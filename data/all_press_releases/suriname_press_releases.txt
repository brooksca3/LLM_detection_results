Title: IOM Caribbean Supports Civil Society Collaboration on Environmental Migration and Disaster Displacement Issues
Content: 06 March 2024
Paramaribo, Suriname, 4 March 2024 – Representatives from 21 civil society organizations (CSOs) working in 9 Caribbean countries gathered in Suriname from 29 February to 1 March to cooperate and strengthen their skills to address challenges related to migration and climate change, which has become an urgent issue in the Caribbean.  The participants, who are engaged in grassroots work and advocacy with and for vulnerable and marginalized groups, exchanged knowledge and experiences, learned from technical presentations, and proposed actions to build resilience in the communities they work with.

Data from 2023 [Source] shows that between 2012 and 2022, disasters in the Caribbean displaced 5.3 million people internally. Events including hurricanes, floods, landslides and volcanic eruptions made Caribbean people leave their usual places of living. These sudden movements have affected people and communities socially, economically and psychologically, making it harder for them to cope and recover. CSOs play an important role in planning for and responding to these disasters, to reduce the negative impacts on communities. The Conference aimed to increase their skills and awareness to participate in discussions on this topic.
Eduard Michel of ADRA Curacao shared: “We learned approaches of other countries [who] also are facing the same challenges, how they are creative, how they are using the [international] standards in a local context, to solve the issues. So it was very interesting for us, for me especially, because I am more equipped to bring all of this knowledge back to our office in Curacao.”
CSO representatives and technical experts presented on topics such as data and knowledge management, governance, disaster preparedness and urbanization, sharing knowledge and experience across sectors and agendas, to help improve the conditions of vulnerable populations with cross-cutting methods. The participants, who are each experts in advocacy for the rights of migrants, people with disabilities, gender, LGBTIQ+, indigenous, and youth rights related to environmental actions, said the conference presented them with different perspectives and was a chance for networking and regional collaboration on climate mobility challenges and solutions.
Terry Ince, CEDAW Committee of Trinidad and Tobago (CCoTT) reflected on the Conference: “These two days also gave me the opportunity to meet with colleagues across the region that's doing similar work so that we can now collaborate in a manner that will aggregate the resources of the diminishing resources that we have. And those resources include people, the knowledge that they have, the experiences they have.”
The event was organized with the support of the Republic of France through the project “Caribbean Component: Implementing Global Policies on Environmental Migration and Disaster Displacement at the Regional Level” implemented by IOM’s Coordination Office for the Caribbean.
Patrice Quesada, Coordinator of IOM Caribbean expressed that “What we hope that we've been able to convey as a message representing the UN system, the international community, is that basically, you are not alone for that process.”  IOM and the UN system, with the support of donors including the French Government, are committed to supporting the essential role of civil society in representation and advocacy, ensuring that no one is left behind. The Global Compact for Migration, expressed in Sustainable Development Goal 10.7 and which guides good migration practices, encourages this inclusive, all-of-society approach to decision making processes, as Caribbean countries work to address the impacts of climate change on human mobility in the region, one of the most exposed in the world to the impacts of climate change and environmental disasters.

Title: Blue Talks Conference Highlights Suriname's Commitment to Sustainable Oceans
Content: 01 March 2024
Paramaribo, February 29, 2024 – Today, the French Residence in Suriname hosted the Blue Talks conference on the issue of ocean and sustainable development. The event, organized by the Embassy of France and the United Nations in Suriname, brought together a diverse group of stakeholders including representatives from the National Assembly, the business community, NGOs, academia and international organizations, all gathered to discuss the pressing issue of ocean governance and protection
Ambassador De Lacoste emphasized the importance of the upcoming United Nations Oceans Conference to be hosted by France in June 2025, where the global community will converge to accelerate action on "conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”, stressing that collective commitments to address marine pollution and illegal fishing are crucial for reaching the 2030 agenda. Additionally, he underscored that engagement with NGOs and the community is essential to ensure that maritime activities align with sustainable practices.
Ms. Kazana emphasized Suriname's unique position with its extensive coastline along the Atlantic Ocean and stated, "By sharing local experiences, aspirations, and concerns, we can enrich the global dialogue and ensure that the upcoming UN Ocean Conference truly reflects the realities faced by communities living alongside the ocean."
The conference featured presentations from a number of experts, including Ms.  Charlene Sanches who presented on behalf of Total Energy, highlighting the company's commitment to responsible energy production and environmental protection in Suriname's offshore projects.
Mr. Michel Amafo, Director of the Maritime Authority of Suriname (MAS) in his presentation underscored MAS's commitment to safety, security, and sustainability in regulating shipping activities within Surinamese waters. He highlighted the integral role of MAS in facilitating various industries, including oil and gas, agriculture, and fisheries, while ensuring environmental protection and efficient transportation.
Dr. Haydi Berrenstein, Manager of the Foundation for Research, Education and Awareness in Ecosystems, Biodiversity, and Aquaculture, highlighted the importance of conserving natural habitats, such as mangroves, for coastal protection and biodiversity conservation.
Mr. Claus Eckelmann, Regional Forestry Officer of FAO, highlighted the importance of the mangrove ecosystem, for not only the protection of Suriname’s low-lying coast, but also to enable sustainable fisheries management. He further explained that the Guyana North Brazil shelf, a critical marine ecosystem that supports significant fish stocks and sustains the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen in Suriname, Guyana, and French Guiana, requires effective stock assessments and the implementation of regulations to prevent overfishing and ensure the viability of marine resources for future generations.
Moreover, FAO emphasizes the importance of effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with regulations and prevent illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing activities.
In parallel with FAO's efforts, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has been leading regional initiatives to combat IUU fishing and protect endangered species such as sea turtles. Ms. Soraya Wijntuin, the Oceans Coordinator of WWF Guianas, highlighted the collaborative efforts undertaken by multiple stakeholders to develop regional action plans and enhance monitoring and enforcement capabilities.
"The decline in sea turtle populations, with over a 90% decline in nesting numbers in some areas, underscores the urgent need for coordinated action across borders," remarked Ms. Wijntuin.
The presentations were closed off by Mr. Desiré Simons from the Green Heritage fund who informed the audience about the EU-funded program of maritime spatial zoning along the coastline of Suriname.
The symposium concluded with a call for continued collaboration and concerted efforts to address the complex challenges facing marine ecosystems in the Guyana region. By implementing innovative solutions, strengthening regulations, and fostering partnerships between stakeholders, the path towards sustainable fisheries management and conservation of marine resources can be charted, ensuring a healthy and prosperous future for coastal communities and ecosystems alike.

The course is a result of the collaboration between UNICEF Suriname and the Interfaculty of Graduate Studies and Research (IGSR) of the Anton De Kom University of the University of Suriname. It highlights the crucial role that social workers play in protecting the rights and well-being of children.
“While passion drives many social workers, it is essential that they receive the recognition, investment, and support they need to function optimally for the most vulnerable in our society,”
Javier Cordoba, Program Manager of UNICEF Suriname.
The 2nd cohort of the Pre-graduate Course in Child Protection delved into various aspects of child rights and protection. The focus was on strengthening their knowledge and skills to effectively intervene in situations of child abuse, neglect, or child labor.

Title: Minister of Education Commits to  'UNICEF Commitment of Action for Foundational Learning'
Content: 24 January 2024
On the International Day of Education UNICEF calls for transformation of the education system for peace and sustainable development.
Paramaribo, 24 January 2024 – On the International Day of Education, under the theme "Learning for Sustainable Peace," UNICEF emphasizes its commitment to support the government of Suriname in providing universal access to quality education for every child.
UNICEF commends the government of Suriname for showing leadership in addressing and committing to solutions and actions in line with the sustainable development agenda 2030 for inclusive quality education.
Despite significant efforts, we must acknowledge the challenges in the education sector in recent years:
In 2021, the education system underwent significant changes due to the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the expansion of primary education to include grades 9 and 10, followed by secondary education extending up to grades 14-16, depending on the type of education. Automatic promotion was also implemented in primary education, posing significant challenges for teachers, parents, and caregivers.
The most significant challenge was the decline in academic performance due to automatic promotion. As a result, children risk not passing the assessment for grade 10 without a change in awareness to maintain good academic performance, regardless of automatic promotion. The impact is particularly felt among children in the interior, where schools have been closed for extended periods due to emergencies such as floods and droughts. The decline in the education system is so significant that more children are now at risk of leaving school.
The shadow of the pandemic has not only affected Suriname but also other countries in the region. UNICEF data shows that four out of five sixth graders cannot read a simple text, and 4.3 million children are not attending school in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Now is the time to turn promises into action. To address the learning crisis in the region, UNICEF and its partners have developed a 'RAPID Framework' of short-term actions to rapidly recover from the decline in education. The 'RAPID' Framework emphasizes the following actions:
This call to action underscores the urgency and importance of a collective effort to transform education, making it inclusive and resilient to the challenges of the 21st century.
UNICEF reaffirms its support to the Government of Suriname, particularly the Ministry of Education, and collaborates with relevant partners and stakeholders on solutions such as catch-up learning programs, innovations, and inclusive educational materials that cater to the educational needs of all types of learners. In 2023, UNICEF supported the Ministry in organizing an Education Congress to develop education policies, currently in the final stages. In the area of Foundational Learning, UNICEF supports, in collaboration with the Saga Foundation, modules for early stimulation and learning for 3-year-old children. This year, priority will also be given to the development of Early Childhood Development (ECD) policy. UNICEF also supports awareness programs on mental health and well-being for children and adolescents in schools.
Today, UNESCO and the Ministry of Education of Chile, along with CAF BANK, the World Bank, ECLAC, and UNICEF, convened a regional education meeting bringing together education ministers from the region at the ECLAC headquarters in Santiago, covering 33 countries with approximately 125 million students supported by 6.9 million teachers. The meeting aims to make progress in defining government policies focused on the recovery and transformation of education as accelerators of the education goals of Agenda 2030. The Minister of Education, His Excellency Minister Henri Ori, joined Education Ministers from Latin America and the Caribbean during the Education Meeting in Santiago this week, focusing on securing new commitments and actions in the area of foundational learning.

Title: Suriname strengthens the application of labour laws through tripartite efforts
Content: 11 January 2024
ILO support includes technical expertise as well as international and comparative insights and information.
As part of Suriname’s process to review the functioning of is labour laws on minimum wage, dismissal, child labour and equality, the country has recently established tripartite commissions. Each is dedicated to one of the laws being evaluated, and members have been consulting ILO instruments related to the matters covered by their commission.

To support the review process, ILO Caribbean Office is collaborating with the tripartite commissions through interventions that provide its technical expertise as well as international and comparative insights and information.

One such intervention was a workshop hosted on 30 November 2023 in Paramaribo for all commissions as an opportunity to broaden their knowledge on the ILO International Labour Standards (ILS) that are relevant to the issues they are addressing. The session also contributed to the successful delivery of Suriname's third Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP), which is being implemented between 2023 and 2026 and is designed to lead to positive changes in the national labour landscape.

“The workshop covered a wide range of issues such as the elements and methods to set minimum wages; how to administer a dismissal process and minimize its impact; what are the worst forms of child labour and how they are addressed in the Caribbean; what is discrimination; and how to address violence and harassment at workplace,” explained ILO Caribbean Specialist for Labour Law and International Labour Standards (ILS), Shingo Miyake who facilitated the comprehensive session.

"The seminar on ILO standards was very timely as three committees set up by Minister Steven Mac Andrew are busy completing their assignments. The seminar has provided new insights into minimum wage, child labour and dismissal which will be included in the three final reports to be presented to the Minister in mid-February 2024," said Glenn Piroe, Chair of the Commissions on Dismissal Act Review, Minimum Wage Act Review and List of Light and Hazardous Work.

The following day, on 1 December 2023, each commission met with the ILO to go through a list of issues of their concerns and discuss technical matters. The ILO experts who attended the meetings included Shingo Miyake as well as colleagues from ILO headquarters who joined virtually from Geneva.

Each ILO team member took turns in accordance with the subjects covered by each commission and shared their insights. The commission members made comments and asked questions. The results of the exchanges were used in the recommendations to be prepared by each commission and submitted to the Minister of Labour.

Title: Participate and contribute to the solution - International Day of the Migrant
Content: 18 December 2023
Paramaribo-18 December 2023 - The message of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the entire Surinamese society is 'Participate and contribute to the solution' '.
Every year, on December 18, the International Day of the Migrant is celebrated. The goal is to honor migrants, stand up for their rights, and encourage the international community to collectively harness the positive power of migration. 
Throughout history, people have always been on the move and will undoubtedly continue to be so in the future.   
On this International Migrant Day, IOM highlights the potential role of migration as a solution to global challenges, drawing on the momentum generated by recent conversations on International Migration and COP28. 
These include adapting to the impacts of climate change and providing improved economic opportunities for communities. "We highlight how our collective actions today can prepare us for the challenges of tomorrow."
IOM in Suriname 
IOM's arrival in Suriname follows the increased focus on migration in the Caribbean. Suriname is one of 175 IOM member states that are both countries of origin, destination and transit for migrants.  
Suriname is also one of the IOM member states that can be categorized as diverse, multicultural and multi-racial "nations of immigrants," societies in which many newcomers from abroad live.   
 
"Because of its relatively small population, less than 600,000 inhabitants, many of whom are no longer in their home countries, Suriname experiences real challenges in dealing with the many demands of migration" explains Jan-Willem Wegdam, IOM's senior representative in the country. 
"These demands arise from migration flows in three categories - from, to and through Suriname. Whether it is the welcoming of new migrants to Suriname, the departure of its own citizens, or the transit of third-country migrants through its territory, it is inevitable that the government and other stakeholders in Suriname need the world's help in all these efforts. IOM wants to help in this regard".
Suriname and migration  
The Surinamese government established an inter-ministerial commission on Oct. 27, 2023. The main task of this commission is to cooperate with international and national partners in the field of migration, with the goal of drafting and monitoring the National Migration Policy Plan for Suriname.
IOM Suriname and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Business and International Cooperation have already undertaken several activities to promote awareness, cooperation and support. This also contributes to the goals of Suriname and the Sustainable Development Goals, with the core idea of leaving no one behind.

Title: Migration: a solution, not a problem
Content: 18 December 2023
It is common knowledge that social, political, economic and environmental challenges in Latin America 
and the Caribbean push people to migrate. However, it is less well known that the potential of migration 
itself can serve to address these same challenges collectively and constructively. Migration should not be 
seen as a problem, nor as a simple movement of people: Migration is a powerful force that can drive the 
development of societies and economies, and Central America, North America and Caribbean is proof of 
it.
Migration is an accelerator of inclusive growth and sustainable development, enriching societies through human, socio-economic and cultural capacities. When it comes to economic growth, data shows that in 
the Latin American and Caribbean region, countries that have received the largest migration flows would increase by 0.10 to 0.25 per cent per year of GDP between 2017 and 2030. A study in 2020 by the International Monetary Fund supports this prediction, showing that every additional 1% of immigration has the potential to boost GDP growth by 2% in destination countries.
Migrant remittances are a lifeline for their families and communities. According to the World Bank, 
remittances considerably exceed official development aid and are at least equal to or more than ODA plus foreign direct investment combined. For Latin America and the Caribbean, remittances have doubled from USD 73 billion in 2016 to USD 145 billion in 2022.
Migrants drive economic development, filling gaps in labor demand, creating new avenues for business and fostering trade connections between their countries of origin, transit and destination. They also enrich host economies by bringing diverse skills, facilitating knowledge sharing and helping to reduce trade costs. The innovative skills that migrants possess and their ability to integrate into local business networks can significantly influence trade dynamics between countries and regions.
The transformative potential of migration stretches beyond the economic sphere. Migrants teach new knowledge and skills to their community, which translates into greater productivity, innovation, and growth. This is crucial when it comes to solutions for large scale issues like climate change.
Although collective action is necessary, individuals can also be agents of change for their communities and societies and can help create opportunities for progress. Many migrants work in key sectors such as agriculture, health, education, and tourism. All these individuals have the power to exert an immediate, positive impact on their host communities as well as their countries of origin.
The extent to which migrants can contribute to development is directly linked to their ability to access services, integrate into society, and stay connected with their communities of origin. This is why we must focus our efforts on creating conditions in which migration is a choice rather than a necessity, takes place along safe and regular channels, and acts as a catalyst for development.
International Migrants Day is celebrated every year on 18 December. Let’s use this date to celebrate migration not just as a journey of people, but as a journey towards a prosperous and interconnected world. Well-managed migration is key to sustainable development, prosperity and progress. This day is an  opportunity to act today, individually and collectively, to build a better tomorrow, using migration as part  of the solution.

Title: Creatively Highlighting the Crucial Role of Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Content: 12 December 2023
On December 11, 2023, the United Nations in Suriname hosted a special commemorative event to mark the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The event gathered high-level government officials, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Business and International Cooperation, Albert Ramdin, members of the diplomatic corps, youth representatives, and human rights advocates.

She emphasized the continuing relevance of the declaration, underscoring its role in underpinning the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.
"In the 75 years since its adoption, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has provided a roadmap to equality and fundamental freedoms, enshrining the rights we are all entitled to as humans," stated Kazana.
The evening featured various local artists and their creative expressions, including a poetic rendition of the Universal Declaration in Sranan Tongo, contrabass, guitar, and piano performances, as well as a sign language story, all of which illustrated the enduring values and principles of the Declaration.
The performances were complemented by powerful messages from individuals such as Paulus Asoiti, Cynthia Pansa, and Shermaine Artist, providing personal perspectives on the transformative impact of human rights in their lives.
The United Nations in Suriname collaborates with local government and civil society partners to build local capacity for human rights protection in Suriname. The event on December 11 was a celebration of our shared commitment to Human Rights and their advancement in Suriname.

Title: Social Groups Gain Insight into Relationship between Migration and Gender Based Violence
Content: 20 November 2023
Paramaribo, 13 November 2023 – Over 20 individuals from various civil society groups in Suriname gained more insight into the ways that migration and displacement can increase vulnerability to gender-based violence. The groups met during a workshop on Gender Based Violence and Migrant Integration held on 27 October 2023.  With this new understanding of the vulnerabilities of people on the move, participants developed slogans for posters observing International Day for Elimination of Violence Against Women on 25 November, and during the ensuing "16 days of Activism against Gender Violence”.

The posters will help to raise public awareness of the harmful social norms and power inequalities that are at the root of gender-based violence in migration contexts.  The campaign will call for action to reduce these inequalities and bring an end to gender-based violence.
During the workshop, participants gained knowledge on the topic of migration and considered how true integration can take place. They had to think and talk with each other from their own experiences and organizations’ perspectives about violence in general, and particularly about violence that vulnerable migrants experience. Migrant integration was considered along the psychological, economic, political, social, linguistic, and navigational dimensions. What emerged clearly from the workshop is that coherent government policy is needed that will define the rights of migrants in all these dimensions and provide protection against violence and access to justice.
Astrid Runs, project officer Joint-Programme SDG of UNFPA, acknowledged that in Suriname international and internal migrations play a big role. “Through our UNFPA joint programs, i.e. the Minimal Initial Service Package (MISP), we also pay attention to internal migration in Suriname, due to climate crisis and/or humanitarian disaster. Within the MISP’s workshop district teams and health care providers get the necessary knowledge and skill set regarding sexual and reproductive health rights and gender-based violence to mitigate harmful practices that migrants can face. The IOM workshop has been informative and interactive for the participants, and it gives us the opportunity to deepen the cooperation with IOM Suriname on a structural level.”
Participants in the workshop recognized that the dimensions and their impacts can be complex.  For instance, linguistic integration of migrants is challenging.  Because language barriers exist, direct communication between locals and migrants can be difficult.  The linguistic and navigational dimensions are also related, as it is also not easy for migrants to navigate official documents and processes in Suriname because of the language barriers. Representative of the Haitian consulate, Jean-Claude Lappe attended the workshop.   He noted that it is important to have a special collaboration with the IOM and other organizations to support integration of the new generation of Haitians that are coming to Suriname.
The awareness workshops on Gender Based Violence and Migrant Integration were organized by Dance Against Violence (DAV) Foundation, in collaboration with International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Suriname and supported by the UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund).

Title: PAHO announces the 2023 Malaria Champions of the Americas
Content: 03 November 2023
Suriname was appointed as the Malaria Champions of the Americas by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on November 3, 2023. Together with the Dominican Republic, Belize, the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, and the Brazilian city of Manaus, Suriname was awarded the title of Malaria Champions of the Americas for their persistent actions towards malaria elimination in the region.
The awards were presented during an event commemorating Malaria Day in the Americas, which takes place on November 6 in North and South America. During the gathering, PAHO and its partners recognized the national and subnational efforts of these countries, as well as the impact that the projects have had in addressing malaria and improving the health of their populations.
"Despite the significant challenges that still exist in eradicating malaria in North and South America, we also have successful experiences like the projects being honored today, which help position us as one of the regions making the most progress in eradicating this disease globally," stated PAHO Director, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa.
The Dominican Republic was recognized for its efforts to interrupt malaria transmission by 2022 in Los Tres Brazos, the main urban focus of the disease in recent years. Belize was distinguished for its ongoing efforts to eradicate malaria, achieving WHO certification as a malaria-free country in 2023. Suriname was awarded for being the first country in the Amazon region to report no malaria cases for a year.
The state of Quintana Roo (Mexico) was also acknowledged for its efforts to interrupt malaria transmission and prevent the reemergence of the disease in a context of high population mobility. The municipality of Manaus (Brazil) was recognized for its intensified surveillance initiatives to interrupt the transmission of P. falciparum.
"These actions are best practices that can inspire other countries, policymakers, and stakeholders to achieve the goal of eradicating malaria throughout the region. We invite everyone to join the efforts against this potentially deadly disease, which disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in areas with limited access to healthcare," added Dr. Barbosa.
The Malaria Champions is a collaboration between PAHO, the United Nations Foundation, the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University, the Center for Communication Programs at Johns Hopkins University, the Florida International University, and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Health.
Since 2009, more than 40 projects throughout the region have received this award.
Malaria is a disease caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is common in tropical areas, and symptoms can range from mild, such as fever and headache, to severe forms with a risk of death.
In order to combat this disease, PAHO has emphasized the importance of countries and their partners prioritizing actions to improve access to diagnosis and treatment, addressing the barriers that affected communities may face, such as rural and mobile populations.
Malaria is one of more than 30 diseases that need to be eradicated as part of PAHO's 2030 Elimination Initiative of Communicable Diseases.

Title: Financing Sustainable Development: the UN and Ministry of Finance of Suriname talk about the future
Content: 02 November 2023
On 23 October 2023 in Paramaribo, the Minister of Finance and Planning Mr. Stanley Raghoebarsing met with the UN Resident Coordinator Joanna Kazana, accompanied by UNDP Deputy Resident Representative for Suriname, Mr. Berdi Berdiyev, UNICEF Head of Office for Suriname, Mr. Javier Córdoba, and Mr. Claus Eckelmann, FAO Suriname Regional Forestry Officer for the Caribbean.
The UN Resident Coordinator briefed the Minister about the key priorities of the Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework (MSDCF) including economic resilience, shared prosperity, gender equality, climate change resilience, natural resource management, and peacebuilding.  She mentioned that in Suriname 13 UN agencies (7 resident) are providing support to implementation of the MSDCF and national priorities.  She spoke about the alignment with SDGs and importance of donor coordination and long-term strategic planning, especially in the context of new opportunities and growth expected in connection with oil industry in the perspective of the next 5-7 years.
The RC congratulated the Minister on successful cooperation with the IMF.  She stressed the importance of Suriname accessing global climate finance instruments and the complexity of achieving a high growth - and low carbon economy.  She stressed the importance of visioning what Suriname will be in 5-7 years from now.  By using the SDG as a framework for long-term planning and development, the country can ensure that people and the environment of Suriname will be benefitting from growth.
Within the forestry sector, FAO's Claus Eckelmann emphasized the importance of considering the human dimension within forest-related policies, underlining the need for sustainable and profit-driven models. The discussions also underscored the importance of investing in community-level infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Notably, the need for financial innovation and strategic investments emerged as key considerations in advancing the country's development trajectory.
Mr. Córdoba of UNICEF underscored the need for close collaboration and financing for the well-being of children, including immunization, mental health, or early childhood development.
Mr. Berdiyev of UNDP offered to continue collaboration on climate finance, effective governance, area-based development, and capacity strengthening initiatives, with a particular attention to sub-national and local level.
The Minister of Finance reflected that it is good for Suriname to have the UN by its side on the verge of historic change and major transformation of the country.  He stressed the necessity of managing the country's limited resources, emphasizing the need for streamlined efforts on donor coordination, and addressing topics such as effective governance, institutional capacity, rule of law, and modernized tax and customs institutions. An important topic for the Minister was the need to prioritize day-to-day life improvements, ranging from renovating schools, enhancing infrastructure, and bolstering security, with a call to empower small and medium-sized enterprises.
The meeting concluded with a strong call for increased collaboration between the Ministry of Finance & Planning and the United Nations, envisioning a transformative path towards Suriname's long-term development goals.

Title: An Urgent Call to Action: Revitalizing the Agenda for Sustainable Development
Content: 16 September 2023
It is the greatest wish of all humanity to achieve sustainable development by the year 2030. Unfortunately, this dream has now found itself in danger.
We must urgently turbocharge the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Latin America and the Caribbean — including the achievement of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — while viewing the agenda as much as a commitment to human rights as it is a development plan.
Established in 2015 by 193 countries, the 2030 Agenda represents our roadmap to ensure a dignified life for all people, promoting an equitable, inclusive, and peaceful society, fostering prosperity, and taking care of our planet. Despite having the knowledge, resources and technology needed to achieve these ideals, we are progressing at a rate too slow to attain them.
As we approach the halfway point for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, an unprecedented effort is required from all governments to revitalize and accelerate the implementation of the SDGs. The SDG Summit in New York, scheduled for September 18th and 19th, offers a crucial opportunity to raise ambition and translate it into concrete action.
We are in a moment of "polycrisis," facing simultaneously interconnected and prolonged crises with serious repercussions for people, society, and the environment. The alarm bells have already been rung with economic instability, the pandemic, conflicts in various regions, growing migratory movements, humanitarian crises, increased poverty, destructive climate events, and accelerated biodiversity loss, among other issues. These crises have negatively impacted the progress of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, where an alarming 27% of the targets have regressed.
We are at a crossroads, but we still have the opportunity to correct course. Countries' commitments must be more ambitious and urgent. At the September SDG Summit, States must present credible and urgently needed plans to rescue the 2030 Agenda. At the national level, it is essential for governments to collaborate with all stakeholders, including the private sector, civil society, academia, and the scientific community, and to implement more integrated and transformative public policies.
To achieve real impact, countries must adjust national budgets and mobilize resources internationally. The global financial architecture must be updated and made more equitable, especially for Latin America and the Caribbean. This includes increasing long-term financing and taking measures to alleviate the debt of countries in the region.
Key measures to be pursued include investment in a just transition, sustainable resource management, energy efficiency, digitalization, and the creation of inclusive and fair job opportunities. These actions are fundamental to achieving the SDGs, and the United Nations advocates for a deep global transformation that addresses current challenges.
At the national level, we identify six priority challenges with significant transformative potential: strengthening social protection systems, ensuring decent work, transforming education, promoting digitalization; facilitating access to clean energy, reforming food systems to improve health and well-being, and effectively addressing climate change; biodiversity loss and pollution.
The United Nations teams, present in the 40 countries and territories of Latin America and the Caribbean, are committed to supporting governments and society at large in making these transformations a reality.
Our common future is at stake, and we have a seven-year deadline to turn things around. The risks of not accomplishing the SDGs are consequential, which is why we need to significantly increase ambition and action. Future generations will judge us by the decisions we make today, and we cannot afford to disappoint them. We must be steadfast in our determination to create a more sustainable and just future.

During the meeting, the UN Annual Report for 2022 was presented and both UN and Government participants reflected on achievements and lessons learned along the way.
During her opening remarks Ms. Joanna Kazana, Resident Coordinator of the UN for Suriname, indicated that 2022 underlined that the UN system was able to mobilize more than 10 million US dollars in resources on a very diverse portfolio. The UN country team was able to attract every available resource that was accessible and for which Suriname was eligible.
Ms. Kazana also recognized the installation of the National SDG Commission and the SDG platform, which represent very important instruments for the cross sectoral coordination between the government institutions, and coordination with and between non-governmental organizations.
Ms. Lilian Menke, Deputy Director Macro Sector Planning of the Planning Bureau, during her remarks underlined that the Country Implementation Plan can only be successfully implemented through joint efforts from all stakeholders. She also showed appreciation to the UN system in Suriname for the longstanding partnership which is based on mutual respect and understanding.
Finally, with the midway point of Agenda 2030 fast approaching, the meeting also took a proactive and forward-looking view at future development activities in the areas of Climate Financing, Gender, Water Resources Management, Education, Agriculture, Health and Migration, ensuring close alignment to Suriname’s National Development Plan.

Title: Defending Press Freedom: The Essential Pillar of Democracy and Human Rights
Content: 03 May 2023
On 17 December 1986, journalist Guillermo Cano Isaza was assassinated in front of the offices of his newspaper, El Espectador, in my home country of Colombia. He was targeted because of the news stories he was pursuing as a journalist.
On World Press Freedom Day every year, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) honours his legacy by awarding the Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize to a person or entity anywhere in the world that has stood up for press freedom — especially in the face of physical danger.
Today, as we observe the 30th anniversary of the proclamation of World Press Freedom Day by the UN General Assembly, I reflect on the story of Guillermo Cano Isaza, which made me aware for the first time in my youth of the risk members of my own family faced doing their jobs as journalists, and the risk I too would face if I decided to follow in their footsteps.
Remaining steadfast in my mission, I would go on to develop a career as a news producer in Colombia where I would meet two brave colleagues who I now pay tribute to on this day: Jaime Garzon, a journalist, comedian, and peace activist who was murdered in 1999 and Orlando Sierra Hernández, a columnist and deputy newspaper editor who was murdered in 2022. Both deaths, according to UNESCO’S Observatory of Killed Journalists, have been linked to the performance of their duties.
These first-hand experiences have shaped my view on press freedom as a fundamental human right which must be defended, protected, and expanded in all contexts. This view is supported by Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:
“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."
When journalists are intimidated and fear for their safety, the fourth estate is weakened, leaving the citizenry that journalists serve without the ability to hold those in power accountable. And such threats to the freedom of journalists and media workers are growing daily. From global health to the climate crisis, corruption, and human rights abuses, they face increased politicisation of their work and attempts to silence them from many sides.
According to UNESCO, 2022 was one of the most dangerous years to be a journalist with 86 journalists and media workers killed around the world  — a year-over-year increase of 50%. Moreover, even against the backdrop of global conflicts in Ukraine and other parts of the world, the deadliest region to be a journalist last year proved to be Latin America and the Caribbean. This is a reflection of the outsize risk journalists in the region face while covering topics such as crime, corruption, gang violence, and the environment. The three countries that saw the most killings of journalists last year according to UNESCO were Mexico (19), Ukraine (10) and Haiti (9).
As Haiti struggles with a multidimensional crisis caused by three consecutive years of economic recession, a political impasse, and unprecedented levels of gang violence, the level of risk incurred by journalists working in the country has increased.
At the United Nations, we are working to support journalists and media workers everywhere. Despite a less lethal work environment in many Caribbean countries, there are still places where the media is not free to report and investigate without fear of retribution. Journalists across the region report incidents of intimidation, harassment, and even physical violence, all of which undermine the fundamental principles of democracy.
To address these challenges, governments in Suriname and the wider Caribbean must continue strengthening measures to protect press freedom and enact laws that provide journalists with legal and whistle-blower protection.
Citizens can also support press freedom by demanding transparency and accountability from their elected officials. By denouncing censorship and supporting independent journalism, citizens can help create a more open and democratic society.
Globally, the wider international community must also participate in advocacy for press freedom in their individual countries as well as collectively, across the world.   This includes holding governments accountable for their actions and ensuring journalists can carry out their work without fear of retribution.
Let us never forget that it is the responsibility of journalists to expose human rights abuses and advocate for the rights of vulnerable populations. Without a free and independent press, these abuses can go unnoticed and unchallenged. As someone who knows what it is like to work in an environment where press freedom is constantly under threat, I pledge my personal support and that of the United Nations Information Centre for the Caribbean Area for the defence of press freedom in the region.

Title: Vaccination Week in the Americas 2023 launched in Suriname
Content: 28 April 2023
Suriname, April 25, 2023 (PAHO/WHO) – The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) officially launched the 21st Vaccination Week in the Americas, an initiative that aims to mobilize concerted action across the region to boost routine and targeted immunization efforts. Taking place from 22 to 29 April, this year’s Vaccination Week in the Americas (VWA) campaign aims to reach more 92 million people with over 144 million doses of different vaccines in 45 countries and territories.
In Suriname, the Vaccination Week in the Americas 2023 campaign was officially launched at the Regional Health Services at Koewarasan, Suriname. The kick-off event was attended by representatives from the Ministry of Health, UNICEF, PAHO/WHO, regional Government authorities, and staff members of RGD and Medical Mission and other health personnel.
During the launch event, the importance of vaccination was emphasized and the role of the Vaccination Week in the Americas campaign in promoting immunization was highlighted by several speakers.

PAHO/WHO Advisor, Health Systems and Services Dr. Rosmond Adams mentioned: "For the past 21 years, this PAHO initiative has been celebrated in the Americas. And today, we are delighted to celebrate this week all our partners and medical personnel in Suriname as well. I hope that Suriname will take advantage of this year’s campaign to maintain the topic of immunization at the forefront of the health and political agenda. PAHO is pleased to offer technical cooperation in support of your efforts. We encourage you to increase vaccination coverage by strengthening all aspects of the immunization program, including human resource capacity and the integration of immunization into the primary healthcare."
Director of Health Dr. Rakesh Gajadhar Sukul expressed his gratitude to the partners of the Ministry of Health Suriname who ensure that vaccines are readily available for the children in Suriname. He also encouraged people not to waste these vaccines and encouraged the population to vaccinate children to protect them from preventable diseases.
The deputy Director of the Regional Health Services (RGD) Nursing Affairs Steven Tel highlighted: "At the moment we have a nationwide coverage of approximately 70%, and with the slogan of this year #getuptodate #eachvaccinecounts VWA aims to bring vaccination coverage back to pre-COVID pandemic levels around the end of 2023. While vaccination is part of the RGD's regular services, in this week we are hereby emphasizing the importance of vaccination."
Following the opening of the Vaccination Week in the Americas 2023 campaign at the RGD Koewarasan, UNICEF organized a mini fair for elementary school children. The fair featured a range of activities, including dancing, arts and crafts, and other interactive games.
The aim of the fair was to engage children in fun and educational activities that promote the importance of vaccination and healthy living. UNICEF representative, Mr. Nicolas Pron mentioned: "UNICEF as always stands ready to support to ensure that every child is protected from vaccine preventable diseases. All partners must double down on the commitment to increase financing and accelerate catchup vaccination to protect children and prevent disease outbreaks."
The fair was a great success, with children enthusiastically participating in the activities and learning more about the importance of vaccination. The arts and crafts station, in particular, was a hit with children creating posters and banners promoting vaccination and health.
The event was also an opportunity to promote the importance of community engagement in promoting vaccination. Overall, the launch event at the RGD Koewarasan marked an important milestone in the 2023 Vaccination Week in the Americas campaign, highlighting the commitment of Suriname and its partners to promoting the importance of vaccination and ensuring that everyone has access to life-saving immunization.

Title: World Immunization Week 2023- Get up to date, each vaccine counts!
Content: 24 April 2023
Many children in Suriname have missed childhood vaccines, risking their lives and health.
Paramaribo, 24 April 2023 – After 2 years of immunization backsliding caused by the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions, we must catch-up! We must restore and strengthen immunization services to reach all children missing out on the life-saving benefits of vaccines, and we must stop outbreaks from accelerating. The theme for this year’s World Immunization Week: “Get up-to-date, each vaccine counts”, is a call to all partners and communities to get back on track and ensure that all children are protected against vaccine preventable diseases, leaving no one behind.
Suriname annually reports vaccination coverages for key childhood vaccinations such as Pentavalent-3, Polio-3, and MMR-1. These vaccinations provide protection against preventable diseases such as: Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis, HepatitisB, Polio, Measles, Mumps and Rubella.  For the year 2022 the reported national coverages were: Pentavalent-3: 94%, Polio-3: 90%, MMR-1: 82%.
While these may seem like good numbers at the national level, large discrepancies still exist at subnational level between districts and communities. Coronie, Saramacca and Sipaliwini reported low vaccination coverages for Pentavalent-3 and Polio-3 ranging from 38% for Saramacca, 49% for Coronie and 73% for Sipaliwini.
Suriname’s national target is to achieve and maintain a 95% vaccination coverage rate to ensure that we are protected from outbreaks; however, data shows that Suriname has not reached this target for the routine childhood vaccinations. The past 3 years have shown less parents bringing children for their routine immunizations. As these children pass the age when vaccines are routinely given, they risk never catching up on their vaccinations. Under-vaccinated children are left more vulnerable to a range of vaccine-preventable diseases.
The low coverage and the devasting decline in vaccination rates do not only affect children, but also communities. Illnesses like diphtheria, measles, and polio, once thought controlled or eradicated in many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, are making a comeback, putting the whole region’s well-being at risk. In Suriname, climate induced risks, such as flooding in the interior, are further exposing more communities to infectious diseases. Failure to protect children against diseases has dire consequences: some children die and many more live with lifelong disabilities.
“Now is the time to protect the health of every child in Suriname. When we do not vaccinate children, we risk their lives and health – as well as societies’ growth and development,” says Nicolas Pron, UNICEF Area Representative for Guyana and Suriname.
While the reasons leading to Suriname’s backslide are not yet fully understood, the decline may be driven by multiple factors; the vaccination program disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, stay-at-home recommendations, and the fear of contracting the virus from health-care facilities led families to put off vaccinating children. Increased vaccine hesitancy also played a role in some populations due to misinformation. Furthermore, public spending on health has been uneven in recent years, reducing investment, leaving populations without access to quality care and vaccine stock-outs.
This setback calls on all stakeholders to intensify joint efforts. In order to vaccinate every child, it is vital to strengthen primary health care including front-line health providers such as the National Immunization Program, the Regional Health Services, and the Medical Mission; and to provide them with the resources and support they need.
Despite the limited national budget, basic health services -including immunization- must remain a priority because they do not only save lives, but also represent a proven strategy for reducing future health care costs and support lasting economic growth.
Currently UNICEF and PAHO are working jointly with the Government of Suriname and partners across the health sector to expand and improve routine immunization services and primary health care services. This is done through evidence generation, identification and prioritisation of marginalised communities, procurement of cold chain equipment, working with communities to address vaccine hesitancy and mobilising technical and financial resources.
On the occasion of the 2023 immunization week, UNICEF calls on the Government and all health partners to catch up on the backfall of children’s routine immunization in Suriname, in order that to ensure every child is protected from vaccine preventable diseases. The government must double-down on their commitment to increase financing for immunization, working closely with stakeholders to unlock available resources, implement and accelerate catch-up vaccination efforts to protect children and to prevent disease outbreaks.
“Vaccines have saved millions of children’s lives and will continue to save lives,” says Pron, “Action, through prioritized investments is critical to build back immunity, stop outbreaks and protect every child, in every community with essential vaccines.”

Title: Message from PAHO Director on World Health Day 2023
Content: 07 April 2023
Washington D.C. 7 April 2023 (PAHO) – Today we are celebrating World Health Day, as we do every year on April 7th, but we are also honoring the World Health Organization on the 75th anniversary of its creation.
This is a great opportunity to highlight the achievements made in recent decades, the major advances in public health that have improved the quality of people's lives, and the lessons learned, while recognizing the challenges that lie ahead.
Health for All has been our top objective throughout all these years. And despite the tremendous progress we have made, inequities persist in the Region of the Americas and have been exacerbated by COVID-19.
The pandemic has significantly impacted people's health and lives, as well as the conditions for development in the countries of the Region. It has exposed and deepened structural challenges faced by health systems, affecting response capacity and deepening inequities.
During the crisis, essential health services were disrupted and those receiving COVID-19 patients were overwhelmed by high demand. Despite the efforts made, maintaining continuity of service remains difficult.
The pandemic also caused shortages and inequities in access to essential medicines and other health technologies. It also significantly increased existing access barriers to health services and generated new ones.
We aspire to develop and achieve resilient health systems that have the capacity to prepare for an emergency and respond effectively, maintain basic functions during a crisis, and reorganize and transform if conditions so require.
As we progress through the pandemic, it has become clear that the Primary Health Care strategy is the key to achieving this, because the fundamental component of a resilient health system is efficient primary care, with the capacity to coordinate health promotion, disease prevention and surveillance, and care for the most prevalent health problems in our communities.
Now more than ever, in the context of the Region of the Americas, "Health for All" is a call to reaffirm our commitment to primary health care in order to build resilient systems, and it is a call to redouble our efforts to achieve this.
On behalf of the Pan American Health Organization, I want to reiterate our commitment to Member States and our support for the achievement of Health for All.

Title: The Joint Programme: “Roadmap to a Sustainable Financial System for Suriname” comes to an end
Content: 05 April 2023
On Tuesday March 28, 2023, the United Nations (UN) Suriname together with the Ministry of Spatial Planning and Environment hosted a Stakeholders & Partners Forum and the final Project Steering Committee meeting ahead of the Joint Programme’s (JP) closing on March 31st, 2023.
The Joint Programme, entitled, “Roadmap to a Sustainable Financial System for Suriname” is co-led by UNDP and UNEP, and supported by UNFPA and FAO and the JP’s closing comes 30 months after its launch.
The project team under this Joint Programme has spent the last two years working to strengthen capacities at national level and nurtured dialogues and solutions involving stakeholders in the public and private sectors, and civil society groups active in the forestry sector and the artisanal, small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sector. Through the JP, the United Nations has been supporting the Ministry of Spatial Planning & Environment on the development of the National Climate Agreement (NCA). This NCA will be accompanied by a roadmap of actions over the short-to-medium terms, to address climate change, build awareness and capacity and increase the flow of capital towards climate solutions. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has been a key partner in the dialogues and will continue to support the Government of Suriname in the completion of the National Climate Agreement following the completion of the Joint Programme.
During the Joint Programme closing event (March 28th 2023)   the UN Resident Coordinator a.i., Mr. Dennis Zulu highlighted the significance of the JP as Suriname faces the effects of Climate Change which he called “a turning point in Suriname’s effort to transition to a Green Economy”. “The proactive approach and strong commitment of all project partners yielded many concrete and encouraging results and I would like to recognize the Ministry of Spatial Planning and Environment for their leadership, as well as the Inter-American Development Bank for their partnership throughout the process” said Mr. Zulu.
With more than 90 % of forest cover, Suriname has the potential to build a vibrant and sustainable forest industry producing climate benefits at the same time. As Mr. Claus Eckelmann, representative of the FAO, explained during his presentation, wood is the most environmentally friendly building material when compared to other materials. Using more wood instead of concrete and steel is beneficial for the climate. Although payments for environmental services, nature tourism and forest by-products (NTFPs) are important income streams from the forest, the wood value chain continues to be the most important revenue earner with the highest potential for upscaling. The highest potential for the forest and wood sector is in adding value to the wood and not just exporting it as round wood, according to Mr. Eckelmann.
Ms. Deirdre Shurland, representative of the UNEP, highlighted during her presentations the importance of awareness raising and capacity strengthening as a short-term strategic task of the JP’s Sustainable Financing Roadmap and the NCA. There is a need to improve the knowledge and understanding of Suriname’s climate and sustainable development commitments amongst all local stakeholders, as ROM reported that during the February 2023 sector dialogues, most participants were unfamiliar with the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), both of which detail Suriname’s climate commitments under the Paris Agreement.
She also highlighted that although this JP is coming to an end the Government of Suriname has shown ownership and leadership for the development of the National Climate agreement, which has set the tone for its continued preparatory work leading up to COP28 in Dubai later in 2023.
Mr. Bryan Drakenstein, representative of UNDP, on behalf of Ms. Margaret Jones-Williams, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, expressed his gratitude to the Ministry of Spatial Planning and Environment for co-leading the JP process and all steering committee members for their diligence and input which has shaped the outcomes of this program.

Title: UN JP LNOB holds information session with Ministry of Regional Development and Sports, and other Programme stakeholders
Content: 03 April 2023
The United Nations Joint Programme Leaving No One Behind (UN JP LNOB) on Tuesday, 7th February, 2023 held an information and mobilization session with the Ministry of Regional Development and Sports and key Programme stakeholders. The session aimed at creating awareness of the UN JP LNOB policy objectives among staff members of the various departments of the Ministry and other national stakeholders. It also aimed at identifying key policy gaps and potential areas for collaboration so as to tap into the available knowledge and resource base among stakeholders to enable the achievement of the UN JP LNOB objectives.

Key sessions in the meeting included welcome remarks by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Regional Development and Sports Mr. Maverick. Boejoekoe; the UN JPLNOB overview which was presented by the UNDP Programme Officer for Social Development and SDG Integration Mr. Ruben Martoredjo, presentations of the various national policies including the Regional Development policy, the policy on the sustainable development of Indigenous peoples, the policy on the sustainable development of Surinamese of Afro descent, the policy on Agricultural Development in the Interior and the policy relating to other tribal peoples. During the information session, representatives of government departments shared their success stories of similar interventions and raised salient issues for the successful implementation of the UN JPLNOB.

Some of the key success stories shared include the UNDP sponsored Cloth mask-making project for Indigenous and Tribal women whose skills were later used to make uniforms for indigenous school children after COVID-19 had been controlled, the introduction of a new highlight rice project among indigenous communities of West Suriname to supplement cassava that was originally grown, among other projects. Session participants therefore called for interventions that can be adapted to alternative use or replicated in other communities to expand their reach and associated benefits beyond the JP LNOB target communities.
The representative of the Medical Mission, Mr. Melvin Uiterloo called for process chains to add value to produce. “We must create full value chains that include processing materials to final products to create more skills and employment at each level”, he said.
Participants also noted some challenges by their departments including insufficient funding to sustain their activities and the lack of coordination between national Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Sustainable Agricultural Production of the Interior.
They also noted a growing gender gap where men are beginning to be left behind with the rise of the status of women. “Proposed interventions should, therefore, promote gender equality so that no one is left behind”, said Mr. Boejoekoe, a session participant and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Regional Development and Sports. Other participants who attended the information session included the UNICEF M&E Officer and JP LNOB focal point Ms. Prya Hirasingh, the team from the Programme Management Unit including the Deputy Programme Manager, Mrs. Simone Sakia, the Programme Monitoring and Evaluation Officer Ms. Simone Boldewijn, the Communications Specialist Ms. Chanique Bipat, the Communications Officer Ms. Tinsia Plein, among others.

Title: UNFPA Suriname is building the resilience of women against climate change
Content: 21 March 2023
On March 20th, 2023, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Ministry of Home Affairs in Suriname organized a symposium on Gender and Climate Change, with the theme "Building Resilience". The goal of this symposium was to sensitize participants about gender and to solidify the support created for the integration of gender sensitive approaches in the National Climate Agreement. The symposium also provided an opportunity to strengthen knowledge about the link and impact of climate in gender equity outcomes and to strengthen the knowledge that climate resilience is rights-focused, gender-sensitive and people-centered, which are core values of UNFPA's approach to climate action.
Climate change is exacerbating the vulnerability of women and girls across the world. Unfortunately, during climate-induced natural disasters, conflicts and public health emergencies, gender and sexual and reproductive health needs are often overlooked, with staggering consequences including increased unintended pregnancies, higher risk of maternal deaths, rise in early marriage and genderbased violence. The effects of climate change are felt first and most acutely by vulnerable and marginalized populations, including women, children, youth, people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly and the urban poor.
The Government of Suriname, in partnership with the UNFPA, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), are implementing the SDG Joint Fund Programme aimed at developing sustainable development financing strategies for priority sectors. The main objectives of the initiative are to ensure more inclusive and gender-responsive actions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to develop a national roadmap for a sustainable financial system to achieve national development and climate change goals.
Gender has been both cross-cutting as well as an independent subject addressed during the course of this joint project. The Bureau of Gender Affairs of the Minister of Home Affairs has been a valued partner during the implementation of the joint project and will continue to play a crucial role by ensuring the monitoring of gender actions which will be registered in an addendum of the Gender Policy Vision Document 2021 - 2035.
During the event Ms. Annette Tjon Sie Fat and Ms. Sharda Ganga gave presentations which were focused on getting the participants familiar with basic concepts like gender and gender equality. They also presented the addendum on the Gender Vision Policy Plan 2021 – 2035. The addendum stresses the core values of UNFPA‘s approach to climate action, which are ensuring that climate resilience is rights-focused, gender sensitive, and people-centered. The addendum also emphasizes the inclusion of gender responsive sustainable finance.
During his remarks the Director of Home Affairs said: "Abundant rainfall, long droughts, storms, hurricanes and other kinds of natural disasters are unstoppable. We can prepare for it, fortify ourselves and resist it. The SDG Joint Project is an initiative in which international and national partners not only work on resilience against the consequences of climate change, but also strongly encourage cooperation at the same time. It is important not to neglect anyone in the collaboration. Involving the most vulnerable groups, including the Indigenous and Tribal peoples, will only enhance the effectiveness of projects."

Title: IOM broadens training of Suriname authorities facing challenges of greater regional migration.
Content: 20 March 2023
Persons fleeing economic and social hardship in Venezuela, Cuba, and Haiti, others arriving in the Americas from Asia, the Middle East and Africa, are among the growing challenges faced by small nations across the Caribbean, including continental states like Suriname.
For that reason, the United Nations’ migration agency—the International Organization for Migration, or IOM—this week is stepping up its activity here by sharing expertise in migration management with local officials and other stakeholders.
For three days IOM specialists conducted a new round of training in IOM’s Essentials of Migration Management course with officials representing nearly a dozen Surinamese ministries and other government agencies.
This is IOM’s second visit to Suriname to offer the course, known to its developers as EMM2.0, which emphasizes a whole-of-government approach and encourages interaction on migration matters across many public concerns including law enforcement, health, child protection, human rights, labor rights and the environment.
EMM2.0 is IOM’s flagship training programme which provides foundational training to government officials and all stakeholders dealing with migration and was offered here at the request of the Government of Suriname in support of its ongoing development of its migration policy.
A total of 25 officials from 11 government ministries received certificates upon the completion of the training. Participating ministries included the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Business and International Cooperation; Ministry of Home Affairs; Ministry of Education, Science and Culture and the Directorate of National Security. Other attendees included the United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office and Interpol, whose representatives contributed to the workshops’ discourse.
IOM National Project Coordinator, Astrid Pavion, who directed the three-day training, explained: “Suriname’s migration challenges include not only management of undocumented arrivals from varied backgrounds but also the challenges of seeing so many of its own citizens leaving for opportunities abroad.”
“The relationship between the Government of Suriname and IOM has become even more productive”, Pavion said, “and it allows IOM to provide additional support to the government in its management of migration.”
Support for this week’s training was implemented by IOM through the Western Hemisphere project, that is funded by the United States Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM).
“The U.S. promotes safe, orderly, and humane migration through bilateral and multilateral diplomacy and targeted capacity-building programs,” said Catherine Griffith, the Chief of the US Embassy’s Political Economic office in Suriname. “We support regular labor migration pathways that promote decent work and access to formal labor markets and ensure migrant worker protections throughout the recruitment and employment process.  We want to see predictability in the process of getting business, residency, and labor documents, which permit migrants to work, study, and contribute to society.”

Title: The new PAHO/WHO Representative visits Medical Mission in Suriname
Content: 14 March 2023
Paramaribo, Suriname, March 14, 2023 (PAHO/WHO) – The site visit by the PAHO/WHO Representative (PWR) Dr. Lilian Reneau-Vernon to the Medical Mission in Paramaribo, Suriname was an important step in strengthening the partnership between the two organizations. The visit provided an opportunity for the PWR to get an overview of the work being done by the Medical Mission and to identify areas for further collaboration. The purpose of the visit was an introduction and orientation meeting for future visits to remote outpatient clinics in Suriname.
During the orientation meeting, the PAHO/WHO Representative was provided with an overview of the Medical Mission's primary healthcare model by Deputy Director of Medical Mission Dr. Maureen Wijngaarde-van Dijk, which includes the training of healthcare assistants from the communities. These assistants engage in health promotion activities, provide treatment for common ailments, and rehabilitation services under the supervision of doctors. The primary healthcare model is an integrated approach that takes into account the social determinants of health and seeks to provide comprehensive and holistic care to the population.
The PAHO/WHO Representative also had the opportunity to learn about the challenges faced by the Medical Mission in providing healthcare services to remote communities. The partnership between PAHO/WHO and Medical Mission Suriname is of great importance, as the latter has been providing quality healthcare to hard-to-reach communities in the interior of Suriname for almost 300 years. The Medical Mission operates 51 clinics in the districts of Brokopondo and Sipaliwini, which cover an area of 130,000 square kilometers and serve approximately 54,000 people, mainly indigenous (Amerindian), tribal (Maroon), and migrant populations (gold miners and forestry workers).
About Medical Mission
Driven by Christian Principles, the Medical Mission Primary Health Care Suriname has been providing quality health care to the hard-to-reach communities in the interior of Suriname for almost 300 years. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health Organization (WHO) has collaborated with the Medical Mission in many ways over the years, ensuring that vulnerable groups, especially in remote areas, have access to quality health care and are not left behind.

Title: PAHO facilitates successful kick-off meeting for Intra Action Review for the COVID-19 pandemic in Suriname 21 Feb 2023
Content: 13 March 2023

Suriname, February 21, 2023 (PAHO) – On behalf of the Surinamese Government and the Pan-American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) will perform an Intra Action Review (IAR) for the COVID-19 pandemic.
The RIVM is a research institute in the Netherlands that operates under the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and its mission is to promote public health and a safe and sustainable living environment through research, monitoring, and policy advice. The RIVM is a WHO Collaboration Center for International Health Regulations.
An Intra Action Review (IAR) is a facilitated discussion to reflect on actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, identify gaps and lessons learned and propose recommendations to strengthen responses to future pandemics. An IAR is important as it provides a chance to evaluate current response measures, learn from the actions taken during the pandemic, identify functional bottlenecks, and improve preparedness and response systems for future outbreaks.
The importance of COVID-19 IAR in Suriname
The COVID pandemic has created challenges worldwide in response capacity, infrastructure, resources, and financing, particularly for small countries like Suriname with economic problems and limited infrastructure, who have adopted a tailored response approach. Because the Surinamese government has the ambition to renew and strengthen the public health care system, it has requested PAHO to implement this COVID-19 IAR to strengthen their public healthcare system, with RIVM supporting the evaluation in Dutch.
“Requesting a COVID-19 IAR denotes the country's seriousness in opening the doors to review the response to COVID-19 pandemic. PAHO has a work plan in International Health Regulations (IHR) and this evaluation helps us to align our internal processes of technical cooperation.”
according to Oscar Mesones Lapouble, Technical Officer, Tropical and Vector-borne Diseases from the PAHO/WHO Suriname office.
The IAR's methodology is based on the WHO's methodology, which focuses on 10 "pillars" (focus areas) relevant in the context of the COVID-19 response. In coordination with the Ministry of Health, a number of these focus areas have been selected for review. This selection was made on the basis of perceived relevance and to limit the burden on local government as much as possible. Together with the Ministry, an inventory has been made of which stakeholders are important to participate in these reviews. These are then invited for interviews and/or focus group sessions to jointly discuss and analyze the issues involved, identify strong and weak elements in order to provide concrete advice to improve the future response to major outbreaks or pandemics.
The identified priority areas of focus are:
The kick-off meeting took place on February 20, 2023, highlighting the importance of the IAR in the context of Suriname and what IAR participants can expect during this review. The interviews are scheduled for the last two weeks of February, and provisional feedback will take place on March 2. At the end of March, the final report is expected to be available.

Title: PAHO presents the findings of the Essential Public Health Functions (EPHF) for Suriname
Content: 13 March 2023
Suriname, March 09, 2023 (PAHO) – The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) hosted a stakeholders’ meeting in Paramaribo, Suriname to present the results of the evaluation of the Essential Public Health Functions (EPHF) for the country. The presentation brought together key stakeholders from the health sector to discuss the findings and to identify areas for improvement. The EPHF framework serves as a guide for countries to ensure that they have the necessary systems in place to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats. By evaluating and strengthening these functions, Suriname can better protect the health of its citizens and improve its overall public health capacity.
The EPHF Framework in Suriname
The PAHO/WHO has a renewed framework for the Essential Public Health Functions (EPHF)  to guide health authorities in strengthening their policies and addressing public health challenges in the region. Suriname participated in the EPHF evaluation and strengthening exercise as part of its commitment to universal health and became the first country in the Caribbean Region to complete this exercise. A multidisciplinary team developed an action plan to strengthen the country's public health infrastructure based on the gaps identified in the EPHF assessment. Addressing these gaps will also support universal access to health and universal health coverage, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the PAHO/WHO Strategy for Building Resilient Health Systems and Post COVID-19 Pandemic Recovery to Sustain and Protect Public Health Gains.
The meeting was opened with a speech by the PAHO/WHO Representative Dr. Lilian Vernon-Reneau who stated that:
“The Assessment in Suriname was done in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health, as the owner along with key actors in the health sector. This is a process facilitated and supported by PAHO, but it is the Ministry’s of Health process to gauge the institutional capacities in performing these essential public health functions. It is not an examination of the system rather it allows us to build on already existing strong areas and to focus our attention to strengthen areas that may require such action.”
Dr. Amar Ramadhin, Minister of Health Suriname in addressing the participants mentioned that;
“Suriname is pleased to be part of the Essential Public Health Functions (EPHF) assessment. Equally, Suriname is very pleased to be the first country in the Caribbean Region to have completed this exercise. The exercise started in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic and was completed in August 2022. I wish to thank everyone who have participated and supported this exercise and I look forward to the discussions on how we can work together to support health system resilience and broader health goals including equity and efficiency.”
Ms. Rachel Jarboe, a representative of PAHO/WHO WDC, provided a brief review of the EPHF evaluation framework and process. The EPHF framework is a tool developed by PAHO/WHO to guide countries in evaluating and strengthening their public health systems. The framework is organized into 11 essential public health functions, which are grouped into three categories: health assessment and surveillance, health promotion, and disease prevention and control.
Following the brief review, Ms. Joanna Baank, PAHO/WHO Consultant for the EPHF Assessment presented the results of the Phase 1 situation analysis and institutional mapping, which aimed to assess the current state of Suriname's public health infrastructure. She also presented phase 2 measurement of institutional capacities, which evaluated the country's capacity to implement the EPHF framework.
The moderator for the day, Dr. Rosmond Adams, Advisor for Health Systems and Services at PAHO/WHO Suriname mentioned: "PAHO is pleased to support Suriname in the assessment of the essential public health functions and the development of the action plan to strengthen these functions. Within out framework of technical cooperation, we will work collaboratively in health system strengthening.”
Dr. Adams also presented the results of Phase 3, which involved a gap analysis to identify areas where Suriname's public health system falls short of meeting the requirements of the EPHF framework. Based on the findings, an Action Plan was developed to address these gaps and improve the country's public health infrastructure.
The Action Plan includes several key initiatives, such as strengthening laboratory capacity, surveillance systems, and disease prevention and control measures. It also aims to enhance communication and coordination among key stakeholders and to improve human resources for public health.
A key takeaway from one of the health stakeholders Dr. Jerry Tulsi from the Medical Science Institute (Faculty of Medical Sciences) stated that:
“We were already aware that there are gaps in our health care system, but now these gaps have now been identified and well documented, and based on this documentation we can make improvements to our health care systems.”
Dr. Marc Sprenger, Director of the National Recovery Plan at the Ministry of Health, provided an update on the ongoing reform process of Suriname's health sector and how this reform will support the essential public health functions. The health sector reform aims to improve the quality, accessibility, and efficiency of health services in Suriname. It is aligned with the country's National Health Policy and Strategic Plan and is based on a human rights approach to health.

Title: Protecting Caribbean women in digital spaces
Content: 08 March 2023
The rights of women in the Caribbean need to be protected,  both in physical and virtual spaces. The prevalence of cyberviolence in terms of its root causes and impacts is gender-based, with a disproportionate impact on women. Similar types of violence against women and girls often occur in both offline and online spheres or originate in one sphere and are carried through into the other. In the most serious cases, cyberviolence can lead to physical assaults and even suicide.[1]

One of the objectives of International Women’s Day (IWD - March 8) this year is to spotlight the importance of protecting the rights of women and girls in digital spaces and addressing online and technology-facilitated  gender-based violence. The theme for IWD is, “DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality”. This theme is aligned with the priority theme for the upcoming 67th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW-67), “Innovation and technological change, and education in the digital age for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls”.
In 2018, the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, its causes and consequences defined online violence against women to encompass any act of gender-based violence against women that is committed, assisted or aggravated in part or fully by the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), such as mobile phones and smartphones, the Internet, social media platforms or email, against a woman because she is a woman, or affects women disproportionately.[2]
Women worldwide and in the Caribbean are increasingly falling victim to cyber-attacks, particularly via online shopping and other social media activities. There have also been several instances of stalking and trafficking resulting from cyber activities. Additionally, the rapidly growing access and use of ICT, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has had multiple impacts on gender equality and women’s rights, including the further exacerbation of existing forms of violence against women (VAW), especially sexual harassment, and the emergence of new forms of VAW, such as non-consensual image sharing and harassment of women in virtual spaces. It is important to take the necessary actions, both big and small, to address this issue. It is imperative that measures are implemented to prevent, address and criminalize these acts, whether big or small, to  ensure that there are consequences for perpetrators. We must also ensure that adequate and useful help is available for survivors.
While digital spaces are a challenge for the safety of women and girls, they can also be leveraged as powerful tools to protect and promote their rights. Here in the Caribbean, the United Nations - including the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) - has taken several measures, using ICT, to protect our women. For example - in the framework of the EU funded Spotlight Initiative - in Jamaica the App HOPE (a mobile app) was launched  in 2021 in collaboration with the civil society organization Eve For Life. The App HOPE can help you understand if you or someone you know is affected by gender-based violence (GBV). The App does this through questions that you can answer. It also sensitizes on the rights to a life free from violence in a  “know your rights” section; through the analysis of scenarios, it also helps address common myths related to GBV. Finally, but not less important, the App Hope provides hints on  the actions that you can take to be safe and the contact information of support services available, including in cases of emergencies.
The digital space also has the potential to promote Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) and raise awareness on human rights. In 2022,   the Caribbean Observatory on Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Observatory was launched. The SRH Observatory is an advocacy platform that permits monitoring and tracking progress towards the advancement of integrated SRHR and GBV in the region while lobbying for improved programming as well as policy and legislative reforms.
While there are several initiatives that can help to address technology-facilitated Gender-based Violence and promote the rights to a life free from violence, we recognize that the work needs to continue and much more needs to be done, including by promoting the further development, use and dissemination of safe technology for GBV prevention and response.
In addition to highlighting the need to protect women in digital spaces, the United Nations’ Observance of IWD this year also serves to recognize and celebrate the women and girls who are championing the advancement of transformative technology and digital education, further promoting gender equality. There is a plethora of women in the Caribbean who deserve recognition for their work to advance transformative technology and digital education in our region who we should be celebrating and elevating. Today, let’s highlight two of the women in tech who have been making strides in the Caribbean and that can inspire more women to participate in the digital space while promoting safe spaces. Evie Kanhai-Gurchuran, from Guyana, for example is the founder of  a coworking space that fosters a tech and entrepreneurial community. She works tirelessly to close the opportunity gaps for Caribbean entrepreneurs in a digital space and to close the gender gap for women and girls in computing. Another stellar woman in tech is Jamaican Melissa James, an award-winning diversity expert who has been dedicated to increasing diversity in the technology industry.
This 8th of March, Join us in celebrating women in tech, but let’s also engage all year long in helping to protect our women in ICT spaces!
UNFPA, as the UN agency responsible for sexual and reproductive health, remains dedicated to supporting governments and other stakeholders to protect the rights of women from various forms of violence, while  aiming at achieving  three transformative results:  zero maternal deaths, zero unmet need for family planning and zero GBV and harmful practices. UNFPA is committed to helping  the Caribbean through deliberate, strategic and collaborative actions that will lead to a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL - OPED FOR INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY
Content: 08 March 2023
The latest forecasts estimate that on our current track, it will take another 300 years to reach full gender equality.
Today’s cascading crises, from the war in Ukraine to the climate emergency, affect women and girls first and worst. And as part of the global pushback against democracy, women’s rights over their bodies and autonomy over their lives are being questioned and denied.
Two statistics make our failure very clear:
Every ten minutes, one woman or girl is murdered by a family member or intimate partner.
And one woman dies every two minutes during pregnancy or childbirth. Most of those deaths are entirely preventable.
On International Women’s Day, we must commit to doing better. We need to reverse these horrific trends and stand up for the lives and rights of women and girls, everywhere.
This is one of my core priorities and a central plank of the work of the United Nations around the world.
From South Sudan to Myanmar, we are supporting women and girls in crisis and making sure their voices are heard in peace processes.
The Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, recently visited Afghanistan with a message for the authorities: women and girls have fundamental human rights, and we will never give up fighting for them.
This year, International Women’s Day focuses on closing gender gaps in science, technology, and innovation. Globally, men are 21 percent more likely to be online than women — and over 50 percent more likely in low-income countries.
But even the richest countries lose out because of gender-based stereotypes and historic bias. In the tech industry, men outnumber women two to one.  In Artificial Intelligence, it’s five to one.
Big data is the new gold, and the foundation of today’s political and business decisions. But it often ignores gender differences – or turns a blind eye to women altogether.
We should all be alarmed by products and services that bake in gender inequality right from the start, and digitize patriarchy and misogyny.
The Silicon Valleys of this world must not become Death Valleys for women’s rights.
Medical decisions based on data from men’s bodies can not only harm women; it can be deadly.
Discrimination against women in science and technology is the result of centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and damaging stereotypes. Women account for just three percent of Nobel Prize winners in scientific categories since 1901. And women online – including scientists and journalists – are often targeted for sexist hate speech and abuse designed to silence and shame them.
But they will not be silenced. Women and girls everywhere are demanding their rights, and their words reverberate around the world.
We need action on several fronts to make sure women and girls can make their full contribution to the world’s knowledge through science and technology.
We must break down barriers — from discriminatory data to stereotypes that push girls away from studying scientific subjects at an early age.
Decisionmakers of all kinds must broaden women’s participation and leadership in science and technology, through quotas if necessary.
They should be creative, widening the recruitment pipeline and hiring for skills. And they must be persistent. Gender equality will not happen by itself; it has to be prioritized and pursued. This approach is getting results at the United Nations, where we have our own strategy for gender parity among our personnel.
We also need action to create a safe digital environment for women and to hold accountable both the perpetrators of online abuse, and the digital platforms that enable them.
The United Nations is working with governments, civil society, the private sector and others on a Code of Conduct aimed at reducing harm and increasing accountability on digital platforms, while defending freedom of expression.
Women’s rights are not a luxury that can wait until we solve the climate crisis, end poverty and create a better world.
Investing in women and girls is the surest way to uplift all people, communities and countries, and to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Together, let’s work for a more inclusive, just, and prosperous world for women and girls, men and boys, everywhere.

Title: United Nations presents the SDGs during CANTO 39th Annual General Meeting in Suriname
Content: 03 March 2023
On February 7th, the United Nations participated in the CANTO 39th Annual General Meeting which was co-hosted by Telesur in Paramaribo Suriname.
The UN fundamentally believes that ICT is a catalytic driver to enable achieve for the SDGs. While ICT forms the backbone of today’s digital economy, it also has enormous potential to fast forward progress on the Goals and improve people’s lives in fundamental ways. ICT is specifically mentioned in four SDG Targets in Agenda 2030 and it can be linked to Education (SDG 4), Gender Equality (SDG 5) and Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure (SDG 9), among others.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted just how quickly digital connectivity is fast becoming the global metric of inclusion, with more than 2 billion people being left offline during the pandemic. The digital divide, which is the lack of affordable internet and appropriate digital skills, prevented many people, from working or studying from home during the crisis, and one in three children missed out on remote learning when schools were shut down. Through SDG 9, the UN works to ensure that broadband networks and connectivity are understood as an essential infrastructure for development.
During the CANTO Annual General Meeting held in Paramaribo, the UN highlighted the vast opportunities for ICT to play a role in the advancement of the SDGs in Suriname.  From digital financial services as a tool to help people out of poverty, to the crucial role satellite monitoring plays in climate action, to the importance of early warning systems in extreme weather events, ICT plays a significant role in sustainable development.

Title: Suriname signs Decent Work Country Programme III
Content: 15 February 2023
On Friday 10 February 2023, Suriname officially signed its third DWCP. DWCPs are the main vehicle for delivery of ILO support to countries and have two main objectives: to promote decent work and its normative framework as a key component of national development strategies; to organize ILO’s knowledge, instruments, advocacy and cooperation at the service of tripartite constituents in a results-based framework to advance the decent work agenda.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) and tripartite partners in Suriname signalled the continuation of efforts to advance social justice and promote decent and productive work opportunities for women and men with the signing of a new four-year Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP). On Friday 10 February 2023, Suriname officially signed its third DWCP. DWCPs are the main vehicle for delivery of ILO support to countries and have two main objectives: to promote decent work and its normative framework as a key component of national development strategies; to organize ILO’s knowledge, instruments, advocacy and cooperation at the service of tripartite constituents in a results-based framework to advance the decent work agenda.
This DWCP will focus on several key areas including jobs, productivity and sustainable growth, livelihoods, human capital, and a skilled workforce as well as labour market governance and labour rights. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its commitment to the human rights agenda and the core programming principle to leave no one behind, is central to this third Suriname DWCP. The priorities of the DWCP are based on Suriname’s national development priorities, as articulated in the Multi-Annual Development Plan of the Republic of Suriname (NDP), 2022-2026, which in turn aligns with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Delivering the feature address at the launch, the Honourable Steven Mac Andrew, Minister of Labour, Employment Opportunity and Youth Affairs, noted that the DWCP is “broader than sustainable development goal number 8” and “shows that (we) have paid attention to issues that confront the whole world, for example climate change and the necessity to create green jobs”.

Mr. Lars Johansen, Deputy Director ILO Decent Work Team and Office for the Caribbean highlighted that the signing underscored the country’s commitment to mainstreaming decent work in social and economic policies. “In the case of Suriname, since this is the third Decent Work Country Programme developed, each building on the one that went before it.” He emphasized and thanked the Government and social partners for their “continued belief in and commitment to the DWCP as the best way of collaborating with the ILO and other Development partners.”

The DWCP focuses on three priorities:
This DWCP was developed through the close cooperation of the ILO’s Decent Work Team (DWT) for the Caribbean and a cross-section of national stakeholders led by Suriname’s tripartite constituents. In addition to bilateral consultations, stakeholder workshops and visits to Brokopondo and Redi Doti were held in September and November 2022.

Title: Celebrating 120 years of solidarity in advancing health and well-being, leaving no one behind
Content: 16 December 2022

On December 2nd, 2022, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) marked its Anniversary as the world’s oldest international public health agency, celebrating 12 decades of work promoting health and wellbeing throughout the region of the Americas.
On this day in 1902, 11 countries came together at the First General International Sanitary Convention of the American Republics and founded the International Sanitary Bureau. Their aim was to address the spread of yellow fever across borders during a time of rapid maritime transport expansion.
Since then, PAHO has worked tirelessly to combat disease, prolong life and to promote the physical and mental health of all people in the Americas, leaving no one behind.
“As our region begins to emerge from almost three years of COVID-19 pandemic, one which has laid bare some of our most striking health inequalities, never before I have been more convinced that the creation of PAHO 120 years ago was an act of incredible foresight,” PAHO Director, Carissa F. Etienne said.
“Today, the organization continues to work with countries under the guiding principle that health is not a privilege but a fundamental human right,” she added.
Throughout the past 120 years, PAHO has led the Americas in becoming the first region in the world to eliminate smallpox and poliomyelitis, and to eliminate the transmission of rubella and neonatal tetanus.
The organization has also played a key role in achieving a 30-year increase in average life expectancy in the region, as well as a significant reduction in child mortality and an expansion of health coverage among poor and vulnerable populations.
Over the past three years, PAHO has worked on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response in the region, supporting countries, equipping laboratories and providing tests. Through its Revolving Fund, PAHO procured and delivered over 151 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 30 countries of the Americas.
PAHO is the specialized health agency of the Inter-American System and also serves as Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization (WHO). PAHO has 35 Member States and four Associate Members in the region. Under their leadership, PAHO sets regional health priorities and mobilizes action to address health problems throughout the Americas.

Title: Suriname concludes successful DWCP III validation workshop
Content: 16 December 2022
A Tripartite Validation Workshop for Suriname's third Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP III) was held in Paramaribo on 10 November 2022. The workshop co-organized by the ILO and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Youth Affairs, gave social partners the opportunity to discuss and validate the priority areas of intervention, short and medium-term strategic outcomes and the operationalizing of the implementation plan for the DWCP III.
The DWCP defines how constituents, with the support of the ILO and other key social partners, work together towards the attainment of decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security, and human dignity. The DWCP identifies three areas of priority and sets out associated outcomes are expected to be achieved over a specified period of time.

The priorities identified in the DWCP III (draft) are:
1. Jobs, productivity, and sustainable growth;
2. Livelihoods, human capital, and a skilled workforce;
3. Labour market governance and labour rights.

The DWCP III is being designed to integrate and find synergies with the Multi-Country Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (MSDCF) 2022-2026, and the accompanying Country Implementation Plan for Suriname, which guides the activities and priorities of the wider UN system across the Caribbean region.

The official signing of the DWCP III is scheduled to take place in January 2023. The implementation phase is set to commence 01 February 2023 and run for a period of 3 years (2023-2026).

Title: Welcome to an 8-billion-strong world
Content: 15 November 2022
The world’s population will reach 8 billion in the middle of November – a testament to scientific breakthroughs and improvements in nutrition, public health and sanitation. But as our human family grows larger, it is also growing more divided.
Billions of people are struggling; hundreds of millions are facing hunger and even famine. Record numbers are on the move seeking opportunities and relief from debt and hardship, wars and climate disasters.
Unless we bridge the yawning chasm between the global haves and have-nots, we are setting ourselves up for an 8-billion-strong world filled with tensions and mistrust, crisis and conflict.
The facts speak for themselves. A handful of billionaires control as much wealth as the poorest half of the world. The top one percent globally pocket one fifth of the world’s income, while people in the richest countries can expect to live up to 30 years longer than those in the poorest. As the world has grown richer and healthier in recent decades, these inequalities have grown too.
On top of these long-term trends, the accelerating climate crisis and the unequal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic are turbocharging inequalities. We are heading straight for climate catastrophe, while emissions and temperatures continue to rise. Floods, storms and droughts are devastating countries that contributed almost nothing to global heating.
The war in Ukraine is adding to ongoing food, energy and finance crises, hitting developing economies hardest. These inequalities take their greatest toll on women and girls, and on marginalized groups that already suffer discrimination.
Many countries in the Global South face huge debts, increasing poverty and hunger, and the growing impacts of the climate crisis. They have little chance of investing in a sustainable recovery from the pandemic, the transition to renewable energy, or education and training for the digital age.
Anger and resentment against developed countries are reaching breaking points.
Toxic divisions and lack of trust are causing delays and deadlock on a host of issues, from nuclear disarmament to terrorism to global health. We must curb these damaging trends, repair relationships and find joint solutions to our common challenges.
The first step is acknowledging that this runaway inequality is a choice, and one that developed countries have the responsibility to reverse – starting this month at the UN climate conference in Egypt and the G20 summit in Bali.
I hope COP27 will see a historic Climate Solidarity Pact under which developed and emerging economies unite around a common strategy and combine their capacities and resources for the benefit of humankind. Wealthier countries must provide key emerging economies with financial and technical support to transition away from fossil fuels. That is our only hope of meeting our climate goals.
I also urge leaders at COP27 to agree on a roadmap and institutional framework to compensate countries in the Global South for climate-related loss and damage that is already causing enormous suffering.
The G20 summit in Bali will be an opportunity to address the plight of developing countries. I have urged G20 economies to adopt a stimulus package that will provide governments of the Global South with investments and liquidity, and address debt relief and restructuring.
As we push for action on these medium-term measures, we are working non-stop with all stakeholders to ease the global food crisis.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative is an essential part of those efforts. It has helped to stabilize markets and bring food prices down. Every fraction of a percent has the potential to ease hunger and save lives.
We are also working to ensure Russian fertilizers can flow into global markets, which have been severely disrupted by the war. Fertilizer prices are up to three times higher than before the pandemic. Rice, the most widely consumed staple in the world, is the crop that will suffer most.
Removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian fertilizers is an essential step towards global food security.
But among all these serious challenges, there is some good news.
Our eight-billion-strong world could yield enormous opportunities for some of the poorest countries, where population growth is highest.
Relatively small investments in healthcare, education, gender equality and sustainable economic development could create a virtuous circle of development and growth, transforming economies and lives.
Within a few decades, today’s poorest countries could become engines of sustainable, green growth and prosperity across entire regions.
I never bet against human ingenuity, and I have enormous faith in human solidarity. In these difficult times, we would do well to remember the words of one of humanity’s wisest observers, Mahatma Gandhi: “The world has enough for everyone's need – but not everyone's greed.”
This month’s big global meetups must be an opportunity to start bridging divides and restoring trust, based on the equal rights and freedoms of every single member of humanity’s eight-billion-strong family.

Title: Government Launches Kick-Off event to Develop National Climate Agreement
Content: 25 October 2022
In the presence of His Excellency president Chandrikapersad Santokhi, the Ministry of Spatial Planning and Environment launched the Kick-Off event for the upcoming High-Level Meeting on Climate Financing.  The Kick-Off event was held at Ballroom Torarica on October 21, 2022 and was attended by UN Resident Coordinator, Dennis Zulu (virtual), Minister of Labour Steven Mac Andrew. The event also included members of the private sector (Central Bank, Surinaamsche Bank, VSB), Indigenous and Tribal organizations (VIDS, Stichting KAMPOS), non-profit organizations (WWF, Projekta) as well as members from Academia.
This event was held to kick off the development process of the National Climate Agreement which is intended to serve as a roadmap to address climate change issues and for accessing different options of climate finance available for Suriname. During the Kick-Off event, both United Nations and the Inter-American Development Bank, co-organizers of the event, presented ongoing support being provided to the Government of Suriname in the areas of climate and environment.
The United Nations system in Suriname, under leadership of the Resident Coordinator, is also supporting the Government of Suriname through the implementation of a Joint SDG Fund programme whereby the objective is to help the country achieve Agenda 2030 (including Paris Agreement climate goals), to address development funding challenges (which hinder the country’s progress) while also delivering inclusive, gender-based outcomes. In tandem, the IDB continues to support the Government of Suriname in the development of an NDC Investment Plan. This raises the country’s climate ambition by including two new sectors (agriculture, transport, and urban Infrastructure) and by increasing the climate goals of the forestry and energy sectors. IDB’s support also incorporates climate change criteria in budgeting and public investment decision-making, in collaboration with the Ministry of Spatial Planning and the Environment.
The High-Level Meeting for Climate Financing is planned for the first quarter of 2023 at which the government-led National Climate Agreement will be elaborated and presented. Today’s Kick-Off event was utilized to raise awareness, and to ensure broad-based, cross-sectoral inputs into the National Climate Agreement. The government has also updated its Nationally Determined Contribution, and with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank, is developing an Investment Plan for the updated Nationally Determined Contribution.
During his opening remarks the UN Resident Coordinator, Dennis Zulu, stated: “We have a very narrow window of opportunity to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Urgent and ambitious action is needed now. As we have seen with the recent unprecedented flooding, adaption is crucial for Suriname.” He further emphasized that "a National Climate Agreement can not only ensure a sustainable pathway towards Climate Financing, but also gives Suriname a multi-sectoral plan for addressing Climate Change.”
Minister Tjong-Ahin shared that the government of Suriname is committed to take the lead in climate actions by stating
“Our government is committed to curb the situation and take a lead role in climate action and in association climate finance.”

President Santokhi during his remarks made it clear that climate change adaptation will require many changes, but that the national development must not be undermined in the process. He underscored the importance of ensuring that the National Climate Agreement is an inclusive process by stating that “we need to join hands to formulate a good strategy, plan and execute. All stake holders, the private sector, indigenous people, commercial banks, NGO’s are invited and have to assume their responsibility to get things going.”
Ms. Margret Jones Williams, Deputy Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme, stated that the development of the National Climate Agreement is urgent, and that the development has been prioritized by the government who has shown a very high level of political will. Ms. Williams also highlighted the need for continued consultation with all stakeholders as this event yet again showed that all stakeholders, especially those representing the Indigenous and Tribal peoples, want and deserve the opportunity to provide their input in the development of the National Climate Agreement.
Minister Tjong-Ahin with his final remarks thanked the United Nations Agencies and all other organizations for the support in organizing this event. He also reaffirmed not only the importance of the National Climate Agreement but also the importance of ensuring that the development process is an inclusive process. “This process is about all of us having consensus about what we want to do against climate change before we move forward,” he said.

Title: Launch ceremony of the project “Sustainable Pineapple Value Chain Development” in Suriname
Content: 29 September 2022
Under the patronage of His Excellency Chandrikapersad Santokhi, president of Suriname, and in the presence of the UN Resident Coordinator Ad Interim, Dr. Dennis Zulu, representatives from the United Nations and government officials from Suriname, today launched a significant UN Joint SDG Fund project to upgrade the pineapple sector through a programme that will benefit indigenous and other rural communities. The four-year project will be implemented by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).


The joint programme, “Sustainable Pineapple Value Chain Development”, part of the “The Agrifood Systems Transformation Accelerator” (ASTA) co-led by FAO and UNIDO, was developed in close collaboration with the various stakeholders in the pineapple value chain in Suriname. The joint programme will see the four UN agencies, in partnership with development banks and local financial institutions, implement several solutions including an innovation hub to provide cutting edge technical assistance and an innovative guarantee facility to ease access to credit and de-risk investments.
In his opening remarks, UN Resident Coordinator, Dr. Dennis Zulu said: “At the United Nations, we are committed to supporting, to accompanying, and to pioneering new ways of facilitating linkages between value chain actors and service providers, strengthening and institutionalizing knowledge in local institutions, and contributing to a conducive policy environment. But we need to do it together and we certainly cannot do it without each other.”
Ms. Lisa Kurbiel, head of the Joint SDG Fund, congratulated Suriname on being successfully selected amongst 10 programmes from 155 proposals received by the Fund after going through a very competitive process.  She emphasized “this joint programme offers a unique opportunity to channel SDG-compliant investments into the pineapple value-chain through an innovative collateral facility to ease access to credit and de-risk investments accompanied by cutting edge technical assistance. We also see this joint programme as a model with potential to be scaled to other value chains both in the country and in the region.”
His Excellency Albert R. Ramdin, Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Business and International Cooperation, stressed on the importance of this financial and technical assistance that targets the sustainable development of a value chain that is deeply anchored in the culture of the Indigenous Peoples and other communities. “The success of this program will give our Country access to foreign investment to strengthen the livelihoods of local farmers and Suriname's capacity to export.”
His Excellency Chandrikapersad Santokhi, president of Suriname, expressed satisfaction at the launch ceremony of this project and praised the SDG Fund that is in the best position to bridge a gap though a sustainable investment model that leverages the power of markets to empower communities, and support a clear path for farmers to build a rewarding, modern pineapple value chain in Suriname. The president highlighted: "Suriname's pineapple sector is challenged by a lack of modern production, post-harvest handling, and an integrated supply chain. To solve these problems, consideration of all stakeholders is needed. And we are delighted, to count on the UN, as one of our trusted stakeholders.[...] a key component to succeed in this project, is the cooperation of all parties, – if we want to go fast, we will go alone, but if we want to go far, we need to go together.”

Title: “Protecting Indigenous knowledge systems and cultural expressions as effective levers for sustainable development in Suriname”
Content: 09 August 2022
UNESCO Opinion Editorial on the occasion of the International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples 2022.
The theme of this year’s International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples is “The Role of Indigenous Women in the Preservation and Transmission of Traditional Knowledge”. It highlights the vital role that Indigenous women play in their communities as knowledge holders on cultural norms and traditions, community histories, medical services and agriculture systems, while being agents of conflict prevention and resolution through community order and indigenous justice. The International Day also commemorates this year the milestone of the 15th anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2007.
Indigenous women also are the educators among many of their peoples, transmitting resource and territory sustainable management knowledge, cultural heritage, and their languages. Language is a key element when implementing literacy programs or designing an educational curriculum. We need to understand and expand our education system to include more Indigenous knowledge that cares for the planet.
We also need to invest more in education in Indigenous communities by developing appropriate curricula and inclusive teaching methodologies that meet their specific needs. Indeed, there is a general lack of disaggregated data, admittedly indigenous peoples, especially women, suffer the highest illiteracy rate1 in the population. This has dramatic consequences since it leads to a lack of opportunities in the labour market, limited personal development possibilities, and high levels of rural-urban shift, where they face low wages and discrimination.
In most cases, indigenous women are the primary conduit through which the younger generation learns and perpetuates Indigenous languages. Despite accounting for only 6.2 percent of the world’s population, indigenous peoples are the custodians of 4,000 languages. These languages are part of our common human heritage, which we must preserve and cherish. This is why UNESCO, as the lead agency of the United Nations International Decade of Indigenous Languages, which runs from 2022 to 2032, is working to address the critical status of many indigenous languages around the world, and encourage their preservation, revitalization, transmission and promotion among youth.
The link between indigenous knowledge systems, natural sciences and social sciences and policy-making is a key priority for UNESCO in Suriname, Guyana, Belize and the indigenous peoples' landscape of the Caribbean.
For example, the UNESCO project "Strengthening the Capacities of Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten and Suriname to Implement the 2003 Convention for the
Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage" deepened dialogue on the relevance and importance of documenting and protecting the intangible heritage of these territories through youth and community-based approaches. The project highlighted the importance of recognizing and identifying living heritage through community-based inventories and developing strategies to pass it on sustainably with the authoritative and full participation of local communities. Strengthening international South-South cooperation through the development and implementation of joint agreements and strategies (Willemstad Declaration) was also one of the main outcomes of the project. Finally, Suriname ratified the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage during the project.
Just last month, UNESCO visited Suriname's World Heritage Sites to advise national and local stakeholders on the development of a national strategy for sustainable tourism. On this occasion, UNESCO participated in a traditional meeting, called the Krutu, of the Kwinti tribe -- one of the six indigenous and Maroon communities in Suriname to address the challenges of the Central Suriname Nature Reserve and on ways to develop sustainable tourism strategies and sustainability practices.
UNESCO is also developing a trialogue series to mobilize all relevant stakeholders and expand the Indigenous Knowledge-Environmental Sciences-Policy Making interface in the Caribbean. Indeed, we believe it is one of the drivers for leveraging the value of indigenous knowledge in addressing environmental and societal issues, and in complementing the traditional scientific knowledge system. In Suriname, Guyana and Belize, biodiversity and the related ecosystem services are important catalyzers for climate adaptation and regulation, land and forest preservation, provisioning of freshwater resources and disaster risk resilience. Indigenous knowledge systems can help in transitioning towards community-based sustainable green and blue economies in these countries.
Indigenous peoples’ issues are an integral part of global concerns. Therefore, we must rally as one humanity for the full participation and enjoyment of Indigenous peoples’ rights, their knowledge systems, languages and cultural riches, through innovative and creative exchanges, in the global endeavor to find sustainable pathways for the living world, for society and for humanity as a whole.

Title: Suriname geeft "hoop en inspiratie aan de wereld om onze regenwouden te redden": VN-chef
Content: 12 July 2022
Suriname is misschien het kleinste en dunst bevolkte land in Zuid-Amerika, maar het is ook één van de groenste. Suriname wordt beschouwd als een wereldleider in het behoud van biodiversiteit, met meer dan 90% van het landoppervlak bedekt met oerwoud, de ongeëvenaarde natuurlijke hulpbronnen van het land compenseren voor haar relatief klein oppervlak.
Suriname is geclassificeerd als een koolstof negatief land, omdat haar regenwouden meer emissies absorberen dan het land uitstoot. Dik groen gebladerte lijkt zowat overal te zijn, zelfs in de buitenwijken van de hoofdstad Paramaribo, die zelf bezaaid is met bruisende markten en culturele centra.
Op Zaterdag 3 juli zag VN-secretaris-generaal António Guterres, tijdens zijn eerste bezoek ooit aan Suriname, met eigen ogen de inzet van het Surinaamse volk om hun natuurlijke schatten en voorouderlijke kennis te beschermen.
"Regenwouden zijn een kostbaar geschenk voor de mensheid. Daarom wil ik vanaf hier in Suriname een boodschap sturen naar de wereld: We moeten het geschenk van de regenwouden eren en behouden, want dit is geen geschenk dat blijft geven", vertelde de heer Guterres aan verslaggevers op een gezamenlijke persconferentie met president Chan Santokhi aan het einde van zijn eerste dag in het land.
De VN-chef gaf ook een duidelijke waarschuwing: "Als we de [huidige] schaal van vernietiging in de regenwouden van de wereld blijven zien, bijten we niet alleen in de hand die ons voedt - we scheuren het ook in stukken".
De heer Guterres benadrukte het feit dat de ongebreidelde ontbossing en de verslechterende gevolgen voor het klimaat de incidentie van bosbranden en droogtes doen toenemen.
"Dit is schandalig en beschamend.  Het is wereldwijde zelfmoord in slow motion", zei hij, en hij voegde eraan toe dat een dergelijke vernietiging een wereldwijde wake-up call zou moeten zijn om de longen van onze planeet te redden.

Content: 03 July 2022
On Sunday July 3rd, the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, visited the UN House in Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname. His visit to the UN House was part of an official two-day visit to Suriname to attend the opening ceremony of the 43rd Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). This was the UN chief’s first-ever visit to Suriname.
Mr. Guterres, who had arrived in Suriname a day earlier, had already conducted several field visits to experience the country’s biodiversity and its people firsthand. At the UN House, the UN chief met with the UN Country Team and afterwards attended a special UN Suriname Town Hall meeting held in his honor.
During the meeting with the UN Country Team, the Secretary-General received an overview of the work executed by the UN in Suriname under the recently signed cooperation framework, the Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework (MSDCF) 2022 – 2026. The UN chief provided strategic input on the focus areas identified during his field trips and meeting with the President of Suriname, H.E. Chandrikapersad Santokhi. Mr. Guterres expressed that he was pleased with the achievements and the level of collaboration between the agencies, as part of the ongoing UN Reform.
At the Town Hall meeting, the Secretary-General greeted staff with warm words of encouragement and proceeded to answer a few questions posed by national staff. At the end of the meeting UNDP presented to the Secretary-General a gift from the Vereniging van Inheemse Dorpshoofden in Suriname (VIDS).

Title: Secretary-General, António Guterres scheduled to visit Suriname for CARICOM meeting
Content: 25 June 2022
The Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), António Guterres, will be visiting Suriname to attend the 43rd Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), on the 3rd of July.
With a focus on the environment and biodiversity and on how both are being impacted by climate change, the Secretary-General will first attend the 2022 UN Ocean Conference where he will address and engage with youth at the UN Ocean Conference Youth and Innovation Forum, alongside the President of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. He will subsequently travel to Paramaribo, Suriname to engage with CARICOM heads during the opening ceremony of the Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM.
The Caribbean region is among the world’s hardest hit by worsening climate impacts, despite having contributed among the least to the problem, due to its very low greenhouse gas emissions.
In the face of these severe climate challenges, and with very scarce resources, the region is taking vital steps to build climate resilience, which the Secretary-General will observe first-hand during his stay in Suriname. He will visit an indigenous community in the rainforest, to learn more about harnessing indigenous knowledge to help adapt to climate impacts.
He will also underscore the importance of nature-based climate solutions during a visit to a coastal mangrove rehabilitation site, where he will witness the susceptibility of Suriname’s coastline’ to flooding and erosion. These threats have been heightened by sea level rise and an increase in extreme weather events resulting from the climate crisis.

Title: Outdoor gym in Commewijne should stimulate healthy lifestyle
Content: 13 April 2022
The Commewijne district will have its first outdoor gym; an open-air sports facility that President Chandrikapersad Santokhi says will help promote a healthy lifestyle. The Head of State had the honour of inaugurating this facility on Thursday, 7 April 2022. The gym at New Amsterdam has come about partly with the support of the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO). It follows on from the Safe Exercise Area project that was started last year with the aim of encouraging sports and exercise.
According to President Santokhi, the government's plan is to have a healthy lifestyle unit in every neighbourhood, where everyone can go for family coaching and guidance. The intention is that these units will be staffed by surplus civil servants who will be trained on the basis of selection and voluntariness. The Head of State states that by exercising and moving, fewer people will need specialist treatment and less medication will be used. According to him, there is a large supply of patients at hospitals. This can be prevented if people have a good diet, good information, guidance and exercise. The treatment of chronic diseases weighs heavily on healthcare and 80% of the Ministry of Health's budget goes to curative care.
President Santokhi: "We need to change our attitude to life; a healthy lifestyle through more exercise. Through good nutrition and education, families and individuals can be better supported." The Head of State recalled the International Day of Sports (Wednesday, 6 April) and the International Day of Health (Thursday, 7 April). He stressed the importance of health and placed the significance of the outdoor gym in the context of the government's health policy. With its contribution, the PAHO supports the government in this policy and also contributes to the physical and mental health of the Surinamese society.
Within the Government's policy, the health sector must be able to provide the necessary care. In addition, the Government is working to make the State Health Insurance Fund (SZF) healthier. A system to encourage insured persons to live healthily is being considered. President Santokhi believes that the outdoor sports facility will bring people together and thereby promote unity. "Healthy individuals form a healthy community and that means more production," states the head of state.

Title: UNFPA SURINAME, BREAKING THE BIAS BY UNITING WOMEN
Content: 21 March 2022
The United Women Seminar, an initiative of the Junior Chamber International Female, was executed in partnership with the Bureau of Gender Affairs (Ministry of Home Affairs) and the Youth Advisory Group of UNFPA.
On March 14, 2022, in commemoration of International Women's Day 2022, the second edition of the United Women Seminar was conducted in the Ballroom of Royal Torarica in Paramaribo, Suriname.

Title: Government of Suriname Signs the United Nations Multi-Country Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for the English and Dutch Speaking Caribbean
Content: 03 March 2022
On February 22nd, 2022, H.E. Albert Ramdin, Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Business and International Cooperation (BIBIS) of Suriname, and Ms. Marina Walter, United Nations Resident Coordinator (RC) for Suriname, signed the 2022-2026 United Nations Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework (MSDCF).
The 2022-2026 UN MSDCF is the strategic framework that represents the UN’s collective response to addressing the common development challenges of the English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean.  It provides a common platform for development cooperation to Belize that is strongly rooted and linked to national priorities. The framework prioritizes outcomes in the region in four areas:  economic resilience and shared prosperity; equality and wellbeing; resilience to climate change shocks and sustainable natural resource management; and peace, safety, justice, and the rule of law. Under each of these four priority areas, specific desired changes were defined for UN contribution which were guided by different sources such as the Multi-Year Development Plan (OP) 2022- 2026 and the Sustainable Development Goals.
The process to develop the MSDCF took more the 18 months and required tireless input from both the UN agencies and the government to ensure the development goals important to Suriname were included in the framework. Ms. Walter, during her remarks, commended the Minister and his colleagues for the good collaboration and sound engagement shown during the development process.
The outcomes of the MSDCF will be pursued in Suriname by the Surinamese government and UN agencies, both resident and non-resident, working together with national and international development partners, including civil society, and private sector.
This is the second generation of this regional framework and will ensure that funds and resources are allocated correctly to meet the needs of Suriname and support the country’s efforts to reach the Sustainable Development Goals.

Title: Joint SDG Fund Doubles its Portfolio to $114 Million in Catalytic Impact Investments
Content: 15 February 2022
Today, the UN Joint SDG Fund announces a historic expansion of its portfolio to five new markets across the globe with US $54.5 million in additional investments to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals.
Selected from a global pool of submissions from over 100 countries, the proposals submitted by Kenya, Madagascar, North Macedonia, Suriname, and Zimbabwe emerged as the strongest, most impactful, and investment-ready to take public.
The investments constitute an ambitious and concerted response by the UN to the challenges of our generation, from health in a world still plagued by the COVID-19 pandemic to youth empowerment to climate change. Under the leadership of UN Resident Coordinators, implementation of these programmes will fuel the UN footprint in the five nations, ushering in a new generation of collaborative action across the UN, Governments, civil society, and private sector investors.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Business, and International Cooperation (BIBIS) welcomes the cooperation with the SDG Fund and indicates that the opportunity to grow pineapple in a sustainable way and to be able to market it will be usefully utilized. Strengthening the production sector, where the human factor plays an important role is one of the important elements of the Development Plan. And the (3ADI+); Sustainable Pineapple Value Chain Development project is a clear example of making the cooperation more concrete, whereby substance is given to helping achieve specific SDGs. Public Private Partnership is also further fleshed out in this way. -Miriam MacIntosh, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Business, and International Cooperation (BIBIS).
This announcement comes less than one year after the Fund launched its first investment of US $41 million in four transformative programmes in Fiji, Indonesia, Malawi, and Uruguay. In 2021, a US $17.9 million programme in Papua New Guinea was added, and with the addition of these five new programmes, the Joint SDG Fund’s Catalytic Investment portfolio will grow to US $114 million. The portfolio is expected to leverage US $5 billion toward the SDGs across the 10 programmatic countries.
With sincere appreciation for the contributions from the European Union and Governments of Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and our private sector funding partners, this milestone marks a transformative movement towards achieving the SDGs by 2030.
Recognizing the immense support in the implementation of the UN joint programme initiatives, the Fund is exceedingly grateful for the level of cooperation from, United Nations Capital Development Fund, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Children's Fund, United Nations Population Fund, International Labour Organization, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, International Organization for Migration, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, International Fund for Agricultural Development, UNAIDS, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, UN Women, World Health Organization, World Meteorological Organization.
About: The UN Joint SDG Fund is a multi-partner trust fund established by the United Nations General Assembly. The Fund supports UN member states by de-risking investments that drive financing solutions to accelerate achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our goal is to disburse US$ 1 billion in grants annually in the race to 2030. All programmes share one critical element: their ability to leverage multi-million-dollar grants from the Joint SDG Fund into billions for sustainable development.

Title: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Planning Bureau and United Nations Suriname launch the Country Implementation Plan (CIP) 2022-2023 Formulation Process
Content: 08 February 2022
On February 3, 2022, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Business, and International Cooperation (BIBIS) and the Planning Bureau Suriname (SPS), in collaboration with United Nations Suriname kicked-off the development of the Country Implementation Plan (CIP) 2022-2023 at Royal Ballroom Torarica.
Several stakeholders participated in the February 3rd launch meeting, which brought together representatives of different ministries, the Planning Bureau, Statistics Bureau Suriname, and UN agencies operating in Suriname. Participants had the tasks of formulating the priority activities and programs required to facilitate the sustainable development of Suriname. The CIP serves to operationalize the new Multi-Country Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2022-2026 (MSDCF) at the local level and is therefore a very important tool as indicated by Ms. Marina Walter, Resident Coordinator of the UN.
The MSDCF for the English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean, covering the period 2022-2026, is an important instrument for planning and implementation of the UN development activities towards the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda. This framework has been developed as the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Caribbean, as elsewhere, the impact of the pandemic aggravated and revealed existing structural vulnerabilities. The CIP allows all stakeholders the opportunity to address many of these vulnerabilities. In an effort to deliver the strategic goals of the Surinamese government and its stakeholders, the MSDCF is guided by four main priority areas:
» Economic resilience and shared prosperity
» Equality and well-being
» Resilience to climate change and shocks, and sustainable natural resource management
» Peace, safety, justice, and the rule of law
Under each of these four priority areas, specific desired changes were defined for UN contribution which were guided by different sources such as the Multi-Year Development Plan (OP) 2022- 2026 and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Title: Launch of the SDG Butterfly Mural at het Anton de Kom University Suriname complex
Content: 18 November 2021
The United Nations (UN) Suriname, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Business and International Cooperation (BIBIS) and the Board of the Anton De Kom University Suriname (AdeKUS), recently officially launched the SDG Butterfly Mural on the wall of Building 6 of the AdeKUS complex.
Through a combination of different illustrations, which are encompassed in the silhouette of butterfly wings, the mural depicts each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This artwork was created by local artist Fabian de Ramdanie, who painted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a way that it is recognizable to the people of Suriname.
The SDGs are an urgent call to action to all countries for global cooperation. They recognize that eradicating poverty and other hardships must go hand in hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and boost economic growth - all while addressing climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.
The SDG Butterfly Mural at the AdeKUS is part of the "SDG Butterfly Effect Campaign" announced by UN Deputy Secretary General Amina J. Mohammed in September 2019.  The purpose of this mural is to bring the SDGs to life through art and inspire the public to take action. Visitors to the SDG Butterfly Mural can also show their support for the SDGs by sharing photos and videos via social media. By doing so, they will inspire others and through a kind of Butterfly Effect spread the inspiration of the SDGs and thus contribute to the pursuit of sustainability.
The UN Resident Coordinator (RC) for Suriname, Marina Walter made the official opening of the SDG Butterfly Mural during her visit to Suriname, together with the Minister of BIBIS, Albert Ramdin, and the Chairman of the Board of the AdeKUS. RC Marina Walter who is the representative of the UN Secretary General for Suriname was very pleased with this cooperation.
The cooperation with the AdeKUS has already borne fruit with the students of the Treaty Law, LL.B course of the Faculty of Legal Sciences. As a final assignment for this course, these students made a video presentation on treaties that affect the achievement of the SDGs in Suriname and to which Suriname has committed itself. By incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals into the University's curriculum in this way, we increase the chances of successfully achieving the SDGs. 
The influence of art in raising awareness of the SDGs among the Surinamese people will not remain at the AdeKUS complex. The goal of the UN in Suriname is to inspire people to work and strive for sustainability by placing murals in the different districts, all over the country, because only through collaboration will we be able to implement the SDG's and ensure that no one is left behind.

Title: Visit from the Resident Coordinator of United Nations Suriname to Surinamese politician
Content: 17 November 2021
The United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator (RC) for Suriname, Marina Walter had her first personal meeting with President Chandrikapersad Santokhi on Wednesday, November 10, 2021. The RC is the designated representative of the UN Secretary General for Suriname.
The meeting with the Surinamese Head of State was a courtesy call reaffirming the enduring relationship between Suriname and the UN. During the visit to the President, both officials reflected on their long-standing cooperation. With this first physical meeting between President Santokhi and RC Walter, the importance of continuing this relationship was reconfirmed.
The cooperation between Suriname and the UN is guided by the new development plan of Suriname and the new framework of the UN, the Multi-Country Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (MSDCF).  The MSDCF is the instrument through which the United Nations supports countries and territories in the Caribbean. The Surinamese government has dedicated itself to the growth of the country and the development of its society. The United Nations wants to be a partner in this and where necessary contribute to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which are anchored in Social, Economic and Environmental sustainable development. It is expected that the partnership between Suriname and UN will continue in each area, using the MSDCF. For the organization, a good cooperation with the Surinamese government is important so that there can be a correct implementation of the common goals laid down in the National Development Plan and the MSDCF.
RC Marina Walter also had several meetings with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Business and International Cooperation (BIBIS) during her visit including a visit with Minister Albert Ramdin to discuss cooperation between the UN and the Surinamese government. She also had a first meeting with "Joint National Steering Committee" which is responsible for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Country Implementation Plan. This will be created based on the National Development Plan and the MSCDF. Minister Armand Achaibersing also received a courtesy call from RC Marina Walter given that the Ministry of Finance and Planning is a crucial partner in achieving the SDGs in Suriname.
The UN believes that the Surinamese government has made its commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals very clear. These SDGs were developed in 2015 by all 193 member states of the UN, of which Suriname is one. It is a common goal for all partners to achieve these SDGs by 2030. So for all countries, including Suriname, it is a common agenda.

Title: The United Nation Population Fund Suriname supports Human Rights for all
Content: 29 October 2021
In commemoration of Pride Month, October 2021, and the celebration of UN76 in Suriname,
UNFPA handed over posters addressing Human Rights to PAREA for distribution for other civil society organizations working closely with the LGBTQIA+ community in Suriname. The handover was at the UN gallery to celebrate 76 years of striving towards peace, development, equality, human rights and opportunities for all by the United Nations.
To ensure the information on these posters was understandable it was localized for the Surinamese community. Therefore the posters were created in Dutch as Suriname is part of the Dutch-speaking Caribbean, and Dutch is the official language of the country.
PAREA is an association of lesbian, gay, bi- or transsexual (LGBT)professionals in Suriname with a higher education or comparable career. PAREA serves as a support network, providing Surinamese gay professionals with social and business contacts to further their careers and enrich their lives. PAREA members are active in e.g. education, consultancy, health IT, in bigger (state) companies, or are entrepreneurs.They want to contribute to society as a whole as well. Their members organize projects which benefit the whole society. Parea members want to lead by example and foster a positive image of the Surinamese LGBT community.
UNFPA strongly believes that this is the start of a great and meaningful partnership as both organizations are committed to creating a community with equal  human rights for all and that no one should be left behind.

Content: 04 September 2020
In accordance with the National COVID Response Plan, the Ministry of Health is seeking to streamline all incoming shipments of supplies in accordance with clear rules and guidelines to ensure the safety of its people. The BGVS will support the Ministry to effectively manage and distribute these and future supplies to all health facilities in accordance with the National COVID-19 Needs List. PAHO will continue to provide technical support in this area to strengthen the national logistics management information system and regulatory frameworks for essential medicines in the country.

Title: Suriname launches the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) 2030 project
Content: 30 July 2020
The FCTC 2030 project aims to support Parties to accelerate implementation of the WHO FCTC, the comprehensive and evidence-based tobacco control treaty, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The project is led by the Secretariat of the WHO FCTC in partnership with WHO and UNDP, with additional support from civil society experts and academic institutions. It is delivered though funding generously provided by the Governments of the United Kingdom, Australia and Norway. One of the core elements of the project is the provision of targeted support to a selected number of low- and middle-income countries that have demonstrated considerable motivation to advance tobacco control.
Suriname ratified the WHO FCTC in 2008. It has one of the most comprehensive laws on tobacco control in the Caribbean region mandating implementation of key effective measures as established in the Strategy and Plan of Action to strengthen tobacco control in the Americas 2018-2022. The FCTC 2030 project is therefore an opportunity to access technical support for strengthening enforcement of the tobacco control law, developing a comprehensive, costed national tobacco control strategy and supporting the development of national tobacco cessation guidelines. The project also includes a needs assessment exercise and an “investment case” to demonstrate the social and economic benefits of comprehensive WHO FCTC implementation in Suriname.
During the launch event, Dr. Karen Bell-Lewis, PAHO/WHO Representative in Suriname underlined the support to be given to the Government, in particular the Ministry of Health, including assistance with the development of a four-year national tobacco control strategy in line with the Global Strategy to Accelerate Tobacco Control,  and also the development of national guidelines for the creation of cessation services. Dr. Adriana Blanco Marquizo, Head of the Convention Secretariat, then highlighted the devastating consequences of tobacco use on health, the economy and the environment. She described the WHO FCTC, the first international health treaty, as a powerful tool to fight the tobacco epidemic. She also highlighted that tobacco use leads to non-communicable diseases which increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. The UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, Dr. Margaret Jones Williams, described how tobacco use impedes sustainable development and how the FCTC 2030 project will contribute to the achievement of the SDGs in Suriname. She stressed that UNDP stands ready to support the effort of the government of Suriname to address the key governance and development aspects of tobacco control. Mr Andrew Black, Coordinator of Development Assistance at the Convention Secretariat, elaborated on the support that can be provided through the FCTC 2030 project despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mrs. Farisha Sheombar Sing, Tobacco Focal Point at the Bureau of Public Health presented the activities to be implemented through March 2021.
Dr. Robert Mohamed, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Health, thanked the Convention Secretariat, UNDP and PAHO for their support on behalf of the Minister of Health, the Honorable Antoine Elias.  Dr. Mohamed underlined the importance of the project as the country faces an increase in COVID-19 infections. Tobacco users are most likely to suffer from lung disease or reduced lung capacity which greatly increases their risk of serious illness from COVID-19 infection. Suriname will therefore benefit from the support through this project including the focus on developing national smoking cessation guidelines.
Dr Carmen Audera, FCTC 2030 Regional Consultant with the Convention Secretariat, closed the official launch with an overview of next steps and assurance of support to be given to the government during the coming months.

Title: Opening remarks by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, H.E. Yldiz Pollack-Beighle, on the occasion of the Government of Suriname – UN Country Team Consultation Meeting
Content: 12 July 2019
Mr. Subhas Mungra, Chair of the Plan Coordination Committee, Mr. Reynold Simons, Director of Planning Office of Suriname,
Mr. Winston Lackin, Ambassador in charge of Environment/Presidential Adviser, Mr. Armstrong Alexis, UNDP Resident Representative a.i.,
Representatives of the United Nations Country Team, Members of the Plan Coordination Committee, Supporting staff of the Government and the UN, Members of the media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to welcome you to this two-day consultation meeting with the United Nations system in Suriname. This is the second meeting with representation of the Plan Coordination Committee (PCC), which is a key institution for the Government of Suriname to ensure that there is a coherent and an integrated approach to policy planning, implementation and monitoring.
This consultation is aimed at taking stock of what has been achieved in the past year as well as reaching consensus by both parties on the two-year planning of the Country Implementation Plan (CIP) 2019-2020.
This plan falls under the umbrella of the regional level planning with the United Nations System, referred to as the United Nations Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework (UN MSDF) 2017-2021.
In this regard, I recall the Secretary General’s report on “Repositioning the UN development system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda: our promise for dignity, prosperity and peace on a healthy planet” (December 2017).
In this report the Secretary General emphasized that and I quote: “the United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks should become a clear, action-oriented United Nations response to national development priorities in each country, integrating the Sustainable Development Goals”. End of quote.
Additionally, the Secretary General’s report on “Implementation of General Assembly resolution 71/243 on the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system” (2019), refers to a re-designed Framework – that is renamed by the Secretary General as the “United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework” – in which the Secretary General reiterates as key objective, ensuring that the Cooperation Framework is fully responsive to national priorities.
Participants, ladies and gentlemen,
To ensure effectiveness of the delivery on the ground, bearing in mind coordination of activities of various UN agencies, I wish to highlight the following.
For the reconfiguration of its development system structure, Suriname specifically proposes the following:
i. Regrouping of the countries with which it would share UN resources, specifically excluding overseas territories of developed countries. In light of the extensive but shared challenges, and taking into account political sensitivities, Suriname proposes to explore several models, including the development of an entirely new structure covering only Suriname and its neighbour Guyana, where agencies are distributed between the two at a more or less equal level, and in which the RR and RC would be enabled to dedicate maximum attention to their mandates.
ii. The addition of more UN agencies servicing Suriname.
iii. The addition of an FAO Representative on the ground.
iv. Appointment of a UNDP Resident Representative solely assigned to and residing in Suriname, which will not be combined with another country office.
The Government of Suriname strives to continue its efforts in developing the national economy in a sustainable manner, in which the three dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social and environment – are intertwined and addressed.
After an evaluation of the implementation of the CIP 2018 and in preparation of the CIP 2019-2020, the Government felt the need to propose the following clustering to ensure a clear, coherent, comprehensive and effective programme planning aligned to the national policy areas as outlined in the Multi-annual Development Plan, namely:
1. Reform/institutional strengthening of the national planning system including capacity strengthening within the Government institutions;
2. Agricultural production and food security;
3. Environment including climate adaptation and mitigation, water and waste management, disaster risk management and forestry management;
4. Education;
5. Health;
6. Integrated social policy including gender and youth.
Based on the Multi-Annual Development Plan the Government introduced four (4) Ministerial clusters, namely:
1. Governance;
2. Enabling ministries;
3. Production and;
4. Social ministries.
On the second day of this consultation meeting, working sessions with the UN system will be held to deliberate on these clusters as proposed by the Government as well on the projects proposed for the CIP 2019-2020. The intention is to work towards adoption of the CIP 2019-2020 at the end of that session.
Participants, ladies and gentlemen,
This consultation also provides an opportunity to have deliberations on development strategy issues. The Government of Suriname will present the national development indicators for monitoring development policies and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as the planning for Suriname’s voluntary SDG reporting. We look forward to the adoption of these indicators.
In closing, I wish to extend my gratitude to the UN system for providing their continued support to the Government of Suriname and I look forward to the continuation and deepening of this support to help achieve the national development goals and priorities of Suriname.
I also would like to extend my appreciation to the Planning Office and the Plan Coordination Committee for continuing the process to a more structural, coherent approach of development planning, implementation and monitoring.
And with these words I declare this consultation meeting open. I thank you.

Title: UN Country Team and Government of Suriname hold consultations on strategic development issues
Content: 11 July 2019
The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and the Government of Suriname held consultations in a two-day session regarding the Country Implementation Plan (CIP) 2018/2019-2020 and the strategic development Issues. The focus was on translating the regional UN MSDF strategy into practical and tangible inputs that address and respond to the national development priorities of Suriname, zooming in on every agency’s specific and agreed technical support.

The agencies of the UN system are very pleased with this opportunity to convene with their government counterparts, to discuss and agree on the UN support towards the National Development Priorities for 2019 and 2020. They appreciate the desire of the Government of Suriname to engage in the discussions aimed at defining and refining the inputs of the UN in addressing national priorities of the Republic of Suriname.

On behalf of the UNCT, Mr. Alexis thanked the Government of Suriname for the ongoing and effective collaboration with the UN system and for embracing the process of the UN Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework 2017 – 2021 (UN MSDF)
