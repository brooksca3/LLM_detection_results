UNSG Message for World Environment Day 2024 (observed on June 5)
The theme of this year’s World Environment Day is “land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience.”
Humanity depends on land. Yet, all over the world, a toxic cocktail of pollution, climate chaos, and biodiversity decimation are turning healthy lands into deserts, and thriving ecosystems into dead zones. They are annihilating forests and grasslands, and sapping the strength of land to support ecosystems, agriculture, and communities.
That means crops failing, water sources vanishing, economies weakened, and communities endangered – with the poorest hit hardest. Sustainable development is suffering. And we are trapped in a deadly cycle – land use is responsible for eleven percent of the carbon dioxide emissions heating our planet. It’s time to break free.
Countries must deliver on all their commitments to restore degraded ecosystems and land, and on the entire Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.  They must use their new national climate action plans to set out how they will halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. And we must drastically scale-up finance to support developing countries to adapt to violent weather, protect nature, and support sustainable development.
Inaction is too costly. But swift and effective action makes economic sense. Every dollar invested in ecosystem restoration creates up to thirty dollars in economic benefits.
We are Generation Restoration. Together, let’s build a sustainable future for land, and for humanity.

09 April 2024
I welcome the royal decree of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the King of Bahrain, pardoning 1584 inmates, issued on the occasion of the silver jubilee of His Majesty's accession to the throne and the celebrations of Eid al-Fitr.
The amnesty is an important step towards strengthening Bahraini society's cohesion and solidarity, while upholding the public interest, the protection of human rights, and the rule of law.

I also praise the directive issued by His Royal Highness, the Prime minister, to provide training programs and job opportunities for those covered by the royal amnesty, which will facilitate their reintegration into society and their contribution to national development.

I look forward to the continuation of the constructive dialogue on human rights between the Government of Bahrain and the United Nations as part of their cooperation to achieve Sustainable Development Goals and ensure that no one is left behind.

UNSG António Guterres Message for World Autism Awareness Day, observed on April 2, 2024
World Autism Awareness Day is a moment to recognize and celebrate the important contributions of autistic people in every country and community.
But around the world, they continue to confront barriers to their fundamental rights to education, employment and social inclusion — as called for by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As a matter of fundamental rights, governments must invest in stronger community support systems, inclusive education and training programmes, and accessible and technology-based solutions to enable persons with autism to enjoy the same rights as others.
Scaling-up support and investment in countries and communities requires working hand-in-hand with persons with autism and their allies.
Today and every day, let’s unite to realize their rights, and ensure an inclusive and accessible world for all.

23 March 2024
Climate chaos threatens every region, country and community on earth. So, all of us must unite at the frontlines of climate action.
Our climate is collapsing. The signs have never been clearer. The latest State of the Global Climate report showed climate records being shattered across the board. 2023 saw record heat, record sea levels, record ocean surface temperatures, and Antarctic sea ice at record lows. Fires, floods and droughts around the world are the result.  Abnormal is the new normal. And the human impact is clear: lives taken, livelihoods lost, economies upended.
Climate chaos threatens every region, country and community on earth. So, all of us must unite at the frontlines of climate action – the theme of this year’s World Meteorological Day – and fight for a better future.
Together we must build a future where we have better adapted to the realities of our changing climate, limiting damage when extreme weather strikes, including by protecting every person on earth with an early-warning system by 2027. We must build a future where developing countries have received climate justice, recognizing that they have done the least to cause the crisis. And we must build a future where we have ended our addiction to fossil fuels and limited the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius, avoiding the very worst of climate chaos.
Governments are critical. The G20 – the biggest emitters – must lead a global move from fossil fuels to renewables. And developed countries must deliver finance for climate action in developing countries. We need greater action from business and finance – to slash their emissions in line with the 1.5 degree limit, and to stop financing fossil fuel development. And we need citizens around the world to pile pressure on governments and businesses to act.
Meteorologists around the world are also key. I thank them for all their work to advance climate action. And I welcome the Global Greenhouse Gas Watch initiative which will improve our tracking of emissions.
This is the fight of our lives. Let’s unite at the frontline of climate action and build a better future, together.

22 March 2024
Our planet is heating up – seas are rising, rains patterns are changing, and river flows are shrinking.
Action for water is action for peace. And today it is needed more than ever.
Our world is in turbulent waters. Conflicts are raging, inequality is rife, pollution and biodiversity loss are rampant, and, as humanity continues to burn fossil fuels, the climate crisis is accelerating with a deadly force – further threatening peace.
Our planet is heating up – seas are rising, rains patterns are changing, and river flows are shrinking. That is resulting in droughts in some regions, and floods and coastal erosion in others. Meanwhile, pollution and overconsumption are imperiling the availability of fresh, clean, accessible water on which all life depends. Dwindling supplies can increase competition and inflame tensions between people, communities, and countries. That is increasing the risk of conflict.
Water for peace is the theme of this year’s World Water Day. Achieving it relies on far greater cooperation. Today, 153 countries share water resources. Yet only twenty-four have reported cooperation agreements for all their shared water. We must accelerate efforts to work together across borders, and I urge all countries to join and implement the United Nations Water Convention – which promotes managing shared water resources sustainably.
Cooperating to safeguard water can power and sustain peace. Water stewardship can strengthen multilateralism and ties between communities, and build resilience to climate disasters. It can also drive progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals – which are the foundation of peaceful societies – including by improving health, reducing poverty and inequality, and boosting food and water security.
Let’s commit to work together, to make water a force for cooperation, harmony and stability, and so help to create a world of peace and prosperity for all.

Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
15 March 2024
Institutional discrimination and other barriers are violating the human rights and dignity of Muslims
The International Day to Combat Islamophobia occurs at a time when we see a rising tide of anti-Muslim hate and bigotry in many parts of the world.
Institutional discrimination and other barriers are violating the human rights and dignity of Muslims. Divisive rhetoric and misrepresentation are stigmatizing communities. Online hate speech is fueling real-life violence.
Much of this disturbing trend is part of a wider pattern of attacks against religious groups and vulnerable populations, also including Jews, minority Christian communities and others.
We must confront and root out bigotry in all its forms. Leaders must condemn inflammatory discourse and safeguard religious freedom. Digital platforms must moderate hateful content and protect users from harassment. And everyone must unite to combat intolerance, stereotypes and bias.
Together, let us commit to promoting mutual respect and understanding, foster social cohesion, and build peaceful, just and inclusive societies for all.

Title: UNSG Op-ed on International Womens's Day 2024

10 March 2024
“INVEST IN WOMEN: ENDING THE PATRIARCHY REQUIRES MONEY ON THE TABLE”
The fight for women’s rights over the past fifty years is a story of progress.
Women and girls have demolished barriers, dismantled stereotypes and driven progress towards a more just and equal world. Women’s rights were finally recognised as fundamental and universal human rights. Hundreds of millions more girls are in classrooms around the world. And pioneering leaders have smashed glass ceilings across the globe.
But progress is under threat. And full equality remains light years away.
Billions of women and girls face marginalization, injustice and discrimination, as millennia of male domination continue to shape societies. The persistent epidemic of gender-based violence disgraces humanity. Over four million girls are estimated to be at risk of female genital mutilation each year. Discrimination against women and girls remains perfectly legal in much of the world. In some places, that makes it difficult for women to own property, in others, it allows men to rape their wives with impunity.
Meanwhile, global crises are hitting women and girls hardest. Wherever there’s conflict, climate disaster, poverty or hunger, women and girls suffer most. In every region of the world, more women than men go hungry. In both developed and developing countries, a backlash against women’s rights, including their sexual and reproductive rights, is stalling and even reversing progress.
New technologies – which have such potential to dismantle inequalities – too often make matters worse. That can be because of unequal access, algorithms with baked-in bias, or misogynistic violence – from deep fakes to targeted harassment of specific women.
At our current speed, full legal equality for women is some 300 years away; so is the end of child marriage.  This rate of change is frankly insulting. Half of humanity can’t wait centuries for their rights. We need equality now. That means accelerating the pace of progress. And that relies on political ambition, and on investment – the theme of this year’s International Women’s Day.
We need public and private investment in programmes to end violence against women, ensure decent work, and drive women’s inclusion and leadership in digital technologies, peacebuilding, climate action, and across all sectors of the economy. We must also urgently support women’s rights organizations fighting against stereotypes, battling to make women’s and girls’ voices heard, and challenging traditions and cultural norms. Currently they receive a paltry 0.1% of international development spending. That must change.
Investment may sound far removed from women’s everyday lives. But it takes investment to give schoolgirls the same opportunities as schoolboys. It takes investment to provide digital education and develop skills. It takes investment to provide the childcare that enables caregivers, who are mainly mothers, to do paid work outside the home. And it takes investment to build inclusive communities and societies with the full participation of women and girls of all backgrounds.
Putting money behind equality is the right thing to do, but it also makes financial sense. Supporting women to enter formal labour markets grows economies, boosts tax revenues and expands opportunities for all.
Securing the investment we need in women and girls requires three things. First, increasing the availability of affordable, long-term finance for sustainable development, and tackling the debt crisis strangling many developing economies. Otherwise, countries simply won’t have the funds to invest in women and girls.  We need immediate action to provide breathing space for countries with unbearable debt repayments looming, and to encourage multilateral development banks to leverage far more private finance at affordable costs. Over the long term, we must reform the international financial architecture and make it far more responsive to the needs of developing countries.
Second, countries must prioritise equality for women and girls – recognising that equality is not only a matter of rights but the bedrock of peaceful, prosperous societies. That means governments actively addressing discrimination, spending on programmes to support women and girls, and ensuring policies, budgets and investments respond to their needs.
Third, we need to increase the number of women in leadership positions. Having women in positions of power can help to drive investment in policies and programmes that respond to women and girls’ realities.  I am particularly proud that since early in my tenure – and for the first time in history – we have equal numbers of women and men in senior management across the entire United Nations system.
Equality is overdue.  Ending the patriarchy requires money on the table – it’s time to cough up.

04 March 2024
Today reminds us that disarmament and non-proliferation are critical not only to a peaceful future, but to our very existence.
This second International Day for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Awareness comes at a perilous moment, marked by rising levels of military spending, deepening geopolitical tensions and growing violent conflicts across the globe.

Meanwhile, some leaders are using apocalyptic rhetoric on the use of nuclear weapons.  The proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons, the use of explosive devices in populated areas, and the growing military application of new and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, are also serious concerns.

Today reminds us that disarmament and non-proliferation are critical not only to a peaceful future, but to our very existence.

Global leaders must invest in peace by strengthening the systems and tools that prevent the proliferation and use of deadly weapons — including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — and by developing disarmament solutions.

The proposed New Agenda for Peace includes new strategies and approaches to eliminate the threats posed by nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and other emerging dangers, such as autonomous weapons systems.

On this important day, let us speak with one loud, clear and united voice.

It’s time to stop the madness. We need disarmament now.

Title: Secretary-General's message for 2024 World Wildlife Day
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
03 March 2024
Human activities have devastated our wildlife. Human ingenuity can help to save it.
Pollution, climate chaos, habitat loss, and exploitation of nature, have pushed a million plant and animal species to the brink of extinction. This is horrifying in itself. It is also a direct threat to the health and livelihoods of billions of people around the world – particularly the most vulnerable..
As the theme of this year’s World Wildlife Day reminds us, digital technologies can help to turn things around. Already, satellites are helping to track animals under threat. And data is charting wildlife migration and land use, supporting efforts to protect them.
When used responsibly, sustainably and equitably, digital technologies have the potential to revolutionize conservation. But they are a tool in our arsenal, not a silver bullet. We still need concerted efforts by countries, companies, and individuals to help pull the world’s wildlife back from the brink and build a just, sustainable future.
At this year’s Summit of the Future, Members States will discuss our proposals to develop new metrics to complement gross domestic product. Activities like overfishing and forest clearance increase GDP while devastating nature. Complementary metrics can provide balance, by measuring the things that really matter to people and planet.
I also urge countries to take urgent action to drastically reduce emissions, adapt to climate extremes, prevent pollution, and put the brakes on biodiversity loss, including recognizing the role Indigenous Peoples play in protecting biodiversity.
Developed countries must invest in biodiversity and climate action in developing countries. And all governments must create new national climate plans that align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as well as national biodiversity strategies that implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.
We depend on nature. Let’s show that nature can depend on us – and act now to protect it.

Title: How the UN Environment Assembly can steer the world to a sustainable future
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
18 February 2024
The world does not have an environmental to-do list. The world has an environmental must-do list – for 2024 and for decades into the future.
Everything, everywhere, all as one: how the UN Environment Assembly can steer the world to a sustainable future
The world does not have an environmental to-do list. The world has an environmental must-do list – for 2024 and for decades into the future. We must slow and adapt to climate change, protect and restore nature and biodiversity, reverse land degradation and desertification, and end pollution and waste. Get it right, and we can build a future that works for the many, not just the few – a principle that is at the heart of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Nations at all stages of development have committed to work towards this sustainable future under dozens of multilateral environmental agreements. In times of geopolitical crisis and shifting political landscapes, this is no mean feat. Action on the environment is a powerful force for unity.
There are global deals that set agreed goals and targets, such as the Paris Agreement, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the Global Framework on Chemicals. Many businesses and investors are promising to align their models and capital with low-carbon and nature-positive aspirations. International banks and organizations of all shades and stripes are making environmental action a core part of their objectives. The scientific community is increasingly moving from sounding the alarm to signposting solutions.
However, progress on turning commitments into transformative action must accelerate rapidly. Last year was the warmest on record, with resultant heatwaves, storms and droughts causing havoc. Millions of people died from pollution of the air, land and water. Rainforests continued to shrink and populations of species crucial to ecosystem health dwindled. Every day, every week, every month this continues, humanity digs itself into a deeper hole that will take longer to climb out from.
However, it isn’t just about working harder; it’s about working smarter. With so many agreements in play, there is a growing risk of fragmentation. This is a challenge we need to address by ensuring that work on each commitment dovetails with and amplifies the work of the others. After all, we are essentially facing one single global challenge: what we at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) call the triple planetary crisis: namely the crisis of climate change, the crisis of nature and biodiversity loss and the crisis of pollution and waste. The core drivers of every environmental challenge are often the same: unsustainable consumption and production chief among them. The best solutions to deploy are those that hit multiple challenges at once.
This is where the United Nations Environment Assembly, known as UNEA, comes in. The Assembly, the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment, unites nations every two years to look not just at isolated issues, but everything, everywhere, all as one.
The sixth gathering of the Assembly is taking place this month in Nairobi, Kenya at the home of UNEP – which hosts the secretariats of over two dozen agreements, regional conventions and scientific panels. This year, we are inviting the multilateral environmental agreements, nations and indeed every actor to come together and find new ways of working together towards a common goal.
I am not saying this will be simple. There are dozens of bodies, covering hundreds of goals and targets. The Paris Agreement targets limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C or 1.5°C. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework foresees the protection, restoration and sustainable management of Earth’s lands, oceans, coastal areas and inland waters. Nations are aiming for land degradation neutrality under the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. The Montreal Protocol continues to protect the ozone layer and is contributing to climate action. We have other agreements to do everything from protecting species to shielding people and the planet from harmful chemicals and waste. A new instrument to end plastic pollution is also in the final stages. Meanwhile, nations will step up at UNEA-6 with new resolutions aimed at tackling the triple planetary crisis.
With so much going on, it sometimes feels like we are all in one boat aiming for the same port, operating dozens of different wheelhouses connected to different rudders. We are not taking the fastest, most direct route to the destination. At UNEA-6, everyone must strive to find new ways to coordinate the wheelhouses. To learn from each other and apply lessons of the past to the future. And to start delivering on the many commitments that will make the planet, and humanity, whole and healthy.

Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
08 February 2024
"From climate change to health to artificial intelligence, the equal participation of women and girls in scientific discovery and innovation is the only way to ensure that science works for everyone."
Gender equality in science is vital for building a better future for all. Unfortunately, women and girls continue to face systemic barriers and biases that prevent them from pursuing careers in science.

This deprives our world of great talent. Today, women make up only one-third of the global scientific community, obtaining less funding, fewer publishing opportunities and fewer senior positions at top universities than men. In some places, women and girls have limited or no access to education – an act of self-harm for the societies concerned, and a terrible violation of human rights.

From climate change to health to artificial intelligence, the equal participation of women and girls in scientific discovery and innovation is the only way to ensure that science works for everyone.

Closing the gender gap requires dismantling gender stereotypes and promoting role models that encourage girls to choose science; developing programmes to support the advancement of women in science; and cultivating a working environment that nurtures the talents of all, including women members of minority communities.

Women and girls belong in science. It is time to recognize that inclusion fosters innovation, and let every woman and girl fulfil her true potential.

"The spirit of mutual respect and solidarity that binds us together as one human family."
On this International Day of Human Fraternity, we celebrate the spirit of mutual respect and solidarity that binds us together as one human family.

Today, these values are being severely tested.  Our world is marred by divisions, conflicts, and inequalities.  Discrimination is running rampant.

We must come together to protect and uphold human rights, combat hate speech and violent extremism, and push back against those who profit from fear.

We can take inspiration from the declaration “Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together” – co-authored by His Holiness Pope Francis and His Eminence the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Sheikh Ahmed El Tayeb – to work towards a world where dialogue, compassion, and human dignity prevail.

Let us reaffirm our commitment to bridging divides, fostering religious understanding and cooperation among people of all cultures and beliefs.

Together, let us forge a path towards a more peaceful, just and harmonious world for all.

Title: UNESCO Regional Office for the Gulf States and Yemen's Statement on the International Day of Education
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
24 January 2024
Today countries around the world commemorate the International Day of Education under the theme “Learning for lasting peace”.
The world is at a unique historical juncture, grappling with increased uncertainty and complex issues that shift at an unprecedented speed. Our education systems are confronted with multiple challenges and are highly impacted by technology – related developments, ecological and sociological trends that require them to adapt and transform.
The world is seeing a surge in conflicts paralleled by a concerning rise of intolerance and discrimination. In particular, disinformation, misinformation, hate speech can take dangerous forms that not only cause harm at the personal level and incite group-targeted violence but are also an attack on inclusion, diversity and human rights.
Quality, equitable and lifelong education remains the most transformational power to redress injustice and entrenched inequalities, shape just, sustainable and peaceful societies and futures.
Education, in its various forms, has the power to transcend boundaries, challenge prejudices, bridge gaps between people and cultures, and ultimately, foster a sense of global citizenship, a sense of belonging to a common and diverse humanity, respecting the needs and the rights of each others, and our shared planet Earth, which we all bear responsibility for.
All of this is eloquently articulated in the UNESCO Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights and Sustainable Development unanimously adopted by 194 Member States in November 2023, which underlines the importance of education being positioned at the center of our commitment to peace. The Recommendation focuses on how teaching and learning should transform to bring about lasting peace, a concept deeper than the absence of violence and conflict that includes dynamic, and long-term efforts to build the ability to value human dignity, our well-being and the good state of our shared planet. The Recommendation reaffirms human rights, gender inclusion in and through education, and sustainable development, despite threats and challenges.
In doing so, it promotes 14 guiding principles and priority action areas that can help empower learners with the necessary knowledge, competencies, and attitudes to become agents of peace in their immediate communities.

Title: Secretary-General António Guterres' message for International Migrants Day (observed on 18 December 2023)

18 December 2023
Migration is a fact of life and a force for good. It promotes the exchange of knowledge and ideas and contributes to economic growth. It enables millions of people to pursue opportunities and improve their lives.
At the same time, poorly governed migration is a cause of great suffering. It forces people into the cruel realm of traffickers, where they face exploitation, abuse, and even death. It undermines trust in governance and institutions, inflames social tensions, and corrodes our common humanity.

On International Migrants Day, we highlight the urgent need for safe migration governance rooted in solidarity, partnership, and respect for human rights.

Five years ago, the international community adopted the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration. This has become an important reference point and resource for Member States to assess actions, enhance cooperation, and expand rights-based pathways for migration.

Yet such measures remain the exception, not the norm. Today and every day, we must work towards a more humane and orderly management of migration for the benefit of all, including communities of origin, transit, and destination.

Together, let us secure a safer and more prosperous future for all.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  -  STATEMENT ON CLOSING OF COP28 -  Dubai, 13 December 2023
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
13 December 2023
I thank the government of the United Arab Emirates for their hospitality – and COP28 President Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber and his team for their hard work.
I am also grateful to UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell and his colleagues for their tremendous support.
I also salute all those who have pushed for the strongest possible result, including civil society and young people all over the world.
COP28 occurred at a decisive moment in the fight against the climate crisis – a moment that demands maximum ambition both in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and climate justice.
The issues of the energy transition and the future of fossil fuels were front and centre.
The Global Stocktake clearly reaffirmed the imperative of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees which requires drastic reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions in this decade.
In addition, for the first time, the outcome recognizes the need to transition away from fossil fuels – after many years in which the discussion of this issue was blocked.
Science tells us that limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees will be impossible without the phase out of all fossil fuels on a timeframe consistent with this limit.  This has been recognized by a growing and diverse coalition of countries.

To those who opposed a clear reference to a phase out of fossil fuels in the COP28 text, I want to say that a fossil fuel phase out is inevitable whether they like it or not.  Let’s hope it doesn’t come too late.

Of course, timelines, pathways and targets will differ for countries at different levels of development. But all efforts must be consistent with achieving global net zero by 2050 and preserving the 1.5 degree goal. And developing countries must be supported every step of the way.

The era of fossil fuels must end – and it must end with justice and equity.

Simultaneously, COP28 agreed to commitments to triple renewables capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030.
There was also progress in relation to adaptation and finance.
COP28 offered some other building blocks for progress – including the operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund, even though financial commitments are very limited.
Pledges to the Green Climate Fund now total a record $12.8 billion for the most climate vulnerable communities.
The new framework on adaptation action provides a measurable set of new targets to drive adaptation action and implementation.
And there is clear guidance on the next round of 2025 national climate action plans – or Nationally Determined Contributions -- which all governments must now begin preparing.
I am mobilizing the entire UN system to assist in those efforts.
Over the next two years, governments are required to prepare new economy-wide national climate action plans. These plans must be aligned with the 1.5 degree temperature goal and cover all greenhouse gases.
They must also be underpinned with credible climate policies and regulations, including a price on carbon and ending finance for fossil fuel.  And both the preparation and implementation of these plans must be fully funded and supported.
But much more is needed to keep the hope of the 1.5 degree limit alive and deliver climate justice to those on the frontlines of the crisis.
Many vulnerable countries are drowning in debt and at risk of drowning in rising seas.
It is time for a surge in finance, including for adaptation, loss and damage and reform of the international financial architecture.
We need increased capital and reform of the business model of multilateral development banks to massively increase direct support – and to leverage far more private finance at reasonable costs for climate action in developing countries.
I am working with the government of Brazil in its capacity as G20 President to help advance these critical reforms. This will also be a major focus of next September’s Summit of the Future.
The world cannot afford delays, indecision, or half measures.
I remain confident that despite many differences, the world can unite and rise to the challenge of the climate crisis.

Multilateralism remains humanity’s best hope.

It is essential to come together around real, practical and meaningful climate solutions that match the scale of the climate crisis.

Title: UN Secretary-General's press encounter at COP28
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
11 December 2023

Good morning.
We are in a race against time.
As I said at the opening of COP28, our planet is minutes to midnight for the 1.5 degree limit.
And the clock keeps ticking.
COP28 is scheduled to wrap up tomorrow, but there are still large gaps that need to be bridged.
Now is the time for maximum ambition and maximum flexibility.
Ministers and negotiators must move beyond arbitrary red lines, entrenched positions and blocking tactics.
It is time to go into overdrive to negotiate in good faith and rise to the challenge set by COP President Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber.
It is time to seek compromise for solutions – without compromising on the science or compromising on the need for the highest ambition.
In our fractured and divided world, COP28 can show that multilateralism remains our best hope to tackle global challenges.
Specifically, I ask Parties to ensure maximum ambition on two fronts:
First, ambition on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Second, ambition on delivering climate justice.
The Global Stocktake must offer a clear plan for a tripling of renewables, a doubling of energy efficiency and a single-minded focus on tackling the root cause of the climate crisis – fossil fuel
production and consumption.
Of course, transformation won’t happen overnight.
Decarbonization will create millions of decent new jobs, but governments must also ensure support, training and social protection for those who may be negatively impacted.
At the same time, the needs of developing countries highly dependent on the production of fossil fuels must also be addressed.
But it is essential that the Global Stocktake recognizes the need to phase out all fossil fuels on a timeframe consistent with the 1.5 degree limit -- and to accelerate a just, equitable and orderly energy transition for all.
A transition that takes into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and reflective capabilities, in light of national circumstances – not to reduce ambition but to combine ambition and equity.
That is the reason I proposed the Climate Solidarity Pact – in which big emitters make extra efforts to cut emissions and wealthier countries support emerging economies to be able to do so.
The timelines and targets might be different for countries at different levels of development, but they all must be consistent with achieving global net zero by 2050 and preserving the 1.5 degree goal.
Second, it is time for more ambition on climate justice.
COP28 began with two encouraging steps: agreement to operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund, and replenishment of the Green Climate Fund.
It is a start, but much more is needed.
Many developing countries are drowning in debt, have no fiscal space, and are churning in climate chaos.
We need all commitments made by developed countries on finance and adaptation to be met -- fully and transparently.
We need increased capital and reform of the business model of multilateral development banks to massively increase direct support – and to leverage far more private finance at reasonable costs for developing countries climate action efforts.
And we need far more adaptation ambition.
COP28 must send clear signals that governments have grasped the scale of the adaptation challenge, and that it is a priority not just for developing countries, but the entire world.
I welcome the emerging consensus for a new framework on adaptation with a set of measurable targets to propel action.
But a framework without the means of implementation is like a car without wheels.
The doubling of adaptation finance to $40 billion dollars by 2025 must be an initial step towards allocating at least half of all climate finance towards adaptation.
Looking ahead, the next two years are vital.
First, to establish a new and meaningful global climate finance goal beyond 2025, reflecting the scale and urgency of the climate challenge.
Second, for governments to prepare and present new national climate action plans – or Nationally Determined Contributions – that are economy-wide, cover all greenhouse gases and are fully aligned with the 1.5 degree temperature limit.
Governments must leave Dubai with a clear understanding of what is required between now and [COP30] in Brazil.
So as we approach the finish line for COP28, my main message is clear:
We must conclude COP28 with an ambitious outcome that demonstrates decisive action and a credible plan to keep 1.5 alive and protect those on the frontlines of the climate crisis.
We can’t keep kicking the can down the road. We are out of road – and almost out of time.
Thank you.
Question: Justin Rowlatt from the BBC here. Mr. Guterres, if we don’t get a commitment to phase out fossil fuels in this deal, does that mean this COP conference has been a failure?
Answer: Well, the COP covers many aspects and it depends on the global balance. But a central aspect, in my opinion, of the success of the COP will be for the COP to reach a consensus on the need to phase out fossil fuels in line with a time framework, that is in line with the 1.5 degree limit. That doesn't mean that all countries must phase out fossil fuels at the same time. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities applies. But it means that globally the phase out of fossil fuels needs to be compatible with net zero in 2050 and with the limit of 1.5 degrees in temperature rise.
Question: Sophie Mckoena from the SABC, South African Broadcasting Corporation. SG, the issue of the pact that you spoke about, it was difficult to get it during covid-19. Do you think this time around what you are calling for the developed countries will respond positively?
Answer: Let's be clear. One of the things that is essential is that all commitments made by developed countries need to be transparently implemented. But we will not solve the problems of equity in relation to climate only with climate finance. That is the reason why I’ve been advocating for reforms in the international financial architecture, for effective debt relief mechanisms and for, as I mentioned today, the increase of capital and the change in business models of international multilateral banks, in order to make sure that much more resources are available for developing countries, in order not only to meet their objectives in climate action – mitigation and adaptation – s but also to address the dramatic financial situation in which many of them are.
We cannot separate things. Of course, we cannot expect the COP to solve all the financial problems and developing countries in the world, but it's important that the COP gives a strong signal that those problems beyond the strict problems of climate finance, that those problems need to be addressed. Thank you very much.

Title: Op-ed: Disability Inclusion is a key area of cooperation between the UN and Bahrain
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
04 December 2023
By the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Bahrain Khaled El Mekwad


Today, around 15 per cent of the world’s population, which is more than 1 billion people, live with a form of disability. Women with disabilities are recognized to be multiply disadvantaged, experiencing exclusion on account of their gender and their disability. These are just a few facts to keep in mind as we mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on December 3rd.
Against the backdrop of 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda’s promise to leave no one behind, the UN Secretary General’s report on Disability Inclusion in the UN system noted that “persons with disabilities continue to be among those who are most excluded, including in gaining access to education, health services and employment and in participating in political decision-making”. During the global Covid-19 crisis, people with disabilities have been among the hardest hit. Around the world, the socioeconomic repercussions of the pandemic are deepening pre-existing inequalities, including those associated with disability. This backdrop makes efforts to address persistent vulnerabilities around disability all the timelier.

In 2019, the UN Secretary General launched the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy to achieve transformative and lasting change on disability inclusion. Through the strategy, the organizations of the UN system reaffirm that the full and complete realization of the human rights of all people with disabilities are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in alignment with the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030.

Bahrain was one of the first countries to sign the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 (acceded in 2011). Under the guidance of the High Commission for Disability Affairs, a range of government ministries and entities partnered with institutions and civil society organizations throughout Bahrain to address the needs of people with disabilities.

Even before signing the convention, Bahrain paid considerable attention to the issue of disability inclusion, issuing legislation, laws and decisions designed to protect the rights of people with disabilities. One such law (No. 74, 2006) provided many important guarantees for people with disabilities in the areas of care, rehabilitation and employment, and instituted a monthly disability allowance.

The UN and Bahrain have a long-standing partnership in the area of disability inclusion. UN agencies have supported the government in formulating an inclusive and integrated National Strategy for Persons with Disabilities (2012-2016). This included key pillars, such as legislation, health and rehabilitation, inclusive education, economic empowerment, social empowerment (including empowerment of women with disabilities), ease of access to facilities and services and awareness-raising and the media.

With the government having launched in 2023 the Action Plan of the National Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2022-2026), UN agencies are coming together to support the government in its implementation. In addition, the UN Country Team in Bahrain includes persons with disabilities, contributing their expertise to a range of programmes and projects geared towards the 2030 Agenda.

As we mark International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the UN looks forward to continuing to work hand in hand with the government and the people of Bahrain towards a more inclusive, accessible and sustainable world.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL - MESSAGE ON HUMAN RIGHTS DAY - 10 December 2023
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
04 December 2023
“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”

The iconic opening sentence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is as important today as it was when it was adopted 75 years ago.
The Universal Declaration is a roadmap, helping to end wars, heal divisions and promote lives of peace and dignity for all.

But the world is losing its way. Conflicts are raging. Poverty and hunger are increasing. Inequalities are deepening. The climate crisis is a human rights crisis that is hitting the most vulnerable hardest.

Authoritarianism is on the rise.

Civic space is shrinking and the media is under attack from all sides.

Gender equality remains a distant dream and women’s reproductive rights are being rolled back.

Today, it is more important than ever to promote and respect all human rights – social, cultural, economic, civil and political – which protect us all.

The Universal Declaration shows the way to common values and approaches that can help resolve tensions and create the security and stability our world craves.

As we work to update global frameworks and make them more effective in the 21st century, human rights must have a unique and central role.

I call on Member States to use this 75th anniversary, and the Summit of the Future next year, to strengthen their commitment to the timeless values of the Universal Declaration.

And on Human Rights Day, I urge people around the world to promote and respect human rights, every day, for everyone, everywhere.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- REMARKS TO WORLD CLIMATE ACTION SUMMIT COP28
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
01 December 2023


Your Highness, President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan,

I want to express my profound gratitude for the wonderful hospitality that we are enjoying in Dubai from the government and the people of the United Arab Emirates.

COP28 President Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, I want to congratulate you on the positive start to the COP with an expeditious approval of the agenda and the landmark operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund. Congratulations.

Excellencies, friends, all protocol observed.

Just days ago, I was on the melting ice of Antarctica.

Not long before, I was among the melting glaciers of Nepal.

These two spots are far in distance, but united in crisis.

Polar ice and glaciers are vanishing before our eyes, causing havoc the world over: from landslides and floods, to rising seas.

But this is just one symptom of the sickness bringing our climate to its knees.

A sickness only you, global leaders, can cure.

Excellencies,

Earth’s vital signs are failing: record emissions, ferocious fires, deadly droughts and the hottest year ever. We can guarantee it even when we’re still in November.

We are miles from the goals of the Paris Agreement – and minutes to midnight for the 1.5-degree limit.

But it is not too late.

We can - you can - prevent planetary crash and burn.

We have the technologies to avoid the worst of climate chaos – if we act now.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has charted a clear path to a 1.5-degree world.

But we need leadership – cooperation – and political will for action.

And we need it now.

It’s true. Our world is unequal and divided.

As we see in this region, conflicts are causing immense suffering and intense emotion. We just heard the news that the bombs are sounding again in Gaza.

And climate chaos is fanning the flames of injustice.

Global heating is busting budgets, ballooning food prices, upending energy markets, and feeding a cost-of-living crisis.

But climate action can flip the switch.

And renewable energy is the gift that keeps on giving.

It is good for our planet, our health, and our economies.

Cleaning our air.

Meeting the world’s growing energy demand.

Connecting millions of people to affordable electricity.

Bringing stability and security to markets.

And saving money – as renewable energy has never been cheaper.

Excellencies, friends,

The diagnosis is clear.

The success of this COP depends on the Global Stocktake prescribing a credible cure in three areas.

First, drastically cutting emissions.

Current policies would lead to an earth-scorching three-degree temperature rise.

So the Global Stocktake must set clear expectations for economy-wide Nationally Determined Contributions presented by all countries that cover all greenhouse gases, and align with the 1.5-degree limit.

The G20 – which represents 80 per cent of the world’s emissions -- must lead.

And I urge countries to speed up their net zero timelines, to get there as close as possible to 2040 in developed countries and 2050 in emerging economies.

Second, we cannot save a burning planet with a firehose of fossil fuels.

We must accelerate a just, equitable transition to renewables.

The science is clear:

The 1.5-degree limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels.

Not reduce.

Not abate.

Phaseout – with a clear timeframe aligned with 1.5 degrees.

The Global Stocktake must not only commit to that – it must also commit to triple renewables; double energy efficiency; and bring clean energy to all by 2030.

The economics are clear: the global shift to renewables is inevitable.
The only question is how much heating our planet will endure before it happens.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recommended ending our addiction to coal by 2030 in OECD countries and 2040 for the rest of the world.

At the same time, according to the International Energy Agency, the oil and gas industry accounts for just one per cent of clean energy investment.

So allow me to have a message for fossil fuel company leaders:

Your old road is rapidly aging.

Do not double-down on an obsolete business model.

Lead the transition to renewables using the resources you have available.

Make no mistake – the road to climate sustainability is also the only viable pathway to economic sustainability of your companies in the future.

I urge governments to help industry make the right choice – by regulating, legislating, putting a fair price on carbon, ending fossil fuel subsidies, and adopting a windfall tax on profits.

Excellencies,

Third, climate justice is long overdue.

Developing countries are being devastated by disasters they did not cause.

Extortionate borrowing costs are blocking their climate action plans.

And support is far too little, far too late.

The Global Stocktake must commit to a surge in finance, including for adaptation and loss and damage.

And it must support reform of the multilateral development banks to leverage far more private finance at reasonable costs for developing countries on climate action.

And developed countries must show how they will double adaptation finance to $40 billion a year by 2025 – as promised – and clarify how they deliver on the $100 billion – as promised.

Excellencies,

The climate challenge is not just another issue in your inbox.

Protecting our climate is the world’s greatest test of leadership.

And so I urge you to lead.

Humanity’s fate hangs in the balance.

Make this COP count.

Make this COP a gamechanger.

Make this COP the new hope in the future of humankind.

Thank you.

Title: Statement by the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Bahrain, Khaled El Mekwad, on Bahraini Women's Day (1 December 2023)
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
01 December 2023
On Bahraini Women's Day, I congratulate the Kingdom on its steadfast commitment to gender balance and women's empowerment.
Over this year, Bahrain has continuously progressed in the implementation of its ground-breaking National Gender Balance Model, driving national capacities and investments forward to
achieve His Royal Highness King Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa's vision for Bahrain: a nation that empowers and values the contribution of all its people - women and men, girls and boys.
The dedicated efforts of the Supreme Council for Women, under the leadership of Her Royal Highness Princess Sabeeka Bint Ibrahim Al-Khalifa, have been central to advancing gender equality and women's empowerment.
The United Nations in Bahrain is proud to partner with the Supreme Council for Women. In 2023, UN Women, the UN's principal entity for gender equality and women's empowerment, established an office in Bahrain; its first programme office in the Gulf region. The UN Country Team has been working closely with the Supreme Council for Women to support the implementation of Bahrain's national development priorities on gender balance, including championing Bahrain's lessons learned on gender-responsive development through such fora as the Princess Sabeeka Bint Ibrahim Al-Khalifa Global Award for Women's Empowerment.
This year, Bahrain has reported on its accomplishments in implementing the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Women's empowerment, full participation, and leadership in all aspects of public life are crucial accelerators for achieving the SDGs by 2030. The United Nations Country Team will continue to partner with the Kingdom of Bahrain to achieve SDG 5 and all 17 SDGs by 2030.

Date: 29 November 2023
Title: Secretary-General's press conference on UNEP Emissions Gap Report Launch
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
29 November 2023
Once again a very good morning.
I thank Inger and all her colleagues at the UN Environment Programme.
Today’s Emissions Gap report shows that if nothing changes, in 2030, emissions will be 22 Gigatonnes higher than the 1.5 degree-limit will allow.
That’s roughly the total present annual emissions of the USA, China, and the EU combined.
It shows greenhouse emissions reaching [an] all-time highs – a 1.2 per cent increase on last year – when those levels should be shooting down.
And those emissions are shattering temperature records.  June, July, August, September and October were all the hottest on record.
Present trends are racing our planet down a dead-end three-degree temperature rise.
In short, the report shows that the emissions gap is more like an emissions canyon.
A canyon littered with broken promises, broken lives, and broken records.
All of this is a failure of leadership, a betrayal of the vulnerable, and a massive missed opportunity.
Renewables have never been cheaper or more accessible.
We know it is still possible to make the 1.5 degree limit a reality.  And we know how to get there – we have roadmaps from the International Energy Agency and the IPCC.
It requires tearing out the poisoned root of the climate crisis: fossil fuels.
And it demands a just, equitable renewables transition.
Leaders must drastically up their game, now, with record ambition, record action, and record emissions reductions.
The next round of national climate plans will be pivotal.
These plans must be backed with the finance, technology, support and partnerships to make them possible.
The task of leaders at COP28 is to make sure that happens.
This COP will respond to the Global Stocktake – an inventory of country’s climate plans which will show just how far the world is from meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.
That response is vital. Voluntary initiatives and non-binding commitments can play an important role. But they are no substitute for a global response agreed by all.
The response to the Global Stocktake must light the fuse to an explosion of ambition in 2025.
It must align with what the science tells us is needed.
It must set out plans to massively increase ambition and investment in adaptation.
It must commit to a surge in finance and cooperation.
And it must set an expectation for more ambitious and detailed national climate plans.
That means national plans with clear 2030 and 2035 targets, that align with 1.5 degrees, that cover the whole economy, and that plot a course for ending fossil fuels.
These plans must provide clear market signals.
We need market forces driving down emissions.
Governments need to put in place policies and regulations to give the private sector the certainty and predictability it desperately needs.
And the Global Stocktake response must be clear that credible action from the private sector is vital.
We need companies to produce comprehensive transition plans, in line with the recommendations of the High-Level Expert Group that I have created.
No more greenwashing.  No more foot dragging.
Specifically, in their response to the Global Stocktake, countries must commit to triple renewables capacity, double energy efficiency and bring clean power to all, by 2030.
And they must also commit to phasing out fossil fuels, with a clear time frame aligned to the 1.5-degree limit.
Otherwise, we’re simply inflating the lifeboats while breaking the oars.
Achieving all this depends on countries cooperating and working together. The recent climate statement between China and the USA is a positive first step. But much more needs to be done.
And it depends on restoring trust between developed and developing countries, which has been badly damaged by broken promises and sluggish action.
Countries that have not yet done so should announce their contributions to the Green Climate Fund.
We need generous, early contributions to the new Loss and Damage Fund to get it off to a roaring start.
And I welcome the European Union’s commitment to a substantial contribution, and look forward to hearing the details.
Developed countries must honour their promise of $100 billion a year in climate finance.
And they must deliver a clear plan on how they will meet their commitment to double adaptation finance to at least US$40 billion a year by 2025.
At a time of doubt, division and distrust we need the response to the Global Stocktake to restore credibility in climate action.
Leaders can’t kick the can any further. We’re out of road.
COP28 must set us up for dramatic climate action – now.
And finally, let me add that later today, I will travel to Chile and then to Antarctica to see for myself the deadly impact of the climate crisis.
 
Scorching temperatures mean Antarctic ice is melting ever-faster, with deadly consequences for people around the world.
 
I will take my experiences to COP where I will call for action that matches the scale of the crisis we face.
And I thank you.
Question:  Thank you, on behalf of the United Nations Correspondents Association, for this press conference.  So my question on climate is how confident you are for a real concrete turning point emerging from COP28, especially from the countries with the highest emissions?  And if I may a question on the Middle East.  What is your vision for the day after in Gaza?  Thank you so much.
Secretary-General:  well, first of all in relation to COP28.  We must reverse course and as we have seen in this report, the crucial aspect is the eviction of fossil fuels.  So it is time to establish a clear phased-out with a time limit linked to the 1.5 degrees and it’s time to be determined in pursuing that phase-down policy.  And I hope that governments will understand it and I hope that there will be a clear signal from this COP that we must head in that direction.
Now you ask about the day after.  To have an after, we must have a before.  And the before obviously conditions the after and that is why I have been insisting on the need for a humanitarian ceasefire, on unrestricted access for humanitarian aid, on the liberation of hostages and on the need to end the violations of international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians.
And having said so, I think it is also important to be able to transform this tragedy into an opportunity.  And for that to be possible, it is essential that after the war we move in a determined and irreversible way to a two-state solution.  Now that means of course that after the war and this is my opinion, I believe it will be important to have a strengthened Palestinian Authority assuming responsibilities in Gaza.  I understand that the Palestinian Authority cannot come with Israeli tanks in Gaza which means that the international community needs to move into a transition period.  I do not think that a UN protectorate in Gaza is a solution.  I think we need a multi-stakeholder approach in which different countries, different entities, will cooperate.  For Israel, of course, the US is the main guarantor of its security.  For Palestinians, the neighbouring and Arab countries of the region are essential.  So everybody needs to come together to make the conditions for a transition, allowing for the Palestinian Authority, a strengthened Palestinian Authority, to assume responsibility in Gaza and then, based on that, to finally move, as I said, in a determined and irreversible way to a two-state solution based on the principles that have been largely established by the international community and which I have time and time again outlined.
Question:  thank you Secretary-General for this important briefing and the chance to ask you some questions.  I am wondering if you see the intense conflicts in the world as a distraction or an opportunity with the conference coming up?  But more specifically your calls for a ceasefire in Gaza have gone unheeded so far.  You said over the weekend you were shocked by two UN schools and shelters being attacked.  That would be a war crime, would it not?  Why not call it out?
Secretary-General:  first of all, it is clear that we have a distraction in relation to the big challenges that the international community faces in relation to climate change, in relation to  dramatic inequalities around the world, in relation to the problem of technologies that can change the world without effective regulation.
Now, I have been very clear in denouncing the violations of international humanitarian law and the violations of protection of civilians and I have not a mandate to classify the acts that are entities that are recommended.  But I think that more important than a discussion on names is the facts and let’s see the facts.  As you know, we report every year on children killed in armed conflict.  I have already presented seven reports.  In the seven reports, the highest number of children killed in one year by one actor was by the Taliban in 2017, 2018.  The second by the Syrian Government and its allies in again before 2020 and again it was around 700.  We have had Russia last year 350.  We had Saudi Arabia.  If you remember the uproar in relation to Yemen.  In one year, the maximum 300.  Now without entering into discussing the accuracy of the numbers that were published by the de facto authorities in Gaza, what is clear is that we have had in a few weeks thousands of children killed.  So this is what matters.  We are witnessing a killing of civilians that is unparalleled and unprecedented in any conflict since I am Secretary-General.
Thank you very much.

Title: António Guterres' message on the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People (observed on 29 November 2023)
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
29 November 2023
This International Day of Solidarity comes during one of the darkest chapters in the history of the Palestinian people. I am horrified by the death and destruction that have engulfed the region, which is overwhelmed with pain, anguish and heartache.
Palestinians in Gaza are suffering a humanitarian catastrophe. Almost 1.7 million people have been forced from their homes – but nowhere is safe. Meanwhile, the situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, risks boiling over.
I express my sincere condolences to the thousands of families who are mourning loved ones. This includes members of our own United Nations family killed in Gaza, representing the largest loss of personnel in the history of our organization.
I have been clear in my condemnation of the terror attacks by Hamas on 7 October. But I have also been clear that they cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
Across the region, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency is an indispensable lifeline, delivering vital support to millions of Palestinian refugees. It is more important than ever that the international community stands with UNRWA as a source of support for the Palestinian people.
Above all, this is a day for reaffirming international solidarity with the Palestinian people and their right to live in peace and dignity.
That must start with a long-term humanitarian ceasefire, unrestricted access for lifesaving aid, the release of all hostages, the protection of civilians and an end to violations of international humanitarian law. We must be united in demanding an end to the occupation and the blockade of Gaza.
It is long past time to move in a determined, irreversible way towards a two-State solution, on the basis of United Nations resolutions and international law, with Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace and security with Jerusalem as the capital of both States.
The United Nations will not waver in its commitment to the Palestinian people. Today and every day, let us stand in solidarity with the aspirations of the Palestinian people to achieve their inalienable rights and build a future of peace, justice, security and dignity for all.

Title: Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General - on the situation in the Middle East
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
27 November 2023
Seven weeks of hostilities in Gaza and Israel have taken an appalling toll that has shocked the world. For the past four days, the guns have fallen silent. We have seen the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held by Hamas and others since 7 October, and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.

The Secretary General commends the Governments of Qatar, Egypt and the United States for facilitating this arrangement and he recognizes the critical role of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The United Nations will continue to support these efforts in every possible way.

During these four days, the United Nations has scaled up the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza and sent aid to some northern areas that have been largely cut off for weeks. But this aid barely registers against the huge needs of 1.7 million displaced people. The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is getting worse by the day.

The dialogue that led to the agreement must continue, resulting in a full humanitarian ceasefire, for the benefit of the people of Gaza, Israel and the wider region. The Secretary General once again calls for the remaining hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally.

He urges all States to use their influence to end this tragic conflict and support irreversible steps towards the only sustainable future for the region: a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side, in peace and security.

Title: Op-ed from UN Climate Change Executive-Secretary, Simon Stiel
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
23 November 2023
Coal, oil, and gas are fueling the cost-of-living crisis. The COP28 Climate Conference can see a climate action surge.
Over the last couple of years inflation has caused a cost-of-living crisis across large parts of the world. Some fearmongers have used the hardship this has caused billions of people to propagate rhetoric that climate change action is unaffordable and running against the interests of ordinary people. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Propagating a Green vs. Poor narrative is divisive, and it is often used to mask short-term, profit-driven self-interest. The only stable, economically sustainable future is one of energy security, resilience to disasters, well-funded coordinated recovery from them, and ultimately a cap on temperature rise at 1.5 degrees centigrade.

Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and gas are a major driver of the cost-of-living crisis, which is stretching billions of household budgets to breaking point. Prices have swung wildly, as they frequently do, driven higher by uncertainty and conflict. In turn, this pushes up the costs of transport, food, electricity, and basic household necessities. In some heavily fossil fuel-dependent countries, household bills rose as much as US$1000 in 2022 due to fossil fuel energy costs.

Consumer costs will rise even further and economic growth will slow as climate impacts become more intense, according to economic authorities, such as the United States Treasury, the Reserve Bank of India and the European Central Bank. High energy prices also shrink profit margins for businesses and hurt economic growth. High energy prices also shrink profit margins for businesses, hurt economic growth, and impede the right to energy access across the world. Inflation hurts the poorest households the most.

This comes as climate disasters are also getting worse in every country. This year will likely be the hottest for 125,000 years. More destructive storms, unpredictable rains and floods, heatwaves, and droughts are already causing massive economic damage and affecting hundreds of millions of people across the world, costing them their lives and livelihoods.

The fossil fuel taps can’t be turned off overnight but there are a lot of opportunities for action not currently being taken. For example, in 2022, governments spent over $7 trillion in taxpayers’ money or borrowings on fossil fuel subsidies. Subsidies fail to protect the real incomes of the poorest households and divert money that are increasing developing country debt burdens, or could have been used to improve health care, build infrastructure – including renewable energy and grids – and expand social programs to alleviate poverty. Done
responsibly, a phase-out of such subsidies would actually help the poorest and improve the economies of the countries now dependent on them.

This year, at UN Climate Change, we conducted a Global Stock take on climate action up to now. It has indicated clearly that progress is too slow. But it also revealed that there are many tools we have to speed up climate action now, which will simultaneously build stronger economies. We have the knowledge and tools to accelerate this transition while ensuring it is fair and just, leaves no one behind. Billions of people need their governments to pick up this toolbox and put it to work. That includes switching billions of dollars from investments in new fossil fuel production to renewable energy that will provide stable, reliable and lower-priced energy to propel economic growth. This is about both demand and supply. Those of us that demand energy to turn our lights on need to be provided with clean options to do it, and the fiscal space to invest in our communities and their ability to adapt to the changing world.

There is cause for optimism, if governments come to this year’s climate change conference – COP28 – in Dubai with a spirit of cooperation and a laser-focus on solutions. At COP28 we can agree on tripling the world’s renewable energy capacity. We can double energy efficiency. We can show we are doubling finance to help countries adapt to climate impacts and center it in national planning. We can make the climate loss and damage fund a reality that helps deliver climate justice. And we can deliver old promises on financing the transition, and outline how we are going to fund the next steps.

One moment, one meeting, won’t change everything. But we can capture the future in the directions that we set this year, and provide the plan for how national commitments can deliver in 2025.

I refuse to let fearmongering pull a hood over my eyes, and you shouldn’t either.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  -- MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN -  25 November 2023
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
15 November 2023
Violence against women is a horrific violation of human rights, a public health crisis, and a major obstacle to sustainable development.

It is persistent, widespread – and worsening.

From sexual harassment and abuse to femicide – the violence takes many forms.

But all are rooted in structural injustice, cemented by millennia of patriarchy.

We still live in a male-dominated culture that leaves women vulnerable by denying them equality in dignity and rights.

We all pay the price: our societies are less peaceful, our economies less prosperous, our world less just.

But a different world is possible.

This year’s theme of the UNiTE campaign – “Invest to Prevent Violence against Women & Girls” – calls on all of us to take action.

Support legislation and comprehensive policies that strengthen the protection of women’s rights across the board.

Ramp up investments in prevention and support to women’s rights organization.

Listen to survivors and end impunity for perpetrators everywhere.

Stand with women activists and promote women’s leadership at every stage of decision-making.

Together, let us stand up and speak out. Let’s build a world that refuses to tolerate violence against women anywhere, in any form, once and for all.

Title: Statement by United Nations Resident Coordinator in Bahrain, Mr. Khaled Al Mekwad, on United Nations Day
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
24 October 2023

On United Nations Day, which commemorates the entry into force of the United Nations Charter 78 years ago today, we need to reflect on how peoples came together in the wake of World War II to establish this unique organization, as well as the principles of the Charter that have guided the work of the organization.
As stated by the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, the United Nations is a reflection of the world as it is – and an aspiration of the world we know it can be. Hence, United Nations Day is a reminder of our shared destiny and responsibility of scaling up our collective efforts as one humanity towards achieving peace, security, sustainable development, and human rights for all, where no one is left behind.
And amid the tragic circumstances unfolding in the Middle East, the United Nations continues against all odds to keep the flame of hope alive at all levels, sparing no effort in reminding all parties of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law and calling for a humanitarian ceasefire. Furthermore, UN Staff have been working around the clock on the ground and risking their lives to alleviate human suffering in Gaza and deliver much-needed, life-saving humanitarian assistance to the populations in need.
For the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Bahrain, UN Day is also an opportunity to reflect on the longstanding partnership with the Kingdom of Bahrain.
The recent months have been marked by a series of high-level engagements of Bahrain with the United Nations, including the Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain, the submission of Bahrain’s Voluntary National Review and the High-Level Week of the United Nations General Assembly.
The United Nations in Bahrain is proud of having contributed to the results showcased and commitments made by the Kingdom on these occasions and having secured such a high level of engagement.
Through the Strategic Cooperation Framework (SCF), the UNCT in Bahrain has worked closely with the Government to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Bahrain and remains engaged in formulating a new SCF for 2025-2029 through leveraging its collective expertise to support the people of Bahrain in achieving the SDGs and their national development aspirations, in line with Bahrain’s Vision 2030.

24 October 2023
The United Nations is a reflection of the world as it is – and an aspiration of the world we know it can be.
It is our responsibility to help build that world of peace, sustainable development and human rights for all.

I know we can do it. The Charter of the United Nations – which entered into force 78 years ago today – points the way.

Above all, it is rooted in a spirit of determination to heal divisions, repair relations, and build peace.

To expand opportunities, and leave no one behind.

To ensure justice, equality and empowerment for women and girls.

To provide life-saving relief to those in need.

And to be flexible enough to address challenges that did not even exist when the UN was born – from the existential climate crisis to the perils and promise of artificial intelligence.

The United Nations is guided by timeless values and principles, but it must never be frozen in time. That is why we must always keep strengthening ways of working and applying a 21st century lens to all we do.

On this United Nations Day, let us commit with hope and determination to build the better world of our aspirations.

Let us commit to a future that lives up to the name of our indispensable organization.

We are a divided world. We can and must be united nations.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -  MESSAGE FOR WORLD CITIES DAY  - 31 October 2023
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
23 October 2023
World Cities Day is a time to consider the pivotal role cities play in sustainable development.
Cities are engines of economic growth and innovation that hold the key to achieving the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. They are also on the frontlines of today’s complex challenges, from the climate crisis to growing inequalities and political polarization.

But local authorities are struggling with limited support and resources, while demand for infrastructure, affordable housing, efficient transport, and social services is immense and growing. This year's theme, Financing Sustainable Urban Development, is a call to action.

Governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society, must work together to mobilize finance for resilient, sustainable cities. I am a strong advocate for equitable financing solutions at the global level. These must be used, together with innovative and diverse funding sources, to strengthen local financing strategies that are climate-friendly, inclusive and equitable.

The Advisory Group on Local and Regional Governments I established recently will strengthen coordination to implement the SDGs, and make sure the voices of cities and regions are heard as we prepare for the Summit of the Future next year.

As we mark World Cities Day, let’s resolve to work together for urban areas that are not only engines of growth, but beacons of sustainability, resilience, and prosperity for all.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL - MESSAGE ON WORLD FOOD DAY   - 16 October 2023
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
08 October 2023
World Food Day 2023 comes during a global food crisis, with the world moving backwards on ending hunger and malnutrition.
Some 780 million people around the world are going hungry; almost fifty million children are at risk of death from severe wasting. Yet funding for this year’s global humanitarian appeal stands at just 32 percent.

In our world of plenty, it is outrageous that a person dies of hunger every few seconds, while the World Food Programme has been forced to cut its essential aid programmes.

In 2015, after years of progress, Governments set the goal of zero hunger by 2030.

But eight years later, the number of people suffering from hunger has increased significantly.

This crisis demands action – first and foremost from national governments, which have a responsibility to make sure their people have enough to eat.

But many governments lack the resources to do so, and so effective international solidarity is also essential.

The long-term causes of the global food crisis include conflicts, climate extremes, inequality, and economic instability.

The UN system is addressing these root causes through our support for sustainable, equitable food systems that put people over profits.
That means massively scaling up investments in resilient agriculture, and aligning them with climate action.

It means leveraging science and technology to improve the efficiency and reach of food systems.

This year’s theme for World Food Day focuses on water – a necessity for nutritious and healthy food.

The sustainable management of water for agriculture and food production is essential to end hunger, achieve the SDGs, and preserve water for future generations.

Zero hunger is achievable.

This World Food Day, I call on governments, the private sector, civil society and academia to work together;

to prioritize feeding the hungry;

to bring ending this crisis to the top of the global agenda;

and to invest in long-term solutions that provide everyone with enough to eat.

26 September 2023




The UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, condemned the attack that claimed the lives of two soldiers from Bahrain and injured several others in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He offered his condolences to the Kingdom of Bahrain and his wishes for the speedy recovery of the injured. He also expressed concern over continued military tensions at the Yemeni border and on several frontlines in Yemen over the past months that led to casualties, including civilian loss of life.
“Any renewal of offensive military escalation risks plunging Yemen back into a cycle of violence and undermines ongoing peace efforts. Continued flare-ups of fighting demonstrate the fragility of the situation in Yemen,” the Special Envoy said, “We have been in touch with all sides to urge them to exercise maximum restraint at this critical time, and to use dialogue to resolve differences and diffuse military tensions.”
Grundberg warned that “the minimum level of trust required for constructive dialogue is hard-earned, but easily lost,” and emphasized the need for decisive steps towards a sustainable nationwide ceasefire and the resumption of an inclusive political process to end the conflict.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  - MESSAGE FOR WORLD HABITAT DAY - 2 October 2023
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
24 September 2023
This year’s World Habitat Day focuses attention on ‘Resilient Urban Economies’ and the potential of cities as drivers of inclusive, green, and sustainable growth.
To fulfil this promise, cities must confront a range of challenges – from economic shocks and escalating climate emergencies to widening inequalities.

Through our Local 2030 Coalition, we are mobilizing the entire United Nations system to tackle these crises from the ground up and advance sustainable urbanization.

Local zero waste initiatives are supporting the creation of circular economies. Public efforts to expand green spaces help cool urban landscapes during heatwaves. And community action to reduce food waste and promote local production are key steps in transforming our food systems.

Building greater resilience and better protecting vulnerable populations requires far greater investments in sustainable infrastructure, early warning systems, and affordable, adequate housing for all.

At the same time, we must work to improve access to electricity, water, sanitation, transport, and other basic services – while investing in education, skills development, digital innovation, and entrepreneurship.

Local action is vital, and global cooperation indispensable.

On this World Habitat Day, let us pledge to build inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable human settlements for all people, everywhere.

10 September 2023
"UN 2.0 unlocks novel, impactful approaches and solutions for SDG progress, at a time when it is needed the most.”- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
As we approach the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, it is evident that the world is off course in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To get back on track, everyone—including the United Nations system—needs to rethink, refocus, and recharge.
In response, the Secretary-General issued his final Policy Brief on Our Common Agenda, titled “UN 2.0: Cutting-Edge Skills and Forward-Thinking Culture for UN System Impact.” UN 2.0 represents a vision for a rejuvenated United Nations system, better equipped to support member states in the twenty-first century and turbocharge progress on the SDGs.
At the core of UN 2.0 are stronger capabilities in five modern areas of expertise: a dynamic fusion of data, innovation, digital, behavioral science and strategic foresight, which we call our “quintet of change.” To foster environments where these cutting-edge skills thrive, the UN 2.0 will be rooted in a shift towards organizational cultures that put a priority on agility, learning, and creativity.

Title: The Secretary-General's Message on the International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
07 September 2023
"Air pollution knows no borders, travelling thousands of kilometres, spreading contaminates with the wind. And the climate crisis is having devastating and growing impacts on every continent on Earth"
Air pollution is a global emergency. Ninety-nine per cent of humanity breathes air laced with soot, sulphur and other toxic chemicals, with low- and middle-income countries suffering the highest exposures. Every year, seven million people die prematurely as a result, and air pollution is intimately linked to global heating.

Air pollution knows no borders, travelling thousands of kilometres, spreading contaminates with the wind. And the climate crisis is having devastating and growing impacts on every continent on Earth.

Global problems require global solutions. We must act together for clean air – the theme of this year’s International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies.

Together, we must accelerate a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuels, particularly coal, towards clean renewable energy, while ensuring that no one is left behind.

To help achieve this, I have proposed a Climate Solidarity Pact in which all big emitters make extra efforts to cut emissions, and wealthier countries mobilize financial and technical resources to support emerging economies to do so. And I have proposed an Acceleration Agenda to super-charge these efforts. I urge all countries to put both into effect.

We must also support the transition to clean cooking and electric vehicles. We must encourage walking and cycling in cities, and put in place systems to make responsible waste management second nature. And we must act on the pledge to reduce methane emissions.

Our air is a common good and a common responsibility. Let’s work together to clean it up, protect our health, and leave a healthy planet for generations to come.

Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
27 August 2023
On the International Day Against Nuclear Tests, Secretary-General Guterres highlighted the importance of ending nuclear tests for the future of humanity.
Since 1945, more than 2,000 nuclear tests have inflicted terrifying suffering on people, poisoned the air we breathe, and ravaged landscapes around the world.

On the International Day Against Nuclear Tests, the world speaks with one voice to end this destructive legacy.

This year, we face an alarming rise in global mistrust and division. At a time in which nearly 13,000 nuclear weapons are stockpiled around the world — and countries are working to improve their accuracy, reach and destructive power — this is a recipe for annihilation.

A legally binding prohibition on nuclear tests is a fundamental step in our quest for a world free of nuclear weapons. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, though not yet in force, remains a powerful testament to humanity’s will to lift the shadow of nuclear annihilation from our world, once and for all.

In the name of all victims of nuclear testing, I call on all countries that have not yet ratified the Treaty to do so immediately, without conditions.

Let’s end nuclear testing forever.

Title: Making Freedom of Religion or Belief a Lived Reality: Threats and Opportunities
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
23 August 2023
United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief Nazila Ghanea, writing for the UN Chronicle, condemns the abuse of religion or belief as a tool of discrimination, hostility and violence.
The UN Chronicle  is not an official record. It is privileged to host senior United Nations officials as well as distinguished contributors from outside the United Nations system whose views are not necessarily those of the United Nations. Similarly, the boundaries and names shown, and the designations used, in maps or articles do not necessarily imply endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.
In 2019, the United Nations General Assembly designated 22 August as the International Day Commemorating the Victims of Acts of Violence Based on Religion or Belief. On this day in 2022, one of my first public acts as Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and in partnership with the Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide, Under-Secretary-General Alice Wairimu Nderitu, was to join 54 other mandate holders in condemning the ongoing, widespread and cynical abuse of religion or belief as a tool of discrimination, hostility and violence, calling on States to redouble efforts to provide redress to victims and underlining the importance of working together with State and non-State actors to prevent such violence. We honoured the victims as well as their inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights, and committed to ensuring that no one suffer on such grounds.
In the subsequent 12 months, I have dedicated my first two thematic reports to mapping the landscape of freedom of religion or belief in the world. The first report, with international focus, was delivered to the Human Rights Council in March 2023; the second report, with national focus, will be delivered to the General Assembly in October 2023.
Landscape of freedom of religion or belief
Freedom of religion or belief, and the prohibition of discrimination based on religion or belief, are represented in the International Bill of Human Rights; the African, American, and European human rights conventions; and other standards. With due regard for the importance of treaty law, however, human rights must be practically and effectively enjoyed lest these provisions be deemed a “dead letter”.
Regrettably, in 2023—37 years after the establishment of my mandate, 42 years after the adoption of the 1981 United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, and 75 years after the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which enshrined the rights to freedom of religion or belief as well as non-discrimination on that basis, the landscape of freedom of religion or belief in the world remains very challenging.
This is perhaps most apparent in situations of armed conflict. Well-known examples of violations committed during armed conflict include the plight of the Rohingya Muslims, Christians being targeted by armed groups in parts of West Africa, and the crimes against humanity and genocide perpetrated by the Islamic State against Yazidis. Relatedly, the counter-terrorist discourses and policies that have proliferated since 2001 continue to have a chilling effect on religious or belief minorities’ abilities to manifest their beliefs, and pose a significant threat to civic space more broadly, which is of such importance in the face of the intersecting challenges humanity currently faces.
In numerous States, individuals and communities are denied their fundamental rights to their religious or belief identities from the day they are born.
Direct violence against marginalized religious or belief communities often goes hand in hand with, and is facilitated by, legally mandated discrimination at the national level and/or unchecked and widespread prejudicial and discriminatory attitudes. In numerous States, individuals and communities are denied their fundamental rights to their religious or belief identities from the day they are born. A key mechanism for this is the refusal by Governments to officially recognize religious or belief identities, which may include indigenous, non-religious beliefs and others, and the spate of individual and collective human rights violations that flow from non-recognition. These begin, in many cases, with denial of citizenship itself. Furthermore, the fundamental right to change one’s religion or belief continues to be criminalized in many contexts, with punishments which, in some cases, include the death penalty.
Law enforcement officials and public prosecutors should be the principal actors in offering protection and redress to those who are subjected to violence based on their actual or perceived religion or belief. Nonetheless, in situations where the constitutional or legal framework does not respect freedom of religion or belief, law enforcement and legal authorities are often the primary intellectual and material authors of violations of rights such as the arrest, detention and prosecution of individuals. These violations can be based on unsubstantiated allegations of national security crimes, extremism, terrorism, blasphemy or apostasy, or violations of religious dress codes or other traditions, all of which are incompatible with international human rights standards. Subsequently, individuals deprived of their liberty are particularly vulnerable to mistreatment related to their religion or belief as well as due process violations.

However, even where the legal framework itself does not criminalize particular religious or belief belonging outright, widespread prejudicial attitudes among functionaries of the State can motivate them to abandon their obligations towards those under their jurisdiction. My mandate has received credible allegations of functionaries failing to take action against, or even participating in, religiously motivated mob violence such as attacks on religious leaders, including indigenous spiritual leaders; the destruction of places of worship; and online campaigns of threats and harassment.
Criminal justice alone is not up to the task of transforming the widespread prejudices and attitudes at play. I submit that these can only be effectively addressed through engagement with freedom of religion or belief as established under international human rights law. This includes ratifying the relevant treaties and repealing unhelpful reservations, certainly, but also bringing domestic legislation into line with these standards; their promotion through dialogue and education at all levels of the State; and the involvement of civil society, the business community and religious leaders.
Violence in the name of religion or belief doesn’t stop there and can include gender-based violence, denial of sexual and reproductive rights, seeking to justify violence and discrimination against minorities, and harmful practices against girl children. States are obliged to take positive measures to address this violence at the individual and systemic levels, including through addressing the underlying attitudes that lead to violent acts.
As much as it is appropriate to condemn violence and violations around the world, 22 August also allows us a moment of introspection.
As we consider the ongoing challenges to the realization of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals, States must be clear-eyed about the obstacle that marginalization based on religion or belief represents. As we look towards the final seven years of the Agenda, and indeed beyond it, it is of fundamental importance that this marginalization be recognized, its dimensions measured and its reality addressed across all relevant Goals.
Recognizing and transforming pain
All the above-mentioned forms of violence, representing only a small portion of belief-based violations, take place in a global context of increasing polarisation, the fomentation of which is, unfortunately, often politically instrumentalized and intentional. As much as it is appropriate to condemn violence and violations around the world, 22 August also allows us a moment of introspection. All States can consider the violations suffered by those marginalized or even criminalized on the basis of religion or belief within their own countries, and extend their international and national solidarity across more religious or belief communities and traditions.
The phrase “you have to keep breaking your heart until it opens” is often attributed to Rumi, the thirteenth-century Persian poet. So many religious and belief communities have suffered, and most continue to suffer, the heartbreak of oppression or persecution; we must open our hearts and recognize the shared experience of pain to end this cycle, transform our attitudes and make human rights a lived reality.

Title: Martin Griffiths: It’s time to walk the talk on protecting humanitarian workers
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
17 August 2023
Op-ed by Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths for World Humanitarian Day.
This World Humanitarian Day, we commemorate 20 years since that murderous day when terrorists detonated a suicide bomb outside the United Nations headquarters in the Canal Hotel in Baghdad, Iraq, on 19 August 2003. As the late UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said at the time, it was one of the darkest days in the history of the United Nations. It still is.

For me, World Humanitarian Day will always be an occasion of mixed, and still raw, emotion.
Among those killed that day was Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was serving as Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General to Iraq. Sergio was my friend, and my daughter’s godfather.

Sergio was devoted to the United Nations. He joined the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in 1969 not long after leaving university, and he spent the rest of his tragically curtailed life with the UN in increasingly senior positions. I first worked with him in 1996, when he served briefly as UN Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes Region, and I served as his deputy before taking over the role. But I really got to know him when we moved to New York together in 1998 to set up the new Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) – he as the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and I, again, as his deputy.

We became close, bound together by a common passion for the realities of humanitarian dilemmas in the field and how to resolve them. Like many of our best, Sergio’s passion was grounded in a devotion to the UN Charter, a copy of which he always carried. He had a strength of world view that made his advocacy, and indeed his oratory, all the more effective. We also became close personally, and I am still proud that my daughter was his godchild. It was this synthesis of personal trust and professional partnership with Sergio that made his passing so traumatic but also so formative for me, as for so many others. His example inspires me as I now carry out the role he held all those years ago.

The suddenness and finality of Sergio’s loss shocked me deeply. It brought me abruptly face-to-face with our mortality, despite my many years of working in war zones. I grieve him to this day.
In total, 22 people were killed that day and more than 100 injured. A good number of them were UN personnel. Many of them were Iraqis. But what united them all was a mission to assist Iraq to recover and rebuild as a country.

I know what this commemoration must mean to the families, friends and colleagues of the people affected that day, and of all those people killed, injured or kidnapped in pursuit of the humanitarian cause since then. And I know what it means to the humanitarian community and the wider UN community – the loss of one of us is a loss to us all. I feel your grief and pain.

I also feel anger. Anger that those responsible for the Canal Hotel bombing, and for the majority of attacks on humanitarian workers since then – and indeed for attacks on health workers and civilians in conflict – have never been held accountable. Anger that year after year, humanitarian workers continue to be the target of intentional attacks and are being killed, injured and kidnapped in the course of their work; there were more than 400 aid worker victims last year, the majority of whom were national staff. Impunity for these crimes is a terrible scar on our collective conscience. Pious words do not make a difference, actions make a difference. It is time we walk the talk on upholding international humanitarian law and tackling impunity for violations.

But my overwhelming feeling this and every World Humanitarian Day is a deep sense of pride. Pride to have worked with people like Sergio. And pride to be part of an organization and a community that continue to dedicate their lives to helping more people than ever around the world in their time of need, despite the risks and dangers.

This World Humanitarian Day, I pay tribute to Sergio and to all those who lost their lives and were injured in the Canal Hotel bombing 20 years ago. I pay tribute to all those who have been killed, injured and kidnapped in the course of their service to the humanitarian cause. And I pay tribute to all those who continue to serve the hundreds of millions of people in need around the world, no matter who, no matter where and no matter what.

As Emergency Relief Coordinator and UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, my pledge to humanitarians on World Humanitarian Day is this: We will continue to advocate for your safety and security as you continue your vital work; we will provide systematic and predictable leadership on safe humanitarian access; we will continue to call for accountability for breaches of international humanitarian law; and we will do our best to take care of you when you need support.

We cannot bring back those taken from us. But we can honour their memories by doing everything possible to support those continuing their work.

Title: The Secretary-General's Message for International Youth Day 2023
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
10 August 2023
Every year, International Youth Day celebrates the determination, ideas and leadership of young people as we pursue a better world.

Across all of today’s challenges, young people are calling for bold and accelerated action, standing in solidarity with the most vulnerable, and designing solutions to ensure social, economic and climate justice, and peace and prosperity for all. To expand their participation, I recently launched a policy brief calling for governments to make youth participation the norm, rather than the exception, across decisions and policies around the world.

This year’s theme reminds us of the importance of ensuring young people gain and apply skills in the burgeoning green economy. From innovative sustainable technologies and renewable energy, to revolutions in transportation systems and industrial activity, young people must be equipped with skills and knowledge to shape a cleaner, greener, more climate resilient future.

Humanity depends on the boundless energy, ideas and contributions of youth everywhere. Today and every day, let’s support and stand with young people in shaping a just and sustainable world, for people and planet.

Title: State of the Climate in Asia 2022
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
01 August 2023
Extreme weather and climate change impacts are increasing in Asia, which ricocheted between droughts and floods in 2022, ruining lives and destroying livelihoods.
Melting ice and glaciers and rising sea levels threaten more socio-economic disruption in future, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organization.
Asia, the continent with the largest land mass extending to the Arctic, is warming faster than the global average. The warming trend in Asia in 1991–2022 was almost double the warming trend in the 1961–1990 period, according to the WMO State of the Climate in Asia 2022 report.
There were 81 weather, climate and water-related disasters in Asia in 2022, of which over 83% were flood and storm events. More than 5 000 people lost their lives, more than 50 million people were directly affected and there were more than US$ 36 billion in economic damages, according to the report.
The report, one of a series of WMO regional State of the Climate reports, was released during a meeting of the the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific’s (ESCAP) Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction. It is accompanied by an interactive story map with a special focus on agriculture and food security. The expected increase in the frequency and severity of extreme events over much of Asia will impact agriculture, which is central to all climate adaptation planning.

Title: The Secretary- General's Message on World Day Against Trafficking in Persons
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
30 July 2023
"We must invest much more in detection and protection. We must strengthen law enforcement to bring criminals that commodify human beings to justice. And we must do more to help survivors rebuild their lives."
Human trafficking is a heinous violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms.

It preys on vulnerability and thrives in times of conflict and instability.

Today – amidst growing inequalities, worsening climate emergencies, and record displacement – more and more people are left vulnerable to traffickers.

The majority of detected victims are women and children, many of whom suffer brutal violence, forced labour, and horrific sexual exploitation and abuse.

Yet traffickers continue to operate with impunity. Their crimes are receiving not nearly enough attention. This must change.

We must invest much more in detection and protection. We must strengthen law enforcement to bring criminals that commodify human beings to justice. And we must do more to help survivors rebuild their lives.

On this World Day against Trafficking in Persons, let us redouble our efforts to detect, protect, and support survivors and leave no trafficking victim behind.

Together, let us build a world where no one can ever be bought, sold, or exploited.

Title: The United Nations in Bahrain publishes its 2022 Country Results Report
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
26 June 2023
Manama, 26 June 2023 - The 2022 Country results report by the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Bahrain was released today. It highlights the progress made in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the Government of Bahrain and the United Nations Strategic and Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (SCF).
“The UNCT has been a key partner of Bahrain in its journey towards sustainable development, especially in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bahrain has demonstrated its commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs by establishing the “Ministry of Sustainable Development”, the first of its kind in the region, said United Nations Resident Coordinator in Bahrain Khaled El-Mekwad.
"The Country Results Report is an accountability tool for the UNCT towards the Government of Bahrain as it prepares the second Voluntary National Report for Bahrain, which will showcase Bahrain’s progress towards achieving the SDGs at the High-Level Political Forum in July 2023. The report also presents further avenues of engagement and exploring further opportunities in 2023 and beyond’, he said.
"As advocates of progress, we in the Kingdom of Bahrain firmly support the UN development system reforms led by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. These reforms pave the way for a more effective and transparent collaboration. Our collaboration with the UN Country Team is driven by our mutual goal of achieving the Economic Vision 2030, the Government of Bahrain's 2019-2022 Action Plan, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as our national objectives", said Foreign Ministry Undersecretary for Political Affairs, His Excellency Dr. Shaikh Abdulla bin Ahmed Al Khalifa.
"We are delighted to have received the United Nations Country Results Report for the year 2022, and anticipate the opportunities and prospects that may arise in 2023”, His Excellency said.

Title: Amina J. Mohammed: The Future We Want Requires More Women in Diplomacy
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
23 June 2023
The article was originally published in The UN Chronicle. The UN Chronicle is not an official record. It is privileged to host senior United Nations officials as well as distinguished contributors from outside the United Nations system whose views are not necessarily those of the United Nations. Similarly, the boundaries and names shown, and the designations used, in maps or articles do not necessarily imply endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.

On 24 June, we commemorate the International Day of Women in Diplomacy. I welcome this initiative of the United Nations General Assembly, under the leadership of the President of the seventy-sixth session of Assembly, H.E. Abdulla Shahid, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Maldives, to make women’s leadership more visible, to acknowledge the achievements of women in the diplomatic space, and to call attention to the journey we still must travel to achieve women’s full and equal participation in all areas of decision-making and political life.
Only 4 of the 850 delegates who signed the Charter of the United Nations in 1945 were women. Since then, we have seen an increase in women’s representation in diplomacy worldwide and at the United Nations, but it has not been at the speed or pace we need. In fact, far too often, decision-making spaces are void of women.
One of the greatest achievements of the United Nations and multilateralism was the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948—spearheaded by a woman, Eleanor Roosevelt—through which all nations recognized the equal rights of men and women as fundamental human rights.
Diplomacy continues to be a male bastion globally. Diplomatic powers wielded by leaders at the highest levels of the State remain mostly in the hands of men. Images of the representatives of the G7 and G20 countries remain male-dominated. All-male panels are too often the norm. Women serve as Heads of State and/or Government in only 28 countries; there are currently 16 women Heads of State (10.6 per cent of countries) and 16 women Heads of Government (8.3 per cent).1 At the ministerial level, the sphere of foreign affairs remains disproportionately dominated by men, with women ministers holding just 25 per cent of this type of portfolio.2 At the parliamentary level, women hold just 26.5 per cent of seats.
The same has been true for this very institution. As the world’s Organization, we need to do better. And that has been a rallying call for our Secretary-General for the past six years. Today, we have made laudable progress, demonstrating clearly what political will, institutional and cultural change, and special measures can achieve.
In 2020, parity was attained among all senior leaders of the United Nations for the first time in the history of the Organization. We are also at full parity and have attained greater geographic diversity among our resident coordinators. The United Nations is on track to achieve parity at all levels in entities at Headquarters in the next five years. We continue to struggle, however, with the challenges of greater inclusion in the field, particularly in peacekeeping missions, at all levels. This is where our interactions with the communities we serve are most frequent, challenges for countries are the greatest, and the need for diversity to strengthen our efforts is more critical than ever. For these reasons, we are amplifying our efforts and are determined to achieve the goals the Secretary-General has set for us.
Without the input of half the world’s population, we cannot develop policies that work for everyone.
Throughout history, women have made essential contributions to politics and international relations when they have a seat at the table. The negotiations concerning the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in the Liberian and Irish peace processes, are clear examples of the fundamental roles women have played in achieving durable success. Women’s equal participation and representation at all levels of decision-making are key to unlocking the transformational changes needed to secure a sustainable future. Women’s engagement in political processes improves such efforts: more inclusive decisions are made, different voices are heard and solutions are created. Governments function better,3 corruption decreases and peace processes improve.4 Without the input of half the world’s population, we cannot develop policies that work for everyone.
At the United Nations, we, the women working in diplomacy, along with our feminist male allies, have an opportunity to drive forward the change we need. Our Common Agenda—the Secretary-General's vision for the future of global cooperation—offers a unique chance to network inclusive multilateralism, including intergenerational voices. This is also why, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I initiated Women Rise for All—to shine a bright light on the difference women’s leadership makes, and how more inclusive governance structures and more diverse negotiating spaces lead to more effective policies and lasting change.
We need to bring change if we are to secure these benefits for us all, especially those currently left out or left behind. This will require well-calibrated measures and policies designed to support the achievement of women’s rights. It will take calling out and dismantling the structural obstacles to women’s equal participation.
When we finally achieve full and fair representation, we will be closer to an inclusive, just and prosperous society that is more peaceful, sustainable and equitable, a society that reflects our shared Sustainable Development Goals and the future we all want.

Title: The United Nations on the frontline in the fight against hate speech
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
18 June 2023
Op-ed by Ahmed Ben Lassoued,
Director, United Nations Information Centre for the Gulf Countries (UNIC Manama)
This year marks the 75th anniversary of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention of the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It is an opportunity to recall that the worst mass atrocities in history were often fueled by hate speech towards parts of the population, including vulnerable groups, leading to or reinforcing discrimination, stigma and marginalization. Moreover, we must always remember that these horrific crimes were not inevitable. Unfortunately, too often, the desperate pleas of the victims went unheard, partially because they had been dehumanized as consequence of hate speech.
Remembering the past is crucial to safeguarding the future. This is particularly relevant today as the world witnesses an alarming resurgence of xenophobia, racism, stigmatization, and intolerance in general. What's even more concerning is that new communication technologies have made the impact of hatred potentially more devastating than ever. Social media, for instance, can spread hate speech like wildfire, dividing people and threatening global peace. And let us make no mistake:  no community, country or region of the world is immune to the irrationality of hatred, including online.
The United Nations has a long history of mobilizing the world against hatred of all kinds to defend human rights and advance the rule of law. The impact of hate speech extends to various areas the UN focuses on, including protecting human rights, preventing atrocities, fostering peace, achieving gender equality, and supporting children and youth.
To tackle the growing trends of xenophobia, racism, intolerance, violent misogyny, antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred around the world, UN Secretary-General António Guterres launched in 2019 the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech. This first UN-wide initiative on hate speech is our comprehensive framework for tackling the causes and impacts of hate speech, in line with international human rights standards. Since then, United Nations country teams on the ground have been confronting hate speech by implementing education initiatives, positive speech campaigns, research to understand and address root causes, and promoting inclusion and equal rights.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 the UN Department of Global of Global Communications launched “Verified”, a global initiative aimed at combatting COVID-19 misinformation, which is often paired with fear-mongering and hateful content. "Verified" collaborates with UN agencies, influencers, civil society, businesses, media organizations and social media platforms to spread trusted and accurate information.
A significant milestone in the battle against hate speech was marked by the UN General Assembly in 2021, when it adopted a resolution promoting interreligious and intercultural dialogue and tolerance to counter hate speech. Additionally, June 18 was designated as the International Day for Countering Hate Speech.
And last but not least, the UN Secretary-General launched last week an essential policy brief on information integrity on digital platforms, calling for guardrails to address the “clear and present global threat” of online hate speech, mis- and disinformation.  Speaking at a press conference, Mr Guterres stressed the need for coordinated international action to make the digital space safer and more inclusive while vigorously protecting human rights.
These initiatives demonstrate that we are not powerless in the face of hate speech. The UN is leading the charge, but collective efforts are essential to raise awareness about the dangers of hatred and work together to prevent and eradicate it in all its forms. As we observe the International Day for Countering Hate Speech, let's renew our commitment to ending this toxic and destructive phenomenon while fostering inclusive, just, and peaceful communities that value and protect the rights and dignity of all individuals.

Title: A sustainable urban future through inclusive and effective multilateralism: takeaways from the second session of the UN-Habitat Assembly
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
13 June 2023
The second session of the UN-Habitat Assembly (UNHA2) was a major step towards advancing the achievement of the SDGs, specifically Goal 11, on creating sustainable cities and communities.
Last week, 89 ministers and deputy ministers from around the world, along with and 5,517 participants gathered in Nairobi, Kenya for the second session of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) Assembly, organised under the theme “A sustainable urban future through inclusive and effective multilateralism: achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in times of global crises.”

Thematic debates and discussions during the Assembly focused on Universal access to affordable housing, climate action, crises recovery and the need to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at local level. Delegates and high-level speakers unanimously emphasized the critical role of cities in achieving the SDGs.  A Ministerial Declaration and ten resolutions were approved during the final day of the Assembly.

The Kingdom of Bahrain’s delegation was led by H.E. Ms. Amna Ahmed Al Rumaihi, Minister of Housing and Urban Planning, accompanied by representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Bahrain Center for Strategic, International and Energy Studies, DERASAT.  Bahrain's active participation was a sign of commitment and engagement to multilateral efforts addressing critical challenges and harnessing on the opportunities offered by cities.

Furthermore, Bahrain’s participation was also marked by the adoption of
two resolutions co-sponsored by the country, respectively on "Affordable Housing for All" and "Clean Up Day", and the global launch of State of Arab Cities Report.

In the “Adequate Housing for All" resolution submitted by Bahrain, Egypt, France, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Pakistan and the United States of America, Ministers agreed to establish an intergovernmental expert group to make recommendations to accelerate progress towards the universal achievement of safe, sustainable, adequate, and affordable housing. The co-sponsored resolution also calls upon Member States to prioritize access to adequate housing including through improving data and financing, and requests UN-Habitat to provide all necessary support to advancing this agenda.

Recalling the Agenda 21 and recognizing that environmental degradation, climate change, and unsustainable development constitute some of the most pressing and serious threats to the ability of present and future generations, Member States also adopted a resolution on World Cleanup Day. Bahrain, Botswana, Estonia, and Pakistan championed the submission, acknowledging that cleanup activities across the globe mobilizing millions of volunteers, raising awareness, and working towards a waste-free environment, have proven to be an effective instrument of public engagement.
The second session of the UN-Habitat Assembly was a major step towards advancing the achievement of the SDGs, specifically Goal 11, on creating sustainable cities and communities. It demonstrated that with inclusive and effective multilateralism, the world can start emerging from multiple crises – pandemics, climate emergencies, and conflicts – and harness on the power of urbanization for sustainable development.

About the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat)

23 May 2023
Excellencies,
Halfway through the timeline of the 2030 Agenda, we are leaving more than half the world behind.
Poverty and hunger are again growing.
The climate crisis is escalating.
Conflict and persecution have forced one hundred million people from their homes.
And the economic destruction and dislocation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic was prolonged and amplified by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The cost of food, energy, and finance has risen sharply, with a devastating impact on vulnerable countries and communities. Inequalities and gender discrimination are on the rise.
The Sustainable Development Goals – our only comprehensive solution to these crises – are far off track.
We have gone into reverse on more than 30 per cent of SDG targets – including our most fundamental goals of reducing poverty and hunger.
Progress on another 50 per cent is weak and insufficient.
But it is not too late to turn the tide. And we are determined to do just that.
The SDG Stimulus, the proposed reforms of the global financial architecture, the Acceleration Agenda on climate, the Transforming Education Summit, Food Systems transformation, the Global Digital Compact, the Global Accelerator on Social Protection and Jobs, the Black Sea Initiative and the Memorandum of Understanding on promoting Russian food and fertilizers to global markets – all these initiatives are aimed at reducing poverty, inequality and hunger, and getting the 2030 Agenda back on course.
Around the world, United Nations country teams lead our efforts for sustainable, inclusive development.
They are our eyes, ears and hands, supporting governments, convening stakeholders, and striving to translate global and regional commitments on the SDGs into action.
When we started the reform process, no one foresaw that our country teams would be operating in such challenging conditions.
Despite that, four years on, the reforms have succeeded.
My report on the QCPR implementation demonstrates that.
The verdict is in: Resident Coordinators are bringing United Nations entities together in support of countries’ priorities for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
They are also working together to help address crises that cross borders.
The overwhelming majority of host governments agree.
Fully 88 per cent say that Resident Coordinators provide effective and strategic leadership in support of their national plans and priorities.
All Least Developed Countries and Landlocked Developing Countries surveyed said the UN’s activities were closely aligned with their needs and priorities.
And all small island developing states said collaboration between UN entities has improved since the reforms.
The system is data-driven – which is delivering new levels of transparency and accountability.
In Egypt, the reinvigorated role of the RC was a catalyst to mobilize UN expertise and comprehensive action to support the Egyptian Presidency of COP-27 on the climate crisis.
In Pakistan, the newly-empowered RC system coordinated across the entire UN family with the government, in response to the devastating floods that affected 33 million people.
The Cooperation Framework was the blueprint for a long-term approach to support recovery, going beyond the immediate humanitarian response to involve international financial institutions.
In Small Island Developing States, the integrated support provided by our multi-country offices is helping to address issues ranging from climate adaptation to debt distress.

Excellencies,
The transformative vision of the 2030 Agenda relies on a global partnership and unprecedented investment.
But that investment has not been forthcoming.
Many developing countries simply cannot afford to invest in the SDGs because they face a financing abyss.
The annual SDG funding gap stood at 2.5 trillion dollars before the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the OECD, it now stands at some 4.2 trillion.
Developed countries adopted expansionary fiscal and monetary policies and have now largely returned to their pre-pandemic trajectory of economic growth.
Developing countries have been hobbled by their inability to do the same. Vulnerable Middle Income countries are denied debt relief and concessional financing; and the Common Framework for Debt Treatment is not yet effectively working. If they go to the markets, developing countries may be charged interest rates up to eight times higher than their developed counterparts.
It is clear that something is seriously wrong with the rules and governance structures that produce these results.
I have therefore called for an SDG Stimulus – an emergency measure to scale up affordable long-term financing for all countries in need, by at least 500 billion dollars a year.
At the same time, we are working on long-term proposals to right the fundamental injustices and inequalities in global financial architecture which reflect the global realities of 78 years ago.
I count on your support for these proposals, and for all our efforts to accelerate the 2030 Agenda.
Excellencies,
Meanwhile, we rely on our partnerships with the governments of developing countries to get the most out of every development dollar.
And to do that, we need adequate, predictable and flexible funding for the UN development system.
I thank those Members that have maintained or increased their financial support to the UN development system.
However, the Resident Coordinator system is still chronically under-funded.
We are far from reaching the targets we committed to four years ago.
The Resident Coordinator system is the anchor for all our efforts to support countries in achieving the 2030 Agenda.
Yet, in 2022, the RC system suffered from a funding gap of 85 million US dollars.
The Joint SDG Fund is far short of the Funding Compact target of 290 million US dollars per year.
Unless Member States step up, we are effectively starving the UN development system of the support it needs to deliver for Member States.
A recruitment freeze is reducing our ability to deliver. With every month that passes, further reductions will have to be made, affecting our ability to coordinate the UN system and convene beyond it.
We have responded to the concerns of Member States. We are now turning to Member States to meet their commitments.
Let us recall we are talking about 85 million dollars – a tiny investment for the returns we are already witnessing.
Development coordination saves lives by eradicating poverty and preventing humanitarian crises.
Countries are spending more than two trillion dollars a year on military budgets.
It is simply not credible to pledge support for peace, if they are not prepared to invest a tiny fraction of this amount in sustainable development – the greatest conflict prevention tool we have.
I therefore urge Member States to reconsider my recommendation for a hybrid 2.0 funding model for the UN development system.
The current funding model for the RC system is far too vulnerable to fluctuations in voluntary funding, making it unpredictable and unsustainable.
It has also failed to provide sufficient resources.
The most logical, principled solution is to fund the Resident Coordinator system with a greater share of assessed contributions under the Regular Budget of the United Nations.
Therefore, in the coming months, I intend to launch a transparent, inclusive consultation process with Member States so that all views are heard before a formal proposal is submitted to the General Assembly.
I ask you to approach these consultations with a sense of urgency, solidarity, and resolve.
We must address this unfinished business from the reforms as we head towards the SDG summit in September.
Creative new approaches have not worked.
A new funding model, with a greater share of assessed contributions through the Regular Budget, is the only sustainable, predictable, and realistic option.
Excellencies,
Together, the United Nations and countries around the world are working towards a generational shift in global development – a shift towards fairness and justice in development financing, and a dynamic in-country support system that is aligned with the needs and priorities of Member States.
The SDG Summit in September must be a moment of unity to provide a renewed impetus and accelerated action for achieving the SDGs.
It must deliver concrete progress on the means of implementation and a clear commitment to overhaul the current international financial architecture.
The next weeks and months are an important opportunity to prepare the ground.
This will be the most important initiative of the 2023 calendar.
We have made significant progress, but we still have a way to go.
Member States are our partners on this journey. We count on your continued engagement and leadership at the highest levels.
A robust resolution from the ECOSOC Operational Activities Segment would be an important first step in this direction.
Together, we can create a more sustainable and equitable future for all people, everywhere.
Thank you.

14 May 2023
Article 353 of the 1976 Penal Code been exempting rapists from prosecution if they married their victim. "This landmark legislative reform will increase the protection of the fundamental rights of women and girls in Bahrain", said Khaled El Mekwad, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Bahrain.
The United Nations in Bahrain congratulates the Kingdom of Bahrain after its House of Representatives voted, on 9 May, to remove Article 353 from the 1976 Penal Code, which had exempted rapists from prosecution if they married their victim.
This landmark legislative reform will increase the protection of the fundamental rights of women and girls in Bahrain. It represents another significant step towards achieving Bahrain’s global commitments for the Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Developments Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. The reform is also a highly positive achievement in the implementation the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).
In July, Bahrain will present its second Voluntary National Report on progress in the national implementation of Agenda 2030 to the High-Level Political Forum in New York. Last week’s legislative milestone highlights the kingdom’s leadership on gender-inclusive sustainable national development.
The United Nations in Bahrain also congratulates the Supreme Council for Women (SCW), whose coordination of the National Strategy for Bahraini Women under the leadership of Her Royal Highness Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa, Wife of His Majesty the King and SCW President, has driven momentum for sustainable development that recognizes and benefits from the full participation of women.
The United Nations remains committed to continue supporting the Kingdom of Bahrain in achieving Agenda 2030, including SDG 5.

Title: Secretary-General Launches ‘Our Common Agenda’ Policy Briefs on Delivering 2030 Agenda Promises, Strengthening Response to Global Shocks
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
09 March 2023
Today, it is for me a milestone on our road to Our Common Agenda and the Summit of the Future.
I am pleased to launch two policy briefs to inform the discussions of Member States as they prepare for the SDG [Sustainable Development Goals] Summit and the Summit of the Future.
One considers how we can take the future into account in our decision-making and deliver on our responsibilities to generations yet to be born.  The second lays out proposals to strengthen the international response to complex global shocks through an emergency platform.
These first two policy briefs start our contribution to the consideration by Member States of the decisions and changes needed to equip the multilateral system for the challenges of today and the future.  We will publish nine more [by] July.  The goal is simple:  to breathe new life into the multilateral system so that it can deliver on the promises of the United Nations Charter and the 2030 Agenda.
As our world becomes more complex, more uncertain, and more dangerous, we have an even greater responsibility to strengthen the multilateral system.  That must be the ultimate aim of the Summit of the Future.
The SDG Summit this September — the central event of 2023 — and the Summit of the Future in 2024 are key moments for us to come together around the decisions necessary to put the world back on track to a fair, inclusive, and sustainable future for all.
The SDG Summit will be the centrepiece of high-level week and of all our work in 2023.  The Summit of the Future will build upon it, fill gaps, and address the new challenges coming at us thick and fast.  Member States will decide on the scope of the Summit of the Future, and the proposals to be incorporated into the Pact for the Future.
Our policy briefs will provide ideas to address some of the challenges we face.  They will be an ambitious and interconnected package of ideas and proposals.  Each one will outline how the ideas and recommendations will contribute to achieving the SDGs.  Gender and human rights will, of course, be cross-cutting themes in all of them.
Our first policy brief covers “Thinking and Acting on Behalf of Future Generations”.  Achieving the SDGs, upholding the rights and meeting the needs of people alive today are clearly preconditions for a better future.  At the same time, we must make those decisions with an eye on the future, recognizing the rights and interests of people who are not yet born.
Most members of future generations will be born in countries that are currently low- and middle-income countries.  On our current path, they are likely to live in places that are already suffering the effects of poverty, hunger, the climate crisis, crippling debt, discrimination and inequality, including gender inequality.  Privilege and poverty both transmit powerfully across generations.  The policy brief makes it clear that a secure and equitable future starts now.
Many Member States already have dedicated national institutions on this issue.  And there are hundreds of national and international agreements and resolutions on future generations.  But we lack practical mechanisms and practical frameworks and systems to turn these commitments into reality.  Because, as the proverb says, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
If we had taken action to prevent and end greenhouse gas emissions thirty years ago, the climate crisis would be far less threatening today.  If we had taken steps to prepare for pandemics, COVID-19 would not have left chaos in its wake.  Considering the future pays off in the present.
This policy brief proposes three concrete steps at the global level, drawing inspiration from national initiatives.  First, it proposes the appointment of an envoy who will be the global voice for future generations, raising awareness about the impacts on them of the decisions we take today.  An Envoy for Future Generations could also maximize the benefits of the United Nations system’s capacity to forecast the long-term impact of current policies and activities.
Second, the brief proposes ideas to inform a political declaration defining our duties to the future.  This would be an opportunity to consolidate the commitments we have already made to future generations and to adapt these commitments to the new challenges of our era.
It could clearly define what we mean by the term “future generations”; the importance we place on their needs and interests; and their relationship to people alive today.  Such a declaration could recognize that the risks, opportunities and decisions we face have foreseeable consequences and must be managed accordingly.
It could acknowledge that the continued existence of humanity is at stake, setting out the issues that will affect future generations most, including the well-being of our planet and our climate; a stable and peaceful world; and the safe development of technology.  It could reconfirm that [we] have an obligation to future generations to meet our own needs without compromising their ability to meet theirs.
It could commit to securing the interests of future generations in all decision-making.  And it could endorse some practical steps to safeguard the interests of future generations, including a commitment to establish capacities across the United Nations system for a greater focus on the future in policymaking.  I welcome the discussions already under way on how to craft a meaningful declaration.
Third, the brief proposes a dedicated intergovernmental forum.  This would be a space where Member States could advance the commitments in the declaration and share experiences and innovations.  It would provide an opportunity for intergenerational thinking and the expression of intergenerational solidarity.  The brief therefore recommends the establishment of a Commission on Future Generations as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly.
Today’s second policy brief concerns strengthening the international response to complex global shocks through an emergency platform.  Such a platform would consist of a set of protocols around convening key actors in the event of complex, global shocks, and operationalizing their coordinated response.  It would not be a standing entity or body.
Our global interconnectedness means that shocks that occur in one country or sector can quickly have cascading consequences elsewhere, often in unforeseen ways.  Those shocks are coming at us with greater strength and frequency, with serious implications for peace and security, economic stability, and environmental sustainability.  And they can have a disproportionate impact in some areas.  Both the COVID-19 pandemic and the global cost-of-living crisis hit the poorest and most vulnerable hardest, throwing SDG progress and Agenda 2030 further off-track.
The global response to such shocks is often ad hoc, fragmented, and improvised.  We need a mechanism to tackle multidimensional threats with a multidimensional response.  This policy brief calls for a more formal, predictable, and structured approach.  An emergency platform would leverage the UN’s convening power and capacities in a timely and predictable way.
It would identify and bring together actors at the appropriate level to respond.  It would be flexible and agile, responding to different types of shocks.  Crucially, it would promote a global response based on solidarity and equity and the key principle of leaving no one behind. All people and countries hit by a shock must have access to the support they need.
Accountability would be built into the emergency platform in order to hold all parties to their concrete commitments.  While decisions would continue to lie with Member States, the emergency platform would also include private sector, civil society, and other non-State partners with an ability to contribute to the global response.
The emergency platform would not displace or duplicate the work of intergovernmental bodies, including the Security Council.  Nor would it interfere with the mandate of specialized agencies or existing mechanisms, such as the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.  It would be a tool for the multilateral system to support intergovernmental decisions and complement existing mechanisms.
The United Nations is the only organization that can bring together all stakeholders in the event of complex global shocks and have them work together to best effect.  It is time to take decisions that enable it to do so.  These recommendations are now in your hands.  I encourage you to consider them closely.  I thank all the co-facilitators for their efforts to ensure Member States can discuss and examine the ideas in these briefs in detail.
In conclusion, allow me to offer some reflections on the Preparatory Ministerial Meeting on the Summit of the Future in September.  This must be a meaningful and ambitious meeting to sustain political momentum towards the Summit.  [In addition], its fundamental objective is to agree on the scope and elements of the Summit of the Future, but in addition, this could also be a moment to agree on some concrete outcomes in areas where there is broad consensus.
These policy briefs present a series of ideas to serve as inspiration and to provide clarity to facilitate the choices that are in the hands of Member States.  I stand ready to support your decisions on the ministerial meeting and a meaningful Summit of the Future, building on the SDG Summit.
I look forward to engaging with you further on the many proposals and issues in these two policy briefs, and especially to hear your views, your opinions, your comments, in order for us to be able to be more effective in the way we support the discussion among Member States preparing the decisions Member States must take in the Summit of the Future.  Thank you.

Title: IOM Bahrain Organizes Regional Workshop on Legal Identity, Border Security and Safe Mobility
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
17 January 2023
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the Kingdom of Bahrain, in cooperation with the Naif Arab University of Security Sciences (NAUSS), today organized an Arab-region workshop on Legal Identity, Border Security and Safe Mobility.
This workshop follows a new project recently signed between IOM and NAUSS, which is aimed at establishing the region’s first Arab Centre for Technical Cooperation on Migration and Border Management and sets out a comprehensive framework to strengthen technical, legal, operational and policy cooperation in the Arab region.
“The United Nations strategy for Legal Identity continues to guide IOM’s collaboration efforts in the Arab region, noting that identity management remains a critical component of fulfilling the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.” said Othman Belbeisi, IOM Regional Director for MENA, speaking at the workshop. “IOM’s continued commitment aims to support ongoing efforts of relevant authorities from governments of Arab States to ensure a harmonized and coordinated approach on migration and border governance, at a time when states are increasingly looking for technical advice on evidence-driven policies to effectively manage human mobility and enhance identity management.”

The workshop, hosted by the Ministry of Interior of the Kingdom of Bahrain, brought together over thirty regional government officials and focused on strengthening cooperation on border security and identity management to improve safe migration across the region. The workshop also outlined recommendations on cross border cooperation as well as measures aimed at strengthening access to legal identity, consular support and protection of migrants, and technical capacities of governments in risk analysis, including document verification and use of biometrics technologies.
Participants at the workshop represented border and immigration authorities from Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Yemen. Local and international experts from IOM, UNICEF, UNOCT, ICAO, and various Arab countries delivered presentations during the event.
The workshop also shed light on key challenges and lessons learnt, while encouraging participants to reflect and build on the recommendations back home, which is vital for enhancing national and regional cooperation on issues of migration management.

Title: Op-Ed: Transforming Education Summit – the global moment of truth
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
19 September 2022
As parents, teachers and students got ready for a return to school this autumn, few were thinking of the fact that across the world, education is in deep crisis. This is a slow and often unseen crisis, but its impacts affect us all. At the upcoming UN Summit on Transforming Education, world leaders have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take decisive action. The United Nations and the European Union now call on all member states to deliver much-needed commitments to ensure that all girls and boys can access, enjoy and benefit from a meaningful, modern, high-quality education. Their rights and our collective futures depend on it.
Education is the most powerful and transformative tool we have to empower girls and boys with hope, skills and opportunity for their future. It also paves the way for solving many of today’s global challenges. However, in many parts, poverty and inequality still have a major influence over school attendance and learning achievement. And right across the world, education systems are struggling to equip learners with the values, skills and knowledge needed to thrive in our rapidly changing world.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a pre-existing crisis and the global funding gap for education has increased significantly. Even before the pandemic, governments were spending less than half of the needed sum on education. Since then, two in three governments have cut their education budgets while some international donors have announced their intention to reduce aid to education.
Collective action on future-oriented learning and education financing is urgent, if we want to recover pandemic-related learning losses and ensure that children and young people everywhere are able to access their right to education as enshrined in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Investing in education has a transformative impact across the Sustainable Development Goals. It advances gender equality: educated girls are more likely to participate in the decisions that most affect them, to live longer, healthier lives, and to earn higher incomes. It makes a major contribution to national development: every euro spent on education can generate 10–15 euros in economic growth. And by nurturing informed, empowered citizens, it can help countries to tackle major challenges such as climate change, social breakdown, conflict, gender-based violence and more.
The European Union is significantly increasing its investment in education in partner countries. The EU will dedicate more than 10% of its international partnerships budget, representing over 6 billion euros, towards global education.
Now we need others to do likewise. The UN Secretary-General is calling on all government leaders and all actors, including private sector and civil society, as part of a global mobilisation, to make concrete commitments to increase funding for education, from all sources.
At the Transforming Education Summit, the representatives of all countries and partners face a moment of truth: now is the time to collectively fill the investment gap to tackle the global education crisis. Now is the time to invest in learning recovering and help put the SDGs back on track, thereby sowing the seeds for transformation of our education systems, so that education better prepares learners to contribute to a more inclusive, peaceful, sustainable and just future, leaving no one behind.

Title: The Secretary-General's Message for International Youth Day - 12 August
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
10 August 2022
Today, we celebrate International Youth Day, and the power of partnerships across generations.

This year’s theme — “Intergenerational Solidarity: Creating a World for All Ages” — reminds us of a basic truth: we need people of all ages, young and old alike, to join forces to build a better world for all.

Too often, ageism, bias and discrimination prevent this essential collaboration. When young people are shut out of the decisions being made about their lives, or when older people are denied a chance to be heard, we all lose.

Solidarity and collaboration are more essential than ever, as our world faces a series of challenges that threaten our collective future.

From COVID-19 to climate change, to conflicts, poverty, inequality and discrimination, we need all hands on deck to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and build the better, more peaceful future we all seek.

We need to support young people with massive investments in education and skills-building — including through next month’s Transforming Education Summit.

We also need to support gender equality and expanded opportunities for young people to participate in civic and political life.

It’s not enough to listen to young people — we need to integrate them into decision-making mechanisms at the local, national and international levels.

This is at the heart of our proposal to establish a new Youth Office at the United Nations.
And we need to ensure that older generations have access to social protection and opportunities to give back to their communities and share the decades of lived experience they have accumulated.

On this important day, let’s join hands across generations to break down barriers, and work as one to achieve a more equitable, just and inclusive world for all people.

Title: Bahrain’s Royal Humanitarian Foundation signs agreement to support earthquake relief efforts in Afghanistan
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
07 August 2022
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency announced a US$ 1 million agreement with the Royal Humanitarian Foundation (RHF), a Bahraini foundation, to support the relief efforts in earthquake-hit regions of Afghanistan.
The agreement was signed in Kabul by UNHCR Representative Leonard Zulu and the Secretary-General of RHF Dr. Mustafa Al-Sayed in the presence of UNHCR Senior Advisor and Representative to the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries Khaled Khalifa.
In this agreement, the Royal Humanitarian Foundation will support UNHCR’s relief efforts in areas of southeastern Afghanistan that were struck by a deadly earthquake in late June that killed some 800 people and injured many others – the country’s worst earthquake in 20 years.
“This generous assistance will support the most urgent needs of earthquake-affected residents in the three worst-affected districts of southeastern Afghanistan, Giyan and Bermal in Paktika Province and Spera in Khost Province, with the construction of earthquake-resistant homes, protection services, and the delivery of essential relief items,” said UNHCR Representative in Afghanistan Leonard Zulu.
The Secretary-General of the Royal Humanitarian Foundation praised UNHCR’s efforts in providing relief to vulnerable persons.
“This grant affirms the Royal Humanitarian Foundation’s commitment to supporting humanitarian efforts worldwide and our confidence in UNHCR’s global relief capacity as an agency that provides humanitarian assistance swiftly and efficiently wherever it is needed,” said Dr. Mustafa Al-Sayed.
UNHCR’s Senior Advisor and Representative to the GCC Countries, Khaled Khalifa, praised RHF’s pioneering humanitarian role, evidenced by its prompt response and readiness to provide the grant.
“The grant is yet another example of a true humanitarian partnership, ensuring timely assistance wherever it is needed,” he added. “Our partnership with the foundation plays a crucial role in assisting those in need in Afghanistan and around the world, which was made possible by the leadership of His Highness Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa.”
Over the past four decades, Afghanistan has been battered by conflicts and natural disasters that have left millions facing famine and starvation. The latest estimates indicate that some 24 million Afghans are in need of humanitarian assistance. There are around 3.5 million conflict-displaced persons in Afghanistan, as well as 1.57 million climate-displaced people, making it one of the most complex humanitarian crises in the world.

Title: Op-Ed: My Message from Hiroshima
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
07 August 2022
On Saturday, I proudly stood with Japan’s Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, and the people of Hiroshima in memory of an unprecedented catastrophe.

Seventy-seven years ago, nuclear weapons were dropped on the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Tens of thousands of women, children and men were killed in the blink of an eye, incinerated in a hellish fire. Buildings turned to dust. The cities’ beautiful rivers ran with blood.

Those who survived were cursed with a radioactive legacy, stalked by health problems, and subjected to lifelong stigma because of the nuclear bombing.

I had the great honour of meeting with a group of those survivors — the hibakusha, whose numbers grow smaller each year. They told me with unflinching bravery what they witnessed on that terrifying day in 1945.

It is time for world leaders to be as clear-eyed as the hibakusha and see nuclear weapons for what they are. Nuclear weapons make no sense. They cannot deliver safety, protection or security. By design, they deliver only death and destruction.

Three-quarters of a century have passed since mushroom clouds swelled above Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since then, humanity has endured a Cold War, decades of absurd brinksmanship, and several terrifying near-misses that placed humanity within minutes of annihilation.

But even during the depths of the Cold War, nuclear powers made significant reductions in their nuclear arsenals. There was widespread acceptance of the principles against the use, proliferation and testing of nuclear arms.

Today, we are in danger of forgetting the lessons of 1945.

A new arms race is picking up speed, with governments spending hundreds of billions of dollars to upgrade their stockpiles of nuclear arms. Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now held in arsenals around the world. Geopolitical crises with grave nuclear undertones are spreading fast, from the Middle East, to the Korean peninsula, to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Once again, humanity is playing with a loaded gun. We are one mistake, one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from Armageddon.

Leaders must stop knocking on doomsday’s door and take the nuclear option off the table for good.

It is unacceptable for states in possession of nuclear weapons to admit the possibility of nuclear war, which would spell the end of humanity.

By the same token, countries with nuclear weapons must commit to the “no first use” of those weapons. They must also assure States that do not have nuclear weapons that they will not use — or threaten to use — nuclear weapons against them, and be transparent throughout. Nuclear saber-rattling must stop.

In the end, there is only one solution to the nuclear threat: not to have nuclear weapons at all. This means opening every avenue of dialogue, diplomacy and negotiation to ease tensions and eliminate these deadly weapons of mass destruction.

We are seeing fresh signs of hope in New York, where the world has come together for the Tenth Review Conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Treaty is one of the main reasons why nuclear weapons have not been used since 1945. It contains legally binding commitments to achieve nuclear disarmament, and can be a powerful catalyst for disarmament — the only way to eliminate these horrendous weapons once and for all.

And in June, members of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons met for the first time to develop a roadmap towards a world free of these doomsday devices.

We can no longer accept the presence of weapons that hang by a slender thread over humanity’s future.
It is time to heed the timeless message of the hibakusha: “No more Hiroshimas! No more Nagasakis!”

It is time to proliferate peace.

Together, step by step, let’s wipe these weapons off the face of the earth.

Title: Food Safety in Bahrain: Setting the Standard for the World
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
07 June 2022
Op-Ed by the United Nations Country Team in Bahrain on the World Food Safety Day.



In December 2018, the United Nations General Assembly designated 7 June as World Food Safety Day. This decision has been made in light of the critical need to raise awareness at all levels and to promote and mobilise actions to prevent, detect and manage foodborne risks. This year's theme is: "Safer food, better health." Food, after all, is more than just what we eat. It is the foundation of our culture, economy, and relationship with the natural world. Food safety is essential to human health and well-being. It contributes to a healthy life, economy, planet, and future. On the other hand, unsafe foods cause many diseases and contribute to other health conditions, such as impaired growth, micronutrient deficiencies, communicable and non-communicable diseases, and mental illness. Globally, one in ten people is affected by foodborne diseases annually due to contaminated food products.
The Kingdom of Bahrain has a high standard of food safety management that aligns with international best practices. This performance is undoubtedly beneficial to long-term human development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), Goal 3 (Health and Well-being), and Goal 6 (Water and Sanitation). Bahrain is a regional trendsetter in food safety. In addition to developing its national policies and guidelines, it also participates in standards formulation, implementation, and evaluation in the food safety committee within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. It is also commendable that the Kingdom of Bahrain employs a multi-agency approach to food safety governance. The safety and quality of imported foods are strictly controlled. Although Bahrain does not formally apply the "One Health" approach, it applies stringent safety standards to imported livestock to protect local livestock, the environment and the citizens. This effort is being carried out in collaboration with the other GCC countries. As the country's plans for increasing local food production unfold, it is essential to enhance the food safety measures related to local production.
It is also critical that how we produce, process, market and consume our food, and dispose of our waste establishment -which we have coined 'food systems'- is sustainable[1]. When food systems function well, they deliver food security and nutrition, allowing increased accessibility, affordability of a safe food for all, for an active, healthy life.
As a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the resulting decline in the global wheat supply, 44 million people in 38 countries are suffering from emergency levels of hunger, with price increases of up to 30 per cent for staple foods threatening people in countries across Africa and the Middle East. While the Kingdom of Bahrain and other GCC countries have been the least affected by the war in Ukraine, thanks to generous government subsidies, its food security may be challenged by climate change, urbanization trends, and the vulnerability they bring to the existing food system. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the extent to which climate change affects individual regions and countries will vary over time. Moreover, different societal and environmental systems will have varied abilities to mitigate or adapt to change. As a result of its recognition of global climate change challenges, the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain has been actively engaged in consultation within the Global Food Systems Summit convened by the UN Secretary-General in September 2021, identifying food security and self-sufficiency of agricultural and fishery products as priorities for cooperation with the United Nations.
As a follow-up to last year's highly successful Global Food Systems Summit in New York, the Secretary-General has established a Food Systems Coordination Hub to bring together the UN system capacities for supporting all countries in transforming national food systems. Until September 2022, the Hub will host a series of monthly Food Systems Solutions Dialogues that will cover various areas of food systems.
Within the Strategic and Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for the period  2021-2024, the UN Country Team in Bahrain will continue to support Bahrain in developing food systems towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and to showcase Bahrain's food safety standards model at a global level.

Title: Op-Ed: The power of partnerships: Why supporting our peacekeepers matters more now than ever by Under-Secretary-General, Jean-Pierre Lacroix
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
30 May 2022
Despite our best efforts to keep personnel safe, more peacekeepers are being injured or killed in these volatile conditions. The frequency of malicious attacks against peacekeepers increased from 280 in 2020 to 463 last year. In 2021, there were 24 fatalities due to these violent acts.
Every day, United Nations peacekeepers work to protect hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people in the world’s most fragile political and security situations.

Our civilian and uniformed personnel support ceasefires, prevent and respond to violence, investigate human rights violations and abuses, and help build peace, recovery, and development in conflict-affected countries. There is no doubt that lives are saved and changed by their presence.

In South Sudan, more than 80 percent of respondents to a recent perception survey reported feeling safer due to the presence of UN peacekeepers. Communities in other conflict zones also testify about the impact of peacekeeping. During operation “Let Peace Reign” in the Central African Republic, local leaders reported that increased patrols were deterring armed groups while the provision of clean water, medical assistance, and road rehabilitation by peacekeepers had significantly improved their lives. “It prevents the enemies of peace in our region so that peace returns, allowing us to move freely,” said Iyo Feikoumon from Doyi Village.

In some peace operations, a primary task is to provide robust protection of civilians due to the nature of the threat on the ground. Our military and police personnel make every effort to carry out this mandate in challenging and, often dangerous, conditions. However, the ultimate objective is to create the conditions for political solutions and sustainable peace. That is the true measure of our success.

Achieving that outcome is becoming more difficult in an increasingly tense global political and security climate.

Conflicts are more complex and multi-layered with local tensions fueled by national, regional, and international forces acting in their own interests. An increasing number of actors are involved in violence, including criminal, terrorist, and other armed elements. It is difficult to engage with these individuals and groups, with diverse motives and objectives and often links to transnational organized crime, because they have no real interest in reaching political settlements that foster lasting peace.

We are witnessing a less united approach to conflict resolution among global powers due to widening political divisions which, in turn, takes the pressure off warring parties to end violence and make concessions. These divides are exposed in Security Council resolutions relating to peacekeeping mandates, with less unanimity in the decisions made by Member States, notably on mandate renewals, but also less support to our missions when they face challenges on the ground.

A surge in mis-and disinformation is also creating new and growing threats to the safety of UN personnel and the communities they serve. In places like Mali, Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo, fake news fuels fighting as well as hostility towards peacekeeping missions. We are experiencing an increase in attacks on our bases, ambushes of convoys, and the increased use of improvised explosive devices. In this environment, the iconic blue flag that should provide safety for peacekeepers now risks making them a target.

Despite our best efforts to keep personnel safe, more peacekeepers are being injured or killed in these volatile conditions. The frequency of malicious attacks against peacekeepers increased from 280 in 2020 to 463 last year. In 2021, there were 24 fatalities due to these violent acts.

Among those we have lost are eight peacekeepers who died when their helicopter went down in the eastern DRC in March, during a reconnaissance mission to help protect civilians. I attended a very moving memorial service alongside colleagues in Goma. We all understand that risk, and loss, are inevitable given the nature of our work, but coming together in these tragic circumstances reminds us of the immense price paid by fallen peacekeepers and their families. I want to pay tribute to them. Their sacrifice inspires us to redouble our efforts to build peace and stability.
UN peacekeeping is not alone in this endeavor. Many partners work alongside us in the cause of peace.

Among them are humanitarians who provide life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable. Strong partnerships with communities are also critical. They inspire us with their resilience and persistence in helping resolve tensions, supporting reconciliation, and building peace. Women and youth are also vital partners as powerful champions for peace as are civil society and the media who shine light on the challenges and help promote solutions. We continue to strengthen our partnerships with the 122 Member States that contribute more than 75,000 military and police personnel to our 12 peacekeeping operations. We rely on the consent and active participation of host governments as well as the strong, united support of regional and international partners to persuade parties to put aside their differences and make the necessary concessions to reach political settlements.

That is why, this year, we are marking the International Day of UN Peacekeepers under the theme “People. Peace. Progress. The Power of Partnerships”. It is a chance to thank partners for their contributions and to issue a fresh call to action in the pursuit of global peace and security.

Peacekeeping is an imperfect tool that can never meet all needs or expectations. There are times when we are prevented from, or fail to carry out our mandates, and let ourselves, and those we serve, down, including in cases of misconduct by our personnel.

When this happens, we will continue to be held accountable, to constantly interrogate our performance, and find ways to be more innovative and effective, particularly through the Action for Peacekeeping initiative, which establishes priority areas where progress is needed. This includes strengthening our capacity to advance political solutions and support sustainable peace, improving protection of civilians as well as the safety of peacekeepers, implementing the Women, Peace and Security Agenda, and rigorously evaluating our own performance.

Our goals are ambitious and not all will be achieved.

Questions may sometimes be asked about the value and impact of peacekeeping.

But if not peacekeeping, what else? Does a better solution exist today to maintain ceasefires, protect civilians, prevent chaos, and support peace efforts in the complex, conflict-affected environments where our operations are deployed?

Despite these questions, and in the face of many challenges, UN Peacekeeping will persevere alongside our partners, to be a strong force for change in a collective effort to achieve peace and progress for all peoples.

Title: Op-ed: Bahrain is progressing towards the implementation of the New Urban Agenda
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
10 May 2022
An Arabic version of this op-ed by Fernanda Leonardi, Head of the UN-Habitat Country Programme in Bahrain, was published in Al Watan on 10 May 2022.
The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) congratulates the Government of Bahrain on the presentation of its National Report before the General Assembly High-Level Meeting on the implementation of the New Urban Agenda and commends its support to a joint multilateral effort to revitalize the New Urban Agenda in order to accelerate the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the importance of urban public spaces and parks for public health. The density of urban areas did not exacerbate the COVID-19 crisis, in fact, walkable neighborhoods provided better social safety nets and liveability during the lockdown[1]. Nevertheless, urban sprawl continues to accelerate over the last decades. It threatens sustainable urban financing and biodiversity while increasing car dependency, emissions-related diseases, and traffic accidents.
The contribution of cities to the realization of the global targets on climate change is therefore essential. Cities that account for 67-76% of global energy use and for 71-76% of man-made CO2 emissions can also offer the most sustainable form of human settlement [2]. While climate impacts are mostly felt in urban communities, sustainable urbanization can provide an opportunity to advance climate-resilient development [3].
Generating specialized and cutting-edge knowledge in support of urban climate change mitigation and climate resilience has never been more critical. Cities must strive to harness the benefits of technology, and ensure that people are at the center to ensure automation, digitalization, and other structural economic changes do not lead to unemployment.
Bahrain’s commitment to the New Urban agenda is critical to the achievement of the SDGs and its own Vision 2030. Participation in the High-level meeting in New York was a valuable opportunity for Bahrain to take stock of its efforts and exchange knowledge on how to achieve more sustainable cities. There is an increased understanding amongst all sectors of government and society on the importance to look at how cities are planned and how they can be a catalyst for sustainable development.
UN-Habitat strongly advocates for resilient urban planning and design. Low-carbon plans for infrastructure and basic services are needed to promote local economic development and to protect cities from further contributing to environmental degradation. Concurrently, it is critical to pay particular attention to green spaces, water management, mobility, and energy efficiency as key pillars of sustainable urban development.
UN-Habitat has recently joined the UN family in Bahrain and stands ready to support the country to further explore opportunities to establish the linkages between urban planning and sustainability, in terms of cities as hotspots of vulnerability, but equally as well as drivers and opportunities for prosperous and sustainable urban development.
Dr. Fernanda Lonardoni is the Head of the UN-Habitat Country Programme in Bahrain.

27 January 2022
Manama, 27 January 2022 - Today, on the occasion of the annual celebration of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the humanity honours the six million Jewish men, women and children, the Roma and Sinti, and the countless other victims who perished at the hands of the Nazi regime and its collaborators.
We - the United Nations in Bahrain, the Embassy of the Republic of Germany in Manama, and the Embassy of the State of Israel in Manama - come together today to remember and promise never to forget those victims. On this occasion, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Bahrain a.i., Mohamed El Zarkani, the German Ambassador to Bahrain, Kai Boeckmann, and the Israeli Ambassador to Bahrain, Eitan Na’eh, will take part on 31 January 2022 in a virtual session with a Holocaust victim who survived 12 death camps. The testimony will be followed by a discussion. The session is organized by “Memories in the Living Room (Zikaron BaSalon)”, an Israeli program featuring testimony from Holocaust survivors.

23 January 2022
Op-ed by His Excellency Abdulla Shahid, President of the United Nations General Assembly, published during his official visit to Bahrain on 22-25 January 2022.
For the third year in a row, COVID-19 looms over our global experience. We are wearied by a virus that mocks us at every turn: receding and giving us hope one moment; resurging with a vengeance the next. The spread of the Omicron variant has been a particularly cruel blow, making its appearance close to the New Year, usually a festive time when we look to new horizons and leave the past behind. Instead, we continue to endure this tragic pandemic, as unwelcome as it is seemingly unrelenting.
Yet we are not powerless. Far from it. This year, unlike two years ago, we confront the pandemic with a veritable arsenal of vaccines at our disposal: Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, , Sinopharm, among others – all of them developed in record time, is a testament to what human ingenuity and collective can achieve.
We must now approach vaccine distribution with the same energy and commitment we brought to bear in developing them. In this task, we can turn to examples of countries that have done this at the national level, so we can emulate their success globally. That is our path out of this pandemic.
The Kingdom of Bahrain is one example of a country that has run a highly successful vaccination programme. I am currently undertaking an official visit to the country, from 22-25 January, at the invitation of its government. While here, I think it apt to highlight why its programme has been so effective, because it underscores why I have made global vaccination such an important priority for this session.
From the very beginning, Bahrain placed its trust in science and in the medical community, by deferring to the World Health Organization and approving all COVID-19 vaccines authorized by that body. It began offering shots of the vaccines it had available, to all its residents - citizens and non-citizens alike, free of charge. It has thus far approved six WHO-approved vaccines for use. Bahrain, to its credit, was the first country to approve the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for emergency use.
Its quick approval of vaccines and commitment to a speedy and comprehensive vaccine rollout ensured it achieved one of the highest vaccination rates in the region. It has now fully vaccinated two-thirds of its population and provided a booster shot to over half of them. This has helped the country maintain a manageable caseload and avert the level of tragedy that befell countries with lower vaccination rates.
Note that having sufficient stock of vaccines is not enough. That needs to be complemented by strong distribution logistics, and awareness campaigns on vaccine efficacy.  Bahrain has been highly successful on that front as well.
Bahrain’s medical community, front-line workers and supporting staff truly stepped up to the task. They helped deliver, distribute, and administer vaccines. They tended to the infected, helped them recover, and ensured that the country averted healthcare disasters. Critically, they helped assuage concerns relevant to vaccines and encouraged more of the public to get vaccinated.
While I am on this trip, I am accompanied by Ms Futoon Alammadi, a Bahraini national working in my office who was part of these efforts. She is among ‘15,811 front-line healthcare professionals and supporting staff’ who were presented with the Prince Salman Bin Hamad Medical Merit award ‘in appreciation of their tireless efforts and honourable sacrifices in combatting COVID-19 and preserving public health’.[1] I am proud to have her on my team and encourage more young people to follow her example.
What we need to do now is to emulate Bahrain’s success at a global level. We must end global vaccine disparities and distribute the many vaccines we have at our disposal to all the countries that need it. Concurrently, we must encourage increasing numbers to get vaccinated and ask for the public’s help in meeting our vaccination targets.
By doing this we can ensure that we do not endure more tragedies, more heartbreak, more exhaustion – and especially more variants that could evade existing vaccines and put us back on square one.  I will continue to make these precise arguments during the High-Level Event on vaccines that I will convene on February 25th this year.
We can only succeed with the collective support of the international community. I remain confident that we will prove equal to the challenge. We can vaccinate the world. We can defeat Covid. And we can look forward to marking the beginning of next year in a spirit of celebration, with the pandemic behind us.

Title: WHO opens country office in Bahrain
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
26 July 2021
Today, WHO officially opened a country office in Bahrain.
Located in the capital city of Manama, the new office is the 20th WHO country office to open in WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region, and the 152nd WHO country office globally.
The office will enable WHO to work on the ground with national health authorities, United Nations partners and a range of stakeholders in all sectors to foster public health collaboration at the national, regional and international levels.
Her Excellency the Minister of Health Faeqa Bint Saeed Al Saleh formally opened WHO’s new premises in Manama City in a ceremony that was attended by His Excellency the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr Abdullatif bin Rashid Alzayani, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, United Nations Resident Coordinator a.i. Dr Hashim Hussein and WHO Representative in Bahrain Dr Tasnim Atatrah, who also represented Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO's Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.
“We are pleased to have this WHO country office in our Kingdom, which is the result of mutual interests and willingness from both parties. The challenges that impact health today are unprecedented; however, I have complete faith that our capabilities to deal with these challenges are even greater through collaboration,” said Her Excellency the Minister of Health Faeqa Bint Saeed Al Saleh.
Bahrain has long been a strategic Member State and partner for WHO in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and beyond. The establishment of the WHO country office in Bahrain is the culmination of a historic and fruitful partnership between WHO and the Ministry of Health.
“The WHO country office will provide strategic, technical, policy and service delivery support to the Government in its work to advance health and well-being at the national, regional and international levels,” said WHO's Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The office will further enable WHO to support the national health authorities through on-the-ground programmatic interventions to strengthen the provision of health services, sharing best practices and lessons learned locally, regionally and globally, and collaborating with other United Nations agencies, ministries and government institutions to further the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
“Partnership for health is at the heart of WHO’s vision of Health for All by All in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Bahrain has been a key partner in the global and regional health arenas, and I am delighted that our partnership is now set to go even further,” said Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, in remarks delivered by WHO Representative in Bahrain Dr Tasnim Atatrah.
“The opening of the WHO country office further illustrates the Government of Bahrain’s continued efforts in prioritizing the health of all its people,” noted United Nations Resident Coordinator a.i. Dr Hashim Hussein. “The United Nations continues to extend its full support to the Government of Bahrain in furthering its national development priorities.”
Reaffirming WHO’s aim to provide support to Bahrain’s Ministry of Health, WHO Representative in Bahrain Dr Tasnim Atatrah commented: “WHO’s strategy for its country office in Bahrain aims to advance the health and well-being of all people based on the Organization’s global and regional strategy. This involves working closely with all national counterparts and partners, and utilizing all assets, in line with the mission outlined in "WHO's Thirteenth General Programme of Work", focusing on the priorities set for Bahrain.”
WHO’s Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean comprises 22 countries and territories, and WHO has offices in most of them: the opening of the Bahrain office brings the number of WHO country offices in the Region to 20. WHO country offices play a key role within the Organization in ensuring appropriate WHO technical cooperation with countries and leadership in the health sector. Functions of country offices include policy advice and technical support, information, public relations and advocacy, and management and administration.

Title: UNEP launches the UN Decade for Ecosystem Restoration on World Environment Day
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
05 June 2021
As the world faces the triple threat of climate change, loss of nature and pollution, there is no time to lose in addressing these critical environmental threats. Today, on World Environment Day, the United Nations Environment Programme and the Food and Agricultural Organization are launching the UN Decade for Ecosystem Restoration; a crucial decade for countries to deliver on their international environmental commitments such as the Paris Agreement. It will aim to halt the degradation of ecosystems and restore them to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Only with healthy ecosystems can we enhance people’s livelihoods, counteract climate change, and stop the collapse of biodiversity.
Back in 2019, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the UN Decade for Ecosystem Restoration following a proposal for action by over 70 countries. It will build a strong, broad-based global movement to ramp up restoration and put the world on track for a sustainable future that will include building political momentum for restoration as well as thousands of initiatives and practices on the ground such as reforestation, to re-wetting peatlands and coral rehabilitation.
The world’s ecosystems – from oceans to forests to farmlands – are being degraded, in many cases at an accelerating rate. The COVID 19 pandemic has made us realize the importance of our environment and that while causes of degradation are various and complex, one thing is clear: the massive economic growth of recent decades has come at the cost of ecological health. Unprecedented growth in the West Asia region has also put pressure on natural ecosystems. The region is extremely sensitive to changes in land use and to the impacts of climate change; some countries more than others. Some factors such as declining land cover, water scarcity and rapid population growth are contributing to and exacerbating land degradation in this arid to semi-arid region. Marine environments and specifically coral reefs are changing quicker than they can recover by themselves.
“Achieving successful ecosystem restoration at scale in the West Asia region will require deep changes to grasp the economic, social and ecological benefits. This includes adopting inclusive wealth as a more accurate measure of economic progress, creating an enabling environment for public -private partnerships, taking action on food waste, making more efficient use of agricultural land, and encouraging a shift to a more plant-based diet,” says Sami Dimassi, UNEP Regional Director and Representative for West Asia.
“The UN Decade will require action by everyone: governments, donors, institutions working on restoration, public and private institutions, civil societies local communities and youth. We already see a lot of key initiatives underway in the region which are definitely a move in the right direction and we are excited to work closely with all stakeholders to scale up restoration in the region to further boost biodiversity and mitigate against climate change” continued Sami Dimassi.

Title: Foreign Minister launches the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2021 – 2022
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
31 May 2021
His Excellency, Dr. Abdullatif Rashid Al-Zayani, Minister of Foreign Affairs, has launched the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2021 – 2022 for Bahrain at a virtual signing ceremony attended by His Excellency, Abdulla bin Faisal Al Doseri, Assistant Foreign Minister, senior government officials and heads of UN agencies in Bahrain. The Resident Coordinator a.i., Mr. Mohamed El Zarkani, signed the UNSDCF on behalf of the UN Secretary-General.
“The UN system in Bahrain expresses its deep appreciation for its continued partnership with the Government of Bahrain and its acknowledgment of the UN system’s efforts in supporting the delivery of its national development priorities. With the start of the Decade of Action, the UNSDCF comes at a transformative moment to focus together on critical areas in achieving Bahrain’s national vision of ‘…a society where justice, security, stability, and prosperity prevail’ and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” said Mr. El Zarkani.
H.E. Dr. Al-Zayani expressed his belief that the UNSDCF constitutes a valuable tool for the Kingdom's development that responds to the policy and programming priorities of national development strategies, including the Economic Vision 2030 and the Government Action Plan 2019-2022. H.E. noted that the UNSDCF will also enhance the joint vision of achieving the SDGs, and that that the close relations between the Kingdom of Bahrain and the UN continue to align these efforts with the development needs and priorities of the Kingdom, expressing his deep gratitude to the United Nations Regional Director for Arab States, the UN Resident Coordinator and  the UN heads of agencies.
H.E. Al Doseri praised the efforts of the United Nations in signing the UNSDCF and described it as an example of the constructive cooperation between the United Nations and the Kingdom of Bahrain. H.E. welcomed the new UN agencies who are joining the updated version of the UNSDCF and noted it will further support and cooperation in future joint projects. H.E. also highlighted the keenness of the Kingdom of Bahrain in its continued work with the UN.
Based on the UN General Assembly Resolution 72/279 to better position the UN’s operational activities for development, the UNSDCF is situated as the UN’s central country planning instrument in support of the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and responds to the global reform of the UN Development System. As stated by UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, “The goal of reform is a 21st century United Nations, focused more on people and less on process, more on delivery and less on bureaucracy. The true test of reform will be measured in tangible results in the lives of the people we serve – and the trust of those who support our work.”
The UNSDCF was developed through a multi-stakeholder consultative process and is informed by His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa’s Economic Vision 2030 and the Government Action Plan 2019-2022. It is an update of the Strategic Partnership Framework 2018 – 2022 and builds on the historical successes of the cooperation between the Government of Bahrain and the UN.
“With the Agenda 2030 and the SDGs at its core, the UNSDCF enables 21 UN agencies in Bahrain in implementing programmatic interventions under its four strategic priorities: 1) Environment, Energy, and Food; 2) Quality, Comprehensive Social Services; 3) Economic Diversification, Public Administration, and Resilience; and 4) Bahrain Among Nations,” stated Mr. El Zarkani.
The UNSDCF adopts strategies to support the Government of Bahrain in: 1) enhancing the implementation of strengthened policy and regulatory frameworks for the sustainable management of environmental resources and the promotion of energy efficiency and food security; 2) strengthening social sector policies and systems that will tangibly improve the delivery of quality, and comprehensive services for Bahraini citizens and residents; 3) fostering policy and regulatory reform that will build on Bahrain’s success to diversify its economy and generate employment, while strengthening the foundations for economic success with stronger rule of law and increased resilience; and 4) enhancing Bahrain’s role in international and regional partnerships for sustainable development, including peace and security initiatives, and to expanding South-South cooperation.

Title: ESCWA, the Supreme Council for Women and the Royal University for Women in Bahrain establish a Women’s Research Centre
Content: Visit our 2022 Country Results E-report website
11 February 2021
The UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), the Supreme Council for Women (SCW) and the Royal University for Women (RUW) in the Kingdom of Bahrain agreed today to establish the RUW Women’s Research Centre.
The three parties signed an agreement which outlines several priority areas for cooperation to contribute towards the development of the scientific, intellectual and cultural arenas of human sciences related to women’s issues in the region. During the first phase, they will work on the development of the guiding principles and the framework of the Centre to ensure its sustainability and resilience.
"Establishing a research centre on women studies in a renowned academic complex such as the RUW is not an easy task; however, through this partnership, we will be able to overcome all the obstacles and challenges that we might face when carrying out the tasks entrusted to this Centre,” said ESCWA Executive Secretary Rola Dashti.
The Center will contribute to enhancing knowledge about the reality of women and girls in the region at the political, economic and social levels, and will provide qualitative research to investigate the dynamics of societies to identify factors and interventions that can foster gender equality.
“Our partnership is important since the Centre will serve as a scientific knowledge hub not only for Bahrain but also for the entire Arab region, providing important studies and research that can help in empowering women in the region,” Dashti added.
Findings of the research will be used to support the current endeavours of policymakers in the region to introduce the necessary reforms at the legislative level and continue developing programmes that address the needs of women.
For her part, Secretary-General of Bahrain's Supreme Council for Women Hala Al-Ansari commended the fruitful cooperation among the three partners, which has led to the establishment of the Centre. "This new entity falls under one of the most important areas of expertise of our Council: producing studies and research to support decision makers in developing policies on women's issues," she added.
The Center will also contribute significantly to enhancing the research skills of students, researchers and other engaged persons, and will help alert them to the social and cultural biases that impact gender equality in the region.
Al-Ansari added that the Council would pay particular attention to the new Centre and would rely on it for its research. She also praised the generous support of RUW, which will be hosting it, and the technical support provided by ESCWA.
“RUW has had a long and fruitful collaboration with the SCW, which already resulted in many successful research and community projects over the last decade. We are now very excited to work in partnership with both SCW and ESCWA, which will provide the strategic vision in setting up the Women’s Research Centre”, said Chairman of RUW Board of Trustees Fahad Al Zamil, adding that RUW would strive to turn the Centre into an interdisciplinary research unit, focusing on women’s issues such as leadership, equality and representation, and to instill social consciousness about a gender just society.
“RUW is the only women’s university in Bahrain offering high quality programmes, with a vision to become the regional leader in academic excellence. We also encourage and support our faculty to conduct high impact research. This collaboration with SCW and ESCWA will add a global dimension to research related to women’s studies,” Al Zamil concluded.
The Centre will provide a venue for practical and innovative policy focused research and documentation to address the situation of women and girls in the region, while building a strong foundation for gender-based innovation and transformation.

Title: The Investment Case for Non-Communicable Diseases in the Kingdom of Bahrain

The Report on the investment case for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) was developed jointly by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Interagency Task Force (UNIATF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gulf Health Council (GHC), and the Ministry of Health in Bahrain.
The four main NCDs – cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases – cause 75% of deaths in Bahrain, and nearly one in five adults dies from NCDs before the age of 70. The premature death, morbidity and disability associated with NCDs are more than a health issue – they negatively affect socio-economic development and long-term fiscal sustainability of government and public services.
Avert 636 million BD (USD 1.7 billion) in economic output losses;The investment case for NCDs in Bahrain shows that NCDs cost the Bahrain economy 534 million BD (USD 1.4 billion), equivalent to 3.8% of its 2019 GDP, and kill around 2,000 Bahraini citizens per year. However, by investing in four cost-effective and proven policy packages, Bahrain would, over the next 15 years:
Beyond the four policy packages modelled, the investment case discusses air pollution, the food system, urban design, and implementation of other cost-effective interventions such as bans on trans fats and health taxes on sugar and other health-harming products, as well as integrated responses to NCDs and COVID-19.

Dr. Lionel Dabbadie, Senior Fisheries and Aquaculture Officer in the Subregional Office (SNG) highlighted the importance of such meeting to sustain aquatic biodiversity and ensure effective management of genetic resources for future food security and aquatic conservation in the GCC states and Yemen. He empathized that “fish production for human consumption has increased sevenfold since 1950. In 2018, we collectively consumed 20.5 kg per person and per year, reaching an all-time record of 179 million tonnes. For millions around the globe, fish is a major source of livelihood, income, nutrition and well-being. The future of this resource is thus of utmost importance to ensure our future but unfortunately, threats on its sustainability are also real”.
In 2018, the number of overexploited fish stocks continued to increase, although 78.8 percent of the volume harvested from the seas still come from sustainably exploited wild stocks. Reversing this trend by achieving sustainable fisheries is a necessity, not an aspiration, because the price of failing to do so will be unacceptable. Management is the best strategy to ensure that tomorrow, we will still be able to consume the fish we like. But developing aquaculture is another option, which has already allowed the individual consumption of aquatic products to double since 1960, while human population doubled.
However, aquaculture is still in its infancy, and a recent survey by FAO found that most farmed aquatic organisms are still highly similar to their wild relatives. The main consequence is that aquaculture has not yet lost the genetic variation present in the wild (as has occurred for terrestrial species) but also does not yet benefit from the gains of sustainable selective breeding, which can increase productivity of aquatic species by 10 percent per generation. It is important to conserve and retain genetic diversity to enable our cultured resources to adapt to new environments or to natural and human-induced impacts such as climate change or new diseases. As stated by Dr. Graham Mair, Senior Aquaculture Officer in FAO headquarters: “Implementing genetic improvement in aquaculture to develop new farmed types is a necessity that must go together with the conservation of the variability in aquatic genetic resources, to preserve the integrity of our aquatic ecosystems but also to maintain our future capacity to develop new or improved farmed strains for our own food security.”
A Global Plan of Action on aquatic genetic resources
The Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture requested FAO to develop a Global Plan of Action for AqGR (GPA) in response to the recent report on the State of the World’s Aquatic Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. This is currently being developed in response to a series of consultations with FAO Members Nations This regional workshop will ensure that the concerns and expertise of GCC states and Yemen are well taken into consideration by the GPA. The specific objectives of the workshop are to identify the key stakeholders for the information system on AqGR in the region, to evaluate and get recommendations on the Registry system for farmed types and to review the draft objectives, principles, overall structure and potential strategic priorities of the Global Plan of Action on Aquatic Genetic Resources.

Manama, Bahrain, 29 November, 2020 - The United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator in Bahrain is proud to support 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, an annual global campaign spanning two important international commemorations. The campaign, which began on November 25, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, will run up to International Human Rights Day, which falls on December 10. In solidarity with the Supreme Council for Women, and in close collaboration with UN Women, the United Nations House in Hoora will be bathed in orange light throughout the campaign.

In support of this civil society initiative, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres is urging global action through his campaign to UNiTE by 2030 to End Violence against Women. The United Nations Resident Coordinator a.i. in Bahrain, Mr. Mohamed El Zarkani, invites all people, civil society, women’s organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire United Nations family in Bahrain to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls.
Commenting on the occasion, Mr. El Zarkani, United Nations Resident Coordinator a.i. in Bahrain said, “The 16 Days of Activism Campaign coincides with Bahraini Women’s Day on December 1, spearheaded by the Supreme Council for Women under the leadership of Her Royal Highness Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa, the wife of His Majesty the King, with the theme of Bahraini Women's Day for 2020 being “Bahraini women in the diplomatic field”. The convergence of these events will be an opportunity for all Bahrainis to spark a renewed sense of urgency and bolster global action to end violence against women and girls.”
On behalf of Supreme Council for Women, H.E. Hala Al Ansari, Secretary General of the Supreme Council for Women in the Kingdom of Bahrain said “On the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Supreme Council for Women reaffirms the Kingdom of Bahrain’s efforts in the field of protecting human rights and preserving the dignity of citizens and residents in accordance with its constitutional principles and the rule of law, in addition to its commitment to international conventions and treaties on human rights, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which is reconfirmed through Bahrain's commitment to support all efforts dedicated to the issue of combating violence against women at the national and international levels.”
Also commenting was UN Women Regional Director, Ms. Susanne Mikhail who said, “Bahrain’s strategic approach to ending violence against women, including the implementation of the National Strategy to Protect Women against Domestic Violence, can produce lessons for other countries in our region and beyond. UN Women is proud to partner with the Supreme Council for Women and the UN Country Team to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment, in furtherance of Bahrain’s commitments under Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 and the 17 SDGs, the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against women, and other legal frameworks.”
Violence against women is the most pervasive breach of human rights worldwide. The Secretary-General has urged countries to prevent and redress violence against women and girls as a key part of their COVID-19 response plans. Around 135 countries have adopted measures to prevent or respond to violence against women during this global crisis. However, more needs to be done to address violence against women and girls at the local level, and to ensure adequate funding for such measures. There remains a culture of impunity around violence against women and girls, and the global pandemic is threatening to reverse progress if women cannot access the care and support they need.
The Secretary-General reiterates his call to: fund essential services on gender-based violence and women’s organizations working at the forefront; respond to the needs of survivors, including during the global pandemic; prevent gender-based violence from happening in the first place by challenging cultural and social norms, mobilization campaigns, and adopting a zero-tolerance policy; and collect data that will improve services, programmes and policies.
The United Nations Resident Coordinator in Bahrain and UN Women join the Secretary-General in his appeal for concrete, tangible and meaningful commitments during the 16 Days of Activism.

The signing ceremony was held in Bahrain Sunday and was attended by Her Royal Highness Princess Sabeeka Bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa, the President of the Bahraini Supreme Council for Women, Yannick Glemarec, UN Women Deputy Executive Director and Mohammad Naciri, UN Women Regional Director for Arab States.
The award aims to ensure the commitment of countries, official agencies and organizations through their legislative, public and private sector authorities or civil society to adopt non-discriminatory policies against women, to achieve equal opportunities between women and men in various fields and to show appreciation for institutional and individual efforts and initiatives for gender mainstreaming. The opportunity to compete for the award will be opn to public, private and civil society institutions and individuals all over the world. Details will be announced at a later date.
"The award will provide an opportunity to engage on a larger discussion on how we can all contribute, in our individual and institutional capacity to equality. It will enable us to review what works well at the global level, with the overall aim of both codifying lessons learned and disseminating the best practices identified to accelerate gender equality and women empowerment," Said Mr. Glemarac in a statement at the press conference following the signing ceremony.
During the signing ceremony, Her Royal Highness commented that the global launch of the award coincides with the 10 year anniversary of the launch of the National Edition of the Award. Her Royal Highness also mentioned that it is a privilege for the Kingdom of Bahrain to globalize this experience allowing other countries to benefit from the success the award had contributed on the national level.
“The Arab Region still has a long way to go to achieve gender equality and end gender-based discrimination. However, steps like this award, and other small and big steps taken by Arab countries to empower women and raise awareness on the importance of this empowerment make us optimistic about the future of gender equality in the region,” stated Mr. Naciri.
