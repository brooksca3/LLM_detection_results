Title: Ministry of Climate Change, Aga Khan Foundation & United Nations mark World Environment Day
Content: 06 June 2024
Event raises awareness on the need to work collectively on mitigating the effects of climate change and protect the environment in Pakistan.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, June 5th, 2024 – Today the United Nations, the Aga Khan Foundation and the Ministry of Climate Change & Environmental Coordination celebrated World Environment Day in Islamabad with an event raising awareness on how climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution are affecting Pakistan, and how people are taking action.
“Pakistan is among the countries most adversely impacted by climate change, but it is leading the way with its climate diplomacy,” said Ms. Romina Khurshid Alam, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Climate Change. “We are educating our youth on this crucial subject. We will leave no stone unturned to slow environmental degradation down and increase our ability to deal with the fallout of global warming and its impacts on clean water, health, agriculture, food systems, and energy.”
During the ceremony, Pakistan’s ‘Living Indus’ initiative officially received the World Restoration Flagship award which the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) announced in March; UNEP supports Pakistan’s National Adaptation Plan for building resilience to climate change. Living Indus is a Government-led initiative, which the UN supports, to restore the ecological health of the Indus River Basin. Moreover, the event paid tribute to 30 ‘Climate Heroes’ -- women and men who take action against the climate crisis across the country.
“Just last week, temperatures in Pakistan crossed 52 degree Celsius. We cannot turn back time, but we can take collective action to adapt to this new age of global warming,” said Mr. Mohamed Yahya, the UN Resident Coordinator in Pakistan. “Across the country, communities are already trying to cope with the impact of climate change; they combat pollution, deforestation, rapid glacial melt, floods, droughts and heatwaves. By supporting ‘Living Indus’ and a range of innovative programmes, UN agencies aim to help them protect and restore nature, biodiversity, water sources, as well as their lives and livelihoods.”
The event marked the premiere of ‘When the floods come’, a new documentary by Nyal Mueenuddin. This young Pakistani filmmaker went on a 3000km odyssey down the Indus River to capture the most intimate stories of how people’s lives are inextricably bound to climate change. The film will be screened again during a public event at PNCA this Friday.
“Communities have been experiencing firsthand the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. It is already transforming landscapes, habitats, livelihoods, and local aspirations, said Mr. Akhtar Iqbal, CEO, Aga Khan Foundation. “That said, we have witnessed how our collective actions can make a difference. We, at the Aga Khan Foundation and agencies of the Aga Khan Development Network, have been fully committed to doing our part for over 55 years and we will continue to support Pakistan to cope with the challenges ahead. We want to ensure that communities are empowered to be more resilient, have access to clean energy, adopt more sustainable natural resources management practices and contribute to large reforestation efforts. We also want to place women and young people at the centre of climate leadership and invest in their future through boosting green businesses and jobs.”
In Pakistan and all over the world, ecosystems are threatened. From forests and drylands to farmlands and lakes, natural spaces on which humanity’s existence depends are reaching a tipping point. This year, World Environment Day focuses on land restoration, halting desertification and building drought resilience under the slogan “Our land. Our future. We are #GenerationRestoration.”
Led by the UNEP, and held annually since 1973, World Environment Day has grown to be the largest global platform for environmental outreach. It is celebrated by millions of people across the world.

Islamabad, 04 June, 2024 – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan, with support from the Government of China, successfully completed the ‘Strengthening PPE-related Manufacturing Capacities in Pakistan’ project. To celebrate the occasion, a closing ceremony was held in Islamabad, which was attended by high-level officials including the Counsellor for Economic Commercial Affairs from the Government of China, Mr. Yang Guangyuan, and the Chairman of the Prime Minister Youth Programme, Mr. Rana Mashhood Ahmed Khan. Representatives from the Planning and Development Departments in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Sindh Education Foundation, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority, and Technology Upgradation and Skill Development Company, as well as selected project beneficiaries from Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, were also present at the event.
The closing ceremony highlighted the collaborative efforts between the Government of China, UNDP Pakistan, and Federal and Provincial Governments to support youth and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in pursuing employment, income generation, and business development opportunities in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab. In this regard, the project equipped 17 Common Facility Centers in the three provinces with 858 new and state-of-the-art industrial training and production equipment, which will be used by the youth workforce, as well as MSMEs to increase the supply of their products, and match the quality demands of the markets.
The initiative will benefit 10,000 young people over a period of three years with at least 50% of the beneficiaries being young women. At the newly equipped centres, trainees will gain hands-on technical skills in industrial manufacturing and production processes of Personal Protective Equipment, apparel/textiles, plastic goods, light furniture, and other commercial goods production. Additionally, MSMEs are also being offered access to the available facilities at the centres to assist in their commercial production work. Moreover, through the project's commercial production and income generation model, the centres would be able to sustain themselves in the long run.
In her speech, Ms. Van Nguyen, the Deputy Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan highlighted that the project's interventions would enhance business development opportunities for enterprises and the vulnerable youth of Pakistan, enabling them to become more resilient and economically empowered. She said that “With the right technologies and technical support provided by this project, Pakistan can leverage its labour-intensive MSMEs to produce export-quality products that are in high demand, both locally and internationally. This approach not only ensures increased productivity, but also creates employment opportunities and improves prospects of income generation for Pakistan’s youth.”
Also speaking at the occasion, Mr. Yang Guangyuan, Chief Guest and the Minister Counsellor for Economic Commercial Affairs from the Government of China said that “This project is truly small and smart. By teaching a person to fish, instead of giving him a fish, we could possibly help to feed him for a lifetime. I am delighted to know, that in the next 3 years, more than 10,000 young Pakistanis will get involved, with 50% of them being women, which will lay a solid foundation for relevant manufacturing industries in Pakistan. The future of Pakistan relies on young people. The future of Pakistan's economy relies on export-oriented industry. The project combines these ‘two futures’. We are sincerely honoured, together with our close partner UNDP, to play a role in it.”
Mr. Rana Mashhood Ahmed Khan, Chairman of Prime Ministers Youth Programme highlighted the importance of collaborative efforts in achieving sustainable development. "We believe that the holistic development of youth should be achieved through collaborative and cross-sectional approaches. Projects like this demonstrate that together, we can achieve great things. We also appreciate the support of our friends from China and UNDP in helping us build a brighter future for our youth, and look forward to continued collaboration and support in our efforts to empower the youth of Pakistan."
This project was initiated under UNDP’s Stabilization and Inclusive Development Programme (SIDP), which aims to contribute to the economic development of vulnerable groups, particularly youth, women, and people with disabilities, through skills development, access to meaningful employment and by catalyzing the MSME sector. The programme focuses on strengthening business-enabling environments by providing technical support to public institutions and the private sector for job-rich economic development. Additionally, SIDP equips vulnerable groups with the necessary skills to remove barriers to education and promote socially cohesive and resilient societies.

KARACHI, Pakistan (ILO News) – The Government of Sindh is leading efforts to consolidate and simplify labour laws and ensure they comply with International Labour Standards through social dialogue. Geir Tonstol, the International Labour Organization (ILO) Country Director for Pakistan met with Syed Murad Ali Shah, the Chief Minister of Sindh, on Friday, 31 May 2024 to update on progress.
The ILO responded to the request for technical assistance from the Government of Sindh province in drafting a Labour Code that would help to consolidate, simplify and rationalize existing labour laws, and comply with International Labour Standards through social dialogue.
Currently, 21 labour laws address different aspects of labour relations in Sindh, creating difficulties in understanding the legal framework on labour relations and its implementation for employers, workers and other stakeholders.
The Government of Sindh believes that this initiative will facilitate the understanding and implementation of the labour legislation for all parties involved. It is expected to improve the country’s image in the global market, make the legal framework more transparent and clearer for foreign partners and investors, enhance enforcement, broaden coverage and strengthen the protection of workers.
Following the request of the Government of Sindh province, the ILO helped bringing all existing labour laws into a single, modern and comprehensive Labour Code that aligns with Pakistna’s international obligations.
This effort was significantly advanced in Sindh on 27-31 May 2024, through the European Union-funded International Labour and Environment Standards in Small and Medium Enterprises project. During this period, the draft Labour Code was presented by the Department of Labour and Human Resource and the ILO to social partners and discussed with representatives of employers and workers.
The Chief Minister of Sindh met with Geir Tonstol to discuss progress on the matter. Both the Chief Minister and Mr Tonstol highlighted the strategic importance and relevance of the Labour Code as a way to provide stronger regulatory stability to Sindh’s business environment and create a good climate for investments, extending fundamental labour rights to all workers, including in the informal sector, strengthening the defence of fundamental principles at work and enhancing Pakistan’s ability to comply with the international obligations of the country, including GSP+ commitments.

IOM Chief of Mission, NCHR Chairperson, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Denmark representative, and other stakeholders pose for a photo with the reports.
Islamabad, 21 May — Supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, the National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) launched a report titled "Perilous Journeys: Unravelling Irregular Migration from Pakistan."
The report examines the landscape of irregular migration originating from Pakistan, highlighting the distinction between human trafficking and migrant smuggling, and shedding light on the drivers of migration, gaps in policy and legislation, and associated human rights abuses. According to the report, while Pakistan was not among Europe’s top ten countries for migration in 2022, it became the fifth most prominent by mid-2023, with arrivals reaching 8,778 in December. Currently, a significant portion of Pakistan’s population, particularly in urban areas, expresses a desire to leave the country.
The report identifies economic opportunity as the primary driver of migration from Pakistan, with factors such as job availability, access to education, and social networks influencing destination choices.
Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, the Chief Guest at the event, praised the report, noting that such studies are crucial for guiding efforts to curb irregular migration, a significant global issue. He emphasized that it is primarily the state's responsibility to provide an environment where citizens can envision their future in the country. However, he added that creating this environment requires the collaborative efforts of all stakeholders.
Speaking at the launch, NCHR Chairperson Rabia Javeri Agha noted the complexity of deterring irregular migration, stressing the importance of addressing its root causes. "By addressing the underlying factors driving migration and ensuring the protection of migrants’ rights, we can work towards creating a more secure and prosperous future for individuals and communities affected by irregular migration," she said.
IOM Chief of Mission, Mio Sato, remarked, "This report is not merely a diagnosis; it offers a roadmap for change. The recommendations outlined provide a blueprint for action, from establishing dedicated awareness units to fostering labor migration channels. We must work together – government, civil society, and international partners – to address the root causes of irregular migration and ensure the protection of those most vulnerable."
The report provides comprehensive operational and policy recommendations to address irregular migration, offering clear guidance on legal responsibilities. It calls for a multifaceted approach involving collaboration among government agencies, civil society organizations, and international stakeholders to ensure safe, orderly, and regular migration.

Title: Statement by Mohamed Yahya, the United Nations Resident & Humanitarian Coordinator in Pakistan, on the recent string of attacks against girls’ schools
Content: 01 June 2024
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, June 1st, 2024
The United Nations in Pakistan is deeply concerned by the recent string of attacks against girls’ schools in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Merged Districts (KPMD) and Balochistan. In just one month, four girls’ schools have been destroyed. The United Nations in Pakistan joins Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in calling for the protection of girls' right to education. We welcome the Prime Minister’s commitment to bring the culprits to justice, repair and rebuild the damaged schools, and support Pakistan’s daughters in realizing their right to quality education.
At a time when the Prime Minister has declared an education emergency, pledging to enroll 26 million out-of-school children, ensuring the safety and security of schools is paramount, especially in remote and vulnerable areas.
Inclusive education, free from fear and intimidation, is the foundation of a strong and prosperous Pakistan. The United Nations in Pakistan stands ready to support the Government in the rehabilitation and re-opening of these schools as soon as possible.

The Asia Pacific Employment and Social Outlook 2024, reveals persistent employment issues and calls for inclusive policies to avert ageing crisis.
ISLAMABAD (ILO News) - Asia-Pacific labour markets have recovered well since the global pandemic but face deep seated challenges that are being compounded by the region's rapidly ageing population according to the International Labour Organization’s Asia Pacific Employment and Social Outlook 2024.
Unemployment in the region is projected to remain roughly unchanged in 2024 and 2025, at 4.2 per cent, which corresponds to 87.8 million out of work in 2024. While the unemployment rate for the region remains below pre-pandemic levels as a whole, significant variation exists between subregions and countries. The region’s jobs gap, which shows the total unmet need for employment, amounted to 164 million in 2023. That figure includes for example women who would like to work but are unable to search for a job because of care obligations.
Persistent issues related to working poverty and informality remain, with a substantial proportion of workers still engaged in low-quality, informal employment despite decades of economic growth.  Two in three workers were in informal employment in 2023, an improvement of only 2 percentage points over the course of 10 years.
The report also highlights how the Asia-Pacific region is undergoing rapid population ageing, with the ratio of people aged 65 years and above expected to double by 2050. This demographic shift will significantly increase the economic dependency ratio, posing challenges for sustaining economic growth. East Asia is projected to see the largest demographic drag on growth of 0.3 percentage points per year; South Asia is expected to see its demographic dividend decline a lot.
Despite ageing populations, the region should be able to achieve continued income growth per capita over the coming decades if strong productivity growth can be maintained. Labour productivity in emerging economies in Asia and the Pacific stands at less than a third of that in high-income countries in many sectors, highlighting the large potential for efficiency and income gains. To realise these gains, structural barriers and a lack of training opportunities need to be overcome to allow the region’s large pool of workers who are ready to take up better jobs at higher productivity and pay to meet their potential.
Significant policy reforms and better implementation of existing standards are also needed to reduce inequalities, improve labour market prospects for older workers and ensure equitable pension systems to address the impending demographic changes.
"The Asia-Pacific region may be ageing rapidly but it is not going to run out of workers. There is however an urgent need to ensure that those looking for decent work can access the training and opportunities they need so that evolving labour market demands can be met," said Chihoko Asada-Miyakawa, ILO Assistant Director General and Regional director for Asia and the Pacific.
The report also underscores the need for robust social dialogue involving workers, employers, and governments to address these multifaceted challenges. Initiatives such as the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions are highlighted as essential steps towards advancing social justice in the region.

Saving lives under fire: Peacekeepers from Pakistan
On International Day of UN Peacekeepers, the United Nations releases a video featuring a peacekeeper from Pakistan who saved lives under fire.
ISLAMABAD, May 29th, 2024 – As the world celebrates International Day of UN Peacekeepers today, the United Nations in Pakistan has released a short video featuring the selfless actions of a peacekeeper from Pakistan, Major Furqan Niazi, who saved lives under fire while losing one his colleagues.
In January this year, an ambush on a UN vehicle transporting injured civilians to the hospital left a peacekeeper from Pakistan, Sepoy Muhammad Tariq, and several community members dead in the disputed territory of Abyei. Those who survived owe their lives to the courage and bravery of peacekeepers serving with the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), a contested border region between Sudan and South Sudan -- including Major Furqan, who was shot and injured.
“I spent nearly two months in treatment. The biggest motivating factor for me was my family, how I was going to see my daughter, wife and mother, all of my family members,” Major Furqan told the UN as he recovered at home in Islamabad. He is expected to go back to the mission next month.
“I am really excited. I am going to the place where all of this happened”, he said. “I will see that place after the storm where so many people lost their lives, I got injured, and my fellow peacekeeper lost his life. The biggest driving factor for me is to complete the mission with the people who always have my back.”
On May 29th every year, the world celebrates International Day of UN Peacekeepers and pays tribute to all those who have served to protect peace in some of the most dangerous and inhospitable places on earth.
“Peacekeepers from Pakistan are part of a long tradition of women and men who embody humanity’s highest ideal: achieving peace,” said Mohamed Yahya, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Pakistan. “At great personal risk, they protect the most vulnerable communities affected by conflict. Today we pay tribute to all of them, including Major Furqan Niazi, Sepoy Muhammad Tariq, and all their comrades who were injured or made the ultimate sacrifice to protect peace and human life.”
More than 200,000 Pakistani service women and men have served in 46 UN Missions since 1960 – including at least 160 who lost their lives.  Pakistan is currently the 5th largest contributing country to UN peacekeeping with about 4,300 military and police personnel serving in seven locations around the world.

24 May 2024, Islamabad – Funded by the German Embassy Islamabad, UNDP Pakistan implemented a project to promote access to justice mechanisms for women, girls and transgender persons in Balochistan. The project focused on strengthening linkages between the provincial government and vulnerable communities to protect socio-cultural, economic and environmental rights. Notable achievements were the drafting of the “Women’s Access to Property Bill” for the Province and establishment of gender desks in Quetta and Pishin, which processed more than 4,000 legal aid cases.
To celebrate the project’s completion, the Embassy of Germany and UNDP met with women leaders from Quetta and Pishin as well as with representatives from the Balochistan Commission on the Status of Women (BCSW), the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), the Women Development Department Balochistan, and the Social Welfare Department Balochistan.
In her opening remarks, Ms. Van Nguyen, Deputy Resident Representative of UNDP Pakistan thanked the Government of Germany for their support and applauded the determination and commitment of the women of Balochistan in leading their communities and engaging with key stakeholders to ensure gender-responsive policy making. “WAJIB supported the Provincial Multistakeholder Human Rights Coordination Network, which brought together local women leaders, human rights institutions, civil society organizations, legal experts, government line departments, and vulnerable communities to ensure gender-responsive and gender-sensitive policy making. This included developing action plans to implement existing policies and drafting new policies, for example Balochistan’s first gender-sensitive ‘Media Code of Conduct,” she added.
The opening remarks were followed by a panel discussion on the achievements. Ms. Fouzia Shaheen, Chairperson BCSW, spoke about her involvement in the process, “We have been a part of the trajectory of the project and I can very confidently say that WAJIB has created significant space and capacity for gender responsive decision making, policy and legislation development. The ‘Women’s Access to Property Bill’ in Balochistan is a point of reference.”
Farkhanda Aurangzeb, Member Balochistan NCHR, highlighted the partnership between the NCHR and WAJIB, saying that “The WAJIB not only supported the equitable inclusion of grassroots women’s voices in decision making, but also responded to emergency situations such as the 2022 catastrophic flash floods in Balochistan. This gender-sensitive response placed emphasis on ensuring women’s access to relief services, in partnership with the National Commission for Human Rights.”
German Ambassador Grannas, in his closing remarks, spoke about the strength of WAJIB, noting that “Marginalized women and men, along with their communities, persons with disabilities, those from minority groups, and transgender people were included in every consultative process. This approach ensured that all stakeholders, particularly local women and their civil-society organisations equally contributed to stabilising at-risk communities.”
UNDP’s DHL project works towards gender-equal governance at national and sub-national levels to support citizen-state dialogue and build social trust. DHL strengthens resilience in local communities, especially in vulnerable and at-risk segments of the population. This is achieved through communication, advocacy and capacity development for governments, national human rights institutions and civil-society organisations.

Title: UNIC - PRESS RELEASE : From Refugee to United Nations Chief in Pakistan
Content: 27 May 2024
Mohamed Yahya tells his story on ‘Awake at Night’
Mohamed Yahya tells his story on ‘Awake at Night’
Mohamed Yahya, the new United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator in Pakistan, is a refugee from Somalia; he and his family can't go home. He told Melissa Fleming, the UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, his story in this season’s second episode of ‘Awake At Night’, called “No place like home”.
Mohamed Yahya tells his story on ‘Awake at Night’
ISLAMABAD, May 22, 2024: A former child refugee, Mohamed Yahya knows the life-long pain of yearning for a lost home. That’s why some of his most emotional experiences with the UN have involved helping displaced people return to their towns years after they fled a brutal conflict. In his previous posting in Nigeria, he had the incredible privilege of helping whole communities return home to the north of the country, years after they had to flee from the militant group Boko Haram.
Mohamed Yahya, of Somalia, became Resident Coordinator in Pakistan in January this year; he also serves as the UN Humanitarian Coordinator. He has more than 20 years of experience in development and peacebuilding. Prior to Pakistan, he served as the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative in Nigeria.
Quotes:
“I have been displaced from my own home at the age of three or four, when we left home in Somalia. A little bit of me was, I must say, envious of them, that they're able to go back home. I always imagine how I'll feel when I go back home without fear. As a refugee, there's always a sense of something missing. Because you're deprived of going back to where you were born.”
“We at the UN are in the business of hope and selling hope. Many things concern me, including climate risk. But we signed up to this job to work for the UN, to do what we do so that we can help the world. So it can be a better place for everybody, including my own daughter.”
“I'm really excited about this new job in Pakistan. I am tasked to work across the entire UN presence and be the Humanitarian Coordinator to support Pakistan's development ambition, its acceleration to meet the SDGs, but also its ability to deal with climate induced crises such as flooding and other forms of climate-related impacts. So exciting times, I'm looking forward to that. And the UN has a huge presence in Pakistan.”

Title: Pakistan celebrates first ‘International Day of the Markhor’
Content: 27 May 2024
May 24 2024
This May 24th marks the first-ever celebration of ‘International Day of the Markhor’, proclaimed by the United Nations earlier this month
ISLAMABAD, May 24th, 2024 – Today Pakistan and the world celebrated ‘International Day of the Markhor’, Pakistan’s iconic national animal, for the first time.
On May 2nd this year, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution, sponsored by Pakistan and eight other countries, proclaiming May 24th as the International Day of the Markhor. It recognizes that preserving the Markhor, which was categorized as “near threatened” in 2014, and its natural habitat is an ecological imperative, given the animal’s role in the overall ecosystem.
“Markhors have long been Pakistan’s national treasure. Today, they have also become a world’s treasure,” said Mr. Mohamed Yahya, the UN Resident Coordinator in Pakistan. “Not only do Markhors play a crucial role in the ecosystem, but they offer a significant opportunity to bolster the economy, foster conservation efforts and promote sustainable tourism and economic growth, in line with the Government’s ‘Living Indus’ initiative which the United Nations supports.”
The Markhor population in Pakistan has kept increasing for the past ten years, reaching between 3,500 and 5,000 today thanks to the country’s proactive conservation programmes, and community engagement. Around the world, however, their numbers are declining -- there are less than 6,000 mature individuals across the planet today.
Famous for its long corkscrew-shaped horns, this iconic and ecologically significant species can be found across the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia, including in Pakistan. The greatest threats to its survival are habitat loss, illegal hunting, including poaching, and climate change.
A skilled climber, the Markhor can traverse slanted, almost vertical mountainous terrain and can be found between 600 and 3,500 meters in elevation.
The resolution invites people all over the world to celebrate that day and encourages conservation efforts, while highlighting the importance of continued international and regional cooperation.
Pakistan’s ‘Living Indus’ initiative, which aims to protect and restore the environment, was designated a ‘World Restoration Flagship’ project by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in February this year. It is led by the Government of Pakistan and supported by the United Nations.

This Media Update includes:
16 May 2024 – Quetta: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Balochistan Bar Council organized Balochistan’s first Women Lawyers Conference under the European Union (EU) funded ‘Deliver Justice Project.’ The conference focused on bringing women lawyers from all across Balochistan together so that they could learn from each others’ lived experiences and develop ideas on how to make the justice sector in Balochistan more accessible and safer for women and marginalized individuals, may they be lawyers or litigants.
Over 100 women lawyers from across Balochistan gathered to celebrate their victories, highlight their barriers, and recommend solutions for a shift to a justice sector that responds well to the needs of women and other vulnerable groups in Balochistan. For this, the conference comprised panel discussions and a design thinking group work session with broad participation.
The Women Lawyers Conference is a flagship initiative of the UNDP Pakistan Rule of Law Programme, which has previously been held three times in 2016, 2019, and 2022 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to bring together women lawyers from across the province including the merged districts.
Dr Rubaba Khan Buledi, Advisor to the Balochistan Chief Minister for Women Development, attended the event as the chief guest. Rahib Khan Buledi, Chairperson Legal Education Committee, Balochistan Bar Council, and Zulfiqar Durrani, Head of Office, UNDP Sub-Office Balochistan, also attended the conference.
In her address, Dr Buledi underlined the importance of such initiatives to improve the representation of women in the justice sector. “We appreciate the commendable efforts of the European Union and UNDP Pakistan for bringing this flagship initiative to Balochistan. And we highly appreciate the tireless work of the Balochistan Bar Council for empowering women lawyers in the province. For any society to prosper and progress, every member of that society must be given equal opportunity to grow. Today, on this historic occasion of the first-ever Women Lawyers Conference in Balochistan, I would like to reaffirm the Government of Balochistan’s commitment to creating a women-friendly and safer environment for women lawyers and litigants to ensure justice for all.”
Jeroen Willems, Head of Cooperation, Delegation of the EU in Pakistan, welcomed the participants to the conference via video message. “To come together as women lawyers in Balochistan is a milestone and it is bringing justice closer to women and actually to all people in Balochistan. This country and this province need more women like you so all the best to you!”
Van Nguyen, Deputy Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan, in her video message, stated, “At UNDP, under the EU funded ‘Deliver Justice Project,’ we are working with the justice sector in Balochistan to develop the capacity of women lawyers, equipping them with skills to represent clients and provide legal aid, especially to women and other marginalized groups.” Thanking the Balochistan Bar Council and the EU for their long-standing partnership, Van Nguyen appreciated all women lawyers who are working tirelessly to overcome structural barriers in Balochistan, “You are an agent of change and we thank you for your service!”
The ‘Deliver Justice Project’ aims to support reform processes to ensure the delivery of people-centered justice, enhance access to justice for all, particularly women and marginalized groups, and improve service delivery of the security sector in line with constitutional safeguards and international standards. Implemented in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the Merged Districts, the programme is funded by the European Union and jointly implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UN Women and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
The UNDP Rule of Law Programme is implementing a range of interventions to strengthen the security and justice sector governance in Pakistan.

16 May 2024 – Islamabad: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in close collaboration with the Embassy of Italy, the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), Government of Gilgit Baltistan and EvK2CNR Italy presented the Glaciers Inventory of Pakistan. This initiative marks a significant step forward in understanding and preserving Pakistan's invaluable glacial resources.
Participating in the launch event were Mr. Abrar Ahmed Mirza, Chief Secretary, Gilgit Baltistan and other key stakeholders from the government, the development sector and academia. The event was hosted by H.E. Madam Marilina Armellin, Ambassador of Italy, at the Italian Residence in Islamabad.
The Italian Ambassador to Pakistan, Ms. Marilina Armellin, was extremely pleased to see the project “Glaciers and Students” come to fruition. She stated: “Italy’s long-standing tradition of scientific glacier studies in Pakistan goes back to 1929 when Prof. Ardito Desio founded EvK2-CNR. Having cultivated this legacy for almost a century, EvK2-CNR has conducted, with the invaluable support of the Italian Cooperation Agency-AICS and UNDP, the remarkably important study “Glaciers Inventory of Pakistan” that we are proud to present today. The study, with its invaluable inventory of data, will undoubtedly strengthen the capacity of local institutions for future planning in the field of climate hazards mitigation. It will also help ensure food security for local communities through the conservation of water resources for agriculture. The Government of Italy will continue to support the Pakistani Government’s efforts in fighting climate change, protecting vulnerable communities and ensuring food security”.
Dr. Samuel Rizk, the Resident Representative of UNDP Pakistan, emphasized that “The development of the Glaciers Inventory of Pakistan, cataloging over 13,000 glaciers, is an important building block for informed decision-making within the government institutions ultimately supporting Pakistan to increase its preparedness for climate change-induced disasters”. He further added, “UNDP is grateful for Italy’s support to improve the management of protected areas, promote innovative and local solutions, generate livelihood opportunities and uplift the economies of local communities in Pakistan’s mountainous regions.”
Mr. Agostino Da Polenza, the President of EvK2CNR Italy presented the Glaciers Inventory of Pakistan, followed by a presentation by the Glaciers & Students Project Manager Mr. Maurizio Gallo and his team of experts. Mr. Francesco Zatta, Head of Office, Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) Islamabad affirmed that “AICS Islamabad is firmly committed to strengthening the resilience and adaptation to climate change and natural disaster management within vulnerable communities of Pakistan. Our portfolio approach is based on three pillars that aim to mitigate the impact of climate change, enhance food security, and foster economic development with a focus on job creation. In all our projects, we strive to facilitate partnership and ownership. Glaciers and Students is a virtuous example of this development approach, putting at the core of our interventions an invaluable resource such as glaciers, by fostering knowledge and optimizing their management. We will uphold our commitment by implementing a new program that recognizes the critical role of water for development in Gilgit Baltistan."
The Glaciers Inventory of Pakistan comprehensively maps and assesses the state of more than 13000 glaciers across the country, utilizing cutting-edge technology and scientific methodologies. This inventory will provide policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders with essential data to formulate evidence-based strategies for glacier conservation, water resource management, and climate adaptation.
During the launch event, attendees had the opportunity to hear about the methodology employed in the inventory, the key findings, and the implications for environmental conservation efforts in Pakistan. Participants appreciated the support of the Italian Embassy, AICS Islamabad, UNDP and EvK2CNR Italy in realizing this initiative and their commitment to safeguarding Pakistan's natural heritage for present and future generations.
About Glaciers and Students Project:
The Glaciers and Students project, funded by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) Islamabad and implemented by EvK2CNR Italy together with UNDP Pakistan in the region of Gilgit Baltistan aims to prevent risks of hydrogeological hazards in Pakistan’s mountain areas, by establishing an evidence-based assessment and monitoring system for mountain glaciers. The Glaciers Inventory of Pakistan is one of the major activities under the project. The project has developed research linkages between universities.  A dedicated training and capacity building programme will be designed for the students to ensure long term sustainability of the project.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan – 9 May 2024: The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) strongly condemns the attack on a girls’ school in Shiwah Tehsil of North Waziristan, calling it a despicable and cowardly act that could jeopardise the future of many young and talented girls.
Explosives used in the attack caused serious damage to the structure of the school, reportedly the only for girls in the area.
“While only yesterday, Prime Minister, Shahbaz Sharif, declared an education emergency in the country pledging to work towards enrolling 26m out-of-school children in the country, destruction of a girls’ school in a remote and underserved area is a heinous crime detrimental to national progress,” said Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan.
“Schools must always remain safe learning environments to protect the growth and healthy development of children, adolescents and young people,” he added.
UNICEF and other development partners to the Government of Pakistan, stand committed to uphold and deliver education as the fundamental right of all children, boys and girls, everywhere.

08 May 2024 – Islamabad: UNDP launched its latest report, titled ‘The State of Youth Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in Pakistan,’ during a high-level ceremony at Serena Hotel in Islamabad. The event was attended by the Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunications, H.E. Shaza Fatima Khawaja, the Chairman of the Prime Minister’s Youth Program, Mr. Rana Mashhood Khan, UNDP Resident Representative, Dr. Samuel Rizk, and Adviser Youth Development, Commonwealth Secretariat, Mr. Sushil Ram. The event was also attended by students, youth entrepreneurs, policymakers, and members of academia.
The report, a collaborative effort between UNDP and the Citi Foundation, in conjunction with UNDP Pakistan, the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), and the Commonwealth Secretariat, comprehensively maps the growth and evolution of Pakistan’s youth entrepreneurship ecosystem. It highlights the necessity for concerted efforts and targeted initiatives to establish a more inclusive environment for aspiring entrepreneurs in the country.
The research was conducted and analysed through Youth Co:Lab’s entrepreneurship ecosystem diagnostic framework, which consists of six domains to identify and comprehensively examine the obstacles and facilitators to establishing an inclusive entrepreneurship ecosystem.  These domains focus on Policy and Regulatory Frameworks, Human Capital and Entrepreneurship Culture, Access to Finance and Incentives, Business Development Support and Infrastructure, Access to Markets, and Innovation and Technology.
While Pakistan's youth entrepreneurship ecosystem has displayed remarkable growth and potential, there persists a need to address specific challenges encountered by young individuals. The report advocates for stronger collective efforts and targeted initiatives to establish an inclusive environment for all aspiring entrepreneurs. In this regard, Dr. Samuel Rizk, UNDP Pakistan’s Resident Representative, highlighted the report's utility and emphasized the importance of creating a gender-inclusive entrepreneurship ecosystem. He highlighted, "The report outlines simple, practical, and actionable recommendations for all stakeholders, aimed at accelerating our collective efforts to create an inclusive entrepreneurship environment for youth."
Syed Husain Quadri, Director of Resilience and Climate Action at IsDB, emphasized the significance of collaboration among key stakeholders, stating, "By strengthening collaborative efforts among these stakeholders and implementing targeted policies and programs, we can cultivate a vibrant and thriving ecosystem, which empowers the country’s youth to fulfill their entrepreneurial aspirations." Mr. Sushil Ram, Advisor on Youth Development at the Commonwealth Secretariat, echoed this sentiment, saying, "Together, in partnership with all stakeholders, we can create an enabling environment where every young person has the opportunity to unleash their entrepreneurial potential and contribute to building a brighter and more prosperous future for all."
Recognizing the report's potential to inform policy, Mr. Rana Mashhood Khan, Chairman of the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, highlighted, "This report provides us with essential building blocks through its findings and recommendations, and the next step is to actively engage in their implementation to turn aspirations into action, and rhetoric into results."
One of the key take-aways from the report is that through nurturing talent, ensuring access to resources, and addressing gender and inclusivity disparities, Pakistan can cultivate a dynamic entrepreneurial landscape that catalyzes economic advancement and societal development.

Rawalpindi, 7 May 2024 – UNESCO Islamabad, in collaboration with Fatima Jinnah Women University, convened a significant event on World Press Freedom Day (WPFD) at the university premises. Attended by over 100 participants including civil society, youth, media professionals, academia, and diplomatic missions, the event emphasized the critical role of independent environmental and scientific journalism in addressing climate change issues.
This year's WPFD theme, "A Press for the Planet: Journalism in the face of the Environmental Crisis," underscores the pivotal role media can play in combating the climate crisis, both globally and in Pakistan. The event highlighted the pressing need to bridge the gap between climate change information and journalistic reporting on environmental issues, stressing the importance of reliable, fact-based reporting in fostering societal change to fight disinformation.
Mr. Antony Kar Hung Tam, Officer in Charge of UNESCO Islamabad, emphasized, "The information ecosystem holds the key to addressing this existential crisis. In an era marked by the exponential growth of digital platforms, access to reliable information and the strengthening of independent environmental and scientific journalism have become more crucial than ever."
While discussing the need to increase climate change reporting, Prof. Dr. Uzaira Rafique, Vice Chancellor of Fatima Jinnah Women University, emphasized the necessity for credible and research-based news stories to strengthen climate change reporting in the country.
Pakistan has long grappled with the devastating impacts of climate change, with incidents such as floods affecting millions of lives. Despite governmental efforts, climate change media reporting within the country often lacks prioritization. Moreover, there exists a visible gap between the abundance of academic or scientific studies on climate change and the limited media attention it receives.
Recognizing the importance of integrating the voices of youth in climate change narratives, young scholars who recently finished their academic research on climate change reporting shared that climate change content on digital platforms is limited due to various reasons including their search algorithms and lack of consistent reporting on these issues.
The seminar engaged a diverse group of experts to explore avenues for enhancing credible and fact-based information dissemination on climate change.
Moving forward, UNESCO reaffirms its commitment to safeguard the safety of journalists, and support access to information to ensure that free and pluralistic information can help citizens in protecting democracies and our planet.

Lahore, May 2, 2024: The Punjab Public Prosecution Department convened the 17th meeting of the Pakistan Prosecution Forum (PPF) from 2 - 3 May, 2024, in Lahore. This high-level meeting, funded by the U.S. Embassy’s Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) and facilitated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), is a crucial step toward promoting legislative and policy reforms in Pakistan's criminal justice system. Senior officials from prosecution and criminal justice stakeholders from Punjab and other provinces across Pakistan deliberated to advance critical rule of law reforms by sharing of experiences and discussing solutions for the common challenges they face.
The forum was graced by the Honorable Justice (R) Khalil Ur Rehman Ramday, as the Chief Guest, who in her inaugural speech applauded this established platform, stating, "I am honored to preside over the Pakistan Prosecution Forum, which plays a crucial role in shaping our nation's legal landscape. Together, we will continue our journey towards a fairer and more equitable justice system inclusive of the gender specific needs of our communities." Honorable Justice further apprised that Government of Punjab is committed to reform the current Criminal Justice System for our posterity while ensuring “Rule of Law” in the Province.
The PPF is a prominent national forum consisting of each provincial prosecution department’s leadership. It has representation from all provinces and the federal law department, who come together to advocate for essential prosecution reforms to improve criminal justice service delivery to the public. The UNODC helps the forum improve and strengthen its strategic role. The provincial PPF chapters rotate, with each province hosting quarterly meetings.
The Secretary of Prosecution, Usman Anwar, highlighted, “The Pakistan Prosecution Forum is a valuable opportunity for us to learn from each other and to share best practices. I am confident that this forum will help us improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the prosecution system.”
The 17th  meeting of the forum also highlighted the Punjab Public Prosecution Department's flagship interventions, including the Punjab prosecution capacity building project, police training modernization, and integration of the case flow management system and prison management information system. These projects are graciously funded by the US Embassy’s Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) and are being implemented by the UNODC Country Office in close coordination with Punjab stakeholders. UNODC Advisor for Criminal Justice System and Legal Reforms Arsalan Malik stated, "UNODC is proud to support the Pakistan Prosecution Forum. We are committed to working with the Government of Pakistan to strengthen the overall prosecution system."
The PPF's achievements include an agreement on CrPC revisions, a Code of Conduct for Balochistan prosecutors, and a review and suggestions for amendments to the Balochistan Prosecution Service Act. These efforts have greatly reduced under-trial detainees by promoting fair investigations and trials.
The Forum held discussions on gender sensitivity, job descriptions for prosecutors, performance indicators, the recruitment syllabus, skill set enhancement, and training needs assessment.

Urgent action needed as almost 55 per cent of adolescent girls are anaemic; Pakistan also ranks 6th globally in early child marriages.
ISLAMABAD, 30 April 2024 – UNICEF Pakistan launched its National Gender Strategy (2024-2027) today to deliver lasting, transformative change for millions of girls between 10-19 years.
If the strategy is implemented effectively from urban to rural areas, it can drive change, address inequalities and improve the lives of all girls and women, including those living with disability.
"Striving for equal opportunities for all, especially girls, is fundamental to Pakistan's progress. Investing in girls is a win-win for everyone,” said Nilofer Bakhtiar, Chairperson, National Commission on the Status of Women. “It can lead to higher incomes and increased productivity, benefiting not only girls, but also the nation. By investing in girls' leadership, we unlock their full potential and pave the way for their brighter future.”
Today, adolescent girls in Pakistan face stark challenges in their education, health, nutrition and well-being. For example, Pakistan is home to nearly 19 million child brides.
In addition, more than half of adolescent girls, or 54 per cent, are pregnant before their 18th birthday which can be life-threatening for the mother and the child. A staggering 88 per cent of adolescent girls live in poverty which hampers the country's progress.
“Millions of children, most of whom are girls, face devastating challenges in their daily lives. Often, they cannot use even basic social services like health care. They are forced to drop out of school due to early marriage, poverty, and deep-rooted social norms,” said Inoussa Kabore, UNICEF Deputy Representative in Pakistan. “If all girls and women were to have the opportunities that are their right, such as studying, working, they would contribute to the economy and help Pakistan to prosper. No country will get ahead if half its population is left behind. UNICEF looks forward to working with the Government, civil society organizations, communities, girls and women, men and boys, to change the national dialogue on this critical issue.”
During the launch, UNICEF presented URAAN, which embodies UNICEF’s spirit on gender equality, with wings that symbolize greater equity in programming on gender.
The new strategy reiterates UNICEF’s commitment to the leadership and well-being of adolescent girls with a series of time-bound results.
Through the strategy, UNICEF will:
The strategy will also address barriers at the national and provincial levels, including gaps in gender-disaggregated data, infrastructure and child protection measures.

EU Ambassador Dr. Riina Kionka Visits Flood-Hit Dadu, Sindh, Witnesses European Union's Relief and Climate Resilience Initiatives
30 April 2024, Dadu, Sindh – A delegation led by the Ambassador of the European Union to Pakistan, Dr. Riina Kionka, embarked on a one-day field mission to Dadu, Sindh, to witness the impact and scale of support provided by the European Union (EU) to flood-affected communities in a district that was among the hardest hit by the devastating floods in 2022. In the wake of unprecedented rainfall and floods that swept across Pakistan in 2022, the EU launched a comprehensive relief and recovery initiative aimed at immediate relief, building the resilience of communities through climate-resilient housing, sanitation, livelihood opportunities, as well as child protection services.
The delegation visited EU-funded project sites in four villages across Dadu where on behalf of the European Union the UN World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Save the Children International (SCI) Pakistan are implementing development projects focusing on rehabilitating community assets, providing child protection, education, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) as well as shelters for the community.
During the visit, the delegation observed the distribution of cash assistance to participants under WFP's project. The Ambassador and her team inspected rainwater harvesting ponds for irrigation, communal washing pads, and protective pathways. The delegation also met women entrepreneurs who revived their livelihoods since the 2022 floods, e.g. by opening tuck shops and tailoring businesses. Women-led village development committees shared their challenges and aspirations with the delegation.
The delegation also visited sites where UNICEF is providing child protection and education services with EU funds. At the Children’s drop-in centre and a safe space for girls and women, the Ambassador witnessed children engaging in recreational activities and adolescent girls and women learning vocational skills such as embroidery and stitching. At these facilities, trained professionals also provide psycho-social support to help them recover from trauma and raise awareness on protection from violence and abuse. Later, the delegation visited a flood-damaged public school which UNICEF has since rehabilitated. Besides teaching and learning materials, UNICEF has also provided safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, especially for girls, in all rehabilitated schools.
The delegation further toured the locations where SCI Pakistan created a Child-friendly Space, Climate-Resilient Housing and Sanitation facilities, engaging in discussions with the beneficiaries of the project. Towards the conclusion of their visit, they also observed the livelihoods initiative focusing on kitchen gardening, sustainable agriculture, and livestock management support.
On-site, Ambassador Riina Kionka expressed that the field visit underscores the EU's commitment to supporting development work in Pakistan; “Although almost two years have passed, the flood-affected communities still require our attention and support. While I'm glad that the EU support has made a significant difference in the lives of the hardest-hit, the looming threat of climate change means extreme weather will become more frequent. The EU is working with Pakistan to build long-term resilience to climate change” she said.
WFP’s Head of provincial office in Sindh, Ms. Judith Lumu, Prem Bahadur Chand, UNICEF’s Chief of Field Office - Sindh, and Deputy Country Director from SCI Pakistan Bilal Taj joined the delegation and showed the Ambassador and First Secretary Dr Christian Raitz von Frentz the many activities ongoing.
WFP, UNICEF, and SCI Pakistan are currently implementing these three projects with a financial volume of EUR 12 million for the European Union in 13 districts across three provinces in Pakistan: Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. EURO 12 million has been allocated to benefit 22,365 households. Countrywide, the EU has spent EUR 227 million of grant aid on humanitarian and recovery projects in support of flood-affected communities. EU Member States contributed another EUR 689 million in subsidised loans (EUR 438 million) and grant (251 million), not counting their additional aid in kind.

UN’s Pakistani Peacekeepers to leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo after more than 20 years of service.
Kinshasa, April 25, 2024: More than 20 years after their arrival in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the United Nations (UN) Peacekeepers from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan are preparing to leave the country. The contingent has constituted the bulk of the UN’s troops deployed in South Kivu province and their important contributions to peace consolidation and security was recognized during a tribute ceremony today.
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) in the DRC and Head of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO), Ms. Bintou Keita, MONUSCO’s Force Commander a.i. Major General Khar Diouf, the South Kivu provincial minister of Infrastructures and representative of the interim governor, Mr. Cissa wa Numbe, the Government Delegate General in charge of liaison with MONUSCO, Ambassador Noel Mbemba, participated in the ceremony today in Kavumu, 32 km from Bukavu. The departure of the Pakistani contingent is part of MONUSCO’s disengagement plan from the DRC, initiated in early January 2024.
Since 2003, when they were first deployed, more than 100 000 Pakistani Peacekeepers have served in South Kivu and 31 have died in the line of duty. For Pakistan that’s the greatest number of Blue Helmets they have lost in the 46 Peacekeeping missions in the 29 countries where they have been deployed.
“I pay tribute to the immense contribution the troops from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan have made to advancing peace and security in South Kivu. I honour the 31 Blue Helmets who have paid the ultimate price. Over the years, their sacrifice, professionalism, and commitment have helped protect millions of people in DRC”, the head of MONUSCO said.
The Pakistani troops have been engaged in military operations aimed at protecting civilians and maintaining peace and security in South Kivu. In 2017, together with the Armed Forces of the DRC, the Pakistani contingent stopped a coalition of armed groups from taking over the city of Uvira. In 2018, they pushed back an offensive by armed groups in the Hauts Plateaux of Uvira, protecting more than 120 000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). Over the years, the Pakistani Peacekeepers have protected millions of IDPs, many of whom have established camps around their bases
“MONUSCO is handing over the responsibility of ensuring security and the physical protection of civilians to the defence and security forces of DRC, who will continue to undertake this responsibility in close coordination with community and other local leaders. According to the disengagement plan, in parallel with the withdrawal of UN

25 April 2024, Quetta - In a collaborative effort to combat the pervasive issue of gender-based violence (GBV), Balochistan Police has been implementing a pioneering awareness and advocacy campaign. The initiative is funded by the U.S. Embassy’s Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) and implemented with the technical support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
As part of awareness raising activities, Balochistan Police in conjunction with the U.S. Embassy’s Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) and UNODC organized a flagship seminar on Wednesday, 24th of April 2024 at Sardar Bahadur Khan Women's University in Quetta that successfully concluded the campaign. The seminar brought together experts from law enforcement, academia, and civil society to speak to a large gathering of young and enthusiastic female students with the purpose to inspire them to champion social change to combat gender-based violence in Balochistan.
The event was presided over by the Minister for Education, Government of Balochistan, Ms. Raheela Hameed Durani who emphasized the importance of proactive measures to combat gender-based violence, highlighting the need for universities to play a crucial role in empowering young women. Other key stakeholders included Deputy Inspector General of Police Balochistan, Mr. Qamar-ul-Hassan, Vice Chancellor SBK, Prof. Dr. Sajida Noreen, Chairperson Provincial Commission on Status of Women, Balochistan, Ms. Fozia Shaheen, and  SP, Quetta Police and In-Charge Women and Juvenile Faciliation Centre, Ms. Pari Gul Tareen.
The main focus was on empowering youth, particularly adolescent girls, by sensitizing them to identify and confront gender stereotypes to address causes of gender-based violence in their daily lives, and motivate them to pursue careers as women police officers in Balochistan. Partnering with the Sardar Bahadur Khan Women’s University and Government Girls Postgraduate College in Quetta, Balochistan Police and UNODC had also conducted two interactive awareness sessions on March 27 and 28, 2024, respectively. These sessions successfully brought together accomplished women police officers, psychologists, academics, and gender experts to engage and encourage female students to come forward and support GBV survivors through empathy and respect. The objective was to empower young girls through knowledge of cultural and structural prejudices to address the causes of GBV. Dissemination through social media and printed materials further helped to amplify key messages among wider audience.
The campaign also highlighted the importance of immediate assistance for survivors of gender-based violence and the services available at the Women and Juvenile Facilitation Centre (WJFC) in Quetta. Ms. Pari Gul Tareen, SP, Quetta, said, “Gender-based violence thrives in silence and ignorance. Our aim is to create awareness and a supportive environment for GBV survivors to ensure reporting of GBV to relevant authorities and the delivery of necessary assistance.”
UNODC reassures its continued commitment towards preventing gender-based violence within communities through awareness raising, establishing reporting mechanisms especially for women and increasing the capacity of first responders. Nonetheless, women’s rights and freedoms are essential to building strong, resilient societies which can only be achieved through a whole-of-society approach. This initiative represents a significant step towards fostering a culture of understanding, respect and empathy towards addressing the issue of gender-based violence in Balochistan

کوئٹہ (24 اپریل 2024): صنفی تشدد کے خاتمے کی مشترکہ کوششوں کے تحت بلوچستان پولیس صوبے میں پہلی بار ایک آگاہی مہم چلا رہی ہے۔ امریکی سفارتخانے کے انٹرنیشنل نارکوٹکس اینڈ لاء انفورسمنٹ (آئی این ایل) نے اس مہم کے لئے مالی تعاون کیا ہے جبکہ اقوام متحدہ دفتر برائے انسداد منشیات و جرائم (یو این او ڈی سی) اس سلسلے میں تکنیکی معاونت فراہم کر رہا ہے۔
آگاہی پھیلانے کی سرگرمیوں کے تحت بلوچستان پولیس نے امریکی سفارتخانے کے انٹرنیشنل نارکوٹکس اینڈ لاء انفورسمنٹ (آئی این ایل) اور یو این او ڈی سی کے اشتراک سے کوئٹہ کی سردار بہادر خان ویمنز یونیورسٹی میں 24 اپریل 2024 کو ایک مرکزی سیمینار کا اہتمام کیا۔ سیمینار میں قانون نافذ کرنے والے اداروں، شعبہ تدریس اور سول سوسائٹی سے تعلق رکھنے والے ماہرین نے نوجوان اور پرعزم طالبات کے ایک بڑے اجتماع سے خطاب کیا اور انہیں بلوچستان میں صنفی تشدد کے خاتمے کی تحریک کو آگے بڑھانے اور معاشرے میں تبدیلی لانے کی کوششوں کا حصہ بننے پر مائل کیا۔
تقریب کا انعقاد حکومت بلوچستان کی وزیر تعلیم راحیلہ حمید درانی نے کیا اور انہوں نے صنفی بنیاد پر تشدد سے نمٹنے کے لیے فعال اقدامات کی اہمیت پر زور دیا، نوجوان خواتین کو بااختیار بنانے میں یونیورسٹیوں کے اہم کردار ادا کرنے کی ضرورت کو اجاگر کیا۔ دیگر اسٹیک ہولڈر جس میں بلوچستان پولیس کے ڈپٹی انسپکٹر جنرل مسٹر قمر الحسن، وائس چانسلر سردار بہادر خان وویمز یونیورسٹی پروفیسر ڈاکٹر ساجدہ نورین، چیئرپرسن صوبائی کمیشن برائے خواتین میڈم فوزیہ شاہین اور سپریڈنٹ پولیس کوئٹہ اور انچارج برائے خواتین و بچوں کی سہولت کا مرکز میڈیم پری گل ترین  بھی شامل تھیں۔
سردار بہادر خان ویمنز یونیورسٹی اور کوئٹہ کے گورنمنٹ گرلز پوسٹ گریجویٹ کالج کے اشتراک سے بلوچستان پولیس اور یو این او ڈی سی بالترتیب 27 اور 28 مارچ 2024 کو دو آگاہی سیشنز کا انعقاد بھی کر چکے ہیں۔ ان سیشنز میں پولیس کی کامیاب خواتین افسران، ماہرین نفسیات، تدریسی ماہرین اور صنفی ماہرین نے بڑھ چڑھ کر حصہ لیا اور نوجوان طالبات کی حوصلہ افزائی کی کہ وہ صنفی تشدد کا مقابلہ کرنے والی خواتین کے جذبات کو سمجھتے ہوئے ان کا حوصلہ بڑھانے کے لئے آگے آئیں۔ اصل مقصد ان طالبات کو اس بات پر مائل کرنا تھا کہ وہ ثقافت اور معاشرے میں پائے جانے والے تعصبات کا علم حاصل کریں اور صنفی تشدد کے اسباب پر قابو پانے کے لئے اپنا کردار ادا کریں۔ سوشل میڈیا اور طبع شدہ معلوماتی مواد کے ذریعے ان پیغامات کو شہریوں کی بڑی تعداد تک پہنچانے میں مزید مدد ملی۔
اس مہم کے ذریعے صنفی تشدد کا مقابلہ کرنے والی خواتین کو فوری امداد کی فراہمی کی اہمیت کا اجاگر کیا جا رہا ہے اور کوئٹہ میں بنائے گئے خواتین اور بچوں کے سہولت مرکز (ڈبلیو جے ایف سی) میں دستیاب خدمات کے بارے میں آگاہی پیدا کی جا رہی ہے۔ ایس پی کوئٹہ محترمہ پری گل ترین نے اپنے خیالات کا اظہار کرتے ہوئے کہا کہ خاموشی اور لاعلمی صنفی تشدد میں اضافے کا باعث بنتے ہیں۔ ہمارا مقصد آگاہی پھیلانا اور صنفی تشدد کا مقابلہ کرنے والی خواتین کے لئے ایسا سازگار ماحول پیدا کرنا ہے جس میں وہ صنفی تشدد کی اطلاع متعلقہ حکام کو دیں اور انہیں ضروری معاونت فراہم کی جا سکے۔
یو این او ڈی سی معاشرے میں صنفی تشدد کی روک تھام کے سلسلے میں بلوچستان پولیس کے ساتھ ہے اور اس سلسلے میں آگاہی بڑھانے، بالخصوص خواتین کے لئے اطلاع دینے کے نظام تشکیل دینے اور فرسٹ رسپانڈرز کی استعداد بڑھانے کی سرگرمیوں میں اپنا کردار ادا کر رہا ہے۔ خواتین کے حقوق اور آزادی معاشروں کی تعمیر کے لیے بہت ضروری ہے ۔  جو صرف پورے معاشرے کے نقطہ نظر  سے ہی حاصل کیا جا سکتا ہے۔

On Earth Day, Statement by Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan, on the damaging impact of climate change and pollution on children
ISLAMABAD, 22 April 2024 – “Torrential and unseasonal rains are currently sweeping through Pakistan, once again putting children’s lives in danger.
“It is a reminder of the devastating tragedy in 2022, when 500 children lost their lives as 10 years’ worth of rains were dumped on villages in southern Sindh. I saw firsthand how children were malnourished and the little they had swept away, including their schools and their hopes and futures. Despite significant aid efforts, 9.6 million children were still in need of humanitarian assistance in flood affected areas by December 2023.
“The disastrous floods are one example of how climate change and pollution are impacting children’s health in Pakistan. Record-breaking temperatures put all children in Pakistan at risk of heat stress as they cannot remove excess heat from their bodies. Similarly, children are also more likely to suffer from air pollution than adults, leading to life-threatening respiratory diseases.  About 12 per cent of deaths in Pakistani children under five are due to air pollution.
“Year on year, children in Pakistan are caught in a vicious cycle of drought and floods. From the moment of conception until they grow into adulthood, the health and development of children’s brains, lungs, and immune systems, are affected by their environment. Children in Pakistan are at “extremely high risk” of the impacts of the climate crisis. However, Pakistan shoulders the twin burden of adapting to climate change while reducing global emissions.
“Despite what is at stake, we are failing to protect our environment. The mighty Indus River is a lifeline for Pakistan’s people and children but is now at risk due to climate change, neglect, misuse, pollution, over exploitation and dumping of toxic waste.
“This Earth Day, we must redouble our efforts to ensure no child in Pakistan suffers the consequences of climate change, pollution and related disasters again.
“Here’s how: We must cut greenhouse gas emissions from coal and fossil fuels to protect the planet.
“I am a polluter - every time I eat or travel, I add to global emissions. But blame does not fall equally. According to Oxfam, the world’s richest 10 per cent is responsible for half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. That, among many other things, is heating the planet. Governments must take collective responsibility in line with the pollution they cause. We can also do more to save energy and use other sources like solar.
“We must enact policies and legislation to address climate change and its disproportionate impact on children and women. Protecting children’s health from toxic metals, chemicals, hazardous waste and air pollution is paramount.
“We must invest in children. That means more money to address stunting and malnutrition, build schools, health centres, toilets and hand pumps that can withstand floods and cyclones. However, only 2.4 per cent  from climate funds support projects for children. We urge world leaders to work towards making COP30 a children’s COP to secure the 1.5-degree temperature limit.
“If we fail to do so, more children will become vulnerable to disease, hunger and death. To ensure every child in Pakistan grows up in a safe and clean world, radical action is needed today. We owe it to the next generation, who are the custodians of our future.”

’یومِ ارض‘ کے موقع پر پاکستان میں یونیسف کے سربراہ، عبداللہ فاضل کا بچوں پر موسمیاتی تبدیلی اور آلودگی کے مضر اثرات کے حوالے سے بیان
اسلام آباد۔ 22 اپریل 2024:  "پاکستان میں موسلا دھار اور بے موسم بارشوں کا سلسلہ جاری ہے، جس سے ایک بار پھر بچوں کی زندگیوں کو خطرات لاحق ہوگئے ہیں۔
’’ان بارشوں سے 2022 کے تباہ کن سانحے کی یاد تازہ ہوتی ہے، جب جنوبی سندھ کے دیہاتوں میں 10 سال کی بارشوں کے برابر بارشیں ایک ساتھ برسنے سے 500 بچے اپنی جانوں سے ہاتھ دھو بیٹھے تھے۔ اس دوران میں نے خود دیکھا کہ بچے غذائی قلت کا شکار تھے اور بچوں کے اسکولوں، ان کی اُمنگوں اور مستقبل سمیت سب کچھ سیلاب میں بہہ گیا تھا۔ موثر امدادی کوششوں کے باوجود دسمبر 2023 تک سیلاب سے متاثرہ علاقوں میں 96 لاکھ بچے اب بھی انسانی امداد کے منتظر تھے۔
"تباہ کن سیلاب اس بات کی ایک مثال ہے کہ موسمیاتی تبدیلی اور آلودگی پاکستان میں بچوں کی صحت کو کس طرح متاثر کر رہی ہے۔ اس کے علاوہ ریکارڈ درجہ حرارت سے پاکستان میں تمام بچوں کو شدید گرمی کے خطرے کا بھی سامنا ہے، کیونکہ ان کے پاس اس سے نمٹنے کے لئے وسائل نہیں ہیں۔ اسی طرح بڑوں کے مقابلے میں بچوں کے فضائی آلودگی کا شکار ہونے کے امکانات زیادہ ہوتے ہیں۔ فضائی آلودگی سے سانس کی جان لیوا بیماریاں جنم لیتی ہیں۔ پاکستان میں پانچ سال سے کم عمر کے تقریباً 12 فیصد بچوں کی اموات فضائی آلودگی کی وجہ سے ہوتی ہیں۔
"سال بہ سال پاکستان میں بچے خشک سالی اور سیلاب کے جان لیوا چکر میں پھنسے رہتے ہیں۔ ماں کے پیٹ سے لے کر بلوغت تک بچوں کے دماغ، پھیپھڑوں اور مدافعتی نظام کی صحت اور نشوونما ان کے ماحول سے متاثر ہوتی ہے۔ پاکستان میں بچوں کو موسمیاتی بحران کے اثرات سے’’شدید ترین خطرے‘‘ کا سامنا ہے۔ تاہم، پاکستان کے کندھوں پر عالمی سطح پر مضر گیسوں کے اخراج میں کمی لانے کے ساتھ ساتھ  موسمیاتی تبدیلی کے خلاف اپنا تحفظ کرنے کا دوہرا بوجھ بھی ہے۔
"اتنا کچھ داؤ پر لگا ہوا ہے، اس کے باوجود ہم اپنے ماحول کی حفاظت کرنے میں ناکام ہو رہے ہیں۔ دریائے سندھ پاکستان کے عوام اور بچوں کے لیے زندگی کے وسیلے کی حیثیت رکھتا ہے، لیکن وہ بھی موسمیاتی تبدیلی، غفلت، گنجائش سے زائد استعمال، آلودگی، اور زہریلا فضلہ پھینکنے کی وجہ سے خطرے سے دوچار ہے۔
"اس یومِ ارض پر ہمیں اس بات کو یقینی بنانے کے لیے اپنی کوششیں دگنی کرنی ہونگی کہ پاکستان میں کوئی بچہ دوبارہ موسمیاتی تبدیلی، آلودگی اور متعلقہ آفات کا شکار نہ ہو۔ اس کے لیے ہمیں زمین کی حفاظت کے لئے کوئلے اور فوسل فیولز کے استعمال سے پیدا ہونے والی گرین ہاؤس گیسوں کے اخراج کو کم کرنا ہوگا۔
’’میں آلودگی پھیلاتا ہوں - ہر بار جب میں سفر کرتا ہوں، تو میں گرین گیسوں کے اخراج میں اضافے کا باعث بنتا ہوں،۔لیکن اس جرم میں سب برابر کے شریک نہیں ہیں۔ آکسفیم کے مطابق دنیا کے امیر ترین 10 فیصد افراد دنیا بھر میں گرین ہاؤس گیسوں کے کل اخراج میں سے نصف کے ذمہ دار ہیں۔  بہت سی دوسری چیزوں کے علاوہ، یہ گیسیں زمین کے درجہ حرارت میں اضافے کا موجب بن رہی ہیں۔ حکومتوں کو چاہیے کہ اس آلودگی میں کمی لانے کے لیے اجتماعی ذمہ داری لیں۔ ہم توانائی کی بچت اور شمسی توانائی جیسے دیگر ذرائع کے استعمال سے ان گیسوں کے اخراج میں کمی لاسکتے ہیں۔
" ہمیں موسمیاتی تبدیلی اور بچوں اور خواتین پر اس کے غیر متناسب اثرات سے نمٹنے کے لئے پالیسیاں اور قانون سازی کرنی ہوگی۔ بچوں کی صحت کو زہریلی دھاتوں، کیمیکلز، خطرناک فضلے اور فضائی آلودگی سے بچانا انتہائی ضروری ہے۔
"ہمیں بچوں پر سرمایہ کاری کرنی چاہیے۔ اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ بچوں میں غذائی کمی اور جسمانی کمزوری سے نمٹنے کے لیے زائد رقم مختص کی جائے، اسکول، صحت کے مراکز، بیت الخلا اور ہینڈ پمپ تعمیر کیے جائیں جو سیلاب اور سمندری طوفانوں کا مقابلہ کر سکیں۔ تاہم، موسمیاتی تبدیلی سے نمٹنے کے لیے مختص فنڈز میں سے بچوں کی بہتری کے منصوبوں پر صرف 2.4 فیصد خرچ کیا جاتا ہے۔ ہم عالمی رہنماؤں پر زور دیتے ہیں کہ وہ COP30 کو بچوں کا COP بنانے کی سمت میں کام کریں تاکہ 1.5 ڈگری درجہ حرارت کی حد برقرار رکھی جا سکے۔"
اگر ہم اس میں ناکام رہے تو مزید بچے بیماری، بھوک اور اموات کا شکار ہو جائیں گے۔ پاکستان کے ہر بچے کی پرورش ایک محفوظ اور صاف ستھری دنیا میں یقینی بنانے کے لیے ہمیں آج انقلابی اقدامات کی ضرورت ہے۔ یہ ہم پر اگلی نسل کا قرض ہے، جو ہمارے مستقبل کی نگہبان ہے۔ ختم شد۔


The project, funded by the United Nations Environment Programme and Global Environment Facility, aims to mitigate the use and release of hazardous chemicals in Pakistan's textile sector.
KARACHI, Pakistan (ILO News) – Today, the International Labour Organization (ILO) launched a new project on “Environmental Sustainability through Chemical Management” (ESCM) that will collaborate with 10 Textile Mills in Karachi to pilot a capacity building programme for sound chemical management, focused on reducing occupational hazards from chemicals of concern and Persisent Organic Pollutants (POPs), while ensuring environmental sustainability.
The ESCM project aligns with the ILO's commitment to a just transition with safer, more equitable, and decent workplaces within the textile industry, while also adopting international labour standards, particularly focusing on Occupational Safety and Health. Through collaboration with national partners, the initiative seeks to raise awareness about the ILO Chemical Convention 1990 (No.170) and advocate for policy reforms to ensure compliance with international labor standards.
The launch was attended by multiple stakeholders including representatives from the Federal Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment Coordination, the Living Indus Initiative, other provincial government departments, employers’ and workers’ organizations. The event was followed by a stakeholder consultation where the participants deliberated on strategies to amplify the project's impact and foster industry-wide adherence to global best practices in chemical management. The project is currently active in Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Geir Tonstol, Country Director for ILO Pakistan said “the project on chemical waste management not only complements ILO's factory improvement programs  dedicated to enhancing compliance, notably under the GSP Plus framework, but also strengthens the holistic approach of ILO towards productivity, compliance, human resource development, and just transitions for climate change.”
He added that this comprehensive initiative underscores ILO's commitment to fostering sustainable practices in supply chains while advocating for climate resilience and social justice.
Maria Beatriz Mello da Cunha, ILO Specialist on the Textile, Leather, Footwear and Garments Sector, emphasized that “it is essential that through this pilot project we design a capacity building programme on the ILO Code of Practice for Safety and Health in the Textiles Industries, so that Occupaitonal Safety and Health deficits from chemicals and hazardous materials can be reduced.”
With support from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), and in coordination with the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, the project will engage ILO’s tripartite constituents, project partners, and stakeholders in an active process of both policy and technical interventions in the sector. The project will also serve as a platform to develop synergies and foster knowledge-sharing on workplace safety.
Background:
Globally, the impact of hazardous substances affects nearly one billion workers, resulting in devastating consequences for not only the individuals themselves and their families but also leading to a significant negative impact on the economy's performance. This warrants for transformative action in chemical waste management practices. The project aims to address these issues by collaborating with textile mills demonstrating successful models that can then be replicated and scaled in other sectors.

ILO - PRESS RELEASE : Law Enforcement Officers from Balochistan Empowered Against Forced Labor and Human Trafficking
ILO
Law enforcement departments unite for the first time to identify and address situations of forced labour, especially in exposed sectors like brick kilns and agriculture.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (ILO News) – On 16-17 April, the International Labour Organization (ILO) completed a training programme for 40 officers from the Department of Labour, Federal Investigation Agency, Police, and Mines departments of Balochistan province, equipping them with essential knowledge and skills to tackle forced labour, bonded labour and human trafficking.
The activity took place under the project "From Protocol to Practice: A Bridge to Global Action on Forced Labour" (BRIDGE), which the ILO is implementing in collaboration with the United States Department of Labour. The project aims to bolster efforts to eradicate forced labour.
The BRIDGE project adopts various strategies, including promoting the ratification of the 2014 Protocol to the ILO Forced Labour Convention, improving national policies and legislation on forced labour, conducting research, strengthening the capacities of employers' and workers' organizations to address forced labour, and providing support to victims of forced labour. The project is currently active in Uzbekistan, Peru, Nepal, Mongolia and Pakistan.
In Pakistan, the project has prioritized strengthening the capacity of law enforcement agencies in Balochistan to combat forced labour, bonded labour, and human trafficking. The initiative commenced with a comprehensive training needs assessment of law enforcement agencies in Balochistan, serving as the foundation for the development of a specialized training manual tailored to the region's needs. Following meticulous refinement and testing through a pilot training session held in March 2024 in Quetta, the manual was finalized.
Speaking on the occasion, Sardar Mushtaq Ahmad Jaffar, Director General of Labour in Balochistan, commended the ILO for its enduring partnership and support. He urged officers to seize the opportunity to enhance their capacities and play a pivotal role in eliminating bonded labour, and human trafficking from Balochistan. He particularly highlighted the significance of addressing these issues in sectors such as brick kilns and agriculture, where women and children often suffer as part of borrowers’ families.
Geir Tonstol, Country Director ILO Pakistan said “Respect for fundamental principles and rights is essential to bring an end to unacceptable forms of work. While having laws in place is crucial, effective implementation is imperative. This training represents a significant step towards improving inter-departmental coordination and building the capacities of officials to tackle unacceptable forms of work in the province. The ILO stands ready to support our social partners in advancing social justice for all.”

Pakistan ranks 164th with a ‘low’ human development status
14 March 2024 – Islamabad: Uneven development progress is leaving the poorest behind, exacerbating inequality, and stoking political polarization on a global scale. The result is a dangerous deadlock that must be urgently tackled through collective action, says the 2023-2024 Human Development Report entitled “Breaking the Gridlock: Reimagining Cooperation in a Polarized World” released this week by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
“The widening human development gap revealed by the report shows that the two-decade trend of steadily reducing inequalities between wealthy and poor nations is now in reverse,” said Achim Steiner, Administrator of UNDP. “This gridlock carries a significant human toll. The failure of collective action to advance our response to climate change, digitalization or poverty and inequality not only hinders human development but also worsens polarization and further erodes trust in people and institutions worldwide.”
The 2023-2024 Report places Pakistan in the ‘low’ human development category. In 2022, Pakistan had a Human Development Index (HDI) value of 0.540 with a global ranking of 161 out of 192 countries. In 2023, the country dropped three places to 164 in the global ranking.
“Despite managing well the Covid-19 pandemic, Pakistan's HDI and global ranking have suffered due to persistent social, economic and political pressures, including macroeconomic challenges as well as the lingering effect of the 2022 floods,” said UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative, Dr. Samuel Rizk. He observed that there is a notable 33 per cent decline in Pakistan’s inequality-adjusted HDI, bringing it to 0.360. In the Gender Inequality Index (GII), the country’s rank remains the same at 135 out of 166 countries. The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) score stays unaffected at 0.198, indicating persistent challenges.
The Report reveals that following pandemic-caused setbacks for their HDI in 2020, the South Asian region has demonstrated an overall more resilient recovery compared to East Asia and the Pacific, as well as the global average. However, significant disparities remain between ‘high’ HDI and ‘low’ HDI countries, indicating ongoing challenges in achieving equitable development.
“With a new government in place, and high ambitions for reform, prosperity for Pakistan requires significant mobilization of climate and SDGs financing, along with a fit-for-purpose governance architecture that provides planetary and digital ‘global public goods’,” said Dr. Rizk. “The role of global public goods is different from humanitarian aid and development assistance, which target certain populations in need. Global public goods, by definition, aim to reach everyone and can improve the prospect of human development of all people and societies as whole.”
The latest UNDP Human Development Report calls for reevaluating global interdependence and outlines four critical areas for action: prioritizing planetary public goods for climate stability, fostering digital global public goods for fair technology access, implementing innovative financial mechanisms for low-income countries, and adopting new governance approaches to reduce political polarization and combat misinformation.

Fewer children dying before turning five in Southern Asia than ever before – UNICEF
From 1990 to 2022, the under-five child mortality rate declined by 72 per cent in Southern Asia, a new UNICEF report says.
KATHMANDU/ NEW DELHI, 13 March 2024 – The number of children dying under five years of age declined by two thirds over the past two decades in Southern Asia, according to new mortality estimates released by UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population Division and the World Bank Group. Southern Asia includes nine countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
The report reveals that the number of child deaths under 5 years of age decreased from 5 million in 1990 to 1.3 million in 2022.  The report also shows that Southern Asia’s under five mortality rate, or the probability that a child would die before five years of age, reduced by 72 per cent since 1990, and 62 per cent since 2000.
“We have made heartening progress to save millions of children’s lives since 1990.  These aren’t just numbers on a page – these are children’s lives saved, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters. This success is largely due to investments in trained health workers, improvements in newborn care, treatment of childhood illnesses and vaccinations for children against deadly diseases,” said Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF Regional Director for Southern Asia. “This progress shows us that change is possible. These lives saved are testament to the engagement and will of governments, local organizations, health care professionals such as skilled birth attendants, parents, and families to save the most vulnerable children.”
Despite this progress, however, much more needs to be done. An estimated 1 in 29 children under five years of age are still dying in Southern Asia. This is the second largest burden globally after sub–Saharan Africa. One in four under-five deaths in Southern Asia is due to prematurity. Most children under five years of age die due to preventable or treatable causes such as complications during birth, pneumonia, diarrhea, neonatal sepsis, and malaria.
For children everywhere, the riskiest period of life is the first month. In 2022, Southern Asia accounted for 34 per cent of global neonatal deaths, which means that 1 in 3 newborn babies dying globally was from the region. In fact, the share of newborn deaths to under five deaths increased from 46 per cent in 1990 to 63 per cent in 2022, underscoring the need for greater investment in saving newborns.
The report also reveals that progress among countries is uneven. Three countries (Iran, Sri Lanka and Maldives) have achieved the SDG 2030 target for under five child mortality reduction and four are on track to meet the target (India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal). For example, Bangladesh’s neonatal mortality rate decreased from 66 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990, to 17 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2022.
However, in Pakistan and Afghanistan, urgent action is required to accelerate their annual rates of reduction substantially to meet 2030 targets.
Without urgent action to save lives, an estimated eight million children under five will die from now until 2030 in Southern Asia – more than half of them newborns.  Disparity and inequity are still driving deaths of children across the region.
“Millions of babies are still dying in Southern Asia because of who they are and where they are born,” added Wijesekera. “We call on governments across the region to invest in simple solutions such as having trained birth attendants at every birth, ensuring that all newborns have essential care, better care of small and sick newborn babies, medicines, clean water, electricity, and vaccines to save lives. Every child has the right to healthcare.”

WFP
PRESS RELEASE
WFP Pakistan and the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (GoKP) partner to boost girls’ education through a cash-based stipend programme.
Islamabad: Today, the Elementary and Secondary Education Department (E&SED), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to mark the launch of a cash-based stipend programme for adolescent girls in the Merged Districts (MDs) of KP. The event, held at Marriot Hotel, was at the invitation of the Secretary, Education Department, Mr. Masood Ahmed and the Representative and Country Director of WFP Pakistan, Ms. Coco Ushiyama.
The Girls’ Stipend Programme aims to improve girls’ access to and retention in schools, especially at the higher grades where drop-out rates are high, through the provision of income support to the families of adolescent girls. Over three years of the programme some 30,000 girls in grades 6 -12 in more than 500 government girls' middle and higher schools will receive PKR 1000 per month. This 3-year programme covering all seven districts and sub-divisions in the merged districts is costed at USD 4.4 million, averaging USD 1.1 million per year.
The Secretary of Education at the official launch of the programme stated, “This intervention lays the foundation stone for our future, especially for under-privileged adolescent girls in MDs. In today's society, access to quality education is imperative for our successful future”. He further added that the Government of KP places a high priority in ensuring the access to education enrolment for all out-of-school children. Currently, there are over 1 million children aged 5 to 16 years who are not enrolled in school in the MDs. A staggering 67 percent of the population in MDs is unable to read or write, highlighting low performing educational indicators across the MD region. “
WFP Pakistan’s Representative and Country Director, Coco Ushiyama, highlighted the importance of education, “The profound impact of educating girls is encapsulated in the proverb "Educate a girl and you educate a nation". When women and girls are empowered with better access to education, information, resources, services and economic opportunities, the ripple effects are far-reaching. Evidence confirms that this empowerment also leads to enhanced food security and improved nutrition for women and girls, their families and communities, laying the foundation for a prosperous society.”
The Girls’ Stipend Programme builds on decades-long partnership between the Department of Education, KP and WFP. Most recently in 2021, WFP in support of the Government’s COVID-19 response piloted a cash-based Stipend Programme in the merged districts reaching some 21,000 girls in 280 schools. An impact assessment of that pilot found a significant 14 percent increase in enrollment, and a 96 percent improvement in attendance rates.
The Adolescent Girls Programme will be implemented under the overall supervision of E&SED, with WFP‘s technical support in cash-based transfer operations, data collection, profiling, and skill enhancement for the Education Department staff involved in the education programme.
Today’s event is part of a series of school-based interventions by WFP Pakistan to advance human capital development. School-based programmes are one of the most extensive social safety nets worldwide, which can help maximize the return on investment in education, because it facilitates access to school and improves the nutritional status, health and cognitive development of children.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY
8 March 2024
On International Women’s Day, we celebrate women and girls around the world, and we applaud all they have achieved in the fight for equality.
Women and girls have made great gains – demolishing barriers, dismantling stereotypes and driving progress towards a more just and equal world.
Yet they face immense obstacles.  Billions of women and girls face marginalization, injustice and discrimination, while the persistent epidemic of violence against women disgraces humanity.
Our world still reflects millennia of male-dominated power relations.
And progress is under attack, with a fierce backlash against women’s rights.
At our current rate, legal equality is some three hundred years away.
We must move much faster.
On International Women’s Day, we stand with women and girls fighting for their rights, and we commit to accelerating progress.
This year’s theme – invest in women – reminds us that ending the patriarchy requires money on the table.
We must support women’s organisations on the front line.
And we must invest in programmes to end violence against women, and to drive women’s inclusion and leadership in economies, digital technologies, peacebuilding and climate action.
This all depends on unlocking finance for sustainable development so that countries have funds available to invest in women and girls.
We also need to increase the number of women leaders in business, finance, central banks and finance ministries. This can help drive investments in policies and programmes that respond to women and girls’ needs.
Women’s rights are a proven path to fair, peaceful, prosperous societies. It is good for us all.
Together, let’s take urgent action to make it a reality.
Thank you.

Over 62 million People to Benefit as KOICA and UNOPS Complete Water Quality Monitoring Project
Islamabad: In an event held in Islamabad, Senator Mr. Muhammad Sabir Shah (Chief Guest), Senator Ms. Keshoo Bai, Ms. Samar Ihsan, Additional Secretary EAD, Ms. Sadia Sarwat, Additional Secretary Ministry of Climate Change, His Excellency Mr Park Ki Jun, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea, Mr Yeon Je Ho, Country Director KOICA Pakistan and Ms Jennifer Ankhom-Khan, Country Manager UNOPS Pakistan, attended the closing ceremony of the project “Enhancing Water Quality Monitoring System to achieve SDG 6 in Islamabad, Punjab and KP”
Acknowledging the fundamental right to clean and safe drinking water, the initial and vital step is monitoring its quality. Pakistan faces a significant challenge, with almost 44% of the population lacking access to safe drinking water. In response, the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) collaborated with UNOPS Pakistan to enhance water quality monitoring systems in Islamabad, Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan.
UNOPS Pakistan is implementing this project in collaboration with the Ministry of Climate Change Pakistan (MoCC), Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and Public Health and Engineering Departments of Government of Punjab & KP.
The $4.4 million project has been implemented in 35 district laboratories in Punjab, 8 divisional labs in KP and research and monitoring laboratories, PCRWR and Pak-EPA, in Islamabad.
1.
The project includes significant upgrades to water-quality testing laboratories, encompassing the procurement and installation of advanced laboratory equipment, minor infrastructure enhancements to ensure a safe working environment, capacity-building initiatives for laboratory staff and the WASH Cell of the MoCC, the introduction of a Management Information System (MIS) for improved coordination, and the provision of 8 vehicles transformed into water-quality testing laboratories for the Government of KP and 1 vehicle for PCRWR.
Quote Chief Guest: (Senator Mr. Muhammad Sabir Shah)
“We celebrate this significant achievement, taking pride in the successful project completion that saw the enhancement and equipping of laboratories -a pivotal move towards swift and precise water contaminant testing. This initiative underscores our commitment to climate resilience, exemplified through various measures, including the utilization of advanced technology to respond promptly to challenges in remote areas and emergencies.. Collaboratively with KOICA and UNOPS, we are strengthening Pakistan's capacity to tackle climate-related challenges and uphold the availability of safe and clean water for all”
In partnership with KOICA, UNOPS Pakistan has equipped the laboratories with latest technology to ensure quick, accurate and hassle free testing of contaminants such as arsenic, heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria through microbial testing in the drinking water thus enhancing the capacity of labs to test 16 mandatory water quality parameters and 18 optional parameters as per WHO guidelines. The mobile laboratories will play a vital role in testing the quality of water in far-flung areas and will also be used to respond to public health emergencies during natural disasters or spread of waterborne diseases. UNOPS has also supported the Ministry of Climate Change to establish a WASH cell in Islamabad.
Korean Ambassador Mr.  Ki-Jun Park Pakistan said:“We are pleased to announce the successful completion of the water quality testing project. The Korean Government will continue to support the Government of Pakistan in different sectors, especially in the water sector. I believe that this project will improve people’s quality of life by enhancing water quality and will help in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals”
UNOPS has also developed a Management Information Software (MIS) to strengthen the water-quality data management at provincial level and enable the Ministry of Climate Change to coordinate and monitor the drinking water quality in close collaboration with the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The MIS will also ensure smooth and paperless lab operations in the province of KP.
Miss Jennifer Ankrom-Khan, UNOPS Country Manager for Pakistan, said:“In Pakistan, millions of people still live without access to clean and safe drinking water as it guarantees healthier and resilient communities. The absence of clean drinking water spreads waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A&E etc., and leads to malnutrition in children. With generous support from KOICA, we are delighted to support the Government of Pakistan and specifically the Ministry of Climate Change in providing the people of Pakistan with increased access to safe drinking water and improving their quality of life.”
Under the project, KOICA and UNOPS helped the government make progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: 3: Good Health and Wellbeing; and 6: Clean Water and Sanitation as it is aligned with the Pakistan Government’s Vision 2025 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for Pakistan 2023-2027.
This project also supports achieving SDG 13: Climate Action as water is at the center of climate change; rising temperatures and climate related disasters are introducing deadly pathogens in the freshwater. Enhanced water-quality monitoring systems will identify the patterns of contamination, take mitigation measures accordingly and support the communities during climate change induced disasters.

ADB and UNICEF join hands to strengthen climate resilient water and sanitation services in two major cities of Pakistan
New partnership will benefit up to 1.5 million people
Islamabad, Pakistan, 6 March 2024 — The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) today signed a Letter of Understanding (LOU) to collaborate on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and solid waste management interventions under an ADB-funded project in the cities of Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur in Punjab province of Pakistan.
The agreement was signed by Yong Ye, ADB Country Director for Pakistan, and Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF’s Representative in Pakistan, at UNICEF’s Pakistan office in Islamabad.
“ADB and UNICEF are joining forces and renewing our shared commitment to strengthen policy, legislative framework, and institutional capacity in municipal service delivery, this time to improve the quality, coverage, and reliability of urban services under the Developing Resilient Environments and Advancing Municipal Services (DREAMS) Project,” said Mr. Ye. “The collaboration will enable us to support the government’s efforts to address water supply and solid waste management challenges in these two important and rapidly growing cities.”
Under the new partnership, ADB and UNICEF will collaborate to support inclusive, resilient, and sustainable urban infrastructure and services in Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur through public awareness and communication campaigns that will improve behaviours and practices related to water, sanitation, and solid waste management.
The understanding reached between ADB and UNICEF Pakistan offices will help promote sustainable, inclusive, and low carbon municipal services that will benefit up to 1.5 million urban dwellers in the two cities of Punjab, the most populous province of the country.
“Signing of this agreement further strengthens the existing collaboration between ADB and UNICEF in Pakistan,” said Mr. Fadil. “Both organisations are committed to leveraging collective expertise and knowledge to help increase equitable access to water, sanitation and hygiene services and to reduce vulnerability of citizens, especially children and women, to growing climate change and environmental degradation.”
The close synergies between ADB’s DREAMS project and UNICEF's WASH program present a significant opportunity to enhance the impact of the programs, ultimately leading to positive outcomes in water, sanitation, and hygiene that will benefit communities in Pakistan. The agreement will also pave the way for collaboration in future phases of the DREAMS project and other projects in Pakistan.
This is the second formal agreement between the two organisations at the country level, following the collaboration to procure emergency medical supplies and equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

National Coalition for Social Justice cements the commitment of partners to addressing inequalities and promoting social justice in Pakistan.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (ILO News) – The launch of the National Coalition for Social Justice today marks a meaningful step towards advancing social justice for everyone and everywhere, as leaders from Government, employers' and workers' organizations reaffirmed their commitment to work together for decent work and social justice.
Hosted by the Ministry of Overseas Pakistani and Human Resource Development (MOPHRD), the event was held to commemorate World Day of Social Justice and drew participation from key stakeholders in the world of work.
With the decision to create a National Coalition for Social Justice, Pakistan has taken the first step in implementing commitments made when Pakistan became the first country with both government, employer and worker partnership in the ILO-launched Global Coalition for Social Justice last year.
The Coalition reinforces the recognition that all women and men have the right to pursue their material well-being and spiritual development in conditions of freedom, security, equity and human dignity. With the launch of the National Coalition, Pakistan underscores its commitment to a fairer, more inclusive society.
Driven by the urgency to address widening disparities in the world of work, the participants at the ceremony recognized the challenges posed by climate change, shifting demographics, technological advancements, and the evolving landscape of employment. They stressed the critical need for a coordinated response to address such disparities and build fairer, more inclusive societies.
Speaking at the occasion, Dr. Arshad Mahmood, Federal Secretary, OPHRD, stated that “One of the most pressing issues we face is the gender gap in the labour force, with women comprising only about 21% of the Pakistani workforce. Discrimination and inequalities not only impede economic growth but also exclude a significant portion of the population from the labour market. They undermine social progress, and most importantly, they violate fundamental human rights.”
Dr. Mahmood further added that while the government has taken steps to address these issues, including passing laws to protect women's rights and providing support to women entrepreneurs, more concerted efforts are needed to tackle the root causes of these inequalities.
Geir Tonstol, Country Director for ILO Pakistan stated that “Today, far too many people are denied access to quality education, decent jobs, and social protection, making the quest for social justice more important than ever. The establishment of the National Coalition for Social Justice presents a historic opportunity to focus on injustices in the world of work and promote cooperation for an inclusive and equitable world of work for all and everywhere.”
Chaudhry Naseem Iqbal, President of the Pakistan Worker’s Federations said “This marks a significant milestone for the workers' movement in Pakistan, as the actions outlined within the coalition align with the advocacy efforts undertaken by workers' organizations over the decades. The commitment from the three Tripartite constituents today is a crucial step forward, laying the foundation to transform Social Justice from an aspiration into a tangible reality.”
“I am thrilled to announce our association with the ILO-launched Global Coalition for Social Justice. At EFP, we firmly believe that social justice is not merely an ideal but a practical tool for achieving equitable and sustainable development. The cornerstone of our commitment lies in ensuring decent work for all – a concept that forms the bedrock of our endeavors,” said Malik Tahir Javed, President of the Employers’ Federation of Pakistan.
Background:
The Global Coalition for Social Justice is a ground-breaking initiative aimed at intensifying collective efforts to urgently address social justice deficits and to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the Decent Work Agenda. It creates a collaborative space for action, dialogue, and advocacy, in which partners shape individual and collective opportunities for concrete actions and tangible outcomes. The ultimate goal will be to achieve a greater balance amongst sustainable development's economic, social, and environmental dimensions, significantly reduce inequalities and poverty, and meet essential needs and opportunities worldwide.

Fewer than one in ten children in low-income countries have access to child benefits, leaving them vulnerable to disease, missed education, poor nutrition, poverty and inequality
NEW YORK, 14 February 2024 – Globally, 1.4 billion children aged 0-15 lack any form of social protection, leaving them vulnerable to disease, poor nutrition and poverty, according to new data released today by the International Labour Organization (ILO), Save the Children and UNICEF.
In low-income countries, less than one in ten children in this age group have access to child benefits, highlighting a significant disparity compared to the coverage enjoyed by children in high-income countries.
Child benefits are a critical form of social protection, intended to promote the long-term wellbeing of children. Paid in cash or tax credits, child benefits are essential for reducing poverty, as well as accessing healthcare, nutrition, quality education and water and sanitation. Additionally, these benefits support socio-economic development, particularly in times of crisis.
In such contexts, many children are deprived of the basic resources and services they need to escape poverty, and are therefore exposed to the long-lasting impacts of hunger, malnutrition, and unrealised potential.  The three organisations are calling on governments to ensure all children are shielded by social protection mechanisms, including through universal child benefits.

The data shows there has been a modest global increase in access to child benefits over a period of 14 years, from 20 per cent in 2009 to 28.1 per cent in 2023. However, the progress has been unequal. In low-income countries, rates of coverage remain staggeringly low, at around 9 per cent. At the same time, 84.6 per cent of children in high-income countries are covered.
Coverage rates for children in countries that are highly vulnerable to climate impacts are a third lower than those in countries that are not classified as being at high risk.  Ensuring children are covered by social protection is key to protecting them from the worst impacts of the climate crisis.
“Globally, there are 333 million children living in extreme poverty, struggling to survive on less than US$2.15 per day, and nearly 1 billion children living in multidimensional poverty. At the current rate of progress, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals’ poverty targets are out of reach. This is unacceptable. However, ending child poverty is a policy choice.  Expanding social protection coverage of children in the fight against poverty is critical, including the progressive realisation of universal child benefits,” said Natalia Winder Rossi, Director, Social Policy and Social Protection, UNICEF.
Regional breakdown of child benefits coverage between 2009-2023:
More marked improvements have occurred for the same period in:
“This is a crisis for the over one billion children who are not covered by benefits, and for the countries in which they live. There is an urgent need for effective policymaking to help us close protection gaps. Regional inequalities in coverage and progress are of serious concern – improvement in child benefit coverage is marginal in most regions and too many children are still being left behind.” said Shahra Razavi, Director of the Social Protection Department at the ILO.’’
To bolster efforts to monitor and reduce the gaps in child benefit coverage, Save the Children, ILO and UNICEF have developed the Global Child Benefits Tracker, an online platform to monitor children’s access to benefits, and advocate with governments and donors to close the gaps. This launch comes at a critical time when most recent data shows that 829 million children globally are living in households with per-person incomes below US$3.65 a day and progress on child poverty reduction has largely stalled.
“Child benefits support families to afford better nourishment, health, education, and protection and are key for realising children’s rights and enhancing their potential as adults. Child benefits are therefore critical to building inclusive and resilient economies for the future.  Unfortunately, many countries have not prioritised investment in social protection. Through the Child Benefits Tracker, we highlight the scale of global child poverty and examples of progress to inspire greater political will and investment in child-sensitive social protection systems,” said David Lambert Tumwesigye, Global Policy & Advocacy Lead for Child Poverty at Save the Children International.

The three agencies urge policymakers and donors to take decisive steps to attain universal social protection for all children, by:

Initiative to restore more than 30 per cent of Pakistan’s Indus River Basin by 2030 named one of seven UN World Restoration Flagships
Nairobi, 13 February 2024 – Efforts by local communities and civil society groups to protect and restore Pakistan’s Indus Basin, which has been rapidly degrading, are gaining momentum through the Government of Pakistan’s Living Indus initiative.
Boosting biodiversity, climate mitigation and community resilience through nature- based solutions, these efforts were today named as one of seven UN World Restoration Flagships.
The World Restoration Flagship awards are part of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration – led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) – which aims to prevent, halt, and reverse the degradation of ecosystems on every continent and in every ocean. The awards track notable initiatives following global commitments to restore one billion hectares – an area larger than China.
“The Living Indus initiative presents a unique opportunity to enhance the resilience of the Indus ecosystem in the face of climate change,” said Ahmad Irfan Aslam,
Pakistan’s Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination. “This holistic strategy employs community-led, gender-responsive, and transparent nature- based solutions for restoring the entire Indus Basin, safeguarding its resources for the people of Pakistan.”
The Basin is also home to 195 mammal species, at least 668 bird species, and over 150 fish species, including 22 endemic ones and the endangered Indus Blind Dolphin, one of the world’s rarest mammals.
In recent years, Pakistan has experienced some of its most catastrophic floods and extreme heat waves on record, as well as spiralling air pollution levels, all of which are exacerbated by climate change and severely affect the lives and livelihoods of millions.
“Pakistan’s climate induced disasters in recent years have been heart-breaking, causing destruction on a scale that no nation can, or should have to, accept,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “It is therefore important to recognize and support projects like the Living Indus initiative for the hope and resilience it can offer Pakistan and the region.”
The Living Indus initiative advances the sustainable management of the Indus River Basin, seeking to balance water resource use, ecosystem preservation, and socio- economic development.

By promoting responsible water management, reducing pollution, preserving biodiversity, and enhancing community engagement, it helps ensure a climate resilient future for Pakistan.
The basin-wide initiative has already restored 1,350,000 hectares. It encompasses 25 projects, and it is estimated to cost up to USD 17 billion. With its recognition as a World Restoration Flagship, the Living Indus initiative will now be eligible for additional technical and financial UN support, bolstering its plans to restore 25 million hectares of the river basin by 2030 (encompassing more than 30 per cent of Pakistan’s area).
“Pakistan and its people have been living off the Indus Basin for 6,000 years. Today, 95 per cent of the population, all the country’s agriculture and most of its industries depend on it,” said Julien Harneis, the former UN Resident Coordinator in Pakistan. “However, it suffers not only from the impact of climate change, but also from human-induced environmental degradation. The Living Indus Initiative brings together the government, civil society, the UN and all the countries that support Pakistan to protect the Indus’ future.”
As a World Restoration Flagship, the Living Indus Initiative is recognized as one of the best examples of large-scale and long-term ecosystem restoration in any country or region, embodying the 10 Restoration Principles of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. The announcement of seven new World Restoration Flagships was
made ahead of the 6th UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-6), held between February 26 and March 1, 2024. The Assembly will convene the world’s Environment Ministers in Nairobi, Kenya to address the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste.

Over 50% of KP’s Population to Benefit as KOICA and UNOPS Hand Over 8 Mobile Water Testing Vehicles To KP Government and 1 field training van to PCRWR
Peshawar: In an event held at the Chief Minister House, Mr Yeon Je Ho, Country Director KOICA Pakistan and Ms Jennifer Ankhom-Khan, Country Manager UNOPS Pakistan, handed over 8 mobile water testing vehicles to Honourable Justice Retired Syed Arshad Hussain Shah, Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and one field training van to Dr. Hifza Rasheed, Director General of PCRWR (Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources) Islamabad.
In partnership with KOICA, UNOPS Pakistan procured, remodeled and fully equipped 8 vehicles. These mobile water testing laboratories will play a vital role in testing the quality of water in far-flung areas of the province to ensure clean drinking water is available to the public.
These vehicles will also be used to respond to public health emergencies during natural disasters or spread of waterborne diseases. UNOPS has procured and remodeled the 9 vehicles as per the international standards and equipped with latest technology to ensure quick, accurate, and hassle free testing of contaminants such as arsenic, heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria through microbial testing in the drinking water.
The vehicles are delivered as part of 4.4 million USD project, funded by KOICA and implemented by UNOPS in collaboration with the Ministry of Climate Change Pakistan (MoCC), Public Health and Engineering Departments of KP and Punjab, PCRWR and Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA).
Interim Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Justice (r) Syed Arshad Hussain Shah said: "The project underscores the effectiveness of collective efforts in addressing pressing development issues and the work towards achieving sustainable development goals"
The project is being implemented in 35 district laboratories in Punjab, 8 divisional labs in KP, PCRWR and Pak-EPA in Islamabad.
UNOPS has also developed a Management Information Software (MIS) to strengthen the water-quality data management at provincial level and enable the Ministry of Climate Change to coordinate and monitor the drinking water quality in close collaboration with provincial governments in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The MIS will also ensure smooth and paperless lab operations in the province of KP.
Mr. Yeon Je Ho, Country Director of KOICA Pakistan said: “The Korean Government will continue to support the Government of Pakistan in different sectors, especially in the water sector. I believe that this project will improve people’s quality of life by enhancing water quality and will help in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.”
UNOPS Pakistan is implementing this project in collaboration with the Ministry of Climate Change Pakistan (MoCC), Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and Public Health and Engineering Departments of Punjab & KP.
The water-quality testing laboratories are being upgraded through:
Miss Jennifer Ankrom-Khan, UNOPS Country Manager for Pakistan, said:  “Access to adequate and safe drinking water is a basic human right and monitoring the quality of drinking water is a first step towards its management. In Pakistan, millions of people still live without access to clean and safe drinking water as it guarantees healthier and resilient communities. The absence of clean drinking water spreads waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A&E etc., and leads to malnutrition in children. With generous support from KOICA, we are delighted to support the Government of Pakistan and specifically the Ministry of Climate Change in providing the people of Pakistan with increased access to safe drinking water and improving their quality of life.”
Under the project, KOICA and UNOPS will help the government make progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: 3: Good Health and Wellbeing; and 6: Clean Water and Sanitation as it is aligned with the Pakistan Government’s Vision 2025 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for Pakistan 2023-2027.
This project also supports achieving SDG 13: Climate Action as water is at the center of climate change; rising temperatures and climate related disasters are introducing deadly pathogens in the freshwater. Enhanced water-quality monitoring systems will identify the patterns of contamination, take mitigation measures accordingly and support the communities during climate change induced disasters.

ILO and EFP launch ‘Roadmap for Business Engagement’ to promote SDGs
The roadmap for business engagement would represent a united business voice in Pakistan, showcasing the contribution of the business community to SDGs.
KARACHI, Pakistan (ILO News) – The Employers’ Federation of Pakistan (EFP) launched the “Roadmap for Business Engagement” under the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for Pakistan in Karachi today. Developed with the technical support of the International Labour Organization (ILO), EFP's launch is a step closer to the meaningful implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The initiative, led by the Pakistan Business Task Force (PBTF) within EFP, aims to represent a united business community and contribute meaningfully to the achievement of the SDGs in Pakistan. The event was attended by representatives from the Government, United Nations, employers’ organizations, business community, and other stakeholders.
The PBTF is a joint business group inclusive of EFP, The Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCIS), and like-minded business associations, aiming to unify the business community's voice across sectors and regions in Pakistan. The business task force plays a crucial role in highlighting pressure points that require urgent attention and showcasing the private sector's contribution to the SDGs.
The President of the Employers’ Federation of Pakistan, Tahir Javed Malik, opened the event by highlighting the pivotal role the private sector plays in driving progress towards the SDGs.
“I commend the EFP and its partner organizations for their invaluable work in promoting the SDGs, labor, and human rights. ILO acknowledges the private sector's crucial role in achieving these goals, and therefore, today’s launch marks a step to further strengthen coordination and collective contribution to the achievement of the SDGs,” said Geir Tonstol, Country Director for ILO Pakistan.
Geir Tonstol emphasized the role of tripartite stakeholders in creating a favourable policy and regulatory framework while the private sector implements commitments aligned with the sustainability agenda. “The importance of collaboration, data collection frameworks, and transparent communication to foster a conducive environment for private-sector engagement is key,” he added.
Speaking at the event, Shah Nasir, Head of the United Nations Resident Coordinators Office, underscored the need for private sector involvement to turbocharge progress on the SDGs, praising the PBTF as a platform for facilitating such participation while presenting the UNSDCF.
Ravi Peris, Senior Specialist in Employers’ Activities - Decent Work Team Delhi, highlighted the significance of the PBTF, stating that "The PBTF represents a united business voice in Pakistan, showcasing the contribution of business to SDGs and conveying the kind of business environment needed for the private sector to promote SDGs."
In his concluding remarks, Nazar Ali, Secretary-General of EFP, extended his sincere thanks to the participants, expressing optimism about creating a sustainable and inclusive future. He urged collaboration for transformative change, working towards a more just and prosperous society.
The roadmap recommends collaborative data collection frameworks, the integration of private-sector SDG-related data into national reporting frameworks, and transparent communication with the public. It aims to address challenges such as a lack of awareness of SDGs among formal and informal sector employers and stakeholders, inadequate stakeholder capacity on SDGs, and the need for financial incentives for those already engaged in SDG initiatives while identifying organizational best practices for private-sector contributions to sustainable development.

PRESS RELEASE
ILO launches phase two of cotton workers’ rights project
Cotton-growing communities will be empowered to assert Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (FPRW).
LAHORE, Pakistan (ILO News) – Building on the success of the first phase (2017-2023), the International Labour Organization (ILO) launched the second phase of the programme to promote and realize Fundamental Principles and Rights (FPRW) at Work in the cotton sector.
Funded by INDITEX, the International Labour Organization launched the second phase of the FPRW project at a ceremony in Lahore today. The initiative focuses on building the capacity of cotton-growing communities to advocate for their rights and address gender inequalities in the sector, supporting the most vulnerable cotton-growing communities across Pakistan.
The cotton-growing communities in the selected areas of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan provinces will have improved access to organizing associations for farmers and trade unions under the second phase of the International Labour Organization’s Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (FPRW) project.
The event was attended by representatives from the Government, employers’ and workers' organizations, and other stakeholders working in the cotton sector.
“In the heart of cotton-producing communities, an undeniable reality still persists – children can be found working. Also, women tend to be relegated to lower-paying tasks in some of the most demanding parts of the agricultural cycle. The battle for equality within this sector is compounded by a complex web of discriminatory factors,” said Geir Tonstol, Country Director for ILO in Pakistan.
In advocating for decent work in the cotton communities, he stated that ILO promotes freedom of association and collective bargaining, combats forced labour and child labour and advocates for a safe and healthy working environment in cotton-producing communities. He further emphasized, “realizing these standards would reduce inequality and ensure a more balanced distribution of wealth, thus contributing to sustainable economic growth. The project will also support and establish an institutional mechanism to address vulnerabilities related to fundamental principles and rights at work through social dialogue and scaling up good practices in the rural economy.”
Background:
The ILO and INDITEX, one of the world’s largest fashion retailers, entered into a partnership in 2017 to promote an integrated approach to Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (FPRW) in the cotton supply chain in China, India, Mali and Pakistan, and global component in Geneva. This new, three-year project (Phase II) will operate in India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan as well as at the global level. INDITEX has supported the ILO in promoting respect for labour rights, social dialogue, worker well-being and empowerment in selected cotton-growing areas of these three countries. The mission of its Sustainability Policy is to ensure that its business activity is carried out with full respect for people, the environment and the community at large.

PRESS RELEASE
Brainstorming Session on Smog, GHG Emissions reduction and Air Quality Issues in Pakistan
Islamabad, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) organized a brainstorming session to address smog, GHG emissions, and air quality concerns in Pakistan. On 21 November 2023, the AQI reading during the early hours of the day was 345, ranking Lahore as the second worst city in the world for air quality. An AQI above 151 is unhealthy, while above 301 the air is hazardous for breathing. Lahore and other cities in the province of Punjab are under a smog emergency every year during the winter season. The objective was to tackle the pressing issue of declining air quality by identifying effective practical solutions.
The session included involvement from various key stakeholders including Ms. Florence Rolle, FAO Representative; Ms. Farzana Altaf Shah, DG EPA; Mr. Ashiq Nawaz, Director EPA; Mr. M. Anwar Chaudhry, Senior Chief, Planning Commission; Mr. Faiz ul Sibtain, Assistant Director PEC; Mr. M Azim Khoso, Director (UA) MoCC; and Brig. Mohammad Ashraf.
Mr. Jawed Ali Khan, the Habitat Programme Manager at UN-Habitat, extended a warm welcome to the participants, shedding light on the conference's origins as a response to severe smog occurrences during winters in major Punjab cities. The smog annually affects residents, leading authorities to shut down schools, offices, and parks for extended periods, disrupting daily life. UN-Habitat's primary goal is to address the intricate issues of deteriorating air quality by creating a collaborative platform for joint efforts, focusing on developing tangible solutions, particularly in energy-efficient building practices.
A comprehensive presentation on 'Spatio-Temporal mapping on Smog and its underlying causes using GIS techniques' was delivered by FAO. The presentation highlighted key contributors to smog, such as transport, industry, power, and agriculture (crop residue burning). FAO emphasized that the transport sector is the primary contributor, accounting for 42% of air pollution in Punjab.
Brig. M. Ashraf introduced the concept of 'Energized Buildings' as a strategy to address Pakistan's energy crisis and combat climate change. This concept involves using solar energy to transfer subsoil temperatures (23 – 24oC) into buildings during the day, maintaining cool temperatures. Additionally, passive energy stored within the buildings is used at night, contributing to energy efficiency. Mr. Ashraf concluded that the benefits include lower emissions, a solution to the energy crisis, and cost-effective heating and cooling throughout the year.
After the presentations, stakeholders engaged in constructive discussions, agreeing on a collaborative approach to address various issues related to deteriorating air quality. The consensus was to work together to formulate energy-efficient practices, promote sustainable urban development, and implement targeted interventions in sectors contributing significantly to air pollution. This collaboration involves fostering cooperation among government bodies, environmental agencies, and the public to ensure tangible improvements in air quality, paving the way for a healthier and sustainable future for the affected regions. It was decided to constitute two technical committees, i. Develop strategy to address the issue of smog by improving air quality; ii. Development of Strategy for addressing the issue of GHG emissions from the building construction sector.

PREVENTING FAMINE AND DEADLY DISEASE OUTBREAKS IN GAZA REQUIRES FASTER, SAFER AID ACCESS AND MORE SUPPLY ROUTES
ROME/GENEVA/NEW YORK – As the risk of famine grows, and more people are exposed to deadly disease outbreaks, a fundamental step change in the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza is urgently needed, United Nations agencies warned today. The heads of the World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) say that getting enough supplies into and across Gaza now depends on: the opening of new entry routes; more trucks being allowed through border checks each day; fewer restrictions on the movement of humanitarian workers; and guarantees of safety for people accessing and distributing aid.
Without the ability to produce or import food, the entire population of Gaza relies on aid to survive. But humanitarian aid alone cannot meet the essential needs of the Gaza people. The United Nations, international aid agencies and non-governmental organizations have so far managed to deliver limited humanitarian assistance in Gaza, despite extraordinarily difficult conditions, but the quantities fall far short of what is needed to prevent a deadly combination of hunger, malnutrition, and disease. The shortage of food, clean water, and medical assistance is particularly severe in the northern areas.
Humanitarian action is seriously limited by the closure of all but two border crossings in the south and the multi-layered vetting process for trucks coming into Gaza. Once inside, efforts to set up service points for people in need are hampered by bombardments and constantly shifting battle fronts, which endanger the lives of ordinary Gazans and the UN and other humanitarian personnel striving to help them.
“People in Gaza risk dying of hunger just miles from trucks filled with food,” said WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain. “Every hour lost puts countless lives at risk. We can keep famine at bay but only if we can deliver sufficient supplies and have safe access to everyone in need, wherever they are.”
The latest Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification (IPC) report found devastating levels of food insecurity in Gaza and confirmed that the entire population of Gaza – roughly 2.2 million people – are in crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity. Virtually all Palestinians in Gaza are skipping meals every day while many adults go hungry so children can eat, and the report warned of famine, if current conditions persist.
WFP has been providing food to people inside Gaza every day since 7 October and reached more than 900,000 people with food assistance in December. This has required pivoting to new ways of operating with local partners, including finding safe sites for distributions, channelling wheat flour into bakeries so that they can resume production, and distributing special food supplements to help children fight off malnutrition. On Thursday, WFP’s first food convoy to North Gaza since the humanitarian pause delivered food supplies for around 8,000 people.
The conflict has also damaged or destroyed essential water, sanitation and health infrastructure and services and limited capacity to treat severe malnutrition and infectious disease outbreaks. With Gaza’s 335,000 children under 5 years of age especially vulnerable, UNICEF projects that, in the next few weeks, child wasting, the most life-threatening form of malnutrition in children, could increase from pre-crisis conditions by nearly 30 per cent, affecting up to 10,000 children.
“Children at high risk of dying from malnutrition and disease desperately need medical treatment, clean water and sanitation services, but the conditions on the ground do not allow us to safely reach children and families in need,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.  “Some of the material we desperately need to repair and increase water supply remain restricted from entering Gaza. The lives of children and their families are hanging in the balance. Every minute counts.”
UNICEF has been warning since November that children in southern Gaza are accessing only 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, well below the recommended requirements for survival. To address this, UNICEF and partners have provided safe drinking water to over 1.3 million people, but much more is needed to address the desperate conditions. UNICEF has also provided medical supplies, including 600,000 doses of vaccine, nutritional supplements and vitamins to children and pregnant women, and humanitarian cash transfers to over 500,000 households.
Since the start of the hostilities, WHO and partners have been supporting the health system in Gaza with deliveries of medical equipment and supplies, medicines, fuel; coordination of emergency medical teams; and disease surveillance. There have been more than a dozen high-risk missions to deliver supplies to hospitals in northern and southern Gaza.  WHO and partners helped establish two kitchens at Al-Shifa hospital, now serving 1200 meals a day and delivered medical supplies to support treatment for up to 1,250 children with severe acute malnutrition, and the establishment of therapeutic feeding centres.
“People in Gaza are suffering from a lack of food, water, medicines and adequate healthcare. Famine will make an already terrible situation catastrophic because sick people are more likely to succumb to starvation and starving people are more vulnerable to disease”, said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We need unimpeded, safe access to deliver aid and a humanitarian ceasefire to prevent further death and suffering.”
Israeli authorization to use a working port close to the Gaza Strip and border crossing points into the north is critically needed by aid agencies. Access to Ashdod port, roughly 40 km to the north, would enable significantly larger quantities of aid to be shipped in and then trucked directly to the badly affected northern regions of Gaza, which few convoys have managed to reach.
“The flow of aid has been a trickle in comparison to a sea of humanitarian needs,” said Phillip Lazzarini, Commissioner General for the UN Palestine Refugee Agency (UNRWA).  “Humanitarian aid will not be enough to reverse the worsening hunger among the population. Commercial supplies are a must to allow the markets and private sector to re-open and provide an alternative to food accessibility.”
The agency heads emphasize the urgent need to lift the barriers and restrictions on aid delivery to and within Gaza, and for commercial traffic to resume. They reiterated the call for a humanitarian ceasefire to enable this vitally important roll-out of a massive, multi-agency humanitarian operation.

Islamabad, January 15, 2024: Survivors of sexual violence including rape suffer tremendously from physical impacts, emotional trauma and social stigmatization. Therefore, confidential, comprehensive and timely medico-legal  service and psychosocial support must be available to help them.. As a step towards ensuring an expeditious and effective redressal mechanism, an Anti-Rape Crisis Centre is established at Pakistan Institute of medical Sciences (PIMS) in Islamabad for survivors of sexual violence. The centre is established by the Ministry of Law and Justice and Ministry of Health with the support from the UK Government, UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and Legal Aid Society.
This step is part of the implementation of the Anti-Rape (Trial and Investigation) Act, 2021 which ensured justice for survivors of sexual offences and the provision of services and support they may need before, during and after a trial. The law necessitated the establishment of Anti-Rape Crisis Centers (ARCCs) at  district level within DHQ hospital to provide survivors with access to multiple services including FIR registration, collection of evidence and a medical examination.
Speaking at the occasion, Mr. Raja Naeem Akbar, Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice appreciated the support of all partners in establishing the centre. He stated that ‘the centre will be helpful in addressing the critical issues of gender-based violence". He further emphasized on the establishment of   Anti-Rape Crisis Centres at provincial level and importance of availability of functional ARCCS throughout Pakistan to ensure timely and effective assistance to survivors of rape’.
Speaking at the occasion, Mr. Iftikhar Ali Shallwani, Secretary MoNHSRC said ‘We must also ensure the access of this crucial service to communities living in the outskirts of Islamabad. Due to stigma, many survivors hesitate to report or to walk to the centre. As a solution, we can tap on technology and enable people’s access to services through technology-based solutions. He stated that there should be a round-the-clock helpline or an app that can help survivors access these services and centres.’ He also emphasized on the need on the self-defense training for the girls in schools, and in public.
During her remarks, Ms. Ayesha Raza Farooq, Chairperson for the Special Committee on Anti-Rape Law and National Commission on Rights of Child, said ‘the anti-rape committee has framed comprehensive rules to usher in a new jurisprudence ready to combat sexual violence. The purpose of the Crisis cells is to provide timely response and expedite justice. It provides victim-centric support round the clock. Looking ahead, the goal is to allow every citizen, especially women and children to claim public spaces and travel on public routes without any fear and vulnerability of sexual violence.’
Addressing the audience, Dr. Luay Shabaneh, UNFPA Representative said ‘Rape is an ugly crime which causes lifelong pain and psychological trauma to those who face it. By all means, rape is a crisis which needs a collective response. We should start from prevention and awareness raising but we should also ensure a comprehensive response s to help those in need. He stated that such collective, coordinated and timely response services are absolutely necessary. I hope this Anti-Rape Crisis Centre will be the first building brick to a comprehensive Sexual Violence Response and will be expanded throughout the country. UNFPA stands ready to support the government in making these interventions meaningful and helpful for women.’
Addressing the audience, chief guest Ms. Jane Marriot, UK’s High Commissioner, said “Anti-rape crisis cell in PIMS Islamabad is a significant milestone in addressing gender-based violence in Pakistan. This new antirape crisis facility will ensure that gender-based violence survivors are provided with  quicker response services under one roof. The UK is proud to partner with Pakistan in advancing such important innovations for tackling violence.”
Prof. Dr. Rana Imran Sikandar, Executive Director, PIMS said that the hospital is committed to every support possible to the survivors of sexual violence and to reduce their trauma through psycho social support. He assured that the rape cases will be dealt through a holistic approach and with respect, care and confidentiality throughout the medical examination.

PREVENTING FAMINE AND DEADLY DISEASE OUTBREAKS IN GAZA REQUIRES FASTER, SAFER AID ACCESS AND MORE SUPPLY ROUTES
ROME/GENEVA/NEW YORK – As the risk of famine grows, and more people are exposed to deadly disease outbreaks, a fundamental step change in the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza is urgently needed, United Nations agencies warned today. The heads of the World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) say that getting enough supplies into and across Gaza now depends on: the opening of new entry routes; more trucks being allowed through border checks each day; fewer restrictions on the movement of humanitarian workers; and guarantees of safety for people accessing and distributing aid.
Without the ability to produce or import food, the entire population of Gaza relies on aid to survive. But humanitarian aid alone cannot meet the essential needs of the Gaza people. The United Nations, international aid agencies and non-governmental organizations have so far managed to deliver limited humanitarian assistance in Gaza, despite extraordinarily difficult conditions, but the quantities fall far short of what is needed to prevent a deadly combination of hunger, malnutrition, and disease. The shortage of food, clean water, and medical assistance is particularly severe in the northern areas.
Humanitarian action is seriously limited by the closure of all but two border crossings in the south and the multi-layered vetting process for trucks coming into Gaza. Once inside, efforts to set up service points for people in need are hampered by bombardments and constantly shifting battle fronts, which endanger the lives of ordinary Gazans and the UN and other humanitarian personnel striving to help them.
“People in Gaza risk dying of hunger just miles from trucks filled with food,” said WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain. “Every hour lost puts countless lives at risk. We can keep famine at bay but only if we can deliver sufficient supplies and have safe access to everyone in need, wherever they are.”
The latest Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification (IPC) report found devastating levels of food insecurity in Gaza and confirmed that the entire population of Gaza – roughly 2.2 million people – are in crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity. Virtually all Palestinians in Gaza are skipping meals every day while many adults go hungry so children can eat, and the report warned of famine, if current conditions persist.
WFP has been providing food to people inside Gaza every day since 7 October and reached more than 900,000 people with food assistance in December. This has required pivoting to new ways of operating with local partners, including finding safe sites for distributions, channelling wheat flour into bakeries so that they can resume production, and distributing special food supplements to help children fight off malnutrition. On Thursday, WFP’s first food convoy to North Gaza since the humanitarian pause delivered food supplies for around 8,000 people.
The conflict has also damaged or destroyed essential water, sanitation and health infrastructure and services and limited capacity to treat severe malnutrition and infectious disease outbreaks. With Gaza’s 335,000 children under 5 years of age especially vulnerable, UNICEF projects that, in the next few weeks, child wasting, the most life-threatening form of malnutrition in children, could increase from pre-crisis conditions by nearly 30 per cent, affecting up to 10,000 children.
“Children at high risk of dying from malnutrition and disease desperately need medical treatment, clean water and sanitation services, but the conditions on the ground do not allow us to safely reach children and families in need,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.  “Some of the material we desperately need to repair and increase water supply remain restricted from entering Gaza. The lives of children and their families are hanging in the balance. Every minute counts.”
UNICEF has been warning since November that children in southern Gaza are accessing only 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, well below the recommended requirements for survival. To address this, UNICEF and partners have provided safe drinking water to over 1.3 million people, but much more is needed to address the desperate conditions. UNICEF has also provided medical supplies, including 600,000 doses of vaccine, nutritional supplements and vitamins to children and pregnant women, and humanitarian cash transfers to over 500,000 households.
Since the start of the hostilities, WHO and partners have been supporting the health system in Gaza with deliveries of medical equipment and supplies, medicines, fuel; coordination of emergency medical teams; and disease surveillance. There have been more than a dozen high-risk missions to deliver supplies to hospitals in northern and southern Gaza.  WHO and partners helped establish two kitchens at Al-Shifa hospital, now serving 1200 meals a day and delivered medical supplies to support treatment for up to 1,250 children with severe acute malnutrition, and the establishment of therapeutic feeding centres.
“People in Gaza are suffering from a lack of food, water, medicines and adequate healthcare. Famine will make an already terrible situation catastrophic because sick people are more likely to succumb to starvation and starving people are more vulnerable to disease”, said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We need unimpeded, safe access to deliver aid and a humanitarian ceasefire to prevent further death and suffering.”
Israeli authorization to use a working port close to the Gaza Strip and border crossing points into the north is critically needed by aid agencies. Access to Ashdod port, roughly 40 km to the north, would enable significantly larger quantities of aid to be shipped in and then trucked directly to the badly affected northern regions of Gaza, which few convoys have managed to reach.
“The flow of aid has been a trickle in comparison to a sea of humanitarian needs,” said Phillip Lazzarini, Commissioner General for the UN Palestine Refugee Agency (UNRWA).  “Humanitarian aid will not be enough to reverse the worsening hunger among the population. Commercial supplies are a must to allow the markets and private sector to re-open and provide an alternative to food accessibility.”
The agency heads emphasize the urgent need to lift the barriers and restrictions on aid delivery to and within Gaza, and for commercial traffic to resume. They reiterated the call for a humanitarian ceasefire to enable this vitally important roll-out of a massive, multi-agency humanitarian operation.

Islamabad, January 15, 2024: Survivors of sexual violence including rape suffer tremendously from physical impacts, emotional trauma and social stigmatization. Therefore, confidential, comprehensive and timely medico-legal  service and psychosocial support must be available to help them.. As a step towards ensuring an expeditious and effective redressal mechanism, an Anti-Rape Crisis Centre is established at Pakistan Institute of medical Sciences (PIMS) in Islamabad for survivors of sexual violence. The centre is established by the Ministry of Law and Justice and Ministry of Health with the support from the UK Government, UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and Legal Aid Society.
This step is part of the implementation of the Anti-Rape (Trial and Investigation) Act, 2021 which ensured justice for survivors of sexual offences and the provision of services and support they may need before, during and after a trial. The law necessitated the establishment of Anti-Rape Crisis Centers (ARCCs) at  district level within DHQ hospital to provide survivors with access to multiple services including FIR registration, collection of evidence and a medical examination.
Speaking at the occasion, Mr. Raja Naeem Akbar, Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice appreciated the support of all partners in establishing the centre. He stated that ‘the centre will be helpful in addressing the critical issues of gender-based violence". He further emphasized on the establishment of   Anti-Rape Crisis Centres at provincial level and importance of availability of functional ARCCS throughout Pakistan to ensure timely and effective assistance to survivors of rape’.
Speaking at the occasion, Mr. Iftikhar Ali Shallwani, Secretary MoNHSRC said ‘We must also ensure the access of this crucial service to communities living in the outskirts of Islamabad. Due to stigma, many survivors hesitate to report or to walk to the centre. As a solution, we can tap on technology and enable people’s access to services through technology-based solutions. He stated that there should be a round-the-clock helpline or an app that can help survivors access these services and centres.’ He also emphasized on the need on the self-defense training for the girls in schools, and in public.
During her remarks, Ms. Ayesha Raza Farooq, Chairperson for the Special Committee on Anti-Rape Law and National Commission on Rights of Child, said ‘the anti-rape committee has framed comprehensive rules to usher in a new jurisprudence ready to combat sexual violence. The purpose of the Crisis cells is to provide timely response and expedite justice. It provides victim-centric support round the clock. Looking ahead, the goal is to allow every citizen, especially women and children to claim public spaces and travel on public routes without any fear and vulnerability of sexual violence.’
Addressing the audience, Dr. Luay Shabaneh, UNFPA Representative said ‘Rape is an ugly crime which causes lifelong pain and psychological trauma to those who face it. By all means, rape is a crisis which needs a collective response. We should start from prevention and awareness raising but we should also ensure a comprehensive response s to help those in need. He stated that such collective, coordinated and timely response services are absolutely necessary. I hope this Anti-Rape Crisis Centre will be the first building brick to a comprehensive Sexual Violence Response and will be expanded throughout the country. UNFPA stands ready to support the government in making these interventions meaningful and helpful for women.’
Addressing the audience, chief guest Ms. Jane Marriot, UK’s High Commissioner, said “Anti-rape crisis cell in PIMS Islamabad is a significant milestone in addressing gender-based violence in Pakistan. This new antirape crisis facility will ensure that gender-based violence survivors are provided with  quicker response services under one roof. The UK is proud to partner with Pakistan in advancing such important innovations for tackling violence.”
Prof. Dr. Rana Imran Sikandar, Executive Director, PIMS said that the hospital is committed to every support possible to the survivors of sexual violence and to reduce their trauma through psycho social support. He assured that the rape cases will be dealt through a holistic approach and with respect, care and confidentiality throughout the medical examination.

Statement by UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Kitty van der Heijden at the conclusion of COP28
NEW YORK, 12 December 2023 – “The COP28 climate negotiations generated welcome breakthroughs on both the urgent need to address the root causes of climate change – fossil fuels – and some glimmers of hope for breakthroughs of climate justice for children. Now to have any hope of turning these words into action, we must see a transformative scale up of climate financing.
“For the first time, the COP paid attention to the unique and disproportionate impacts of climate change on children's health and wellbeing, proposing an ‘expert dialogue’ on this to take place during the official COP process next year. This paves the way for change for the children bearing the brunt of climate chaos, and UNICEF stands ready to support.
“Meanwhile, the global goal on adaptation (GGA), which aims to help countries build up defenses to withstand climate hazards, was strengthened for children. By agreeing to new thematic targets on water, health and nutrition, and referencing social protection and education, the COP has sent a strong signal to relevant Ministries that they must build up the climate resilience of services children need, like schools, health, water and sanitation systems. Now, international adaptation finance must be scaled up to make this a reality.
“And where climate adaptation is missing or has failed, children massively lose out. The loss of life and livelihoods caused by unmanaged climate chaos in the present - driven by historic emissions - is a grave intergenerational injustice borne by children. The decision at COP28 to operationalize and capitalise the Loss and Damage Fund was an important step toward addressing this. If implemented well it should mean that children who survive climate disasters can at least count on their schools being rebuilt, child health services restored, and places to live and play made safe.
“These are welcome and necessary new commitments – achieved in no small part, thanks to the incredible efforts of youth advocates from all over the world, supported by UNICEF.
“Through the GGA and the Loss and Damage Fund, world leaders are beginning to treat the harmful symptoms of alarming temperature rises. Yet, until we see timely action to keep temperature rises within the 1.5 degree limit, they will not be treating the root causes.
The Global Stocktake (GST) document has broken new ground by acknowledging that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees requires drastic reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions and a transition away from fossil fuels. We now urgently need clear timelines for achieving this, consistent with both achieving global net zero and with a fast, fair and child-sensitive transition.
“Another future is still possible. A fast, fair and child-sensitive transition offers children a chance of developing new skills, new jobs and building a clean, secure, prosperous world. Children will not and cannot wait for adults to act, they will lead the change and it is incumbent on adults to help equip them with the skills, resources and opportunities to do so.
“This year, we were delighted to mark the first ever thematic day for children at COP, and we welcome a stronger role for a Youth Climate Champion, to engage children directly in climate action and the COP process. Giving young people a platform to have their say, is the right thing to do. But it is not enough. If adults stop at ‘passing the mic’ they risk also ‘passing the buck’. It is now time for world leaders to take seriously their responsibilities not only to listen to young people, but to act to protect vulnerable children facing climate chaos, especially the under 10s.
“Over the next 2 years, Governments must prepare and present new national climate action plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We urge world leaders to seize this window of opportunity, and work towards making COP30 a children’s COP – where we secure the 1.5 degree temperature limit that the next generation needs, and where all climate mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and finance plans have children at their heart”.

Awareness Workshop on Drug Use and HIV With Health Journalists
14 December 2023, Lahore - The Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, Islamabad organized an ‘Awareness Workshop on Drug Use and HIV’ on 14 December 2023 in collaboration with Ministry of Narcotics Control (MONC), UNODC, UNDP, UNAIDS and WHO in Lahore. Purpose of this workshop was to create awareness among health journalists on drug abuse, HIV AIDS, HIV prevention among people who inject drugs (PWID), harm reduction and OAMT.
The one-day workshop was attended by representatives of key media houses and prominent health journalists. Dr. Farrukh Mehmood, UNODC welcomed all the participants and said that the workshop is being organized to create awareness on drug use and drug use related HIV, the various interventions/approaches for drug dependence treatment and prevention of HIV and blood borne infections transmission among PWID.  Mr. Naeem Malik, Ministry of NHSR&C presented a brief background of HIV and AIDS epidemic in the country and shared other dynamics of this deadly and silent disease. He said Government of Pakistan is committed to halt the disease and putting all resources with the support of provincial AIDS Control Programs as well as UN partners and Global Fund for fight AIDS TB and Malaria. He shared that over the last decade, the disease is concentrated in certain key populations like Injecting drug users, Male sex worker and Transgender. He added that the epidemic in drug users in Pakistan is alarmingly high. He said this meeting is organized to share details of a newly initiative of OAMT which is related to address the issues related to drug users.
The participants were briefed that drug use has social and economic impact of drug use on families, society and country and the financial situation of the families of the drug users has an impact on family nutrition and education. The family of the drug user is socially isolated because of the stigma attached to drug use. Increased crime is also associated with drug use. There is high vulnerability of children to drug use due to presence of drug use in the family. Drug use increases the burden on health services, not only related to their drug treatment but also other health problems including Hepatitis B and C and HIV. As drug problem requires a comprehensive multisectoral response from various departments/sectors.
There is low level of awareness about harms associated with drug use and a serious need to raise awareness on drugs prevention including harms associated with drug use. Drug treatment services need to be strengthened both in terms of quality of drug treatment and coverage of treatment services. MONHSR&C, MONC and UNODC have developed ‘Drug treatment protocols’ and ‘Drug treatment guidelines’ for Pakistan. Several trainings based on the treatment guidelines were arranged for the treatment centres staff from the Government as well as private/NGO run drug treatment facilities. Risk behaviors (including sharing syringes and sexual risk behaviors) of drug users increase their vulnerability to HIV.  High HIV prevalence in people who inject drugs (PWID) shows that a lot needs to be done which includes increasing coverage of services for PWID.
World Health Organization and UNODC, consider drug dependence a chronically relapsing health disorder which often co-occurs with other mental and physical conditions. Drug dependence is not a failure of will or strength of character but a medical condition that could affect anyone. Just like any other chronic health condition, such as hypertension or diabetes, the treatment of drug dependence requires a health-oriented response. Among pharmacological approaches, WHO and UNODC recommend countries to introduce and expand access to opioid agonist maintenance treatment (OAMT) for people with opioid dependence. OAMT involves use of a safe prescribed medicine, such as buprenorphine under medical supervision. The benefits of OAMT have been documented by the WHO, UNODC and UNAIDS, the main benefit being that the person who has been using illicit drugs no longer experiences severe withdrawal symptoms and therefore is able to stabilize his/her life.  The injecting drug user stops injecting and sharing syringe which prevents transmission of HIV, Hepatitis and other blood borne diseases. People suffering from dependence on opioids require long-term drug treatment, rehabilitation and care. Drug dependence treatment aims at improving the health and quality of people suffering from drug dependence managed by people who are professionals and who understand the basic underlying health condition.

UNDP - PRESS RELEASE : Government of Germany and UNDP join hands for Flood Reconstruction and Coordination Programme
Government of Germany and UNDP join hands for Flood Reconstruction and Coordination Programme
Islamabad, 13 December 2023: The German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation & Development (BMZ) through KfW Development Bank has announced an allocation of EUR 12 million for flood recovery and reconstruction initiatives in Pakistan.
UNDP in partnership with the World Bank will provide support under a framework agreement towards effective implementation of Pakistan’s Resilient Recovery, Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction Framework (4RF) for a period of three years. With Germany’s financial assistance, the Flood Reconstruction and Coordination Programme will support the flood affected population in Pakistan through an expedited and integrated implementation of  4RF, including reconstructing houses in Balochistan.
KfW Country Director Mr. Sebastian Jacobi said: “This is a critical and timely programme in support of Pakistan’s post-flood development framework. As an infrastructure development bank, KfW takes pride in investing in infrastructure development and climate change adaptation in Pakistan. With BMZ’s funding foll owing the 2022 floods, KfW has so far invested EUR 50 million in flood recovery, reconstruction, and social protection in Pakistan. This programme will facilitate an overarching multilateral policy and institutional support. The programme will also assist concerned stakeholders in supporting 4RF planning and execution through enhanced capacities at various tiers of governance”.
UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative Dr. Samuel Rizk said on the occasion, "Our partnership with the Government of Germany is of critical importance as it combines international expertise with local knowledge to help address the challenges faced after the 2022 floods. Furthermore, I am especially pleased with our renewed partnership with the World Bank through this programme, which helps ensure that the funds pledged in January 2023 at the International Conference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva for Climate Resilience are used transparently and efficiently.”
Dr. Najy Benhassine, the World Bank Country Director for Pakistan said: “The Government of Pakistan, with support from bilateral and multilateral partners, is engaging on an ambitious reconstruction program for flood-affected areas. The inclusiveness of this effort will depend on the ability to direct limited funds to those communities and households which are most in need, and under this partnership, we are providing support which strengthens the transparency during the flood reconstruction. We reaffirm our commitment to support the flood affected people.”
The 2022 floods impacted the lives and livelihoods of 33 million people, causing 1,700 deaths, displacing 8 million people, and pushing 9  million people of the most vulnerable populations into extreme poverty. The partnership between the Government of Germany through KfW, UNDP, and the World Bank shows continued commitment in addressing Pakistan's post-flood challenges and supporting the country to recover and rebuild after the devastating floods.

UNDP Commemorates International Human Rights Day with local community at Faisalabad
Faisalabad, December 12 2023: Christian and Muslim community members, Faisalabad Catholic Church, National Commission for Human Rights, Government of Punjab’s Human Rights & Minority Affairs Department, civil society organisations along with local businesses, and UNDP Pakistan, jointly marked the International Human Rights Day voicing a shared message of solidarity, respect, equality, peace, non-discrimination, dignity for all and a core commitment to building a strong, inclusive and rights-based society in Pakistan.
The event organized by UNDP with the support of the Embassy of Norway in Pakistan, aimed at emphasizing and reinforcing the values of inter-faith harmony, equality, inclusion, the right to work, and to reiterate participants’ commitment to these values, also distributed goodwill food packages to 125 Christian and Muslim community members from Jaranwala neighbourhood.
Recognising Pakistan's constitutional provisions, specifically Article 25 (1) guaranteeing equality before the law for all citizens and Article 5 ensuring freedom of religious practice and cultural development for minorities, speakers spotlighted the need to translate these constitutional safeguards into tangible realities for all faith communities.
The violence in Jaranwala on the 16th of August 2023 that damaged Christian places of worship and homes, serves as a stark reminder of the imperative need for ongoing multi-sectoral investments in interfaith harmony and community cohesion. In partnership with Human Friends Organization, a Punjab based CSO working on interfaith harmony, local students from the St. Paul’s Girls High School performed a skit on interfaith harmony. The skit echoed the sentiments of the Muslim and Christian residents of Jaranwala who spoke about the importance of tolerance, respect and harmony with their neighbors.
Mr. Manzoor Masih, Member National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), reaffirmed the NCHR’s duty to promote the respect and protection of minorities and the realization of their human rights, including the right to dignified livelihoods. Most Reverend Bishop Dr. Indryas Rehmat spoke about the importance of working together across faiths, with the government and with development partners, for peace, equality, and prosperity of the most vulnerable in Pakistan.
“Promoting interfaith harmony and changing the mindset of people requires continuous advocacy at every level,” said Dr. Muhammad Shoaib Akbar, Secretary, Human Rights and Minority Affairs Department of Punjab, reaffirming the Punjab Government’s commitment to ensuring the inclusion, respect, protection, and development of minority faith communities in the province.
Speaking on the occasion Dr. Samuel Rizk, Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan said, “Alongside the Constitutional safe-guards, we need to recognise the valuable contribution of people of all religions, faiths and beliefs, to humanity and the contribution that dialogue among all religious groups can make towards an improved awareness and understanding of the common values shared by all humankind. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) calls for freedom of religion or belief - asserting that believers of all religions and secular beliefs should be able to live peacefully with their rights guaranteed by the State.”
Participants expressed a sustained need for such events and dialogues and thanked UNDP for providing the Holiday Packages with essential supplies for local community members. This is the first event initiating a series of dialogues between duty bearers and rights holders paving way for tangible steps and collaborative actions to ensure the protection and promotion of human rights for all communities in the country.
UNDP’s Decentralization, Human Rights, and Local Governance (DHL) Project works towards improved governance at national and sub-national levels to support devolution and decentralization objectives by strengthening state institutions’ capacity to deliver basic services to citizens. The DHL Project aims to build resilience in local communities, especially in vulnerable and at-risk segments of the population. Furthermore, the project also provides capacity development support to government line departments, national human rights institutions and undertakes awareness raising at community levels for the protection and promotion of human rights across the country.

Only half of young people able to identify correct definition of climate change – UNICEF, Gallup
Findings highlight urgent need to protect and invest in children, including in climate education, in decisions at COP28
NEW YORK/DUBAI, 7 December 2023 – Most children and young people say they have heard of climate change but only half understand what it is, according to a new UNICEF-Gallup poll, as world leaders gather at this year’s COP28.
The global poll found that on average, 85 per cent of young people aged 15-24 surveyed in 55 countries said they have heard of climate change, yet just 50 per cent of those chose the correct definition as per the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) when asked to select between “seasonal changes in weather that occur every year” and “more extreme weather events and a rise in average world temperatures resulting from human activity”.
“Young people have been some of the biggest heroes in driving action to address the impact of climate change. They have been calling for climate action on the streets or in meeting rooms, and we need to do even more to ensure that all children and young people understand the crisis that hangs over their future,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “At COP28, leaders must commit to ensuring that children and young people are educated on the problem, considered in discussions, and engaged in decisions that will shape their lives for decades to come.”
Climate change knowledge among young people was found to be lowest in lower-middle- and low-income countries – those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change - such as Pakistan (19 per cent), Sierra Leone (26 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent).
According to The Children’s Climate Risk Index, published by UNICEF in 2021, children in all three countries are classified as at extremely high risk of the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, threatening their health, education, and protection, and exposing them to deadly diseases.
The global poll – a follow-up to the initial Changing Childhood Project in 2021 – analyzes results from UNICEF’s subset of 2023 Gallup World Poll questions. Alongside climate change, it explores two long-term challenges shaping the lives of children and young people – trust in information, and constraints on political change in a globalized world.
When it comes to trust in information, the results show that 60 per cent of young people surveyed use social media as their primary source of news and information, yet only 23 per cent have a lot of trust in information on those platforms. In fact, social media is the least trusted information source across all institutions in the poll.
In line with the initial Changing Childhood findings, the data reflects how globalization is impacting this generation, with 27 per cent of young respondents identifying as citizens of the world – higher than any other age group polled.
The more expansive worldview the poll identifies among the younger generation may offer hope for more cross-border alliances and collaboration on the climate crisis, eroding trust, and other global problems.
“This research offers valuable insights into how children and young people see three long-term challenges shaping our world—now and in the future,” said Joe Daly, senior partner at Gallup. “Highlighting the perspectives of young people is crucial. It helps today’s policy makers understand the needs and views of rising generations in an era of rapid change and uncertainty.”
In August, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child affirmed the children’s right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, following the recognition of the UN General Assembly in July 2022 that a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is a human right. The guidance explicitly addressed the climate emergency, the collapse of biodiversity and pervasive pollution, and outlined countermeasures to protect the lives and life perspectives of children.
Despite these rights, ratified by 196 states under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and that children are among those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, children are largely disregarded in the decisions made to address the climate crisis, meaning their unique vulnerabilities, needs and contributions are often overlooked.
At the COP28 Climate Change Summit, underway in Dubai, UNICEF is calling on world leaders to ensure decisions deliberately protect and invest in children, including in climate education. This includes:
Beyond COP28, UNICEF is calling on parties to take action to protect the lives, health and well-being of children - including by adapting essential social services, empowering every child to be a champion for the environment, and fulfilling international sustainability and climate change agreements, including rapidly reducing emissions.
“Having witnessed the power of the youth climate movement, I am confident that informing and engaging even more young people around the climate crisis could help turbocharge the collective sense of urgency the world so desperately needs,” added Russell.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE
29 November 2023
This International Day of Solidarity comes during one of the darkest chapters in the history of the Palestinian people. I am horrified by the death and destruction that have engulfed the region, which is overwhelmed with pain, anguish and heartache.
Palestinians in Gaza are suffering a humanitarian catastrophe. Almost 1.7 million people have been forced from their homes – but nowhere is safe. Meanwhile, the situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, risks boiling over.
I express my sincere condolences to the thousands of families who are mourning loved ones. This includes members of our own United Nations family killed in Gaza, representing the largest loss of personnel in the history of our organization.
I have been clear in my condemnation of the terror attacks by Hamas on 7 October. But I have also been clear that they cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
Across the region, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency is an indispensable lifeline, delivering vital support to millions of Palestinian refugees. It is more important than ever that the international community stands with UNRWA as a source of support for the Palestinian people.
Above all, this is a day for reaffirming international solidarity with the Palestinian people and their right to live in peace and dignity.
That must start with a long-term humanitarian ceasefire, unrestricted access for lifesaving aid, the release of all hostages, the protection of civilians and an end to violations of international humanitarian law. We must be united in demanding an end to the occupation and the blockade of Gaza.
It is long past time to move in a determined, irreversible way towards a two-State solution, on the basis of United Nations resolutions and international law, with Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace and security with Jerusalem as the capital of both States.
The United Nations will not waver in its commitment to the Palestinian people. Today and every day, let us stand in solidarity with the aspirations of the Palestinian people to achieve their inalienable rights and build a future of peace, justice, security and dignity for all.

Denial of Women's Housing, Land and Property Rights (HLP) is Gender Based Violence (GBV)
Islamabad, November 28, 2023- The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) marked the culmination of its awareness campaign with a three-day National Conference (November 28-30, 2023) aimed at securing Housing, Land, and Property (HLP) Rights for women and vulnerable groups in Pakistan. The inaugural session was graced by Ms. Nilofar Bakhtiar, Chairperson of the National Commission on the Status of Women, who served as the Chief Guest. Noteworthy attendees included representatives from the Government of Pakistan, the United Nations, foreign dignitaries, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), and academia.
Mr. Jawed Ali Khan, Habitat Programme Manager at UN-Habitat, warmly welcomed participants and shed light on the conference's genesis, which emerged as a response to the catastrophic floods in 2022. These floods affected over 33 million people, displacing numerous families and necessitating urgent rehabilitation and house reconstruction. UN-Habitat's primary objective is to tackle the complex issues surrounding land ownership, property rights, and land tenure security, with a specific focus on women and vulnerable groups.
Ms. Nilofar Bakhtiar underscored the glaring discrimination against women regarding their housing, land, and property rights, despite the existence of relevant laws and articles. She highlighted the challenges faced by women in Pakistan, particularly those involved in agriculture but lacking land ownership. Ms. Bakhtiar advocated for collaborative efforts and social activism to empower women, stressing the importance of addressing the hurdles faced by women and vulnerable groups in accessing HLP rights. She assured the support of the National Commission on the Status of Women in raising awareness about HLP rights and eliminating barriers to access these rights.
Mr. Julien Harneis, Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in Pakistan, expressed gratitude and highlighted how people were compelled to settle along roads in 2022 due to fears of losing land without legal rights, which hindered job mobility and led to malnutrition. He identified two critical issues: the vulnerability of families lacking education and basic necessities and the crucial need to grant land rights, especially to households headed by women. While acknowledging the efforts of the Sindh government in providing land titles, Mr. Harneis urged for an extension of this support to all vulnerable communities. He emphasized the significance of property rights for investment and called for a focus on recent property law rights in Pakistan.
Ms. Leyla Nugmanova, Assistant Representative at UNHCR, highlighted the organization's initiative to prevent violence against women. She stressed the pivotal role of HLP laws in challenging patriarchal norms and empowering women, particularly in times of disasters. Housing, Land, and Property rights were emphasized as the cornerstone of the Humanitarian and Development Nexus. Furthermore, Ms. Fareeha Umar, Portfolio Specialist at UN WOMEN, explained how legal barriers, discriminatory implementation of legal frameworks, and deeply entrenched cultural norms restrict women and vulnerable groups' access to property ownership and inheritance rights.
A panel discussion took place during the inaugural session of the conference, featuring esteemed panelists such as Ms. Nusrat Hashmi, Advocate at Lahore High Court; Dr. Raana Malik, Chairperson of the Department of Gender Studies at the University of Punjab; and Mr. Asim Bhatti, Member and Advocate at the District and High Court Bar Association. They underscored the insufficient awareness among women regarding their Housing, Land, and Property (HLP) rights, emphasizing the critical need to tackle this challenge. The discussion highlighted the necessity for concerted efforts, comprising the implementation of legal reforms, educational initiatives, and community awareness programs. These initiatives are geared towards ensuring fair and accessible Housing, Land, and Property Rights for women and vulnerable groups in Pakistan. Recognizing the importance of empowering stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the legal framework and its gender-sensitive application was identified as a crucial step in achieving the goals of providing accessible HLP services.

Climate Action Plan for Karachi City kickstarts with Rapid Strategic Appraisal & Visioning Workshop
Karachi, November 23 2023 — United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan in collaboration with its partners at C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and The Urban Unit conducted a Rapid Strategic Appraisal and Visioning Workshop to commence the development of a Climate Action Plan for Karachi city (K-CAP).
Climate Promise, UNDP’s global flagship initiative calling for bold climate action is engaged at the provincial and local levels in Pakistan to provide institutional support and strengthen climate change governance towards low-emission development. UNDP Pakistan’s Innovation-Accelerator Lab (AccLab) is committed to change the way we approach development for accelerated impact, through in-depth contextual research, human-centered lens and portfolio logic. Climate Promise and AccLab are jointly spearheading the development of K-CAP.
At the Rapid Strategic Appraisal & Visioning Workshop to launch K-CAP, priority stakeholders from government departments and civil society organisations based in Karachi participated to set the tone for the city’s long-term decarbonization strategy.
The workshop was conducted in two sessions with robust participation from government departments in the first session and civil society organizations in the second. The participants were engaged in interactive activities to identify gaps and prioritise the issues and challenges to draft their Long-term Vision Statements for a carbon-neutral Karachi city by 2050.
The K-CAP visioning workshop commenced with opening remarks from the Mayor of Karachi, Mr. Murtaza Wahab Siddiqui. He appreciated the initiative and stated that “this city, Pakistan’s largest metropolis, is our home, and we are committed to implementing solutions that are sustainable, practical, and that are doable”. The Mayor assured KMC’s fullest cooperation and role as custodian and proponent of implementing the climate action plan and has also dedicated a core team to facilitate the development of K-CAP.
At the visioning workshop, Mr. Usman Manzoor, Programme Officer Climate Promise, UNDP gave an overview of Pakistan’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Long-Term Strategy (LTS), and technical support being provided to the Government of Sindh through K-CAP and NDC Implementation Plan.
Shruti Narayan from C40 spoke virtually at the event and reiterated the opportune launch of the project for Karachi city and its citizens to embark on forging more resilient and evidence-based pathways for a green and inclusive future. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) is a network of nearly 100 mayors of the world's leading cities that are united in action to confront the climate crisis. All C40 cities develop a Climate Action Plan that addresses the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the impacts of climate change and deliver wider social, environmental, and economic benefits.
Keeping in mind the unique challenges of the city, a dedicated Climate Action Plan for Karachi forms an integral part of Phase-II of UNDP Pakistan’s Climate Promise portfolio in collaboration with C40 Cities.

SOFA 2023 Unveils Global Hidden Costs of Agrifood Systems & Calls for Urgent Transformation
In a groundbreaking analysis, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) unveils the staggering hidden costs of current agrifood systems, reaching an alarming $10 trillion annually, nearly 10% of the world's GDP. This revelation comes from a comprehensive study covering 154 countries, shedding light on the multifaceted impact of hidden costs on health, the environment, and society.
The 2023 edition of The State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA) reveals that over 70% of these hidden costs stem from unhealthy diets prevalent in high- and upper-middle-income countries, contributing to obesity, non-communicable diseases, and substantial labor productivity losses.
A significant portion, one-fifth of the total costs, is environment-related, attributed to factors like greenhouse gas and nitrogen emissions, land-use change, and water use, posing a global challenge with underestimated scales due to data limitations.
Low-income countries bear a disproportionate burden, with hidden costs exceeding a quarter of their GDP, highlighting the severe impact on poverty and undernourishment.
The report advocates for true cost accounting (TCA), recommending to countries to conduct regular and detailed analyses, followed by strategic actions to mitigate these hidden harms. The FAO report uniquely disaggregates these costs to the national level, fostering comparability across categories and countries.
To harness the potential of such an approach in transforming food systems, FAO will dedicate two consecutive editions of The State of Food and Agriculture to the same theme. While this year's report presents initial estimates, the 2024 edition will delve into in-depth targeted assessments to identify the most effective ways to mitigate these hidden costs.
For Pakistan, the total quantified hidden costs of the agrifood system amount to approximately $161.8 billion USD (2020 PPP), constituting around 15% of the country's GDP. These costs are categorized into environmental ($28.9 billion), social ($20.9 billion), and health ($112 billion) dimensions.
A noteworthy distinction for Pakistan lies in the environmental realm, with a 10-percentage-point lower share (18% vs. 28%) in comparison to lower-middle-income countries. Conversely, health-related hidden costs show a 9-percentage-point increase (69% vs. 60%), emphasizing unique challenges in the country. Social hidden costs align closely with LMICs overall.
The detailed distribution of hidden costs across sub-categories, especially the intriguing land-use change component representing a hidden benefit, underscores the complexity of the agrifood system's impact on Pakistan's economy and society.
The report advocates for governments to utilize true cost accounting, emphasizing that addressing the climate crisis, poverty, inequality, and food security requires a transformative approach. It calls for innovative research, data investments, and capacity building to scale the application of true cost accounting transparently and consistently.
As the FAO reveals the hidden costs of agrifood systems, the call for global awareness and action intensifies, urging stakeholders at all levels to play a pivotal role in steering agrifood systems towards sustainability.

زرعی خوراک کے نظام میں پوشیدہ اخراجات کی کل لاگت سالانہ 10 ٹریلین امریکی ڈالر تک پہنچ جاتی ہے: ایف اے او کی رپورٹ
ایک اہم تجزیے میں، ادارہ خوراک و زراعت برائے اقوام متحدہ  پاکستان (ایف اے او) کی جانب سے موجودہ زرعی خوراک کے نظام میں پوشیدہ اخراجات پر روشنی ڈالی گئی ہے ، جو کہ سالانہ 10 ٹریلین امریکی ڈالر تک پہنچ جاتے ہیں، یہ پوشیدہ اخراجات دنیا کے کل جی ڈی پی GDP کا تقریباً 10فیصد بنتے ہیں۔ یہ تجزیہ 154 ممالک پر مشتمل ایک جامع مطالعہ پر مبنی ایف اے او کی رپورٹ دی اسٹیٹ آف فوڈ اینڈ ایگریکلچر (SOFA) کے 2023 ایڈیشن کا حصہ ہے ، جس میں صحت، ماحولیات اور  معاشرے پر ان پوشیدہ اخراجات کے کثیر جہتی اثرات پر  سیر حاصل روشنی ڈالی گئی ہے۔
رپورٹ میں بتایا گیا ہے کہ ان پوشیدہ اخراجات میں سے 70فیصد زیادہ اور اعلیٰ متوسط ​​آمدنی والے ممالک میں مروجہ غیر صحت بخش خوراک سے ہوتے ہیں، جو موٹاپے، غیر متعدی امراض اور خاطر خواہ پیداواری نقصانات میں حصہ ڈالتے ہیں۔ ان پوشیدہ اخراجات کی کل لاگت کا ایک اہم  یعنی پانچواں حصہ،  ماحولیات سے متعلق ہے، جو گرین ہاؤس گیس اور نائٹروجن کے اخراج، زمین کے استعمال میں تبدیلی، اور پانی کے استعمال جیسے عوامل سے منسوب ہے۔ یہ عالمی سطح پر ایک چیلنج ہے حالانکہ ماحولیات سے متعلق پوشیدہ اخراجات کا تخمینہ اصل سے کم ہے کیونکہ اعداد و شمار  کو اکھٹا کرنے میں کچھ دشواریوں کا سامنا ہے۔
رپورٹ میں مزید ٍبتایا گیا ہے کہ کم آمدنی والے ممالک غیر متناسب بوجھ برداشت کرتے ہیں، ان کے جی ڈی پی کے ایک چوتھائی سے زیادہ پوشیدہ اخراجات، غربت اور غذائی قلت پر شدید اثرات کو نمایاں کرتے ہیں۔
رپورٹ صحیح لاگت اکاؤنٹنگ (TCA) کی وکالت کرتی ہے، ممالک پر زور دیتی ہے کہ وہ باقاعدہ اور تفصیلی تجزیہ کریں، جس کے بعد ان چھپے ہوئے نقصانات کو کم کرنے کے لیے  بتدریج حکمت عملی کی ضرورت ہے۔ رپورٹ ان اخراجات کو مزید گہرائی سے جاننے کے لئے قومی سطح ، زمروں اور ممالک کے مابین موازنہ کو فروغ دیتی ہے۔زرعی خوراک کے نظام کو بدلنے میں  صحیح لاگت اکاؤنٹنگ کی اہمیت کو اجاگر کرنے کے لئے  ، ایف اے او اسی موضوع پر دی اسٹیٹ آف فوڈ اینڈ ایگریکلچر کے لگاتار دو ایڈیشن وقف کرے گا۔ اس سال کی رپورٹ میں  ابتدائی تخمینوں کو پیش کیا گیاہے، 2024 ایڈیشن ان چھپے ہوئے اخراجات کو کم کرنے کے مؤثر ترین طریقوں کی نشاندہی کرنے کے لیے گہرائی سے اہداف کا جائزہ لے گا۔
اگر پاکستان کے لیے کی بات کی جائے تو رپورٹ میں نشاندہی کی گئی ہے کہ  زرعی خوراک کے نظام کی کل مقدار کے مطابق پوشیدہ اخراجات تقریباً 161.8 بلین امریکی ڈالر (2020 پی پی پی) بنتے ہیں، جو کہ ملک کے جی ڈی پی کا تقریباً 15 فیصد بنتا ہے۔ ان اخراجات کو ماحولیاتی ($28.9 بلین)، سماجی ($20.9 بلین)، اور صحت ($112 بلین) میں تقسیم کیا گیا ہے۔ پاکستان کے لئے ایک قابل ذکر امتیاز ماحولیاتی دائرے میں ہے، جس میں کم درمیانی آمدنی والے ممالک کے مقابلے میں 10 فیصد کم حصہ (18% بمقابلہ 28%) ہے۔ اس کے برعکس، صحت سے متعلق پوشیدہ اخراجات 9 فیصد زیادہ ہیں۔جبکہ سماجی شعبے میں پوشیدہ اخراجات دیگر کم آمدنی والے ممالک سے مطابقت رکھتے ہیں۔  ذیلی زمرہ جات میں پوشیدہ اخراجات کی تفصیلی تقسیم، پاکستان کی معیشت اور معاشرے پر زرعی خوراک کے نظام کے اثرات کی پیچیدگی کو واضح کرتی ہے۔
رپورٹ میں حکومتوں کو حقیقی لاگت کے حساب کتاب کو بروئے کار لانے کی وکالت کی گئی ہے، اس بات پر زور دیا گیا ہے کہ موسمیاتی بحران، غربت، عدم مساوات، اور خوراک کی حفاظت سے نمٹنے کے لیے ایک تبدیلی کی ضرورت ہے۔ یہ شفاف اور مستقل طور پر حقیقی لاگت کے اکاؤنٹنگ کے اطلاق کے پیمانے کے لیے جدید تحقیق، ڈیٹا کی سرمایہ کاری، اور استعداد سازی کا مطالبہ کرتی ہے۔
جیسا کہ ایف اے او  کی رپورٹ میں زرعی خوراک کے نظام کے پوشیدہ اخراجات پر بات کی گئی ہے، عالمی سطح پر آگاہی اور عملی اقدامات کی ضرورت اور اجاگر ہوجاتی ہے۔  اس کے لئے رپورٹ میں  تمام سطحوں پر اسٹیک ہولڈرز پر زور دیا گیا ہے  کہ وہ زرعی خوراک کے نظام کو پائیداری کی طرف لے جانے میں اپنا اپنا کردار ادا کریں۔

Title: Media Update: United Nations Pakistan, 13 November 2023

1 in 3 children exposed to severe water scarcity – UNICEF
The climate changed world – with dwindling water supply and inadequate water services – is also changing children, altering their mental and physical health, new report warns
NEW YORK, 13 November 2023 – 1 in 3 children – or 739 million worldwide – already live in areas exposed to high or very high water scarcity, with climate change threatening to make this worse, according to a new UNICEF report.
Further, the double burden of dwindling water availability and inadequate drinking water and sanitation services is compounding the challenge, putting children at even greater risk.
The Climate Changed Child – released ahead of the COP28 climate change summit - throws a spotlight on the threat to children as a result of water vulnerability, one of the ways in which the impacts of climate change are being felt. It provides an analysis of the impacts of three tiers of water security globally – water scarcity, water vulnerability, and water stress*.
The report, a supplement to the UNICEF’s Children’s Climate Risk (2021), also outlines the myriad of other ways in which children bear the brunt of the impacts of the climate crisis –including disease, air pollution, and extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. From the moment of conception until they grow into adulthood, the health and development of children’s brains, lungs, immune systems and other critical functions are affected by the environment they grow up in. For example, children are more likely to suffer from air pollution than adults. Generally, they breathe faster than adults and their brains, lungs and other organs are still developing.
“The consequences of climate change are devastating for children,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Their bodies and minds are uniquely vulnerable to polluted air, poor nutrition and extreme heat. Not only is their world changing – with water sources drying up and terrifying weather events becoming stronger and more frequent – so too is their well-being as climate change affects their mental and physical health. Children are demanding change, but their needs are far too often relegated to the sidelines.”
According to the report findings, the greatest share of children are exposed in the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia regions – meaning they live in places with limited water resources and high levels of seasonal and interannual variability, ground water table decline or drought risk
Far too many children – 436 million - are facing the double burden of high or very high water scarcity and low or very low drinking water service levels – known as extreme water vulnerability – leaving their lives, health, and well-being at risk. It is one of the key drivers of deaths among children under 5 from preventable diseases.
The report shows that those most affected live in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Central and Southern Asia, and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia. In 2022, 436 million children were living in areas facing extreme water vulnerability. Some of the most impacted countries include Niger, Jordan, Burkina Faso, Yemen, Chad, and Namibia, where 8 out of 10 children are exposed.
In these circumstances, investment in safe drinking water and sanitation services are an essential first line of defense to protect children from the impacts of climate change. Climate change is also leading to increased water stress – the ratio of water demand to available renewable supplies – the report warns. By 2050, 35 million more children are projected to be exposed to high or very high levels of water stress, with the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia currently facing the biggest shifts.
Despite their unique vulnerability, children have been either ignored or largely disregarded in discussions about climate change. For example, only 2.4 per cent of climate finance from key multilateral climate funds support projects that incorporate child-responsive activities.
At COP28, UNICEF is calling on world leaders and the international community to take critical steps with and for children to secure a livable planet, including:
Beyond COP28, UNICEF is calling on parties to take action to protect the lives, health and well-being of children - including by adapting essential social services, empower every child to be a champion for the environment, and fulfil international sustainability and climate change agreements including rapidly reducing emissions.
“Children and young people have consistently made urgent calls for their voices to be heard on the climate crisis, but they have almost no formal role in climate policy and decision-making. They are rarely considered in existing climate adaptation, mitigation or finance plans and actions,” Russell said. “It is our collective responsibility to put every child at the centre of urgent global climate action.”

Notes to Editors:
* Water stress: The ratio of total water demand to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies. Water demand include domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock uses. Higher values indicate more competition among users.
Water scarcity: UNICEF’s Children’s Climate Risk Index defines water scarcity based on composite measure of baseline water stress, seasonal variability, interannual variability, ground water table decline and drought risk. Higher values indicate higher exposure to water scarcity risks.
Water vulnerability: UNICEF calculates water vulnerability index[1] based on composite measure of water scarcity (as above) and drinking water service levels. Higher values indicate high levels of water scarcity and low levels of drinking water service.

پانی کی قلت کے شکار بچوں کی سب سے زیادہ تعداد جنوبی ایشیاء میں ہے: یونیسف
موسمیاتی تبدیلی کے پانی کی فراہمی پر منفی اثرات کے پیش نظر یونیسف نے پائیدار منصوبوں پر سرمایہ کاری کی ضرورت  پر زور دیا ہے۔
اسلام آباد۔ 13 نومبر2023: یونیسف کی ایک تازہ رپورٹ کے مطابق جنوبی ایشیاء میں 18 سال سے کم عمر کے 34 کروڑ 70 لاکھ بچے پانی کی قلت کا شکار ہیں، جو دنیا کے تمام خطوں میں سب سے زیادہ تعداد ہے۔
اعداد و شمار کے مطابق آبادی کے تناسب کے لحاظ سے 18 سال سے کم عمر کے تقریباً 55 فیصد بچوں کو پانی کی کمی کا سامنا ہے۔ اس حوالے سے  جنوبی ایشیاء، مشرق وسطیٰ اور شمالی افریقہ  کے بعد دوسرے نمبر پر ہے، جہاں 64 فیصد بچوں کو پانی کی قلت کا سامنا ہے۔ پانی کا ناقص معیار، کمی  اور بدانتظامی جنوبی ایشیاء میں پانی کی قلت کی بنیادی وجوہات ہیں۔
یونیسف کے ریجنل ڈائریکٹر برائے جنوبی ایشیاء، سنجے وجے سیکیرا کا کہنا تھاکہ اس حقیقت کے باوجود کہ پانی زندگی کا ذریعہ ہے، جنوبی ایشیا کے لاکھوں بچوں کے پاس مناسب مقدار میں پینے کا پانی دستیاب نہیں ہے اور انہیں اکثر قحط، خشک سالی اور دیگر شدید موسمی واقعات کا شکار رہتا ہے۔ جنوبی ایشیا میں آبی قلت کے شکار علاقوں میں رہنے والے بچے، تباہ کن سیلاب اور شدید گرمی کی لہروں جیسے شدید موسمیاتی  خطرات کا بھی  سامنا کرتے ہیں۔ وہ اکثر خشک سالی اور پانی کی کمی کے خوفناک  چکر میں جکڑے رہتے  ہیں۔ جب گاؤں کے کنویں خشک ہو جاتے ہیں، تو گھر، صحت کے مراکز اور اسکول بھی متاثر ہوتے ہیں۔ بڑھتی ہوئی غیر متوقع موسمیاتی تبدیلیوں کی بدولت جنوبی ایشیاء میں بچوں کے لئے پانی کی قلت بدتر ہونے کا خدشہ ہے۔
پانی کی کمی بچوں کی فلاح و بہبود اور نشوونما کو متاثر کرنے کے ساتھ ساتھ  غذائی عدم تحفظ، خوراک کی کمی اور دیگر بیماریوں جیسے اسہال کا سبب بنتی ہے۔ زراعت پیشہ خاندانوں کو درپیش مالی مشکلات بچوں کی تعلیم کو متاثر کرکے انہیں  محنت مزدوری پر مجبور کر سکتی ہیں۔ اس کے علاوہ، آبی قلت نہ صرف بچوں کے لئے بلکہ زراعت، صنعت اور معاشی ترقی کے لئے بھی نقصان دہ  ہے۔
اگرچہ جنوبی ایشیاء میں دنیا کے ایک چوتھائی سے زیادہ بچے آباد ہیں، اس خطے میں دنیا کے قابل تجدید پانی کا صرف 4 فیصد موجود ہے۔ موسمیاتی تبدیلی اور پانی کی بڑھتی ہوئی طلب کی وجہ سے بہت سے جنوبی ایشیائی ممالک میں خشک سالی کثیر اور زیادہ شدید ہوتی جا رہی ہے۔
موسمیاتی  تبدیلی موسم کی ترتیب و تسلسل اور بارشوں میں بھی خلل ڈال رہی ہے، جس کی وجہ سے پانی کی دستیابی  غیر یقینی  ہوتی جا رہی ہے۔ موسمیاتی   تبدیلی زیر زمین پانی کے زیادہ اخراج کا سبب بن کر اضافی دباؤ میں بھی اضافہ کرتی ہے۔ پورے خطے میں  7کروڑ بچے خشک سالی سے متاثرہ علاقوں میں رہتے ہیں، جہاں زیر زمین  آبی ذخائر پر پانی کے لیے بہت زیادہ پمپ استعمال کیے جاتے ہیں۔ پاکستان، بھارت، بنگلہ دیش اور نیپال کا احاطہ کرنے والا انڈو گنگا طاس دنیا میں سب سے زیادہ استعمال ہونے والا آبی ذخیرہ ہے۔ زیر زمین پانی کا کھارا پن اور آبی ذخائر کا تیزی سے خشک ہونا دیگر اہم مسائل ہیں۔ درجہ حرارت میں اضافے سے آبی ذخائر کو دوبارہ بھرنے والے پانی کی مقدار میں مزید کمی واقع ہورہی ہے۔ غیر معیاری مٹی اور تیز بارش بھی زیر زمین پانی کو دوبارہ بھرنے کی صلاحیت کو متاثر کرتی ہے۔
یونیسف کے اعداد و شمار سے معلوم ہوا ہے کہ سال 2022 میں بھی جنوبی ایشیاء میں تمام خطوں کی نسبت  18 سال سے کم عمر کے بچوں کی سب سے زیادہ تعداد، یعنی 16کروڑ90 لاکھ، پانی کی شدید قلت کے خطرے سے دوچار تھی۔ جنوبی ایشیاء کے بعد مشرقی اور جنوبی افریقہ اور مغربی اور وسطی افریقہ تھے، جہاں پانی کی قلت کے شکار بچوں کی تعداد بالترتیب 13 کروڑ  اور10کروڑ2لاکھ تھی۔ زیادہ بڑے اعداد و شمار پانی کی قلت کی شدت اور پینے کے پانی کی فراہمی کی خدمات کی ابتری کی نشاندہی کرتی ہیں۔ 2022 میں کسی بھی دوسرے خطے کے مقابلے میں جنوبی ایشیاء میں پینے کے پانی کی بنیادی سہولیات کی کمی کا سامنا کرنے والے بچوں کی تعداد 4 کروڑ50 لاکھ تھی۔
جنوبی ایشیاء میں یونیسف نے حکومتوں، شراکت داروں اور دیگر پر زور دیا ہے کہ وہ اس بحران سے نمٹنے کے لیے مندرجہ ذیل اقدامات کریں:
حوصلہ افزاء امر یہ ہے کہ سال 2030ء کے تخمینوں کے مطابق جنوبی ایشیاء میں پینے کے پانی کی بنیادی خدمات کی فراہمی میں اضافہ متوقع ہے، جس سے پانی  کی قلت کے خطرے سے دوچار بچوں کی تعداد میں کمی آئے گی۔ ترقی کی موجودہ شرح کے لحاظ سے جنوبی ایشیاء میں پینے کے پانی تک رسائی سے محروم بچوں کی تعداد ساڑھے چار کروڑ سے کم ہو کر ایک کروڑ 80 لاکھ رہ  جانے کی توقع ہے۔
جنوبی ایشیاء عالمی طورپر موسمیاتی  تبدیلی سے سب سے متاثرہ خطوں میں سے ایک ہے اور بچے اس کی قیمت ادا کر رہے ہیں۔ یونیسف کے 2021 کے چلڈرن کلائمیٹ رسک انڈیکس (سی سی آر آئی) کے مطابق، افغانستان، بنگلہ دیش، بھارت اور پاکستان میں بچے موسمیاتی تبدیلی کے اثرات کے’انتہائی زیادہ خطرے‘ سے دوچار ہیں، جبکہ مالدیپ کے مکمل طور پر صفحۂ ہستی سے مٹنے کا اندیشہ  ہے۔ جنوبی ایشیا میں ہر بچہ کم از کم موسمیاتی تبدیلی سے جڑے ایک خطرے، صدمے یا تناؤ کا شکار ہے:
وجے سیکیرا کا مزید کہنا تھا، ’’جب تک ہم فوری اقدامات نہیں کریں گے، بچوں کی مشکلات ختم نہیں ہونگی۔ یہ حکومتوں اور سول سوسائٹی کے اداروں کی ذمہ داری ہے کہ وہ موسمیاتی تبدیلی کے حملوں کا مقابلہ کرنے کی صلاحیتوں کے حامل پانی کی فراہمی  کے نظام اور  ڈیزائن خدمات کی بہتری  کے لئے مل جل کر کام کریں۔‘‘

Empowering Migrant Workers through the National Skills Passport Initiative
Participants discuss the many challenges faced by Pakistani migrant workers and set out a strategy to recognize and enhance the skills and qualifications of returning workers.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (ILO News) – To many Pakistani migrant workers, the National Skills Passport initiative will prove to be a gateway to obtain recognition of their skills and ensure decent employment opportunities for returnee migrant workers, participants at a consultative dialogue concluded today in Islamabad.
The National Skills Passport provides a comprehensive catalogue of an individual’s skills, obtained through formal and informal channels, and provides a migrant worker with documentation of gained qualifications, skills, competencies, and experience in a systematic manner. The National Skills Passport is linked with the Recognition of Prior Learning platform, which formally assesses, certifies, and recognizes the competencies, acquired through informal and unregulated processes.
The consultation event was jointly organized by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and Employers Federation of Pakistan (EFP) in Islamabad in collaboration with the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resources Development (MOP&HRD) and was attended by representatives from Government departments, employers’ and workers’ organizations, and development partners.
The National Skills Passport initiative has been supported by the ILO project Governance of Labour Migration in South and Southeast Asia (GOALS), which is generously supported by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.
“We are pleased to acknowledge that the Government of Pakistan has taken commendable steps to protect the rights of migrant workers through digital registration, licensing of overseas employment promoters, authentication of foreign employment, grievance redressal mechanisms and welfare programmes for migrant workers and their families,” said Geir Tonstol, Country Director of ILO Pakistan.
“Skilled labour is in increasing demand, including in the countries that received the largest share of Pakistan’s migrant workers. It is important to equip aspiring migrant workers with the right skill sets to meet the demands of the international labour market,” he added.
Speaking at the occasion, Majyd Aziz, former President of the Employers’ Federation of Pakistan stated that the National Skills Passport is not just a card, it is the digital portfolio of an individual to find a decent work opportunity locally and internationally. “We are thankful to the ILO’s technical support for piloting innovative approaches in Pakistan including National Skills Passport and South Asia Regional Qualifications Frameworks,” he added.
“The Government of Pakistan recognizes the increasing demand for skilled human resources in the international labour market and has been focusing on the local and international industry demand-driven skills development programs,” said Jawad Sohrab Malik, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister on Labour and Human Resource Development.
He further emphasized that the government of Pakistan has launched a digital 24/7 complaint cell called 'Call Sarzameen' to promptly address complaints submitted by overseas Pakistanis. He also mentioned 'Naya Pakistan Calling,' a platform that facilitates the professional Pakistani diaspora in contributing their knowledge and skills towards national development.
Background:
Pakistan is the second largest country of origin for migrant workers from South Asia. According to estimates prepared by the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, more than 10 million Pakistanis have migrated for overseas employment to 54 countries since 1971. Last year, in 2022, around 800,000 Pakistanis migrated for overseas employment through official channels.
Unfortunately, however, the majority of Pakistani migrant workers are employed as unskilled or low-skilled workers, and, consequently, earn less than a third of what a skilled worker earns.
Anticipating and matching skills supply and demand for migrant workers is thus crucial for maintaining Pakistan’s attractiveness as a source of migrant labour.

UNDP Urges Swift Action and New Directions to Advance Asia-Pacific's Human Development
NOVEMBER 6, 2023 - The Asia-Pacific region is lurching towards an era of unmet aspirations, worsening inequalities, and a steady erosion of democratic spaces. Rising global tensions, new technologies, growing polarization, and existential threats linked to climate change threaten to disrupt improvements in well-being the region has seen in past decades, says a new report from the United Nations Development Programme.
The 2024 Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, launched today, paints a qualified picture of long-term progress, but also persistent disparity and widespread disruption, foreseeing a turbulent development landscape and urgently calling for new directions to boost human development.
Titled Making our Future: New Directions for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific, the new report argues that unmet aspirations, heightened human insecurity, and a potentially more turbulent future create an urgent need for change.
It warns that the region faces three converging ‘risk clusters’, ranging from existential threats due to climate change and future pandemics, economic headwinds from shifting globalization patterns and automation, and a flagging pace of reform due to diminishing democratic spaces, rising populism, and polarization.
While the region will account for two-thirds of global economic growth this year, income and wealth disparities are worsening, particularly in South Asia, where the wealthiest 10 percent control over half of the total income. More than 185 million people continue to live in extreme poverty – earning below $2.15 a day – a number that is expected to climb higher following the economic shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, says the report.
“The report underscores that to overcome existing challenges, we must prioritize investments in human development, with an understanding that each nation will tailor its own pathways to do so,” said Kanni Wignaraja, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP’s Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific. “By fostering a people-first policy and smart growth strategies that put a high value on natural assets, we can pave the way for a future that is not only more secure and peaceful but also sustainable and prosperous for many millions more.”
To bring about that change the Report calls for three new directions in human development: to put people at the heart of development, to recalibrate growth strategies to generate more jobs and respect the environment, and to focus relentlessly on the politics of reform and the science of delivery to turn ideas into practice.
It also provides a panoramic view of how in an uncertain future, countries can revitalize development strategies to close existing inequality gaps and reduce human insecurity.
A people-centred strategy must start by expanding choice for everyone by, among other things, tackling structural exclusion, upholding human dignity, and building capability. Tackling structural exclusion is not only the ‘right thing to do,’ it could also produce large economic benefits. Promoting women's equality alone could boost the region's collective annual Gross Domestic Product by $4.5 trillion by 2025, the report says.
With external market conditions becoming more competitive, a razor-sharp focus on competitiveness and diversification is essential. The Report highlights new areas of economic opportunity in the low carbon ‘green economy’ and in technologies, and the region’s rich marine resources that can be optimized and sustained through new technology and investment as part of the blue economy, which is especially important for Small Island Developing States.
"The call for economic growth should be louder, not quieter, as growth remains essential for human development,” said Philip Schellekens, UNDP’s Chief Economist for Asia and the Pacific, and the principal author of the Report. “Facing growing headwinds to growth and job creation and the prospect of further disruption, it is time to recalibrate both export-led and domestically oriented growth strategies,” he said.
The region’s large informal workforce—about 1.3 billion people—is being left behind, with many workers trapped in low-quality jobs because the formal sector has failed to offer decent employment opportunities. And the region has seen a steady reversal in democratic practices, to a degree last seen in the late 1970s, the report notes, with the pandemic enabling governments to further tighten restrictions on civil liberties.
To chart a new course, governments would need to be future fit to combat the challenges to come.  It unpacks how a greater focus on making change happen would be rooted in leadership and governance that is more anticipatory, more adaptable, and more agile.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR WORLD CITIES DAY
31 October 2023
World Cities Day is a time to consider the pivotal role cities play in sustainable development.
Cities are engines of economic growth and innovation that hold the key to achieving the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. They are also on the frontlines of today’s complex challenges, from the climate crisis to growing inequalities and political polarization.
But local authorities are struggling with limited support and resources, while demand for infrastructure, affordable housing, efficient transport, and social services is immense and growing. This year's theme, Financing Sustainable Urban Development, is a call to action.
Governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society, must work together to mobilize finance for resilient, sustainable cities. I am a strong advocate for equitable financing solutions at the global level. These must be used, together with innovative and diverse funding sources, to strengthen local financing strategies that are climate-friendly, inclusive and equitable.
The Advisory Group on Local and Regional Governments I established recently will strengthen coordination to implement the SDGs, and make sure the voices of cities and regions are heard as we prepare for the Summit of the Future next year.
As we mark World Cities Day, let’s resolve to work together for urban areas that are not only engines of growth, but beacons of sustainability, resilience, and prosperity for all.

Stakeholders validate evaluation of ILO interventions to promote decent work for vulnerable segments of society
Participants in the validation event heard testimonials from stakeholders how the project has brought change in their lives.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (ILO News) – The International Labour Organization (ILO) convened a stakeholders workshop to validate the evaluation of the project “Promotion of Decent Work Opportunities for the Economic Empowerment of Vulnerable Segments of Society project”. The project has been implemented in Punjab, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces since 2019. Participants heard that the project has significantly improved the lives of vulnerable populations. One of its key achievements was the support provided for the development of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Social Protection Policy in 2022. This policy was designed to enhance the quality and adequacy of social protection coverage, ultimately fostering a more secure and equitable environment for vulnerable populations.
Hosted at the ILO in Islamabad, the event brought together representatives from the Government, employers’ and workers' organizations, and development partners.
Funded by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), the project played a pivotal role in enabling the registration of the first-ever trade union in Balochistan’s brick kiln sector, empowering workers by establishing a vital platform for collective bargaining to address labor-related concerns.
Through the project, the ILO has been able to actively support the Government of Pakistan’s commitment to environmental conservation and reduced carbon emissions. The adoption of the so-called zig-zag technique not only improved occupational safety and health for brick kiln workers but also, notably, enhanced their productivity.
“ILO is thankful to the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation for their generous support and also recognizes the dedication of constituents and partners in promoting the cause of decent work,” said Geir Tonstol, Director of ILO’s Country Office for Pakistan.
He further said that this project has seen a remarkable journey, advocating for decent work opportunities, especially within the challenging sector of brick kilns, which is home to some of the most vulnerable segments of our society. “The project addressed rampant decent work deficits by promoting social protection, environmental sustainability, and crucially, by engaging with public entities to enhance dialogue on issues of investment, skills, and job creation,” he added.
Francesco Zatta, Country Director of AICS, welcomed the contribution of the more environmentally friendly technology promoted in brick kilns. “AICS strongly supports Pakistan in ensuring environmental protection and mitigating the effects of climate change. The project’s component of providing an effective one-window operation for social protection is also praiseworthy, especially in documenting workers and their family members and allowing them to benefit from social protection schemes,” he added.
Speaking at the occasion, Azhar Iqbal Malik, Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development noted that the Ministry was committed to promoting decent work and economic empowerment as a means to enhancing the well-being and livelihoods of vulnerable segments of society. “We understand that when people have access to quality jobs, they not only experience improved living standards but also enjoy enhanced dignity and self-respect,” he added.

U.S., UNDP & KP Unite to Boost SME Financial Access in KP’s Merged Areas
Islamabad, October 31, 2023 – The United States Government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Nations Development Programme, and the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa jointly launched a strategy on improving access to finance for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s merged areas. Stakeholders from the banking sector, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA) and the KP Chambers of Commerce also participated and exchanged ideas.
"SMEs represent the driving force of global economies, and Pakistan is no exception with 90% of its workforce employed by SMEs, contributing 40% to the national GDP,” said USAID Mission Director Kate Somvongsiri. “We all know how crucial access to credit is. It's the key for businesses to grow and thrive.”
Neelum Sultana Khattak, Additional Secretary Finance said, “Out-of-the box action-oriented thinking is the need of the day to effectively cope with the challenges. The government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has to open itself for greater partnership with the private sector.” He emphasized that the strategy would help the private sector grow through result-focused interventions.
Ms. Van Nguyen, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative highlighted, “ The development of this strategy is a great effort at sub-national level to mainstream financial inclusion for SMEs in greater harmony and synchronized with national level efforts.” She stated that the strategy reflects the greater commitment of the Provincial Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (GoKP) towards a multi-pronged approach for the sustained economic growth.
SMEs need improved access to credit as one of the prerequisites to their growth, whereby historically, only 1.2 percent of national credit has reached KP. Through the newly developed strategy, the public and private sectors will use modern technology to open new ways for small businesses to get access to finance.

Cementing Climate Resilience through trainings on Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan (CCAAP) and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP)
Islamabad, October 19, 2023: The United Nations Development Program rolled out an intensive two-day training on Climate Change Action Adaptation Plan by the GLOF-II Project for government officials. The GLOF-II Project, a joint initiative by the United Nations Development Program, and the Ministry of Climate Change & Environmental Coordination; aims at strengthening climate-resilience of the communities through strategic policy interventions and adaptation measures to reduce the risks associated with Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in the most climate vulnerable valleys of Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
A multitude of government bodies and ministries, comprising the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs Division, Planning Development & Special Initiatives, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Pakistan Meteorological Department, wholeheartedly engaged in the training sessions. These sessions facilitated a rich exchange of knowledge and expertise on disaster risk management. Moreover, the participants were keenly aware of Pakistan's substantial responsibilities in the realm of Disaster Risk Reduction, both on the global stage and within the country. This collaborative effort highlights the commitment of these key stakeholders in strengthening disaster resilience in Pakistan.
The training’s main objective was to enhance the knowledge of the participants on the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) developed by the Ministry of Climate Change & Environmental Coordination. Tapping into the agriculture-water nexus, urban resilience, natural capital, and human capital amongst other priority areas; NAP’s focus is to enhance resilience and mitigate risks, while promoting sustainable growth through gender, youth, and social inclusion. The Plan is comprehensively based on several guiding principles and approaches to cement climate resilient by integrating adaptation mechanisms into governance models, policies, and implementation strategies, such that no one is left behind.
By engaging government officials, the training, through data and information on climatic conditions of the country, specifically in the context of GLOFs, encouraged participants to identify, understand and address local risks for better and more affective response to climate-induced disasters.
The participants, through engaging conversations, were briefed on the integration of the Gender Action Plan into Disaster Risk Reduction frameworks and policies, while unpacking international and national climate-centric conventions and treaties, such as the Paris Agreement adopted at the Conference of Parties (COP21). Following the sessions, the participants were taken on an exposure visit to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, which entailed a physical examination of the site to assess the conditions and susceptibility to climate-induced disasters of buildings, infrastructure, and facilities.
“Our aim through such trainings on climate-adaptation policies and interventions remains to be to incubate sustainable and climate resilient mechanisms through which our communities are secure and protected, and that the vulnerabilities and risks posed by GLOFs, and other climate-induced disasters are reduced,” stated Amir Khan Goraya, the Resident representative of the Resilient, Environment and Climate Change Unit at UNDP Pakistan on the note of the training.
The participants, in the feedback session, recommended the continuation of such trainings on climate adaptation to reiterate the urgency and need for equitable and sustainable climate action.
UNDP’s GLOF-II project works in 16 valleys of Gilgit Baltistan and 8 valleys in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It empowers communities to identify and manage risks associated with GLOFs and related impacts of Climate Change, strengthen public services to lower the risk of disasters related to GLOF, and improve community preparedness and disaster response. The project also supports development of sustainable options for livelihoods in project areas, with a particular focus on the participation of women in ensuring food security and livelihoods.

High Commissioner of Canada and Resident Representative UNDP Pakistan inaugurated flood affected girls' school in Brep, Upper Chitral
Islamabad, 13 October 2023 – H.E. Leslie Scanlon, High Commissioner of Canada to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Mr. Samuel Rizk, Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan, inaugurated a Government Girls’ High School in the remote Brep village in Upper Chitral, affected by floods in 2022. The ceremony was attended by officials of the High Commission of Canada, Education Department, local administration, UNDP, students, teachers, and parents.
Following the 2022 torrential rains and flash floods, the Brep school building sustained extensive damage, making it unusable and posing serious safety concerns for students and teachers. This natural disaster disrupted the education of girl students, who were temporarily relocated to a nearby rented facility. In September 2022, the Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, Minister of International Development for Canada, visited the affected area and committed to rehabilitating the school, by providing $80,000 in funding through Global Affairs Canada. In collaboration with UNDP and the Education Department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the rehabilitation and restoration work has now been completed. More broadly, Canada has committed a total of $58M for flood response and resilience building in Pakistan, following the 2022 floods. Of this, $33M was provided for disaster response, and another $25M will be utilized for longer-term resilience building and rehabilitation.
While addressing the inauguration ceremony, H.E. Leslie Scanlon, High Commissioner of Canada to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan said, “Canada will continue to look for opportunities to increase access to and improve the delivery of basic education in Pakistan, including for refugees, forcibly-displaced children/youth, and host communities, with a focus on reducing barriers for girls.”
Canada has been at the forefront of empowering women and girls in KP province for decades, focusing on remote, marginalised communities in areas with some of the lowest gender indicators. The rehabilitation of the Brep School is part of the $7 million Improved Access to Quality Education in the Merged Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa project, funded by Global Affairs Canada and jointly implemented by the UNDP, UNICEF and the Elementary & Secondary Education Department of KP.
Through this project, a total of 102 girls’ schools have undergone comprehensive rehabilitation and are equipped with educational resources, leading to a significant improvement in both enrolment and quality of education for around 14,000 girls in Kurram, Orakzai and Upper Chitral. Through this project, Canada has also strengthened the capacities of provincial education institutions, such as the Education Monitoring Authority and the Directorate of Professional Development, funded extensive enrolment campaigns, established Early Childhood Centres, trained hundreds of teachers, provided teaching learning materials and furniture to schools, and improved the curriculum for training of teachers in the province. Canada believes that a holistic approach to education needs is necessary to create a larger impact and sustain the results of girls’ education in the province.
This intervention is part of UNDP’s broader 2022 flood recovery programme, which aims to develop long-term resilience to natural hazards and climate change. UNDP's vision of resilient and integrated recovery - in tune with UNDP's Crisis Offer is guided by the needs on the ground and government priorities, while implemented in coordination with humanitarian and development partners. UNDP’s approach to resilient recovery in Pakistan spans the humanitarian-development nexus, and bridges short, medium- and long-term dimensions of the response, with underlying principles of gender equality and environmental sustainability integrated into all activities.
The Resilient Recovery Strategy in Pakistan is built on four key pillars. The first pillar focuses on rebuilding housing and community infrastructure to provide safe living conditions following the 2022 floods. The second pillar, livelihood recovery, is dedicated to helping people regain their sources of income and rebuild their economic well-being. Meanwhile, the third pillar emphasizes restoring governance systems to ensure effective and accountable government services. Lastly, the fourth pillar concentrates on enhancing disaster resilience and environmental protection, aiming to prepare communities for future challenges and promote sustainable practices. All of these pillars collectively contribute to the broader goal of fostering resilience to natural hazards and climate change in Pakistan.
In the Brep School, UNDP's extensive rehabilitation initiative encompassed a wide array of essential tasks. These included the meticulous removal of over 121,000 cubic feet of debris surrounding the school, the reconstruction of boundary walls, and the construction of a new room and toilet block. Moreover, UNDP provided crucial Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) facilities, undertook necessary repairs and installations of doors, windows, and the main gate, electrified the premises, and revitalized the IT and science lab spaces. In addition to these infrastructural enhancements, the Canada-funded project also furnished the school with modern school furniture, essential IT equipment, and state-of-the-art science lab apparatus. These comprehensive measures have transformed the school into a well-equipped institution, poised to deliver quality education to over 150 girls’ students.
UNDP has developed a strong collaborative partnership with the Education Department, the local community, and the Parents-Teacher Committee to establish a sense of ownership and effective oversight over civil works. This collaborative effort is aimed at ensuring that the project truly meets the needs and expectations of all stakeholders.
To maintain stringent quality control and adherence to project timelines, UNDP's technical team consistently and rigorously monitored the construction activities. This proactive approach not only guaranteed the high quality of the work but also ensured that the project was completed within the specified timeframe, further enhancing its impact on the school and the community.
Mr. Samuel Rizk, Resident Representative UNDP Pakistan shared his remarks “The rehabilitation of this school is not just about repairing a building, it is about restoring hope and opportunity for young girls who deserve the chance to learn, grow and thrive in a safe and supportive environment”
Canada, UNDP and the Education Department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will continue to work together to ensure education remains a priority area KP and to empower children, especially girls and young women to achieve their full potential.

UNDP and Ministry of Climate Change Commemorate International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction in Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Islamabad, October 13 2023: UNDP commemorated International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (IDDRR) 2023 in Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to honour the resilience of the communities in the face of climate-induced disasters such as Glacial Lake outburst Floods (GLOFs.) IDDRR highlights the significance of disaster preparedness and showcases the strength of communities in mitigating disaster risks and losses.
The event garnered an active participation from a diverse background of professionals including government officials, implementing partners, representatives from NGOs/INGOs, members of the civil society, academia, and the media.
In an effort to enhance disaster risk reduction and the significance of preparedness, a series of awareness sessions and mock drills were conducted in Ghizer, Ghundus, Ghulkin, Barah, and Parashing valleys of Gilgit Baltistan. These sessions entailed briefing the community members on safeguarding procedures and mechanisms, followed by a practical demonstration of these methods through mock drills. The primary objective was to increase community cohesion in reducing disaster risks and stress the importance of being prepared ahead of any potential calamity.
Panel discussions in Gilgit and Skardu delved into disaster risk mitigation strategies and community-driven measures for climate adaptation. The discussions highlighted the critical link between disasters and their adverse effects on poverty, inequalities, and discrimination. By understanding how these factors increase community vulnerability to climate-induced disasters, the panels aimed to reinforce the importance of proactive action to build resilience and protect vulnerable populations.
Speaking at the occasion, Mr. Najeeb Alam, Commissioner of Baltistan Division, highlighted the susceptibility of the region to various disasters, primarily attributing this to the escalating impacts of climate change.
"A disaster may strike at any time, especially owing to the melting of the glaciers; disrupting lives and causing massive destruction. With the GLOF-II Project’s climate-adaptation mechanisms, such as the installation of the Early Warning Systems, we will be more prepared to safeguard our lives and habitations than we have been before. This is what this day stands for – to be better prepared to reduce disaster risks," the Commissioner said.
In Peshawar and Chitral (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), the events entailed ‘Resilience For All’ themed Essay Writing, Art, and Speech Competitions for students. These dynamic initiatives included Essay Writing, Art, and Speech Competitions, meticulously crafted to captivate, and educate students. The overarching objective was to impart a profound understanding of climate adaptability and underscore the pivotal role that disaster preparedness plays in preserving lives and reducing environmental damage.
“A disaster changes everything – from the way we live our lives, to our surroundings. Nothing remains to be the same. This is what I learnt through the declamation. I want our voices to be stronger, so that our resilience can be strengthened, and so that we remain prepared.” said a student, following the end of the speech competition.
UNDP’s GLOF-II project works in 16 valleys of Gilgit Baltistan and 8 valleys in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It empowers communities to identify and manage risks associated with GLOFs and related impacts of Climate Change, strengthen public services to lower the risk of disasters related to GLOF, and improve community preparedness and disaster response. The project also supports development of sustainable options for livelihoods in project areas, with a particular focus on the participation of women in ensuring food security and livelihoods.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
13 October 2023
2023 has shattered temperature records, and seen record drought, fire and floods around the world. Poverty and inequality are exacerbating these disasters.
Those with least are often at greatest risk from extreme weather. They may live in places that are more susceptible to flooding and drought; and they have fewer resources to deal with damage and to recover from it. They suffer disproportionately as a result, and may be pushed further into poverty.
Fighting inequality for a resilient future, is the theme of this year’s International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction. Countries must work to break the cycle of poverty and disaster by honouring the Paris Agreement, striving to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
We must also tackle inequality at the global level, by operationalizing the Loss and Damage Fund at COP28 this year and ensuring that every person on Earth is covered by an early warning system by 2027.
This International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction let us reaffirm our commitment to investing in resilience and adaptation, and building a safe and just future for everyone, everywhere.

حکومت اور اقوام متحدہ کے دیگر اداروں کے اشتراک سے ایف اے او کی جانب سے کلین انڈس مہم کا آغاز
جامشورو، سندھ (12/10/2023): ادارہ خوراک و زراعت  برائے اقوام متحدہ (ایف اے او) نے "پانی زندگی ہے، پانی خوراک ہے، کسی کو پیچھے نہ چھوڑیں" کے موضوع کے ساتھ عالمی یوم خوراک (WFD) منانے کے لیے۔ حکومت، ورلڈ فوڈ پروگرام (WFP)، انٹرنیشنل فنڈ فار ایگریکلچر ڈویلپمنٹ (IFAD)، اقوام متحدہ کے بچوں کے فنڈ (UNICEF) اور Oxfam GB کے اشتراک سے سندھ میں کوٹری، جامشورو کے قریب دریائے سندھ کے کنارے صفائی کی ایک مہم کا اہتمام کیا۔ یونیورسٹیوں، اقوام متحدہ کی ایجنسیوں، این جی اوز، سرکاری محکموں اور ذرائع ابلاغ پر مشتمل 300 سے زائد شرکاء نے کچرا اور کوڑا کرکٹ صاف  کیا اور محفوظ طریقے سے ٹھکانے لگایا.اس اقدام کا مقصد زراعت، خوراک کی پیداوار اور مقامی آبادیوں کی مجموعی فلاح و بہبود کے لئے صاف پانی کی اہمیت کو اجاگر کرنا تھا
ہر سال منایا جانے والا عالمی یوم خوراک، خوراک کے نظام کی تبدیلی کو فروغ دیتا ہے۔ اس سال کا تھیم، زراعت اور سماجی بہبود میں پانی کے اہم کردار کو اجاگر کرتا ہے۔ یہ یہ تھیم لیونگ انڈس انیشی ایٹو کے اہداف سے ہم آہنگ ہے، جو حکومت پاکستان اور اقوام متحدہ کی ایجنسیوں کے درمیان ایک باہمی تعاون پر مبنی منصوبہ ہے، جو دریائے سندھ کے طاس کی ماحولیاتی صحت کی درستگی اور بحالی خاص طور پر موسمیاتی چیلنج سے نمٹنے کے لیے کے لیے وقف ہے،خوراک کے اس عالمی دن پر، FAO پاکستان حکومت اور پاکستان میں کام کرنے والے اقوام متحدہ کے دیگر اداروں کے ساتھ مل کر "کلین انڈس" مہم کا آغاز کر رہا ہے، جس میں خوراک کی پیداوار کو بڑھانے کے لیے پانی کے تحفظ اور معیار کی بہتری پر توجہ دی جائے گی۔ اس مہم کا مقصد بیداری پیدا کرنا اور دریائے سندھ کے تحفظ کے لیے کارروائی کی ترغیب دینا ہے۔
حاجی خان جمالی چیف انجینئر سندھ، اسد اللہ کھوسو، اسسٹنٹ ڈپٹی کمشنر جامشورو اور آغا فخر، ڈائریکٹر جنرل فوڈ اتھارٹی سندھ نے حاضرین سے خطاب کرتے ہوئے زراعت، خوراک کی پیداوار اور فوڈ سیکیورٹی میں پانی کی اہمیت پر زور دیا۔ انہوں نے روشنی ڈالی کہ آبپاشی کے وسائل تیزی سے ختم ہو رہے ہیں۔ ہمیں اپنی آنے والی نسل کے لیے آبی وسائل کی مرمت اور بحالی پر توجہ دینے کی ضرورت ہے۔
کسان برادری کے نمائندوں ذوالفقار علی کچیلو اور نغمہ ناز نے کسان برادری کو درپیش مسائل اور پانی کی اہمیت سے آگاہ کیا۔ انہوں نے بتایا کہ کسانوں کے لیے پانی بہت ضروری ہے۔ وہ اپنے کھیتوں کے لیے کھاد اور غذائی اجزاء کے ساتھ زندہ رہ سکتے ہیں لیکن پانی کے بغیر زندہ رہنا ناممکن ہے۔
پاکستان میں ایف اے او کی نمائندہ فلورنس رول نے ملک کی زرعی اہمیت پر روشنی ڈالی، اس کی وسیع آبپاشی والی زمین اسے اس زمرے میں دنیا کی تیسری بڑی زمین قرار دیتی ہے۔ یہ پاکستان میں "کلین انڈس" اقدام کی مطابقت کو واضح کرتا ہے۔
دریائے سندھ، جو پاکستان کی ثقافتی اور اقتصادی بنیاد ہے، کو گلیشیئر پگھلنے اور آلودگی جیسے چیلنجز کا سامنا ہے۔ ایف اے او کی "کلین انڈس" مہم کا مقصد آگاہی پیدا کرنا اور باہمی تعاون سے کام کرنا ہے۔ جس کے لیے آنے والے سالوں تک تمام لوگوں کی مستقل شرکت کی ضرورت ہے۔ تباہ شدہ ماحولیاتی نظام کی بحالی، جیسا کہ دوسرے ممالک میں حاصل کی گئی ہے، پاکستان میں بھی ممکن ہے۔
ڈبلیو ایف ڈی کی کنٹری ڈائریکٹر کوکو اوشیاما نے زندگی میں پانی کے اہم کردار اور موسمیاتی تبدیلی اور آلودگی کے اثرات پر زور دیا۔ ورلڈ فوڈ پروگرام انڈس بیسن ماحولیاتی نظام کو بحال کرنے کے لیے کلین انڈس ڈرائیو کی حمایت کرتا ہے، پانی کے ذرائع اور خوراک کی حفاظت کو یقینی بناتا ہے۔
اقوام متحدہ کی 2023 کی ایک رپورٹ میں پاکستان 36 سب سے زیادہ پانی کی کمی کا شکار ممالک میں شامل ہے۔ IFAD پاکستان کی کنٹری ڈائریکٹر فرنندا تھوماز دا روچا نے پانی کے دانشمندانہ انتظام، موثر خوراک کی پیداوار، پانی کی منصفانہ تقسیم اور آبی خوراک کے نظام کے تحفظ پر زور دیا۔ آکسفیم کے پاکستان کے کنٹری ڈائریکٹر سید شاہنواز علی نے آب و ہوا کے بحران میں پانی کی اہمیت کو اجاگر کرتے ہوئے تمام شعبوں میں اجتماعی کوششوں کی ضرورت پر زور دیا۔

پاکستان میں یونیسیف کے نمائندے عبداللہ فادل نے بچوں کی غذائی قلت اور پینے کے صاف پانی کے باہمی تعلق پر زور دیا۔ پاکستان کی بڑھتی ہوئی آبادی اور پانی اور خوراک کی رسد پر بڑھتے ہوئے دباؤ کے ساتھ، غذائی قلت سے نمٹنے اور بچوں کی صحت اور علمی نشوونما کو یقینی بنانے کے لیے ان وسائل کی حفاظت بہت ضروری ہے۔
ہمارے وجود کے لیے پانی کے اہم کردار کے بارے میں عام لوگوں میں شعور اجاگر کرنے کے لیے پاکستان کے تمام صوبوں میں اسی طرح کی تقریبات کا ایک سلسلہ بھی منعقد کیا گیا۔

Title: Media Update: United Nations Pakistan, 11 October 2023

Halfway to the 2030 deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals, the world is failing girls.
On current trends, the end of child marriage is 300 years away. If nothing changes, by 2030, 110 million young women and girls who should be in classrooms, won’t be. And 340 million women and girls will still endure the grinding hardships of extreme poverty.
Old forms of discrimination against girls continue and in some cases are getting worse. Girls in Afghanistan are unable to exercise their most basic rights and freedoms, confined to their homes with no hope of education or economic independence.
New forms of bias and inequality are emerging. The digital divide means many girls are excluded from the online world. Algorithms based on the experience of men and boys are digitizing and amplifying sexism.
Yet around the world, girls are fighting back – confronting sexism, combatting stereotypes and creating change, on football pitches, in schools, and in the public square. We must stand with them.
My proposal for an SDG Stimulus to get the Goals on track is gaining traction. And we must invest in girls’ leadership – the theme of this year’s International Day of the Girl Child – to support girls to achieve their ambitions and to boost gender equality. When women and girls lead they can shift attitudes, create change, and advance policies and solutions that address their needs.
Women and girls can lead us to a fairer future. On this International Day of the Girl Child, let us amplify girls’ voices, and recommit to working together to build a world where every girl can lead and thrive.

South Asian officials, legislators, girls and campaigners commit to advancing girls’ rights
UNICEF and partners call for greater investment for 170 million adolescent girls living in South Asia, many of whom are out of school, married too young and undernourished
KATHMANDU/11 October 2023: More than 60 government officials, parliament members, adolescent girls and women and girl-led civil society organizations from eight countries came together to advance adolescent girls’ rights in South Asia.
Participants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka committed to focusing on adolescent girls in policies, actions and resource allocation plans at a regional consultation organized by UNICEF in Kathmandu between 9-10 October. In response to girls’ calls for change, they also developed a plan to harness the potential of millions of adolescent girls in South Asia by investing in their future.
“Far too many young girls in South Asia are forced to get married, drop out of school or are subjected to abuse. Despite the challenges, everywhere I go in this region, I see girls who are driven and determined, skilled and solution oriented,” said Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia.  “The message is clear: South Asia’s girls want equal opportunities. And they want them now. Together, we need to ensure that all girls in this region are not left behind. Evidence shows that when we invest in girls, we lift nations.”
South Asia is home to one-third of the world’s 600 million adolescent girls – or a staggering 170 million - yet they are undervalued, and their potential remains largely untapped. For example, 1 in every 5 girls is undernourished. More than half of adolescent girls are anaemic. Only 36 per cent of girls have completed secondary school.
In addition, South Asia accounts for nearly half of the world’s child brides. Across the region, about one-third of adolescent girls are not being educated, employed or trained. Investment in adolescent girls is low, compounded by climate change and conflicts.
To deliver on basic rights for every child, as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNICEF and government partners work together to provide adolescent girls with programmes to keep them safe, healthy and build their skills:
UNICEF plans to reach 25 million girls by 2025 but to do so, more commitments are needed from policy makers and partners in South Asia. To accelerate change, participants at the forum jointly agreed to:
·       Governments, private sector businesses and philanthropic organizations to commit to equitable, tailored and meaningful investments today to allow adolescent girls to fulfil their potential.
Evidence from UNICEF’s Investment Case for Girls suggests that with adequate health and nutrition investments, the world could save more than 12 million lives, prevent more than 30 million unwanted pregnancies, and greatly reduce maternal and newborn deaths and injuries.
“No nation can get ahead if half its population is left behind. We must make bold investments to ensure that every girl in South Asia can complete their education, get better health services and live a life free of violence,” added Wijesekera. “By empowering a girl to take charge of her life, we are not just empowering an individual, but an entire community.”

IFAD-financed projects work together to boost rural development in Pakistan
Murree, 29 September 2023 – To foster rural development while striving to reduce poverty, enhance food security, and empower rural communities in Pakistan, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) organized a two-day ‘Portfolio Overview Workshop’ in Murree from 25 to 26 September 2023.
The event also marked the presence of Fernanda Thomaz Da Rocha, the newly appointed IFAD Country Director for Pakistan, and Arnoud Hameleers, IFAD Country Director for Bangladesh, along with Project Coordinators, Directors, country team members, partner organization representatives, and local experts from the Project Management Units.
The workshop brought together key stakeholders to discuss challenges and collaborative solutions for the IFAD-financed projects. Participants explored ways to connect farmers and producers, integrate high-value and climate-resilient crops, strengthen farmers' organizations, and promote private sector engagement.
Lauding the initiative of reviewing the portfolio together with the government and relevant stakeholders, Arnoud Hameleers says, “these processes are instrumental in enabling experts to identify areas of challenge within implementation. And this is where we start addressing the challenges and finding resolutions to them.”
Fernanda Thomaz Da Rocha conveyed her appreciation to the attendees at the workshop and introduced herself to both the internal and external stakeholders on this occasion. She emphasized the longstanding partnership between IFAD and the Government of Pakistan. “Such collaborative workshops strengthen this alliance in advancing rural development and reducing poverty in the region,” she added.
Da Rocha also spoke about key challenges, including climate change, social and economic empowerment of women and youth, and the need to strengthen farmers' organizations in the journey of rural development. She stressed, "we need to step up our mission to better integrate climate change considerations into our projects and enhance the resilience of rural communities. Engaging youth in productive activities and value chains is crucial for Pakistan's future."
Commending the initiative by the IFAD Country Office, Azam Khan, Deputy Secretary, Economic Affairs Division said, “this workshop offered the project teams a platform to present their progress, performance, and future plans.” Emphasizing IFAD's core mission of supporting rural communities, Khan also commended the strong collaboration between the government and Pakistan and IFAD in the fight against rural poverty.
The workshop ended with an interactive session where the project implementors discussed the areas of improvement in implementation and the roadblocks they face. They collaboratively brainstormed and exchanged ideas to find solutions.
In Pakistan, IFAD supported a total of 29 projects with over 800 million in financing. Currently, there are five ongoing projects in the country. Together with the government, IFAD has positively impacted 2.8 million households in rural areas of the country.

The International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons reminds us that a peaceful future depends on ending the nuclear threat.
Geopolitical mistrust and competition have spiked the nuclear risk to Cold War levels. Meanwhile, hard-won progress over many decades to prevent the use, spread and testing of nuclear weapons is being undone.
On this important Day, we re-affirm our commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons and the humanitarian catastrophe their use would unleash.
This means nuclear-weapon States leading the way by meeting their disarmament obligations, and committing to never use nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
It means strengthening the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, including through the Treaties on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
It means all countries that have not yet ratified the Comprehensive-Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to do so without delay, and for those States that possess nuclear weapons to ensure a moratorium on all nuclear testing.
It means taking into account the evolving nuclear order, and addressing the blurring lines between strategic and conventional weapons and the nexus with new and emerging technologies.
Above all, it means deploying the timeless tools of dialogue, diplomacy and negotiation to ease tensions and end the nuclear threat. The recently launched Policy Brief on a New Agenda for Peace calls on Member States to urgently recommit to this important cause.
The only way to eliminate the nuclear risk is to eliminate nuclear weapons.
Let’s work together to banish these devices of destruction to the history books, once and for all.

EFP with support from ILO organizes the 17th Occupational Safety, Health and Environment Awards
ILO and other social partners reaffirm their commitment to promoting safe and productive workplaces ensuring the safety of workers and enterprise sustainability.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (ILO News) – Supported by the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Employers’ Federation of Pakistan (EFP) organized, on 25 September 2023, the 17th Occupational Safety and Health Award, to recognize the efforts of Pakistani enterprises that have demonstrated good occupational safety and health (OSH) practices and taken innovative initiatives to ensure the safety of workers at the workplace.
Over the last 17 years, more than 550 companies have been recognized for their good OSH practices and assisted in improving workplace health and safety through training and guidance provided by the ILO and EFP.
The ceremony was attended by representatives from the Government, employers’ and workers' organizations, and enterprises – including winning and participating enterprises. Omer Soomro, Minister for Law and Religious Affairs, Government of Sindh, attended the ceremony as chief guest.
“Occupational safety and health is a fundamental principle and right at work. ILO is pleased to acknowledge that the Government of Pakistan is actively pursuing the ratification of ILO’s core OSH Conventions, Number. 155 and Number 187,” said Geir Tonstol, ILO’s Country Director for Pakistan. “The ratification of these two Conventions would further demonstrate Pakistan’s commitment to a safe and inclusive world of work,” he added.
Recognizing the private sector’s role, Geir Tonstol said that the private sector plays a significant role in fostering a culture of prevention, facilitating the sharing of best corporate practices, and establishing robust connections with national authorities responsible for labour issues, “Health and safety are crucial for the long-term sustainability of businesses”.
“EFP recognizes that OSH is not only a fundamental right but also a moral and practical necessity. In 2022, the International Labour Conference in Geneva adopted the ILO’s two OSH conventions as core labour standards, thereby increasing the responsibilities of the government, employers, and workers to respect and comply with OSH legislation,” said Malik Tahir Javaid, President of the Employers’ Federation of Pakistan.
Tahir Javaid emphasized that the development of local industry and industrialization in Pakistan are the only solutions to addressing the challenges that the economy is currently facing, including increasing unemployment and poverty. “We, therefore, request the Government to place more importance on skills development, simplification of labour legislations and strengthening of social protection and other mechanisms to support the industry,” he added.
“The Sindh Government is fully committed to promoting a culture of health and safety, making the well-being of its people a central focus of the province's sustainable development and growth strategy," said Omer Soomro, Minister for Law and Religious Affairs, Government of Sindh
Omer Soomro urged employers, especially those in export sectors, to adhere to ILO Labor Standards, including OSH Conventions, to continue benefitting from the EU’s GSP Plus benefits and support Pakistan's sustainable development through increased exports.
Also speaking at the occasion Zahoor Awan, ILO’s Governing Body Member, and Munazza Gillani, Country Director Sight Savers, appreciated this very important initiative coming directly from employers and also stressed upon the need to collectively work further on promoting health and safety, especially for individuals with special needs.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE
21 September 2023
As we mark this International Day of Peace, people and our planet are in crisis.
Conflicts driving record numbers of people from their homes.
Deadly fires, raging floods and soaring temperatures.
Poverty, inequalities and injustices.
Mistrust, division and prejudice.
This year’s theme reminds us that peace is not automatic.
Peace is the result of action.
Action to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and ensure that no one is left behind.
Action to end the war on our planet and its natural gifts.
Action to uphold and protect the human rights and dignity of every person — especially as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Action to use the timeless tools of diplomacy, dialogue and collaboration to defuse tensions and end conflict.
And action for those millions of people living through the horrors of war.
Peace is not only a noble vision for humanity.
Peace is a call to action.
Let us commit to build, drive and sustain peace for all.

UNIC - PRESS RELEASE : United Nations organizes eight of 12 dialogues about sustainable development in Quetta, Balochistan
United Nations organizes eight of 12 dialogues about sustainable development in Quetta, Balochistan
More than 1,000 local leaders living in 12 major cities outside of the federal and provincial capitals will discuss development priorities across the country.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, 14 September 2023 - Today the eighth of a series of 12 dialogues on sustainable development was held in Quetta, Balochistan, by the United Nations and the district administration.
In total, more than 1,000 local leaders living in 12 major cities across six provinces and territories are discussing the development challenges which they face, and how they impede economic and social progress in their districts. The dialogues are being held in the different languages spoken across Pakistan.
“These dialogues bring the United Nations closer to the people and the local governments that we serve, said Julien Harneis, UN Resident Coordinator in Pakistan.  “We are actively listening to their concerns and their ideas. They will work together, and with us, on accelerating progress to bridge inequalities and reduce poverty. We will share their suggestions with the federal Government as we focus on returning to sustainable development.”
In Quetta, the discussions focused on four topics chosen by the participants ahead of the event: governance, digital transformation, youth employment and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
Nearly 100 local leaders -- women and men, including youth -- participated together with senior officials from Quetta, the United Nations Resident Coordinator, and other UN staff.
The 12 dialogues are engaging local leaders around development issues such as access to basic social services; gender equality and women’s empowerment; climate change; sustainable, inclusive economic growth and decent work; and basic social services. All are key to Pakistan’s progress towards the achievement of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Seven SDG dialogues have already taken place in Bahawalpur, Multan and Rawalpindi, Punjab; Hyderabad and Sukkur, Sindh; and in Mardan and Mansehra, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The dialogues will help inform discussions ahead of the global SDG Summit which the UN is organizing to accelerate progress towards the SDGs, halfway of the 2030 deadline. The Government of Pakistan will participate in the event in New York on 18 and 19 September 2023.
The SDGs, also known as Global Goals, are 17 objectives designed to help bring about peace and prosperity for people all over the world. They are an urgent call for action by all countries to work together towards ending poverty while improving health and education, reducing inequality, spurring economic growth and tackling climate change.

ILO forecasts Pakistan unemployment up 1.5 million since 2021
New labour market brief highlights how prolonged crises are cumulating in extreme labour market distress.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (ILO News) – Deflated job growth and rising unemployment could push Pakistan’s progress toward decent work back by decades, according to a new labour market update issued by the International Labour Organization (ILO).
The brief examines the labour market trends in Pakistan and presents estimates of the impacts of the lingering crisis on employment outcomes in the near term.
According to ILO estimates, in 2023, Pakistan's employment-to-population ratio has fallen well below its pre-crisis trendline at 47.6 per cent while the number of unemployed persons is expected to reach 5.6 million—a surge of 1.5 million since 2021.
The report also highlights that the female unemployment rate, which is historically at least 1.5 times that of male rates, could reach a high of 11.1 per cent.
The increasing labour market challenges reflect the cumulation of Pakistan’s economic distress, following from the shock of the COVID-19 crisis, the 2022 floods and exacerbated by the recent macroeconomic turmoil. Pakistan's recent agreement with the IMF, securing a USD 3 billion Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in July 2023, aims to avert a debt default and shore up investor confidence. However, the SBA and the squeeze on public financing required in its implementation are likely to add further stress to labour market prospects, at least in the short term.
“Pakistan is facing a multitude of challenges that are taking a heavy toll on its labour markets while driving greater informality and out-migration. The ILO, through its Fourth Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP), is dedicated to addressing the plight of workers and struggling enterprises and to finding solutions that will help to increase the security of their livelihoods through these difficult times,” said Geir Tonstol, ILO Country Director for Pakistan.
He further said that ILO would reinforce social dialogue as an instrument for social stability and develop integrated provincial-level inclusive recovery strategies for decent job creation, with a particular focus on women and youth.
The brief highlights a series of possible steps that could support labour-market recovery and mitigate a worsening of decent work deficits in Pakistan in the near-term. These include provincial-level recovery strategies for decent job creation, with a particular focus on women and youth; maintaining government spending on jobs and social protection programmes focussing on the poor and most vulnerable; supporting small and medium-sized enterprises; prioritizing
labour-intensive climate adaptation programmes; and reinforcing social dialogue as an instrument for social stability.

Children bearing brunt of stalled progress on extreme poverty reduction worldwide – UNICEF, World Bank
333 million children globally survive on less than US$2.15 a day as new analysis reveals three lost years due to COVID-19
Multimedia content available to download here.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON D.C., 13 September 2023 – An estimated 333 million children globally – or 1 in 6 – live in extreme poverty, according to new UNICEF-World Bank analysis released today.
Global Trends in Child Monetary Poverty According to International Poverty Lines – which for the first time looks at trends in extreme child poverty – finds that while the number of children living on less than US$2.15 a day decreased from 383 million to 333 million (or 13 per cent) between 2013 and 2022, the economic impact of COVID-19 led to three lost years of progress, or 30 million fewer children than projected in the absence of COVID-19-related disruptions.
The analysis – released ahead of High-level Week of the United Nations General Assembly (18 – 22 September), when global leaders will, among other things, meet to discuss the mid-point of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – warns that, at current rates of reduction, the SDG goal of ending extreme child poverty by 2030 will not be met.
“Seven years ago, the world made a promise to end extreme child poverty by 2030. We have made progress, showing that with the right investments and will, there is a way to lift millions of children out of what is often a vicious cycle of poverty,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “But compounding crises, from the impacts of COVID-19, conflict, climate change and economic shocks, have stalled progress, and left millions of children in extreme poverty. We cannot fail these children now. Ending child poverty is a policy choice. Efforts must be redoubled to ensure that all children have access to essential services, including education, nutrition, health care and social protection, while addressing the root causes of extreme poverty.”

According to the report, Sub-Saharan Africa carries the highest burden of children – 40 per cent – living in extreme poverty, and accounts for the largest share increase in the last decade, jumping from 54.8 per cent in 2013 to 71.1 per cent in 2022. Rapid population growth, limited social protection measures, and challenging global trends including COVID-19, conflict, and climate-related disasters, have resulted in the steep increase. Meanwhile, all other regions in the world have seen a steady decline in extreme poverty rates, with the exception of the Middle East and North Africa.

Globally, children comprise more than 50 per cent of the extreme poor, despite making up only a third of the global population. Children are more than twice as likely as adults – 15.8 per cent versus 6.6 per cent – to live in extremely poor households, lacking the food, sanitation, shelter, health care, and education they need to survive and thrive.
“A world where 333 million children live in extreme poverty -- deprived not only of basic needs but also dignity, opportunity or hope -- is simply intolerable,” said World Bank Global Director for Poverty and Equity Luis-Felipe Lopez-Calva. “It is more critical than ever that all children have a clear pathway out of poverty – through equitable access to quality education, nutrition, health, and social protection, as well as safety and security. This report should be a stark reminder that we have no time to lose in the fight against poverty and inequality, and that children must be foremost in our efforts.”
The most vulnerable children – such as those living in rural settings and children living in households where the head has little or no education – are significantly more affected by extreme poverty. According to the report, an estimated 1 in 3 children in countries affected by conflict and fragility live in extremely poor households, compared to 1 in 10 in non-fragile states.
To end extreme poverty and offset the pandemic backslide, UNICEF and the World Bank are calling on governments and partners to:

Notes to Editors
The Global Trends in Child Monetary Poverty According to International Poverty Lines analysis builds on a similar exercise conducted in 2020 to examine child poverty. The analysis contains records from 10.4 million individuals from 147 countries, taken from the 2022 spring version of the Global Monitoring Database (GMD) with 2019 as a base year. The GMD is a collection of globally harmonized household survey data compiled by the Data for Goals group of the World Bank’s Poverty and Equity Global Practice.

Poverty estimates for 2020, 2021 and 2022 have been “nowcasted”—that is, gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates have been used to forecast household incomes, assuming all households experience equal consumption growth in percentage terms.

The international poverty lines were updated in 2022. The three poverty lines are:
$2.15 (extreme poverty), $3.65 (lower middle income) and $6.85 (upper middle income).
Approximately 333 million children globally survive on less than US$2.15 a day, 829 million children subsist below a poverty line of US$3.65, and 1.43 billion children are living on less than US$6.85 a day.

Four Agriculture Training Centers Established in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa including Merged Districts
Islamabad, September 7, 2023 — The Directorate of Agriculture Extension of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the U.S. Embassy Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan inaugurated four Agriculture Training Centers (ATCs) established in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa including the merged districts. The objective of establishing these centers is to enhance the capacity of farmers in the merged districts to promote the cultivation of alternative crops and eradicate illicit crops and other drug-related crimes.
With funding from the U.S. Embassy Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, the ATCs were established by the UNDP Pakistan Rule of Law Programme in partnership with the Sustainable Development Unit of the Planning and Development Department (P&DD), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in the districts of  Bajaur, Khyber, Mohmand, and Torghar. These centers will facilitate the training of the local farmers on the cultivation of alternative crops in the merged districts, where the cultivation of poppy predominates. Alternatively, crop cultivation will create opportunities for income diversification, gradually diminishing the prevalence of any illicit activities associated with narcotics in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The training at ATCs will include skill-building sessions on timely land preparation, planting, weeding, irrigation, harvesting, storage, and marketing. These training centers, especially through modern technologies, can improve how farmers in these areas receive, exchange, and utilize information. The farmers will also be connected with enterprises for long-term income and job opportunities.
Ms Lori Antolinez, Director, U.S. Embassy Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Mr Muhammad Jawed Marwat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Secretary of Agriculture Department, and Dr Samuel Rizk, UNDP Resident Representative joined the event to celebrate the successful completion of the $975K project.
In his address, Mr Muhammad Javed Marwat, Secretary Agriculture Department, extended his gratitude to UNDP Pakistan and the U.S. Embassy Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement for their unwavering support. He asserted, “We are committed to curbing poppy cultivation and the trade of illicit substances to drive economic and social growth in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, especially the merged districts.”
Under the U.S.-Pakistan Green Alliance framework, the U.S. is committed to supporting Pakistan as it strengthens climate resilience, pursues energy transformation, and fosters inclusive economic growth. At the event, the U.S. Embassy Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Director, Ms Lori Antolinez said, “Through these training centers, these farmers and their families can take pride in developing new skills, producing lucrative crops, and, even more importantly, building a more secure and prosperous Pakistan. ”
UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative, Dr. Samuel Rizk highlighted the U.S. Embassy Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement’s pivotal role in developing sustainable alternate livelihood solutions in the merged areas, “We appreciate the U.S. Embassy Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement’s collaboration and funding to build the first-ever Agriculture Training Centers in the merged districts. These centers will promote the cultivation of alternative crops as a sustainable source of income generation for many individuals and communities. Over time, these centers will not only reduce drug-related crime but will also improve the quality of life of those living in the merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, paving the way for inclusive, dignified, and sustainable development.”
The UNDP Rule of Law Programme is implementing a range of interventions to enhance security and justice sector governance in Pakistan.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF POLICE COOPERATION
“Women in policing”
7 September 2023
On this inaugural International Day of Police Cooperation, I wish to commend law enforcement from around the world for their dedication to peace, security and justice.
By sharing best practices, intelligence, and resources, police forces enhance our collective ability to confront crime, ensure safety and prevent conflict.
The principles that underpin police cooperation – accountability, transparency, and respect for diversity – are essential to renewing a social contract anchored in human rights. Community-oriented policing that emphasizes outreach and local solutions helps to build trust and improve safety.
Today, we also highlight the invaluable impacts of women in policing.
Women’s participation promotes access to justice for all, including for victims of gender-based violence, who may be more likely to seek help from women officers.
Police must reflect the diverse societies they serve. The United Nations supports Member States in ensuring that women are equally represented in all functions, including as leaders, of the police workforce.
Together, let us promote cooperation, foster gender equality and build a safer future for everyone.

ILO and All Pakistan Labour Federation join hands to protect safety and health of mine workers
Advocating a comprehensive strategy for safe mining in Pakistan and continuing the campaign for the ratification of Convention 176.
QUETTA, Pakistan (ILO News) – Ratification of the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Safety and Health in Mines Convention will ensure the rights of Pakistan’s 300,000 mine workers, participants at a consultative workshop, supported by the International Labour Organization (ILO), in Quetta, Baluchistan, concluded.
Representatives of government departments, workers’ and employers’ organizations, examined ways to promote occupational safety and health in mines at consultation, organized by the All-Pakistan Labour Foundation (APLF) and Pakistan Central Mines Labour Federation (PCLMF).
The participants agreed to intensify the campaign for the ratification of ILO Convention No. 176, to ensure workplace safety and social security coverage for Pakistan’s mine workers. 34 countries have so far ratified Convention 176 which came into force in 1995, but not Pakistan.
“The ratification of Convention 176 is central to achieving decent work in a sector that is particularly prone to accidents and injuries. It is an essential tool for resolving the challenge of occupational safety and health in Pakistan’s mining industry,” said Geir Tonstol, Country Director of ILO in Pakistan.
He further recalled that a significant proportion of workers in Pakistan’s mining sector, especially casual labourers, are not able to access social protection, as they are not recognized as mine employees. “I am encouraged by the initiative of our social partners to establish a trade union platform of action on OSH in mines here in Baluchistan. The ILO is committed to providing the technical assistance required to create safer, healthier, and more inclusive workplaces for all,” added Geir Tonstol.
Lala Sultan Khan, President of APLF, welcomed participants and highlighted the challenges faced by mine workers, and called for joint actions using Trade Union Platforms, such as those in Baluchistan. “It's crucial to have a thorough understanding of the country's mining operations. Regular provincial and federal consultations are overdue to address mining sector challenges and enhance worker safety,” emphasized Sultan Khan.
Mines in Pakistan employ around 300,000 workers and contribute significantly to the GDP of the country. Accidents and injuries are reported every year. Workers at mining sites in Pakistan are often not provided with appropriate skills training to execute the work allocated to them, and they are unaware of potential hazards. In June 2022, the International Labour Conference took a historic step by incorporating "a safe and healthy working environment" into the ILO's framework of fundamental principles and rights at work.

PRESS RELEASE
United Nations organizes fifth of 12 dialogues about sustainable development in Rawalpindi
More than 1,000 local leaders living in 12 major cities outside of the federal and provincial capitals will discuss development priorities across the country.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, 31 August 2023 - Today the fifth of a series of 12 dialogues on sustainable development was held in Rawalpindi, Punjab, by the United Nations and the district administration.
In total, more than 1,000 local leaders living in 12 major cities across six provinces and territories will discuss the development challenges which they face, and how they impede economic and social progress in their districts. The dialogues will be held in the different languages spoken across Pakistan in the coming weeks.
“These dialogues bring the United Nations closer to the people and the local governments that we serve, said Julien Harneis, UN Resident Coordinator in Pakistan.  “We are actively listening to their concerns and their ideas. They will work together, and with us, on accelerating progress to bridge inequalities and reduce poverty. We will share their suggestions with the federal Government as we focus on returning to sustainable development.”
In Rawalpindi, the discussions focused on four topics chosen by the participants ahead of the event: women’s voice and participation, digital transformation, youth employment, and access to health services.
Nearly 100 local leaders -- women and men, including youth -- participated together with senior Rawalpindi officials, the United Nations Resident Coordinator, and other UN staff.
The 12 dialogues are engaging local leaders around development issues such as access to basic social services; gender equality and women’s empowerment; climate change; sustainable, inclusive economic growth and decent work; and governance. All are key to Pakistan’s progress towards the achievement of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Four SDG dialogues have already taken place in Bahawalpur and Multan, Punjab, and in Hyderabad and Sukkur, Sindh.
The dialogues will help inform discussions ahead of the global SDG Summit which the UN is organizing to accelerate progress towards the SDGs, halfway of the 2030 deadline. The Government of Pakistan will participate in the event in New York on 18 and 19 September 2023.
The SDGs, also known as Global Goals, are 17 objectives designed to help bring about peace and prosperity for people all over the world. They are an urgent call for action by all countries to work together towards ending poverty while improving health and education, reducing inequality, spurring economic growth and tackling climate change.

PRESS RELEASE
One year on from catastrophic floods, millions of children in Pakistan still need urgent support
ISLAMABAD, 25 August 2023 – One year after historic floods devastated Pakistan and a national state of emergency was declared, millions of children continue to need humanitarian assistance and access to essential services, UNICEF warned today. Recovery and rehabilitation efforts remain underfunded.
This season’s monsoon rains are worsening already challenging conditions for flood-affected communities, tragically claiming the lives of 87 children across the country. UNICEF estimates there are still 8 million people, around half of whom are children, that continue to live without access to safe water in flood-affected areas. Over 1.5 million children require lifesaving nutrition interventions in flood-affected districts, while UNICEF’s current appeal of US$173.5 million to provide life-saving support remains only 57 per cent funded.
“Vulnerable children living in flood-affected areas have endured a horrific year,” said Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “They lost their loved ones, their homes and schools. As the monsoon rains return, the fear of another climate disaster looms large. Recovery efforts continue, but many remain unreached, and the children of Pakistan risk being forgotten.”
Last year’s floods submerged one third of the country, affecting 33 million people, half of whom were children. Vital infrastructure was damaged or destroyed – including 30,000 schools, 2,000 health facilities and 4,300 water systems. The climate-related disaster deepened pre-existing inequities for children and families in affected districts. One third of children were already out of school before the floods, malnutrition was reaching emergency levels and access to safe drinking water and sanitation was worryingly low.
Since August 2022, thanks to support from the international community, UNICEF and partners have reached 3.6 million people with primary health care services; enabled access to safe water for 1.7 million people in areas where water networks were damaged or destroyed; reached over 545,000 children and caregivers with mental health and psychosocial support; and supported education for over 258,000 children. Over the past twelve months, UNICEF has screened 2.1 million children for severe acute malnutrition – a condition where children are too thin for their height - and admitted 172,000 children for lifesaving treatment. Yet the needs continue to outstrip the resources required to respond.
“UNICEF calls on the Government of Pakistan and partners to increase and sustain investment in basic social services for children and families. We must build back climate-resilient systems that bridge equity gaps and reduce vulnerability to climate shocks. We cannot forget the children of Pakistan. The flood waters have gone, but their troubles remain, in this climate volatile region,” said Fadil.

تباہ کن سیلاب کے ایک سال بعد بھی پاکستان میں لاکھوں بچے فوری امداد کے منتظر  ہیں
اسلام آباد۔ 25 اگست2023:  یونیسف نے خبردار کیا ہے کہ پاکستان میں تاریخ   کے بدترین   سیلاب کی تباہ کاریوں اور ہنگامی حالت کے اعلان کے ایک سال بعد بھی لاکھوں بچے انسانی امداد اور ضروری خدمات تک رسائی  کے منتظر ہیں۔ بحالی اور آبادکاری  کی کوششوں کو ابھی تک درکار  مالی اعانت فراہم نہیں کی جاسکی  ہے۔
رواں سال  مون سون بارشوں کی وجہ سے سیلاب سے متاثرہ آبادیوں کے لیے پہلے سے ہی مشکل حالات  مزید بدتر  ہو رہے ہیں، جس کے نتیجے میں ملک بھر میں اب تک  87  بچے موت کا شکار ہوچکے ہیں ۔ یونیسف کے اندازوں کے مطابق اب بھی 80 لاکھ افراد جن میں سے نصف بچے ہیں ،سیلاب سے متاثرہ علاقوں میں صاف پانی تک رسائی سے محروم ہیں۔ سیلاب سے متاثرہ اضلاع میں 15لاکھ سے زائد بچوں کو زندگی بچانے والی خوراک کی ضرورت ہے، جبکہ یونیسف کی  اپیل میں  زندگیاں بچانے  کی کوششوں  کے لیے مانگی گئی  173.5 ملین امریکی ڈالر کی امداد کا محض 57فیصد فراہم ہوسکا  ہے۔
پاکستان میں یونیسف کے سربراہ عبداللہ فاضل نے کہا کہ سیلاب سے متاثرہ علاقوں میں رہنے والے خطرات کے شکار  بچوں نے ایک سال خوف کے سایے تلے  گزارا ہے۔ انہوں نے اپنے پیاروں، گھروں اور اسکولوں کو کھو یا ہے ۔ جیسے ہی  مون سون کی بارشیں شروع ہوئی  ہیں، موسمیاتی تبدیلی  سے ہونے والی  تباہیوں  کا خدشہ بڑھتا جارہا ہے۔ بحالی  کی کوششیں جاری ہیں، لیکن بہت سے لوگوں تک اب بھی  کوئی مدد نہیں پہنچ سکی ہے اور پاکستان کے بچوں کو فراموش کیے جانے کا خطرہ ہے۔
گزشتہ سال آنے والے سیلاب سے  ملک کا ایک تہائی حصہ زیر آب آگیا تھا جس سے 33 ملین افراد متاثر ہوئے ،جن میں سے نصف بچے تھے۔سیلاب سے  اہم  انفراسٹرکچر  کو نقصان پہنچا یا  مکمل تباہ  ہوگیا۔  ان  میں 30ہزار اسکول، 2ہزار صحت کے مراکز اور 4300 پانی   کی فراہمی کی سہولیات شامل ہیں۔ موسمیاتی تبدیلی کی بدولت آنے والی  آفت نے متاثرہ اضلاع میں بچوں اور خاندانوں کو پہلے سے درپیش  عدم مساوات کو مزید گہرا کر دیا ہے۔ ایک تہائی بچے سیلاب  آنے سے پہلے ہی اسکولوں سے باہر تھے، غذائی قلت ہنگامی سطح تک پہنچ چکی  تھی اور پینے کے صاف پانی اور صفائی ستھرائی  کی سہولیات تک رسائی تشویش ناک حد تک محدود  تھی۔
اگست 2022 ء سے اب تک یونیسف اور شراکت دار اداروں نے 36 لاکھ  افراد کو بنیادی صحت کی دیکھ بھال کی خدمات فراہم کی ہیں۔ ان علاقوں میں جہاں پانی کی فراہمی کے نظام  کو نقصان پہنچا ہے یا تباہ  ہوا  ہےوہاں  17 لاکھ  افراد کے لئے  صاف اور محفوظ پانی تک رسائی کو ممکن بنایا  گیاہے۔ 545 ہزار سے زیادہ بچوں اور  صحت کے اہلکاروں کو ذہنی صحت اور نفسیاتی مدد  کی خدمات تک    رسائی حاصل دی گئی  ہے اور 258 ہزار سے زیادہ بچوں کے لئے تعلیم کی سہولیات کی فراہمی میں تعاون کیا گیا ہے  ۔  گزشتہ بارہ ماہ کے دوران یونیسف نے 21 لاکھ  بچوں میں  شدید غذائی قلت  کی جانچ کی  ، جو  ایک ایسی حالت ہے  جس میں بچے اپنے قد کے لحاظ سے بہت پتلے  ہوتے ہیں ،  اور ان میں سے  172 ہزار بچوں کا ان کی  زندگیاں بچانے  کے لیے علاج کیا جار ہا ہے ۔ اس کے باوجود ضروریات درکارو سائل   کے لحاظ سے بہت زیادہ ہیں۔
یونیسف کے سربراہ عبداللہ فاضل کا کہنا تھا ، ’’یونیسف حکومت پاکستان اور شراکت دار اداروں پر زور دیتا ہے کہ وہ بچوں اور  خاندانوں کے لئے بنیادی سماجی خدمات   میں اضافی  سرمایہ کاری کریں  اور ان  کی مسلسل فراہمی کو یقینی بنائیں ۔ ہمیں  موسمیاتی تبدیلی  کے خلاف  پائیدار نظام دوبارہ تعمیر کرنے ہونگے  جو  عدم  مساوات کو پر کریں اور موسمیاتی تبدیلی سے درپیش خطرات  کو کم کریں۔ ہم پاکستان کے بچوں کو نہیں بھول سکتے۔ سیلاب کا پانی اُتر  گیا ہے، لیکن اس موسمیاتی تبدیلی کے خطرات سے دوچار  علاقے میں ان کی پریشانیاں ابھی   برقرار ہیں۔‘‘

Swat, August 23 2023— Peshawar High Court, Balochistan High Court, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan partnered to organize a two-day consultation workshop with the support of the European Union (EU) funded ‘Deliver Justice Project.’ The workshop brought together stakeholders from the justice sector in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to discuss challenges and opportunities faced by District Legal Empowerment Committees (DLECs) operating in these provinces.
DLECs were established in 2011 by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) to provide legal aid or assistance to deserving litigants. The District and Sessions Judge (Zilla Qazi) presides over DLECs and is entrusted with the following duties:
Originally designed to enhance access to justice and legal aid in Pakistan, the optimal utilization of DLECs as a legal aid solution is challenged by access issues impacted by poverty, illiteracy, lack of awareness, cultural and gender barriers, remote locations, and inadequate compensation for lawyers. Based on the recommendations from the baseline study conducted by UNDP Pakistan’s Rule of Law Programme between August 2021 and March 2022, as part of the EU-funded ‘Deliver Justice Project’, an evaluation of citizens’ access to justice and legal aid in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan highlighted a crucial requirement for enhancing the service delivery of DLECs. This enhancement aims to establish more sustainable and easily accessible legal aid services in Pakistan with a focus on marginalized groups, such as women, transgender individuals, and children.
In light of the above, UNDP Pakistan’s Rule of Law Programme partnered with the Peshawar and Balochistan High Courts to organize a cross-provincial consultative workshop on issues faced by DLECs in serving their intended function of enabling efficient and effective access to legal aid for local communities, particularly vulnerable groups including women, transgender persons, and children.
At the end of the two-day consultative workshop, participants were able to propose recommendations for more effective functioning of DLECsfor increased synergies between legal aid mechanisms and strengthened capacity of the legal aid system. The following key recommendations were made by participants after the consultation:
Mr Malik Shoaib Sultan, Deputy Registrar, High Court of Balochistan, and Mr Arshid Jan, Deputy Programme Manager, Rule of Law Programme, UNDP Pakistan were the keynote speakers at the workshop. In his address, Mr Malik Shoaib Sultan, Deputy Registrar, High Court of Balochistan underlined, “Equal access to justice for all cannot be achieved without strengthening the role of DLECs in making legal aid more accessible to the citizens in Pakistan. We are optimistic that the recommendations made in this consultative workshop will prove pivotal in enabling more people to approach formal legal systems to seek justice.” He also appreciated the EU and UNDP  for their efforts to make the justice sector more inclusive in Pakistan.
Mr Arshid Jan, Deputy Programme Manager, Rule of Law Programme, UNDP Pakistan, affirmed, “A necessary prerequisite for the rule of law is everyone having access to justice regardless of their gender, age, and socio-economic status. UNDP is committed to securing a future where everyone can claim their legal rights through equal access to free legal aid in Pakistan. We thank our long-term partners Peshawar and Balochistan High Courts, UNODC, UN Women, and the EU for their ongoing collaborations to  strengthen peace and justice in the region.”
The “Deliver Justice programme” funded by the EU aims to support reform processes to ensure the delivery of people-centred justice, enhance access to justice for all, particularly women and less privileged groups, and improve service delivery of the security sector in line with constitutional safeguards and international standards in the Merged Districts and Balochistan. The programme is funded by the EU and jointly implemented by UNDP, UN Women, and UNODC.
The UNDP Rule of Law Programme is implementing a range of interventions to enhance security and justice sector governance in Pakistan.

PRESS RELEASE
ILO and Pakistan Workers’ Federation join hands for protection of the rights of domestic workers
Discussions consider the ratification of ILO’s Domestic Workers’ Convention and recognise the many benefits this would bring.
Quetta, Baluchistan (ILO News) – Ratification of the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Domestic Workers Convention would confirm the labour rights of Pakistan’s 8.5 million domestic workers and recognize them as workers and essential service providers, participants at a consultative workshop heard today.
Supported by ILO, the consultation was organized by the Pakistan Workers’ Federation (PWF) in Quetta, Baluchistan. Representatives of Government departments, at both federal and provincial levels, met along with employers’ and workers’ organizations, to discuss ways to promote the formalization of domestic workers and advocate for ratification of the ILO Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189).
This step will extend social security benefits and services to domestic workers and improve their working conditions across the country.
“ILO is thankful to the PWF for their commitment to making this dialogue process a reality and carving a way forward for making Decent Work a reality for all domestic workers in Pakistan”, said Geir Tonstol, Country Director of ILO Pakistan. “There is no social justice without decent work for domestic worker”.
“Takeaways from this discussion will serve as important input to both legislative and policy reforms that will ultimately support the ratification of Convention No. 189 by Pakistan and increase the protection of domestic workers across the country,” he added.
“The vast majority of domestic workers in Balochistan are excluded from labour protection and are vulnerable to exploitation by employers, intermediaries and sometimes even their own families”, said Zahoor Awan, Chairman Steering Committee PWF and Worker Member of the ILO Governing Body.
He further said it is high time that all the stakeholders continue to come together and take comprehensive measures to protect and enhance the welfare of domestic workers, aligning with the ongoing global efforts to promote fair and just labour practices.
The informal economy in Pakistan is characterised by low levels of education and skills, a lack of capital resources, lower incomes, and a high degree of segregation.  Domestic workers are also at risk of exploitation due to their high reliance on intermediaries to find domestic work opportunities in the cities.
According to ILO estimates, there are at least 8.5 million domestic workers in Pakistan, the vast majority of whom are women and young girls. Although domestic work is one of the biggest sources of employment in the informal economy, it is unregistered and excluded from the scope of labour legislation as it takes place in private households.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR WORLD HUMANITARIAN DAY
19 August 2023
This year’s World Humanitarian Day marks the 20th anniversary of the deadly attack on the Canal Hotel in Baghdad.
On that dark day, we lost 22 colleagues, including Special Representative Sergio Vieira de Mello.
That tragedy marked a change in the way humanitarians operate.
Because today, although humanitarians are respected around the world, they may also be targeted by those who would do them harm.
This year, global humanitarian operations aim to get life-saving aid to 250 million people in 69 countries – ten times more than at the time of the Canal Hotel bombing.
Sadly, funding is far off track. As crises multiply, it is unacceptable that humanitarians are being forced to reduce aid to millions of people in need.
Other challenges have also multiplied over the past twenty years:
Rising geopolitical tensions;
A blatant disregard for international humanitarian and human rights law;
Deliberate assault and disinformation campaigns.
Humanitarianism itself is now under attack.
But these tests have made the global humanitarian community stronger.
Humanitarians – who are mostly national staff working in their own countries – are even closer to the people they serve.
They are finding new ways to venture deeper into disaster-stricken regions, and closer to the front lines of conflictdriven by a single purpose: to save and protect lives.
On this World Humanitarian Day, we salute the courage and dedication of humanitarian aid workers everywhere.
We reaffirm our full support for their determined and life-saving efforts across the world.
We celebrate their unwavering dedication to serve ALL people in need:
No matter who, no matter where; no matter what.
Thank you.

PRESS RELEASE
76 per cent of children exposed to extreme high temperatures in South Asia - UNICEF
With heat and high humidity in South Asia, UNICEF urges local authorities, frontline health workers and caregivers to help vulnerable children and families
NEW DELHI/KATHMANDU, 7 August 2023 – South Asia has the highest percentage of children exposed to extreme high temperatures, compared to all other regions, according to a UNICEF analysis.
UNICEF estimates that 76 per cent of children under 18 in South Asia – 460 million – are exposed to extreme high temperatures where 83 or more days in a year exceed 35°C. This means that 3 in 4 children in South Asia are already exposed to extreme high temperature compared to only 1 in 3 children (32 per cent) globally. The analysis is of 2020 data, the latest available.
In addition, the data also show that 28 per cent of children across South Asia are exposed to 4.5 or more heatwaves per year, compared to 24 per cent globally.
July was the hottest month ever recorded globally, raising further concerns about a future where children, including those living in South Asia, are expected to face more frequent and severe heatwaves, largely due to climate change.
“With the world at global boiling, the data clearly show that the lives and well-being of millions of children across South Asia are increasingly threatened by heat waves and high temperatures. Countries in the region are not the hottest in the world right now but the heat here brings life-threatening risks for millions of vulnerable children,” said Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia.  “We are particularly concerned about babies, toddlers, malnourished children and pregnant women as they are most vulnerable to heat strokes and other serious effects.”
According to UNICEF’s 2021 Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI), children in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, and Pakistan are at 'extremely high risk' of the impacts of climate change.
In parts of Pakistan’s southern Sindh province, including Jacobabad, the world’s hottest city in 2022, temperatures were in their 40’s in June, exposing 1.8 million people to severe short- and long-term health risks. The scorching heat came less than one year after the devastating floods which left most parts of southern Sindh underwater in August 2022.  More than 800,000 children in flood-affected areas were at risk of severe heat stress in June 2023.
Even in the rainy season, the heat can exacerbate the situation for children. Since children cannot adapt quickly to temperature changes, they are not able to remove excess heat from their bodies. This can cause symptoms and illnesses such as higher body temperature, rapid heartbeat, cramps, severe headache, confusion, organ failure, dehydration, fainting and coma, in young children; poor mental development in infants; and developmental setbacks such as neurological dysfunction, and cardiovascular diseases. Early contractions, hypertension, seizures, high blood pressure, preterm births and stillbirths are risks for pregnant women, who are particularly susceptible to heat.
For young children, ice packs, fans or misting with water can help lower their body temperature, while cold water immersion can help older children.
Education, awareness, and preparedness are key to responding to this crisis. During high temperatures, UNICEF urges frontline workers, parents, families, caregivers and local authorities to protect children and B.E.A.T. the heat by taking the following steps:
Ultimately, the most vulnerable children, adolescents and women are the ones that pay the highest price for extreme weather events.
“Young children simply cannot handle the heat,” added Wijesekera. “Unless we act now, these children will continue to bear the brunt of more frequent and more severe heatwaves in the coming years, for no fault of theirs.”

جنوبی ایشیاء میں گرمی اور ہوا میں نمی کے بلند تناسب کے پیش نظر یونیسف نے مقامی حکام، فرنٹ لائن ہیلتھ ورکرز اور صحت کے اہلکاروں  پر زور دیا ہے کہ وہ خطرے سے دوچار  بچوں اور خاندانوں کی مدد کریں۔

نئی دہلی/کھٹمنڈو، 07اگست  2023:  یونیسف کے ایک تجزیے کے مطابق دنیا کے دیگر  خطوں کے مقابلے میں جنوبی ایشیاء  میں  بلند ترین درجہ ٔ حرارت  کا سامنا کرنے والے بچوں کی شرح سب سے زیادہ ہے۔
یونیسف کے اندازوں کے مطابق  جنوبی ایشیا ءمیں 18 سال سے کم عمر کے 76 فیصد، یعنی 46 کروڑ بچوں کو سخت ترین گرمی کا سامنا ہے ، جہاں سال میں 83 یا اس سے زائد  دن درجہ حرارت  35 ڈگری سینٹی گریڈ سے اوپر  رہتا ہے ۔ اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ جنوبی ایشیا میں ہر 4 میں سے 3 بچے پہلے ہی انتہائی شدید گرمی  کا سامنا کر رہے ہیں جبکہ عالمی سطح پر 3 میں سے صرف ایک بچے (32 فیصد) کو اس قسم کی  صورت حال درپیش ہے۔ تجزیہ 2020 کے اعداد و شمار کی روشنی  پر کیا گیا  ہے،  جو اس وقت دستیاب تازہ ترین اعداد و شمار ہیں ۔
ان  اعداد و شمار سے یہ بھی پتہ چلا ہے کہ جنوبی ایشیا میں 28 فیصد بچے ہر سال 4.5 یا اس سے زیادہ ہیٹ ویوز کا سامنا کرتے ہیں جبکہ عالمی سطح پر یہ شرح 24 فیصد ہے۔
جولائی 2023 عالمی سطح پر اب تک کا گرم ترین مہینہ تھا جس نے  ایک ایسے مستقبل کے بارے میں خدشات کو جنم دیا ہے جہاں بچوں، بشمول جنوبی ایشیا میں رہنے والے بچوں کو متعدد مرتبہ  شدید ہیٹ ویو کا سامنا کرنا پڑ سکتا ہے۔ ان خطرات   کی بڑی وجہ موسمیاتی  تبدیلی ہے۔
یونیسف کے ریجنل ڈائریکٹر   برائے جنوبی ایشیاء ، سنجے وجے سکیرا کا کہنا تھا کہ اعداد و شما ر سے ظاہر ہوتا ہے کہ  دنیا بھر میں بلند ترین  درجہ ٔ حرارت کے باعث شدید گرمی اور ہیٹ ویوز سے  جنوبی ایشیا میں لاکھوں بچوں کی زندگیوں اور فلاح و بہبود کو شدید خطرات لاحق  ہوگئے ہیں۔ اگرچہ خطے کے ممالک کا شمار  دنیا کے گرم ترین ممالک میں  نہیں ہوتا لیکن یہاں کی گرمی عدم تحفظ کے شکار  بچوں کی زندگیوں کے لیے سنگین خطرات پیدا کرتی ہے۔ان کا مزید کہنا تھا کہ  ہم خاص طور پر شیر خوار   بچوں، چھوٹے  بچوں، غذائی قلت کے شکار بچوں اور حاملہ خواتین کے  متعلق  فکرمند ہیں کیونکہ وہ ہیٹ اسٹروک اور دیگر سنگین اثرات کا  آسان  شکار ہوسکتے ہیں۔‘‘
یونیسف کے 2021 کے چلڈرن کلائمیٹ رسک انڈیکس (سی سی آر آئی)کے مطابق، افغانستان، بنگلہ دیش، بھارت، مالدیپ اور پاکستان میں بچے موسمیاتی تبدیلی کے اثرات کے ’شدید  خطرے‘ کی زد میں ہیں۔
سال 2022 میں دنیا کا گرم ترین شہر قرار پانے  والے  جیکب آباد سمیت پاکستان کے جنوبی صوبہ سندھ کے کچھ حصوں میں جون کے مہینے  میں درجہ حرارت 40 ڈگری سینٹی گریڈ تک پہنچ گیا ، جس سے 18لاکھ افراد کو صحت کے مختصر اور طویل مدتی شدید خطرات کا سامنا کرنا پڑا۔ جھلسا دینے والی گرمی کی یہ  لہر اگست 2022 میں جنوبی سندھ کے بیشتر علاقوں کو ڈبونے  والے تباہ کن سیلاب کے ایک سال سے بھی کم عرصے بعد آئی تھی ۔ جون 2023 میں سیلاب سے متاثرہ علاقوں میں 8لاکھ سے زائد  بچوں کو شدید گرمی سے  لاحق   خطرات  کا سامنا  تھا۔
برسات کے موسم میں بھی گرمی بچوں  کے لیے   نقصان دہ ثابت ہوسکتی ہے۔ چونکہ بچے درجہ حرارت کی تبدیلیوں کے مطابق اپنے آپ کو  تیزی سے ڈھال نہیں سکتے ، لہذا ان کے اجسام تیزی سے حرارت کا اخراج نہیں کرپاتے ۔ اس سے چھوٹے بچوں میں جسم کا بلند  درجہ حرارت، دل کی  دھڑکنوں میں تیزی  ، اینٹھن، شدید سر درد، الجھن، اعضاء کا مفلوج ہونا، پانی کی کمی، بیہوشی اور کوما جیسی علامات اور بیماریاں پیدا ہوسکتی ہیں۔ نوزائیدہ بچوں میں ذہنی نشوونما  کے علاوہ  بڑھوتری میں خرابی کے مسائل ہوسکتے ہیں جن میں    اعصابی  اور دل کی بیماریاں شامل ہیں۔شدید گرمی کی شکار  حاملہ خواتین کو قبل از وقت  زچگی کی علامات، بلند فشارِ خون ، دورے پڑنا ، ہائی بلڈ پریشر،بچے کی  قبل از وقت پیدائش اور بچے کی مردہ حالت میں پیدائش  جیسے خطرات کا سامنا ہوسکتا ہے ۔
چھوٹے بچوں  کے جسمانی درجہ ٔ حرارت کو کم کرنے کے لیے  برف کے تھیلے، پنکھے کی ہوا  یا   پانی کی پھوار کا استعمال کیا جاسکتا ہے جبکہ قدرے بڑے بچوں کو محفوظ طریقے سے ٹھنڈے  پانی میں   ڈبوکر  جسم کو ٹھنڈا کیا جاسکتا ہے۔
تعلیم، آگاہی اور تیاری اس بحران سے نمٹنے کے موثر  طریقے ہیں۔ شدید گرمی  کے دوران یونیسف فرنٹ لائن ورکرز، والدین، خاندانوں،صحت کی دیکھ بھال کرنے والوں اور مقامی حکام پر زور دیتا ہے کہ وہ درج ذیل اقدامات کے ذریعے  بچوں کو گرمی سے محفوظ رکھیں:
·        گرمی کے خطرات  سے آگاہ رہیں اور اپنے آپ کو اور اپنے بچوں کی حفاظت کریں۔ احتیاطی تدابیر اختیار کریں ، گرمی کے خطرے کو پہچانیں اور خطرے سے نمٹنے کیلئے  ضروری  اقدامات کے متعلق جانیں۔
·        علامات کی شناخت کریں۔ گرمی سے ہونے والی  مختلف بیماریوں کی علامات کو پہچانیں جو دیکھ بھال کرنے والوں، برادریوں اور فرنٹ لائن کارکنوں کے علم میں ہونی چاہئیں۔
·        حفاظت کے لئے فوری طور پر اقدامات  کریں۔ ابتدائی طبی امداد  کے طریقے سیکھیں جو دیکھ بھال کرنے والوں اور فرنٹ لائن کارکنوں کو فوری طور پر  جسم کی حرارت کو دوبارہ متوازن کرنے کے لئے چاہئیں۔ اور
·        ہسپتال یا مرکزِ صحت لے کر جائیں۔ فرنٹ لائن کارکنوں، خاندانوں اور دیکھ بھال کرنے والوں کو لو اور گرمی  لگنے  کی علامات، خاص طور پر ہیٹ اسٹروک کی علامات کو فوری طور پر پہچاننا چاہیے اور متاثرہ لوگوں کو صحت مرکز  تک لے جانے میں مدد کرنا چاہیے۔
بالآخر، موسمیاتی شدت کی بھاری قیمت سب سے زیادہ  عدم تحفظ کے شکار  بچوں، نوعمرافراد  اور خواتین کو ہی    چکانی پڑتی ہے۔
وجے سیکرا  کا کہنا تھا ، ’’چھوٹے بچے گرمی کی شدت کو برداشت نہیں کر سکتے۔ اگر ہم ابھی اقدامات  نہیں اُٹھائیں گے  تو یہ بے قصور  بچے  آنے والے   برسوں میں اس سے  زیادہ مرتبہ  اور زیادہ شدید ہیٹ ویو کا    سامنا کرتے رہیں گے۔‘‘  ختم شد۔

Islamabad, 07 August 2023 – Jazz, Pakistan’s largest digital operator, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have launched the Women Initiative in Social Entrepreneurship (WISE) to promote women-led social innovation in Pakistan.
The WISE Bootcamps, registrations for which are open now, aim to empower 400 women social entrepreneurs across 12 cities of Pakistan with essential business knowledge and skills to manage sustainable social enterprises.
To strengthen the start-up ecosystem in Pakistan, in 2020, Jazz and UNDP partnered to launch SDG Bootcamps to promote social innovation and entrepreneurship by youth in Pakistan. The SDG Bootcamps engaged 401 participants, 40% of them being women entrepreneurs. The solutions addressed by these enterprises included climate action, health, and digital transformation.
Continuing the partnership – and with implementation through the School of Leadership Foundation (SoLF) – the WISE Bootcamps will focus on strengthening Pakistan's women social entrepreneurs.
“WISE is aimed at empowering Pakistani women by creating opportunities for financial and digital inclusion for the women and youth,” said Aamir Ibrahim, CEO Jazz. “This outcome resonates well with Jazz’s purpose of improving the lives and livelihoods of women in Pakistan through technology. We hope that women-led businesses in WISE will address unique challenges and create innovative solutions that positively impact their communities and beyond.”
“Digital space in Pakistan must be a place for gender equality, for social and economic empowerment and inclusion. Knowledge and skills of technology and innovative entrepreneurship are all part of this ecosystem. If we get it right, development indicators of inclusion and gender equality will achieve their positive trajectory,” remarked Samuel Rizk, UNDP’s Resident Representative to Pakistan.
Emphasizing innovation, WISE seeks enterprises that address at least one of the country's development challenges and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Aspiring social entrepreneurs across Pakistan can apply for registrations: http://bitly.ws/KIDR

PRESS RELEASE
The Legal Aid and Justice Authority, the European Union and UNDP hold a consultative workshop to enhance access to legal aid in Pakistan
Islamabad, August 3 2023—Under the European Union-funded ‘Deliver Justice Project’, the Legal Aid and Justice Authority (LAJA) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) jointly organized a two-day consultative workshop to improve access to legal aid in Pakistan. The workshop brought together representatives from the government, rule of law institutions, national and international partners, and civil society organizations to discuss LAJA’s mandate and provide recommendations to LAJA/government regarding how to ensure access to justice through legal aid in a sustainable manner.
LAJA was established under the LAJA Act 2020 to provide legal, financial, and technical assistance for access to justice for poor and vulnerable groups in society on criminal cases. The key functions of LAJA are to provide legal aid/assistance to poor and vulnerable groups, particularly women and children; enhance public awareness of legal aid and laws in Pakistan; research legal aid and pro bono legal services in Pakistan; and advise the government on the right to a fair trial and due process of the law.
Under the European Union-funded ‘Deliver Justice Project’, UNDP Pakistan’s Rule of Law Programme and LAJA organized the two-day consultative workshop to identify challenges faced by LAJA and develop recommendations to feed into a new strategic plan for LAJA to effectively implement its key functions.
Dr Muhammad Raheem Awaan, Director General, LAJA attended the workshop along with Dr Federico Romoli, International Aid/Cooperation Officer on Rule of Law, Delegation of the European Union to Pakistan and Mr Rana Kaiser Ishaque, Assistant Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan. Representatives from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)  and UN WOMEN also participated in the workshop.
Ms Mehnaz Akber Aziz, Parliamentary Secretary for Law and Justice Ministry, Government of Pakistan, attended the closing ceremony of the two-day workshop as a chief guest where all the key recommendations were presented. She stated, “LAJA has a strong standing in the chain of the Criminal Justice System of Pakistan to provide legal aid and access to justice to vulnerable groups of society. We remain committed to strengthening LAJA to implement its mandate and encourage all justice sector stakeholders to extend support for enabling LAJA to serve the citizens of Pakistan.”
In his address, Dr Muhammad Raheem Awaan, Director General, LAJA, underlined, “LAJA has a huge responsibility to improve awareness of legal aid and ensure access to justice for all in Pakistan. We are optimistic that initiatives like these will play an instrumental role in achieving that goal. We are thankful to the European Union and UNDP Pakistan for their support in bringing all the important stakeholders under one roof to discuss and resolve roadblocks that impede LAJA from implementing its key functions successfully.”
Dr Federico Romoli, International Aid/Cooperation Officer on Rule of Law, Delegation of the European Union to Pakistan, with a separate note thanked LAJA, UNDP, UN Women, and UNODC, for their efforts in improving the provision of legal aid in Pakistan. “A broad political consensus and collaborative approach both at the federal and provincial level are essential to finding sustainable and inclusive solutions to making justice and legal aid more accessible, especially for the most vulnerable groups. We praise and encourage learning opportunities like this workshop aiming to enhance LAJA’s institutional capacity and its coordination with other justice stakeholders .”
Mr Rana Kaiser Ishaque, Assistant Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan, affirmed, “Striving for justice for all is integral to attaining the rule of law and so, now more than ever, we remain steadfast in our efforts to secure a future where everyone will be aware of their legal rights and will have equal access to legal aid in Pakistan. We thank LAJA and EU for being our committed partners in this journey to strengthening peace and justice in the region.”
The UNDP Rule of Law Programme is implementing a range of interventions to strengthen security and justice sector governance in Pakistan.
The ‘Deliver Justice’ project aims to support reform processes to ensure the delivery of people-centered justice, enhance access to justice for all, particularly women and less privileged groups, and improve service delivery of the security sector in line with constitutional safeguards and international standards. Implemented in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Merged Districts, the programme is funded by the European Union and jointly implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

UNICEF & WHO
JOINT STATEMENT
Joint statement by UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell and WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the occasion of World Breastfeeding Week
NEW YORK/GENEVA, 1 August 2023 - In the last 10 years, many countries have made significant progress to increase exclusive breastfeeding rates. Yet even greater progress is possible when breastfeeding is protected and supported, particularly in the workplace.
This World Breastfeeding Week, under its theme, “Let’s make breastfeeding at work, work” – UNICEF and WHO are emphasizing the need for greater breastfeeding support across all workplaces to sustain and improve progress on breastfeeding rates globally.
In the last decade, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding has increased by a remarkable 10 percentage points, to 48 per cent globally. Countries as diverse as Cote d’Ivoire, Marshall Islands, the Philippines, Somalia, and Viet Nam have achieved large increases in breastfeeding rates, showing that progress is possible when breastfeeding is protected, promoted, and supported.
However, to reach the global 2030 target of 70 percent, the barriers women and families face to achieve their breastfeeding goals must be addressed.
Supportive workplaces are key. Evidence shows that while breastfeeding rates drop significantly for women when they return to work, that negative impact can be reversed when workplaces facilitate mothers to continue to breastfeed their babies.
Family-friendly workplace policies - such as paid maternity leave, breastfeeding breaks, and a room where mothers can breastfeed or express milk - create an environment that benefits not only working women and their families but also employers. These polices generate economic returns by reducing maternity-related absenteeism, increasing the retention of female workers, and reducing the costs of hiring and training new staff.
From the earliest moments of a child’s life, breastfeeding is the ultimate child survival and development intervention. Breastfeeding protects babies from common infectious diseases and boosts children’s immune systems, providing the key nutrients children need to grow and develop to their full potential. Babies who are not breastfed are 14 times more likely to die before they reach their first birthday than babies who are exclusively breastfed.
Supporting breastfeeding in the workplace is good for mothers, babies, and businesses, and that is why UNICEF and WHO are calling on governments, donors, civil society, and the private sector to step up efforts to:

PRESS RELEASE
Creating awareness on climate change: Senator Sherry Rehman launches UNDP’s Coffee Table Book “Fading Vistas - Beauty of Northern Pakistan”
Islamabad, 27 July 2023—Senator Sherry Rehman, Federal Minister, Ministry of Climate Change & Environmental, with Mr. Samuel Rizk UNDP’s Resident Representative to Pakistan, launched UNDP’s Coffee Table Book: Fading Vistas – Beauty of Northern Pakistan. The event also exhibited photographs of the breathtaking scenery of the mountains, lakes, and glaciers of the 24 GLOF-II Project valleys in Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The event is part of GLOF-II Project – a joint initiative by the Ministry of Climate Change and UNDP, with the support of the Green Climate Fund.

The book, “Fading Vistas” holds a collection of exquisitely curated photographs of Northern Pakistan's valleys, glaciers, and mountains to reinforce the need to safeguard them from the devastating impacts of climate change. The book also illustrates some of the devastating effects of glacial lake outburst floods and GLOF-II interventions to support affected communities.
The Federal Minister, Senator Sherry Rehman, on working relentlessly on climate adaptation to reduce Pakistan’s climate vulnerability, stated, “Our deep connection to the wondrous ecological systems of the Earth can in no way be negated or undermined, as without the grandeur and benevolence of our natural habitats – the splendid valleys, vast forests, and monumental mountains; we would truly cease to exist.”
The Honorable Minister reinforced how Pakistan bears the brunt of global warming despite its low emissions rate, exacerbating poverty, gender inequality, and loss of livelihoods.
On the occasion, UNDP’s Resident Representative to Pakistan, Mr. Samuel Rizk, highlighted, “Climate Change is a huge development challenge. Apart from the global impacts, it is hitting the poorest and the most vulnerable first and hardest, as they rely on natural resources to support their livelihoods. UNDP is committed to building climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable policies into development plans and programmes in Pakistan.”

Pakistan’s rich topography ranges from the highest glacier-covered mountains to the deepest seas, hosting rich biodiversity and ecosystems. However, climate change makes these natural habitats susceptible to the grave danger of perishing. While our Earth is warning us of rising sea levels owing to large glacial melts, torrential rains, and unprecedented floods and droughts, sustainable climate action needs to be taken to safeguard these endangered sights and ecosystems.
UNDP’s GLOF-II project works in 16 valleys of Gilgit Baltistan and 8 valleys in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It empowers communities to identify and manage risks associated with GLOFs and related impacts of Climate Change, strengthen public services to lower the risk of disasters related to GLOFs, and improve community preparedness and disaster response. The project also supports the development of sustainable options for livelihoods in project areas, with a particular focus on the participation of women in ensuring food security and livelihoods.

PRESS RELEASE
UNHCR provides cash assistance to over 1 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD – UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has completed the disbursement of cash assistance to over 1 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan who were impacted by the prolonged difficult economic situation in the aftermath of the devastating floods of 2022.
The cash assistance programme, which was launched in January 2023 in collaboration with the Government of Pakistan, officially concluded at the end of June.
UNHCR’s one-off cash grant of up to PKR 25,000 or approximately USD100, depending on family size, supported a total of 250,000 Afghan refugee households in Pakistan.
The total spending on cash assistance for Afghan refugees since January was USD17.8 million.
UNHCR’s Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Noriko Yoshida, said that the current economic situation coupled with the floods last year had badly affected people in Pakistan, including refugees.
“It was imperative to provide cash assistance to refugees in line with the support that was provided by the government to the people in Pakistan,” she said.
Pakistan hosts over 1.3 million registered Afghan refugees and 427,000 people in refugee-like situations from Afghanistan.
The assistance has helped those hardest hit by the economic downturn by enabling them to meet their basic needs.
Yoshida reaffirmed UNHCR’s commitment to continue supporting refugees and their hosts and recognized the support of the international community for making their assistance possible. She also acknowledged and appreciated the support in its implementation by the Government of Pakistan, financial service provider Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and other national implementing partners such as INSPIRE Pakistan and Society for Human Rights and Prisoners' Aid (SHARP).
The partnership is UNHCR’s first private sector engagement with the country’s banking system and is an excellent example of the commitment of the Government and private sector in the country to find innovative approaches to support vulnerable Afghans.
UNHCR is on the ground to support Pakistan as it recovers from the aftermath of last year’s devastating floods, with a particular focus on areas hosting refugees. Some 800,000 refugees live in areas that were impacted by the devastating floods.

PRESS RELEASE
25 Countries Halved Multidimensional Poverty Within 15 Years, but 1.1 Billion Remain Poor
Clear progress has been made, though full impact of COVID-19 pandemic remains to be seen.
11 July 2023, New York City – The latest update of the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) with estimates for 110 countries was released today by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) at the University of Oxford. The report demonstrates that poverty reduction is achievable. However, the lack of comprehensive data over the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges in assessing immediate prospects.
The analysis of trends from 2000 to 2022, focused on 81 countries with comparable data over time, reveals that 25 countries successfully halved their global MPI values within 15 years, showing that rapid progress is attainable. These include Cambodia, China, Congo, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Serbia, and Viet Nam.
Notably, India saw a remarkable reduction in poverty, with 415 million people exiting poverty within a span of just 15 years (2005/6–19/21). Large numbers of people were lifted out of poverty in China (2010– 14, 69 million) and Indonesia (2012–17, 8 million).
Countries halved their MPI in periods as short as four to 12 years, demonstrating the feasibility of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of halving poverty according to national definitions within 15 years. Thus, it is crucial to consider context-specific multidimensional poverty indices that reflect national definitions of poverty, since the global MPI assesses multidimensional poverty with the same methodology.
Despite these encouraging trends, the lack of post-pandemic data for most of the 110 countries covered by the global MPI restricts our understanding of the pandemic's effects on poverty.
Pedro Conceição, Director of the Human Development Report Office, observed, "As we reach the mid- point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we can clearly see that there was steady progress in multidimensional poverty reduction before the pandemic. However, the negative impacts of the pandemic in dimensions such as education are significant and can have long-lasting consequences. It is imperative that we intensify efforts to comprehend the dimensions most negatively affected, necessitating strengthened data collection and policy efforts to get poverty reduction back on track."
Judging from the few countries where data were solely collected in 2021 or 2022 – Mexico, Madagascar, Cambodia, Peru, and Nigeria – momentum on poverty reduction may have persisted during the pandemic. Cambodia, Peru, and Nigeria showed significant reductions in their most recent periods, offering hope that progress is still possible. In Cambodia, the most encouraging case among these, the incidence of poverty fell from 36.7% to 16.6%, and the number of poor people halved, from 5.6 million to 2.8 million, all within
7.5 years, including pandemic years (2014–2021/22).
However, the full impacts globally remain to be measured. With a renewed emphasis on data collection, we need to broaden the picture to include the impacts of the pandemic on children. In over half the countries covered, there was either no statistically significant reduction in child poverty or the MPI value fell more slowly among children than among adults during at least one period. This suggests that child poverty will continue to be a pressing issue, particularly in relation to school attendance and undernutrition.
"The astonishing scarcity of data on multidimensional poverty is hard to comprehend, let alone justify. The world is reeling under a data deluge and gearing up for the next era of digital growth. Yet we do not have a post-pandemic line of sight for 1 billion of the 1.1 billion poor people” says Sabina Alkire, Director of OPHI at the University of Oxford: “This problem is eminently solvable – data on multidimensional poverty are faster to gather than most realize – requiring just 5% of questions in the surveys we use. We call on funders and data scientists to make a breakthrough on poverty data, so the interconnected deprivations that strike poor people in real time can be tracked – and intercepted."
The global MPI both monitors poverty reduction and informs policy, showing how people experience poverty in different aspects of their daily lives – from access to education and health, to living standards such as housing, drinking water, sanitation, and electricity. The MPI as a poverty index can be pictured as a stacked tower of the interlinked deprivations experienced by poor individuals, with the aim of eliminating these deprivations.
According to the 2023 release, 1.1 billion out of 6.1 billion people (just over 18%) live in acute multidimensional poverty across 110 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa (534 million) and South Asia (389 million) are home to approximately five out of every six poor people.
Nearly two-thirds of all poor people (730 million people) live in middle-income countries, making action in these countries vital for reducing global poverty. Although low-income countries constitute only 10% of the population included in the MPI, these are where 35% of all poor people reside.
Children under 18 years old account for half of MPI-poor people (566 million). The poverty rate among children is 27.7%, while among adults it is 13.4%. Poverty predominantly affects rural areas, with 84% of all poor people living in rural areas. Rural areas are poorer than urban areas across all regions of the world.
The MPI sheds light on the complexity of poverty – where different indicators contribute to people's experience of poverty differently, varying from region to subnational region, and between and within communities. Ensuring that the data on global poverty is up-to-date and comprehensive is a crucial first step in addressing these challenges and maintaining progress towards a more equal world.

PRESS RELEASE
UN LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN, CALLING FOR RENEWED GLOBAL AMBITION AND ACTION FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
PUBLIC MOBILIZATION COMES AHEAD OF CRITICAL HALFTIME SUMMIT IN SEPTEMBER AT UN IN NEW YORK
New York, 5 July 2023 -  The United Nations, today, is kicking off a communications campaign to rally for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap for people and planet adopted by world leaders in 2015.  Ahead of a critical UN Summit in September, the campaign aims to amplify an urgent call for ambitious new action, showcase the Goals as the blueprint for sustainable progress globally, and galvanize the global public around this shared agenda for our common future.
At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the SDGs is in peril. For the first time in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects.
The 2023 SDG Summit will gather world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 18-19 September to reaffirm their collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to leave no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the world back on track to achieving the SDGs.
Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and countries worldwide, the UN campaign aims to re-energize the conversation about the Goals.
“We want to get everyone on board for the SDGs”, said Nanette Braun, Director of Campaigns in the UN Department for Global Communications. “Our hope is that decision-makers and individual citizens alike will feel inspired to join the conversation and contribute to achieving the Goals with new resolve and ambition.”
Building off the color wheel brand of the SDGs, the campaign uses a dynamic new visual system for its messaging to build momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the SDGs.
One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to take action on the SDGs through the UN’s ActNow initiative across all 17 Goals. From using public transportation, to fundraising for schools or speaking up for equality, the platform lists steps that everyone can take to accelerate progress on the SDGs and create better lives on a healthier planet for all.
A curated group of high-profile influencers, the Circle of Supporters, will galvanize their communities to take individual action on the SDGs and to impress upon decision-makers the urgency to act now.

PRESS RELEASE
FAO Launches DVI Pilot: Bridging the Technological Divide in Rural Pakistan
Rahim Yar Khan, Punjab (05/07/2023): The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in collaboration with the Government of Punjab, launched a Digital Village Initiative (DVI) pilot site, today, in a ceremony organized at the Food Security & Agriculture Centre of Excellency (FACE), Ahmadpur Lamma, Rahim Yar Khan.
Two sites: one in Rahim Yar Khan and another in Sargodha, were launched after detailed assessment conducted in 7 districts of Punjab and Sindh with the support of the provincial governments of both provinces. High government officials, community leaders, researchers, male and female farmers, the private sector and other key stakeholders were present at the launching event.
This pilot launch is the FAO’s global initiative under the 1000 Digital Village Initiate in Asia and the Pacific to bridge the technological divide and empower rural communities with access to digital resources, education, and opportunities.
During the ceremony, female lead farmers from the pilot site villages also received 10 tablets to use the agriculture-related applications on which they were already trained by FAO.
A ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Hyper Localized Weather Station pilot site was also organized along with a briefing on the digital monitoring and forecasting function of the weather station. The stations were installed on both pilot sites along with the provision of necessary equipment installed at training halls of both sites for virtual training of farmers.
The stations will provide customised weather advisory, forecast pest & disease models and other information to farmers of 10 kilometres range from its vicinity. Both weather station facilities are also equipped to arrange online trainings for farmers on the latest innovations in agriculture.
Male and female farmers of selected pilot sites received training on different features of the weather station. Through these stations, farmers will be able to get customized and specific information to their farmland, accurate data and information which will help them in reducing costs related to inputs and taking measures for crop protection.
The data will also help Punjab Agriculture Extension 2.0 Project, Water Management Department and Start-Up companies to offer customized, farm-specific services to farmers. Booths were also set up at the launching ceremony by the digital service provider, which served as an avenue to connect the farmers with services available to them.
Through the deployment of robust internet infrastructure and the provision of tablets and technological resources, the DVI seeks to empower individuals with access to a wealth of information, e-learning platforms, and digital services.
The DVI represents a significant step towards building a more connected and prosperous future for rural Pakistan. By harnessing the power of technology and fostering digital inclusivity, this initiative promises to bring about positive socio-economic change and uplift communities that have long been underserved.

UNICEF - PRESS RELEASE : Funds for world’s climate hotspots woefully neglect the needs of children, new report finds

PRESS RELEASE
Funds for world’s climate hotspots woefully neglect the needs of children, new report finds
New York - June 23, 2023, Children are being failed by climate funding commitments, despite bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, according to a new report from members of the Children’s Environmental Rights Initiative (CERI) coalition; Plan International, Save the Children, and UNICEF.
Just 2.4 percent of key global climate funds can be classified as supporting child-responsive activities, the report finds. According to UNICEF’s Children’s Climate Risk Index, more than a billion children are at extremely high risk of the impacts of the climate crisis.
Maria Marshall, a 13-year-old UNICEF child advocate and climate activist from Barbados said, “Children are the future, but our future is shaped by the actions of those making decisions in the present, and our voices are not being heard. As this report shows, funding climate solutions is an obligation, but how that money is spent also matters. Children’s needs and perspectives must be included.”
The study, Falling short: addressing the climate finance gap for children used a set of three criteria to assess if climate finance from key multilateral climate funds (MCFs) serving the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement were: addressing the distinct and heightened risks they experience from the climate crisis, strengthening the resilience of child-critical social services and empowering children as agents of change.
“The findings are stark,” said Kabita Bose, Country Director at Plan International Bangladesh. “Urgent and effective investment is key to adapting to climate change, and is particularly critical for children, especially girls who are highly susceptible to the short and long-term impacts. Yet current spending almost ignores children entirely – this needs to change.”
The report found that out of all the money given by MCFs for climate-related projects over a period of 17 years until March 2023, only a small portion (2.4%) met all three of the requirements which amounted to only $1.2 billion. The report also says that this number likely reflects an overestimate, meaning that even less money may have met all the requirements.
“Children, especially those already affected by inequality and discrimination, have done the least to cause climate change but are most affected by it.  Climate finance offers an opportunity to tackle these injustices by considering the needs and perspectives of children,” said Kelley Toole, Global Head of Climate Change at Save the Children. “This has been woefully inadequate to date but can and must change. To really tackle the climate crisis, we must put child rights at the heart of our response and ensure children’s voices are heard”.
While MCFs provide a relatively small share of overall climate finance, the degree to which these funds consider children matters greatly. MCFs have a vital role to play in agenda-setting, and in catalysing and coordinating investments by other public and private finance institutions, including at national levels, which are necessary to drive a broader change.
Children are disproportionately vulnerable to water and food scarcity, water-borne diseases, and physical and psychological trauma, all of which have been linked to both extreme weather events and slow-onset climate effects. There is also evidence that changing weather patterns are disrupting children’s access to basic services such as education, healthcare, and clean drinking water.
“Every child is exposed to at least one - and often multiple - climate hazards. The finance and investment that is desperately needed to adapt critical social services like health and water to climate hazards is insufficient and largely blind to the urgent and unique needs of children. This must change. The climate crisis is a child rights crisis, and climate finance must reflect this,” said Paloma Escudero, Special Adviser for Climate Advocacy at UNICEF.
The report highlights that when it comes to children, they are often viewed as a vulnerable group rather than being recognised as active stakeholders or agents of change. Less than 4% of projects, amounting to just 7% of MCF investment ($2.58 billion), give explicit and meaningful consideration to the needs and involvement of girls.
The report is informed by the voices of children from around the world, who said that they face increased risks because of climate change. A teenage girl in Zimbabwe said, “In Chiredzi, we learned that some girls cannot swim across flooded rivers to go to school or go home whilst boys can. Girls must walk for up to 10-15km to get to school. They get tired along the way before they even start classes.” A 13-year-old boy from Bangladesh added, “Lots of large-scale disasters hit our district which causes people to become impoverished, and children like us are engaged in child labour.”
The CERI coalition is urging multilateral climate funds, as well as other climate finance providers providing climate finance at both the international and national levels, to act quickly and address the adaptation gap. They are specifically calling for funding to cover losses and damages caused by climate change. This funding should prioritise the well-being of children and critical social services that support them. The focus should be on reaching and assisting the children who are most vulnerable and at high risk due to climate impacts.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE OCCASION OF
UNITED NATIONS PUBLIC SERVICE DAY
23 June 2023
Today, on United Nations Public Service Day, we pay tribute to the women and men around the world who are answering the highest call: public service.
This year’s celebration arrives at the half-way point towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Public servants and the institutions they support will be increasingly critical as the world accelerates action towards the Sustainable Development Goals, which are badly off track.
Technology must be at the heart of this acceleration. Every day, new technologies emerge that hold the potential to change the way we live and work. When harnessed by an informed, skilled and equipped public service, technology can improve the reach and effectiveness of public services, while driving progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
As we mark this important day, let us celebrate the work of public servants worldwide, and find new ways to apply innovation to our work to shape a better, more sustainable future for all people.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR COUNTERING HATE SPEECH
18 June 2023
Hate speech is used to stoke fear and division, often for political gain, and at immense cost to communities and societies. It incites violence, exacerbates tensions, and impedes efforts to foster mediation and dialogue. It is one of the warning signs of genocide and other atrocity crimes.
Hate speech is often aimed at vulnerable groups, reinforcing discrimination, stigma and marginalization. Minorities, women, refugees, migrants, and people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity are frequent targets. Social media platforms can amplify and spread hate speech at lightning speed.
Misguided and ambiguous responses to hate speech – including blanket bans and internet shutdowns – may also violate human rights by restricting freedom of speech and expression. They may even silence some of those best placed to counter hateful narratives: human rights defenders and journalists.
But we are far from powerless in the face of hate speech. We can and must raise awareness about its dangers, and work to prevent and end it in all its forms.
The United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech is our comprehensive framework for tackling the causes and impacts of hate speech, in line with international human rights standards.
Our offices and teams around the world are confronting hate speech by implementing local action plans, based on this strategy.
Education initiatives, positive speech campaigns, research to understand and address root causes, and efforts to promote inclusion and equal rights all have an important role. Religious, community and business leaders can all play their part.
The United Nations is consulting governments, technology companies and others on a voluntary Code of Conduct for information integrity on digital platforms, aimed at reducing the spread of mis- and disinformation and hate speech, while protecting freedom of expression.
As we mark the International Day for Countering Hate Speech, let us renew our efforts to prevent and end this toxic and destructive phenomenon, while promoting inclusive, just and peaceful communities and societies and protecting the rights and dignity of all.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE OCCASION OF THE WORLD DAY TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION AND DROUGHT
“HER LAND. HER RIGHTS: ADVANCING GENDER EQUALITY AND LAND RESTORATION GOALS”
17 June 2023
Excellencies, friends.
We depend on land for our survival. Yet we treat it like dirt.
Unsustainable farming is eroding soil 100 times faster than natural process can restore them.
And up to 40% of our planet’s land is now degraded:
Imperiling food production;
Threatening biodiversity;
And compounding the climate crisis.
This hits women and girls the hardest.
They suffer disproportionately from the lack of food, water scarcity, and forced migration that result from our mistreatment of land.
Yet they have the least control.
In many countries laws and practices block women and girls from owning land.
But where they do, they restore and protect it: increasing productivity; building resilience to drought and investing in health, education and nutrition.
Equal land rights both protect land and advance gender equality.
That is why this Desertification and Drought Day puts the focus on “her land, her rights”.
I urge all governments to eliminate legal barriers to women owning land, and to involve them in policymaking.
Support women and girls to play their part in protecting our most precious resource.
And together, let’s stop land degradation by 2030.
Thank you.

FAO - PRESS RELEASE : WORLD FOOD SAFETY DAY 2023: PROMOTING SAFE FOOD PRACTICES AND COMBATING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
WFP - PRESS RELEASE : French contribution enables WFP to respond to nutrition crisis in Pakistan
WORLD FOOD SAFETY DAY 2023: PROMOTING SAFE FOOD PRACTICES AND COMBATING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
Islamabad, June 8 - World Food Safety Day (WFSD) was commemorated on June 7th, focusing on raising awareness about the significance of food safety and ensuring access to safe and nutritious food for all. FAO Pakistan organized a series of activities in alignment with the theme "Food standards save lives," with a special emphasis on addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) through collaborative efforts.
The primary objective of these activities was to enhance knowledge about food safety and raise awareness regarding workplace, community, and governmental actions that can effectively promote safe food practices.
Notable among the initiatives was an awareness walk conducted in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), Fleming Fund, and Islamabad Food Authority. This joint effort united key stakeholders in highlighting the importance of food safety and addressing AMR. Participants carried banners adorned with messages promoting safe and nutritious food as well as raising awareness about AMR. Dignitaries and officials shared their insights and underscored the significance of combating foodborne AMR while encouraging the adoption of safe food habits.
To further advance the cause, two awareness seminars were organized in partnership with Fleming Fund, Islamabad Food Authority, the World Health Organization, and the Institute of Food and Nutritious Sciences. The seminars, held respectively at Rawalpindi Women's University and ARID Agriculture University, served as platforms for in-depth discussions on food safety and foodborne AMR. Renowned experts delivered keynote presentations on various topics related to food safety, emphasizing the pivotal role of Codex standards in promoting both food safety and international trade. The distinguished speakers also shed light on the invaluable contributions of academia in developing innovative solutions. The seminars concluded with a strong commitment to promoting safe food practices and combating foodborne AMR.
Recognizing the significance of the matter, the FAO Pakistan team held constructive meetings with the Commissioner of Capital Development Authority and representatives from the Islamabad Food Authority. During these meetings, pressing issues concerning food safety and the escalating threat of AMR were extensively discussed. The Commissioner highlighted the risks associated with contaminated food containing drug residues and stressed the imperative of collective efforts from all stakeholders in combating foodborne AMR.
Dr. M.Afzal, FMD Management Specialist participated in Radio Pakistan’s live program “Zarkhaiz Pakistan” where he emphasized the significance of food safety for all.
FAO Pakistan, together with its esteemed partners, remains dedicated to the pursuit of safe and nutritious food for all, safeguarding public health, and fostering sustainable development. Through these diverse activities, FAO Pakistan aims to significantly increase awareness about food safety, encourage proactive measures to prevent foodborne illnesses, and promote best practices in food handling, storage, and preparations.

French contribution enables WFP to respond to nutrition crisis in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomes a contribution of EUR 3.5 million from the Government of France in support of the ongoing flood response for women and children affected by life-threatening malnutrition in Pakistan.
The funding will help WFP reach thousands of children under-five and pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls suffering from acute malnutrition with lifesaving support in Sindh and Balochistan.
Although floodwaters have receded in most parts of Pakistan following last year’s unprecedented floods, the country now faces a new deadly threat. Against the backdrop of high inflation, especially soaring food prices, millions of people are struggling to afford and access nutritious food and cases of life-threatening severe acute malnutrition are emerging among women and children in several districts worst affected by floods.
“The French Government’s support to WFP reflects another step in France’s solidarity towards the people of Pakistan and particularly the vulnerable communities in Sindh and Balochistan that were most impacted by the 2022 floods”, said Nicolas Galey, Ambassador of France to Pakistan, in a meeting with WFP today. “This timely contribution will support ongoing efforts to improve food security and to bolster community resilience, with a focus on the nutrition of women and girls, and children under five”, he added.
According to a rapid survey* of 15 flood-affected districts in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, nearly one-third of children between 6-23 months of age are suffering from moderate acute malnutrition, while 14 percent are affected by severe acute malnutrition.
“WFP is deeply concerned about the looming nutrition crisis in Pakistan. The increase in cases of severe acute malnutrition among women and children is particularly heartbreaking. WFP remains committed to addressing the situation with utmost urgency. The funding provided by the Government of France will help us reach some of the most vulnerable communities and provide them with life-saving assistance, for that we are extremely grateful,” said Chris Kaye, Country Director of WFP.
The EUR 3.5 million is the latest in a series of significant contributions that underscore the Government of France’s commitment to contribute to eradicating malnutrition alongside partners and supporting Pakistan’s flood recovery. France also previously contributed EUR 1 million in 2022 to the Integrated Nutrition-Safety Net Project for flood-affected pregnant and breastfeeding women in Sindh, and EUR 2 million in support of WFP’s flood response activities last year. The total contribution of EUR 6.5 million will help WFP to provide a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis whose lives and livelihoods have been upended by last year’s devastating floods.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE OCCASION OF UN WORLD OCEANS DAY 2023
8 June 2023
The ocean is the foundation of life.
It supplies the air we breathe and food we eat.
It regulates our climate and weather.
The ocean is our planet’s greatest reservoir of biodiversity.
Its resources sustain communities, prosperity and human health around the world.
Humanity counts on the ocean.
But can the ocean count on us?
We should be the ocean’s best friend.
But right now, humanity is its worst enemy.
Human-induced climate change is heating our planet, disrupting weather patterns and ocean currents, and altering marine ecosystems and the species living there.
Marine biodiversity is under attack from overfishing, over-exploitation and ocean acidification.
Over one-third of fish stocks are being harvested at unsustainable levels.
And we are polluting our coastal waters with chemicals, plastics and human waste.
But this year’s World Oceans Day reminds us that the tides are changing.
Last year, we adopted an ambitious global target to conserve and manage 30 per cent of land and marine and coastal areas by 2030, as well as a landmark agreement on fisheries subsidies.
At the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon, the world agreed to push for more positive ocean action.
A global, legally binding agreement to end plastic pollution is under negotiation.
And in March, countries agreed to the historic High Seas Treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.
Realizing the great promise of these initiatives requires collective commitment.
Sustainable Development Goal 14 — to conserve and sustainably use the ocean’s resources — hangs in the balance.
This World Oceans Day, let’s keep pushing for action.
Today and every day, let’s put the ocean first.

PRESS RELEASE
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s merged districts of Mohmand and Orakzai get their first-ever Model Police Stations
Islamabad, 06 June 2023 — United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan, the Government of Japan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Police jointly inaugurated the Model Police Stations in Kalaya, Orakzai District and in Ghalanai, Mohmand District, in a ceremony held in Islamabad today.
The Model Police Stations are unique police centres in merged districts, as they provide a range of new facilities to better serve the people of merged districts. Amongst others, these include a gender-responsive desk to address gender-based crimes reported to the police stations, a hall to convene joint community and police meetings, an investigation room, an office for station house officers, security posts, lodging facilities to accommodate  55 police personnel and separate holding rooms for men and women.
The Inspector General of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police, Mr Akhtar Hayat Khan, appraised the partnership with UNDP Pakistan and the Government of Japan to enhance access to justice services for people in the province including merged districts. “I am delighted to be here today, to inaugurate the first of its kind Model Police Station of Mohmand and Orakzai, which is a result of the collaboration between the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police, UNDP Pakistan and the Government of Japan. This Model Police Station is one of the many initiatives that we are taking to strengthen the rule of law and provide better services to the citizens of these merged districts. These facilities will ensure that the police can respond to the needs and grievances of the people in a timely and effective manner. I hope that this Model Police Station will serve as an example for other police stations across the country.”
Addressing the ceremony, the Ambassador of Japan to Pakistan, H.E WADA Mitsuhiro, underlined, “Supporting security and justice sector institutions to provide people-oriented and gender-responsive services, especially in post-merger districts, is crucial in maintaining the rule of law in KP. The establishment of Model Police Stations in the merged districts will play an instrumental role in achieving this goal. We are  excited to be a part of this important journey, and are grateful to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police and UNDP Pakistan for their continual efforts to build peaceful and just communities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including merged districts.”
“Model Police Stations equipped and training provided to former Levies and Khasadars integrated into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police will ensure an improved formal policing and justice system in merged areas” stated  Ms Aliona Niculita, Officer In-Charge, UNDP Pakistan. Together, we remain resolute in enhancing people’ access to more inclusive, accessible, and efficient access to justice and security services in merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, particularly for women and other marginalised groups.”
In 2022, under the same project, the UNDP Pakistan Rule of Law Programme also trained over 250 former Levies/Khasadar who were newly integrated into KP Police on professional people-friendly police services. Additionally, in the same year, the first-ever Policing Plans were developed and launched for the seven merged districts of KP to restore people-centred, accountable, and responsive policing in the region. In the near future, three more Model Police Stations will be established in Bajaur, North Waziristan and Kurram to support Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police in their efforts to improve security services in merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
These Model Police Stations were established by UNDP Pakistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police as part of a project supported by the Government of Japan to strengthen the rule of law in merged districts of the province. The UNDP Rule of Law Programme is implementing a range of interventions to strengthen security and justice sector governance in Pakistan.

UNHABITAT
PRESS RELEASE
World Environment Day 2023
‘Solutions to Plastic Waste’
World Environment Day marks its 50th Anniversary this year (2023) and in the 5 decades the day has grown to be one of the largest global platforms for environmental outreach. This year Theme for World Environment Day was ‘Solutions to plastic pollution’[1]. Plastic pollution is a growing and serious concern in Pakistan as it ranked sixth globally and third in Asia among plastic waste generators[2] with the country producing 4 million tons of plastic waste annually. Karachi is identified as among the top 10 marine litter hotspots in the region, constituting an increasing risk to ecosystem health and biodiversity. This is rooted in unsustainable production and consumption patterns, poor plastic and solid waste management and lack of infrastructure, lack of adequate legal and policy frameworks and poor enforcement, and a lack of financial resources both at national and local governments.
UN Habitat in collaboration with Ministry of Climate Change, Shehersaaz, and NUST celebrated World Environment day 2023 to create awareness to effectively manage the plastic waste and create a healthier society. The winners of the Art Competition held by UN Habitat on International Zero Waste Day 2023 were also announced and awarded aiming to create awareness in children and promote sustainable consumption and production patterns and contribute to the advancement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Dr. Muhammad Irfan. Principal & Dean. Professor. School of Civil & Environmental Engineering (SCEE) distributed the awards to the winners.
A Panel discussion was convened to dig out the challenges and to come up with the solutions to reduce and manage plastic pollution. The panelists include Mr. Jawed Ali Khan, HPM, UN Habitat; Dr. Imran Hashmi, Tenured Professor & Associate Dean, IESE, NUST; DR. Hira Amjad, Assistant Professor, IESE, NUST; Ms. Raina Saeed Khan, Chairperson, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board; Dr. Mansoor Ali; Team Lead, Waste Burning Program, Royal Academy of Engineering, UK; and Dr. Beenish Kulsoom, Lead Local Governance Program, Shehersaaz.
The panelists highlighted that that there is need for redesigning products & packaging, market assessment for reuse, refill & recyclability, increased awareness and advocacy, and effective implementation of legislations for beating plastic pollution in Pakistan. A strong need was felt for inclusion of producers responsibility in eliminating plastic pollution through defining and legislation under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Through collective action, we can achieve a world that is cleaner, greener, safer, healthier and happier, for us to live, work and play.
Ms. Almas Shakoor, Executive Director, Shehersaaz welcomed the participants and highlighted the importance of awareness for an effective and efficient plastic waste management system which is critical for improving the productivity and sustainability of Pakistan centers.
Mr. Jawed Ali Khan in his opening remarks explained that UN Habitat is assisting cities through actions including waste data and monitoring, knowledge sharing, education and advocacy. As the cities grow, the problem of plastic and solid waste management is worsening. If the trend continues, 12 billion tonnes of plastic waste will be part of the environment by 2050. It is important that we work jointly towards reducing the plastic waste and promote its utilization for generating circular economy to reduce plastic pollution, value addition and increase resource efficiency.
Dr. Imran Hashmi and DR. Hira Amjad, deliberated that we must recognize that the restoration of nature is imperative to the survival of our planet and the human race. Academia is playing its role by providing the alternatives and students in the universities are doing research on different topics specifically related to Micro-Plastics. He highlighted that the research work done is not appropriately taken up by policy makers for integrating into the policies. This gap needs to be filled by working hand in hand.
Dr. Mansoor Ali described though National policies and legislations exist to address the plastic waste challenge but due to ineffective implementation, we are unable to beat the menace of plastic. There is a dire need to revise the legislations and their implementation strategies. Dr. Beenish Kulsoom said that it is important to identify the root causes for the ineffective local governance system for management of plastic waste. There exists overlapping of mandates of institutions working at the local level resulting in ineffective governance. The solution is to revisit the governance structure. Ms. Raina Saeed explained that awareness and advocacy plays a vital role in building awareness to the general public with respect to the impacts of plastic pollution in Pakistan and working for plastic free Margalla Hills Natural Park.
Citizens perspectives on challenges and solutions were also taken in which they showed concern on low awareness with respect to severity of the impact caused by plastic pollution on the wellbeing. Gardeners, Sanitary Workers and Forest Guards were payed tribute for their continuous efforts to clean the environment.

Pakistan and the United Nations celebrate 75 years of UN Peacekeeping
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, 30 May 2023 - Today an event was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad, in collaboration with the United Nations, to celebrate 75 years of United Nations peacekeeping, paying homage to the more than 200,000 Pakistani service women and men who have served in 46 UN Missions since 1960 – including 171 who lost their lives.
Pakistan is among the largest troop contributing countries to UN peacekeeping with nearly 4,334 military and police personnel currently serving in nine locations around the world.
“Pakistan is proud of its long-standing association and contribution to UN peacekeeping,” said the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar at the event. The Minister of State paid tribute to the services and sacrifices rendered by UN peacekeepers for advancing the shared goals of peace all over the world, and reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong commitment and support to the UN peacekeeping and peacebuilding architecture.
“Today we are celebrating the more than 80,000 brave peacekeepers — women and men — who are carrying out the extremely important task of creating peace around the world. We also thank Pakistan, the fifth largest contributor to peacekeeping globally,” said Knut Ostby, UNDP Representative in Pakistan, who spoke on behalf of the United Nations. “The UN was created to work on three pillars that are interlinked: peace, development and human rights. We see peace as an understanding between people, a desire to work together to bring the world forward,” he added.
The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs opened an exhibition of photographs featuring Pakistani peacekeepers and Pakistan’s work at the United Nations in presence of representatives from the Government, Foreign Embassies, UN agencies and development partners.
The event also included two panel discussions with the participation of a representative from the UN, senior policy level officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army General Headquarters (GHQ), and a female Pakistani peacekeeper who has served in the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The panelists shared their perspectives on the important role of UN peacekeeping, its evolution over the years, and Pakistan’s contributions towards this noble endeavor.
Last week in New York, UN Secretary-General António Guterres laid a wreath to honour the memory of the more than 4,200 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives helping maintain peace and security since 1948 – including 171 who were Pakistani citizens.
Guterres presided over a ceremony during which Dag Hammarskjöld Medals were awarded posthumously to the 103 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers – including eight Pakistanis -- who lost their lives helping maintain peace last year.
In his message, the Secretary-General said, “United Nations peacekeepers are the beating heart of our commitment to a more peaceful world. For 75 years, they have supported people and communities rocked by conflict and upheaval across the globe. Today, on the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, we honour their extraordinary contributions to international peace and security.”
Globally, more than 87,000 women and men are helping maintain peace in 12 conflict zones across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. UN peacekeepers provide security and the political and peacebuilding support to help countries make the difficult, early transition from conflict to peace.
Since 1948, more than two million peacekeepers from 125 countries have served in 71 operations around the world. International Day of UN Peacekeepers, observed on 29 May every year, established by the UN General Assembly in 2002, pays tribute to all women and men serving in peacekeeping, and honours the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace.

WFP WELCOMES CONTRIBUTION FROM THE PHILIPPINES TO SUPPORT FLOOD RESPONSE IN PAKISTAN
ISLAMABAD – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomed a contribution of US$ 100,000 from the Embassy of the Republic of the Philippines to Pakistan for its ongoing flood response to reach the most vulnerable flood-affected communities with relief, recovery and rehabilitation support. The Ambassador-designate of the Republic of the Philippines to Pakistan, Maria Agnes M. Cervantes, handed over the donation to Rathi Palakrishnan, WFP’s Country Director a.i., during a ceremony held at the WFP office in Islamabad on 18 May.
"The Philippine Government is always ready to provide whatever help it could give to the people of Pakistan, with the Philippines and Pakistan considered as most vulnerable to climate change. This is an extension of our appreciation to Pakistan for its assistance after Typhoon Yolanda brought devastation to a large part of the Philippines”, said Ambassador-designate Maria Agnes M. Cervantes.
The contribution comes at a critical time and will support thousands of people in need after the devastating floods last year. Malnutrition was already a major public health concern across the country before the floods, but now its acute form is an increasing concern in the worst-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan, especially among children under 5.
“WFP is very thankful to the Government of the Philippines for the generous contribution and its solidarity with the Pakistani people, especially at a time when people are struggling with soaring food prices and record high inflation. These funds will enable WFP to provide much-needed relief to flood-affected people who do not know where their next meal will come from”, said Rathi Palakrishnan.
In its ongoing flood response, WFP has supported over 3.7 million flood-affected people with 77,745 mt of food and nutrition assistance and US$ 23.3 million in cash-based transfers to date.

STATE OF WORLD POPULATION REPORT PROVIDES INFINITE POSSIBILITIES FOR PAKISTAN
Islamabad, 23 May 2023 – The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Pakistan and the High Commission of Canada in Pakistan co-hosted an event on Tuesday to mark the launch of UNFPA's 2023 State of World Population (SWOP) report. The event was held at the Canadian High Commission and brought together representatives from the Government, the donor community, various UN agencies, civil society and other stakeholders.
This year’s report, titled '8 Billion Lives, Infinite Possibilities: The Case for Rights and Choices', was launched globally on April 19. Presenting the latest trends with regard to population growth or decline, fertility rates, reproductive health, family planning, and migration around the globe as well as the debates and policies those developments are sparking, the report also cautions against trying to control women's bodies to address demographic concerns. Family planning, it suggests, must not be used as a means for achieving fertility targets but as a tool for empowering individuals. Women should be able to choose if, when, and how many children they want to have.
According to the report, Pakistan will be among the eight countries to account for half of the projected global population growth by 2050, along with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, the Philippines and the USA. Pakistan's population is currently estimated at 240.5 million and is projected to reach 403 million by 2050.
The report discusses “population anxieties” felt in different parts of the world, including in Pakistan, in reaction to population growth or, in some cases, to low fertility rates or other demographic trends.
Echoing the key message from the SWOP, Dr. Luay Shabaneh, UNFPA Representative in Pakistan, said there is population anxiety in the country, and a genuine linkage between population dynamics, poverty, nutrition and other socioeconomic dimensions recommending that these should be made clear in the public policies and programmes in the country. He called for a radical rethink of how population numbers are framed, urging policymakers and other stakeholders to abandon narratives about population booms and busts to instead focus efforts on making sure that individuals, especially women, are able to freely make their own reproductive choices, a goal which has unfortunately not been met.
"The government needs to ensure that families are provided with all proper services, information, and understanding to implement their own reproductive decisions. Women are not accountable for any nation's problems; they are victims of social norms," said Dr. Shabaneh. “People need to talk about population issues in today's world of unease and uncertainty. Still, they must do so in new ways that uproot current biases and avoid perpetuating harmful, discriminatory norms and myths.”
The High Commissioner of Canada to Pakistan, Her Excellency Ms. Leslie Scanlon, highlighted reproductive rights, gender equality and bodily autonomy as key priorities shared by UNFPA and Canada and highlighted Canada’s support to family planning and reproductive health in Pakistan through the project Sehaat Mand Khaandaan. “Sadly, many women in Pakistan, like in a number of other countries, are unable to make choices about contraception, family size and their own health given cultural and economical factors, among others.”
Such tremendous challenges and gaps are the reason why Canada stepped forward with a long-term commitment to SRHR with our global 10-year commitment. We do our best to reach the populations that need it the most”, she added.
The event also gave the opportunity to members of the community, including a health practitioner, a woman and a youth leader for health and empowerment, to share their views on these issues and talk about their personal experiences.
UNFPA is committed to working with the government of Pakistan and other partners to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the country's growing population. The SWOP report strongly recommends that governments institute policies with gender equality and rights at their heart, such as parental leave programs, child tax credits, policies that promote gender equality in the workplace, and universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. These offer a proven formula that will reap economic dividends and lead to resilient societies able to thrive no matter how populations change.

PRESS RELEASE
UNDP holds training on responsible reporting on Climate Change and GLOFs for journalists in Gilgit Baltistan
Skardu, 17 May 2023— UNDP Pakistan held a 3-day training on responsible reporting on climate change and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) for journalists in Skardu, Gilgit Baltistan.
The training was organised by UNDP’s GLOF-II Project, a joint initiative with the Ministry of Climate Change and supported by Green Climate Fund. Twenty-five journalists from Gilgit, Skardu, Astore, Ghizer, Hunza, Shigar, Kharmang, Ghanche, and Nagar were trained on the catastrophic impacts of climate-induced disasters such as GLOFs, torrential rains, and floods, and how they disproportionately affect women and girls.
“Gilgit Baltistan’s topography is rich with snow-capped mountains and monumental glaciers. However, it is unfortunate that these glaciers are rapidly melting due to the escalating climate, making communities prone to high climate risk. It is most important for journalists to disseminate the right kind of information through responsible reporting,” remarked the Additional Chief Secretary of Gilgit Baltistan, Aziza Ahmed Jamali, in his opening remarks on the first day of the training.
The training entailed in-depth discussions on digital journalism ethics, storytelling, multimedia reporting, narrative journalism, creative formats, hand-held shooting techniques and journalists’ safety and security. The participants, including women journalists from Gilgit Baltistan, shared the challenges they experienced in reporting the GLOFs and floods of 2022.
Since the Project valleys are highly vulnerable to experiencing climate-induced disasters such as GLOFs, these trainings aim to equip journalists to responsibly report on the experiences of the disaster-affected communities, especially those of women and girls.
UNDP’s GLOF-II project operates in 16 valleys of Gilgit Baltistan and 8 valleys in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It empowers communities to identify and manage risks associated with GLOFs and related impacts of climate change, strengthen public services to lower the risk of disasters related to GLOFs, and improve community preparedness and disaster response. The project also supports the development of sustainable livelihood options in project areas, with a particular focus on the participation of women in ensuring food security and livelihoods.

Government of Balochistan and WFP partner to improve nutrition in Gwadar and Lasbela
ISLAMABAD – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Planning and Development (P&D) Department of the Government of Balochistan have signed an agreement for the implementation of the Gwadar-Lasbela Livelihoods Support Project II (GLLSP-II) to improve nutrition behaviours and practices for food insecure communities in the Gwadar and Lasbela coastal districts. These areas are highly exposed to climate shocks, resulting in lower productivity in agriculture, livestock and fisheries.
Funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the agreement was signed in Islamabad between Rathi Palakrishnan, WFP Country Director a.i. in Pakistan and Rehmat Dashti, Project Director, P&D Department of the Government of Balochistan.
“I am confident that the partnership between the Government of Balochistan and WFP will help us achieve our joint nutrition targets. I appreciate WFP’s efforts to ensure long-term solutions to the malnutrition challenge in Pakistan,” said Rehmat Dashti.
The project will contribute to the prevention of malnutrition through behavioural change interventions on nutrition, building on a nationwide existing programme WFP supports, the Benazir Nashonuma Programme. As part of the broader Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), the Benazir Nashonuma programme targets pregnant and breastfeeding women and children under two through 484 facilitation centres in 156 districts across Pakistan, including in Gwadar and Lasbela. The GLLSP-II project will also support these beneficiaries and use the ten operational facilitation centres - six in Lasbela and four in Gwadar- within government health facilities.
“The World Food Programme is deeply concerned about the worsening nutrition situation in Pakistan, including in several districts of Balochistan. The partnership will allow WFP to provide critical support to the Government of Balochistan in its efforts to raise nutrition awareness among the most vulnerable communities to improve their nutrition and overall well-being” said Rathi Palakrishnan.
Child malnutrition in Pakistan's flood-affected areas continues to rise sharply. A survey[1] conducted in 15 districts in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan showed nearly one third of children under two are suffering from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), and 14 percent from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). WFP is supporting the treatment of MAM cases among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls through a targeted supplementary feeding programme (TSFP) in 23 high prevalence districts in Sindh and Balochistan.
GLLSP-II is an extension of the Gwadar-Lasbela Livelihoods Support Project’s previous phase, conducted in the same two districts. It adopts an integrated approach by the Rome-based agencies - the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) - for climate-resilient agriculture and livestock and sustainable fisheries management.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD TELECOMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SOCIETY DAY
17 May 2023
On this World Telecommunication and Information Society Day, we highlight the power of technology to advance sustainable development in Least Developed Countries.
The digital revolution is a defining force of our era.
The opportunities are tremendous: from transforming education and health care, to accelerating climate action and the achievement of all the Sustainable Development Goals.
But to realize the promise of technology, we must confront its perils:
The lack of ethical guardrails and robust governance frameworks.
The proliferation of hate speech and disinformation.
The amplification of social divides and economic inequalities.
And the risks posed by Artificial Intelligence, from deep fakes to biased decisions by neural networks that no human can fully explain.
Technology must be an instrument to reduce divides – not deepen them.
As the internet becomes ever more central to value creation and innovation, Least Developed Countries risk falling further behind.
We must dramatically improve accessibility and inclusivity and eliminate the digital divide.
We must support the creation of digital public goods: open-source software, open data, and open content.
We must invest in the capacities of public institutions so that they have the skills and resources to understand, oversee, shape, and engage with Artificial Intelligence and other transformative technologies.
And we must come together around a Global Digital Compact – to avoid fragmentation, safeguard human rights, and ensure technology is a force for human wellbeing, solidarity, and progress.
I commend the International Telecommunication Union for working to accelerate global connectivity for all by 2030.
Let us all do our part in closing the digital divide and securing a more equitable and sustainable future everywhere.

PRESS RELEASE
Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to Decent Work through the launch of Decent Work Country Programme for next five years
Islamabad (4 May 2023): The Government of Pakistan, employers’ and workers’ organisations launched the next generation of the Decent Work Country Programme for Pakistan during a historic signing ceremony held at the International Labour Organization’s Country Office in Islamabad.
The Programme, covering the period of 2023-2027, reflects the shared priorities of the ILO's tripartite constituents in Pakistan – the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, employers’ and workers' organizations. The programme aims to promote employment, social protection, respect for international labour standards, and occupational safety and health to make workplaces safe and inclusive.
Pakistan was one of the first countries globally to develop a tripartite Decent Work Country Programme in 2005, demonstrating their commitment to lead by example. The programme is aligned with Pakistan's national priorities set out in the Vision 2025, provincial policies and the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for Pakistan, supporting the country's realization of the Sustainable Development Goals.
The Decent Work Country Programme for Pakistan aims to address critical areas of concern in Pakistan's workforce, including the plight of workers in the informal economy, limited social protection benefits, and the rising number of NEETS – youth who are not in employment, education, or training highlighted the Director of ILO’s Country Office for Pakistan, Mr Geir T. Tonstol.
Mr Zahoor Awan, member of the Governing Body of the ILO, representing the workers of Pakistan, congratulated the ILO for providing support and guidance for finalizing the Decent Work Country Programme. He reiterated that Decent Work is the tool that can address the increasing disparities in the world of work. He noted that the new programme draws lessons from the previous programmes and focuses on upholding and advocating for effective application of International Labour Standards through social dialogue which gives workers an equal voice and agency to represent those who are most vulnerable to shocks.
Representing the employers of Pakistan, Mr Fasihul Karim Siddiqui, Vice-President of the Employers' Federation of Pakistan, called the signing of the Decent Work Country Programme a momentous occasion. He said that the programme considers the challenges faced by the economy and the impacts of recent economic turmoil caused by various unfortunate events on businesses and proposes pragmatic solutions to address business sustainability and competitiveness while making them more compliant.
During the ceremony, UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Pakistan, Mr Julien Harneis, expressed that the Decent Work Country Programme for Pakistan would create a more prosperous, fair, inclusive and equitable society as it is premised on the principle of reaching the furthest behind including women, youth, persons with disabilities, migrant workers among others and ensuring equal access to opportunities and decent work.
Finally, the Chief Guest of the occasion, the Secretary, Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, Mr Zulfiquar Haider, stated that the Programme aligns with the Government of Pakistan's vision of creating an enabling environment for sustainable economic growth and job creation. He assured that in the next five years, his Ministry will take concrete and affirmative measures to ensure that decent employment, skills and social protection are mainstreamed to enable Just Transitions for all.
During the event, informative presentations were given on important aspects of the newly launched Decent Work Country Programme IV for Pakistan. Dr Aliya Khan, an eminent scholar and Decent Work expert emphasized the critical role of Occupational Safety and Health and the significance of creating safe workplaces in Pakistan to guarantee a favourable working environment and promote decent working conditions.

PRESS RELEASE
South Asia could eliminate child marriage only in 55 years – UNICEF
In South Asia, 1 in 4 young women are still married before 18th birthday, with climate catastrophes, economic shocks and the ongoing fallout from COVID-19 threatening to reverse hard-earned gains
KATHMANDU, Nepal, 3 May 2023 – South Asia continues to drive global reductions in child marriage and is on pace to eliminate child marriage in about 55 years, according to a new analysis issued by UNICEF South Asia today.
Child marriage has declined steadily in South Asia. In the last decade alone, a girl’s likelihood of marrying in childhood in South Asia has dropped by nearly half, from 46 per cent to 26 per cent. This progress is driven largely by India, with notable declines in Bangladesh, the Maldives and Pakistan.
However, the region remains home to nearly half (45 per cent) of the world's child brides. While India has recorded significant progress in recent decades, it still accounts for one-third of the estimated child marriage cases globally total. Already, an estimated 640 million girls and women alive globally today were married in childhood – of which 290 million are in South Asia, according to the latest estimates included in the analysis.
Despite a steady decline in child marriage in the last decade, multiple crises including climate catastrophes, economic shocks and the ongoing fallout from COVID-19 are threatening to reverse hard-earned gains in South Asia. The COVID crisis has made it difficult for girls to access health care, education, social services and community support.
"The world is engulfed by crises on top of crises that are crushing the hopes and dreams of vulnerable children, especially girls who should be students, not brides," said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. "Health and economic crises, escalating armed conflicts, and the ravaging effects of climate change are forcing families to seek a false sense of refuge in child marriage. We need to do everything in our power to ensure that their rights to an education and empowered lives are secured."
In South Asia, levels of child marriage vary considerably across the region, from over 50 per cent in Bangladesh to 2 per cent in the Maldives. Within countries, there is further disparity: in Afghanistan, for example, there is a tenfold difference in prevalence across provinces.
However, overall, child brides in South Asia are more likely to live in poor households, have less education and reside in rural areas. For example, 1 in 4 child brides in Pakistan have never been to school.
Girls who marry in childhood face immediate and lifelong consequences. They are less likely to continue in school, and face an increased risk of early pregnancy, in turn increasing the risk of maternal complications and mortality. The practice can also isolate girls from family and friends and exclude them from participating in their communities, taking a heavy toll on their mental health and well-being.
"We've proven that progress to end child marriage is possible. It requires unwavering support for vulnerable girls and families," added Russell. "We must focus on keeping girls in school and making sure they have economic opportunities."
###

Notes to editors:
Estimates of the global and regional prevalence of child marriage are calculated on the basis of national estimates in the UNICEF global databases, comprised of nationally representative data from over 100 countries. National data on child marriage are primarily drawn from household surveys, including the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Demographic data are drawn from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. The latest estimates go up to the year 2022.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY
3 May 2023
For three decades, on World Press Freedom Day, the international community has celebrated the work of journalists and media workers.
This day highlights a basic truth: all our freedom depends on press freedom.
Freedom of the press is the foundation of democracy and justice. It gives all of us the facts we need to shape opinions and speak truth to power. And as this year’s theme reminds us, press freedom represents the very lifeblood of human rights.
But in every corner of the world, freedom of the press is under attack.
Truth is threatened by disinformation and hate speech seeking to blur the lines between fact and fiction, between science and conspiracy.
The increased concentration of the media industry into the hands of a few, the financial collapse of scores of independent news organizations, and an increase of national laws and regulations that stifle journalists are further expanding censorship and threatening freedom of expression.
Meanwhile, journalists and media workers are directly targeted on and offline as they carry out their vital work. They are routinely harassed, intimidated, detained and imprisoned.
At least 67 media workers were killed in 2022 — an unbelievable 50 per cent increase over the previous year. Nearly three quarters of women journalists have experienced violence online, and one in four have been threatened physically.
Ten years ago, the United Nations established a Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists to protect media workers and end impunity for crimes committed against them.
On this and every World Press Freedom Day, the world must speak with one voice.
Stop the threats and attacks.
Stop detaining and imprisoning journalists for doing their jobs.
Stop the lies and disinformation.
Stop targeting truth and truth-tellers.
As journalists stand up for truth, the world stands with them.

Press Release: Children in Pakistan pushed into life-threatening, acute malnutrition

USD $5.5 million UN Humanitarian fund allocation to support lifesaving nutrition interventions in Pakistan as global food prices soar
and children suffer from increasingly severe forms of malnutrition.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, 17 April 2023 – Today the United Nations warned that the number of children suffering from wasting in Pakistan’s flood-affected areas had greatly increased compared to the pre-flood situation, which was already reaching emergency levels.
A rapid survey conducted in 15 flood-affected districts suggests that nearly one-third of children aged 6-23 months suffer from moderate acute malnutrition and 14 per cent from severe acute malnutrition -- a life-threatening form of malnutrition -- with girls being more affected than boys*. The number of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition with medical complications who are admitted for hospital treatment has also gradually increased since the floods, as global food prices soar.
“Even before the floods, child wasting was already reaching emergency levels, but what I am seeing now in villages is very worrying,” said Julien Harneis, the UN Resident Coordinator in Pakistan. “We are grateful for the global community’s support so far, but much more is needed to help the Government provide the increasing numbers of children who are at risk of death with immediate therapeutic food and care. We must help the Government avert a nutrition crisis which would have dangerous and irreversible consequences for millions of children, and for the future of Pakistan.”
The Resident Coordinator announced that he would dedicate USD $5.5 million out of the USD $6.5 million allocation received from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) -- four-fifths of the grant -- towards emergency nutrition and food security interventions.
This additional USD $5.5 million will help UNICEF, WFP, WHO and NGOs provide emergency nutrition interventions as part of the Government-led flood response in the most vulnerable communities of Balochistan and Sindh, with OCHA coordinating and ensuring that the funds are used in an efficient manner.
But with only one-third of the nutrition interventions included in the Floods Response Plan funded so far, additional funding is urgently required to implement early identification, integrated prevention and treatment of malnutrition in a greater number of villages and healthcare facilities. There is also a need to increase the number of interventions that improve availability, affordability and accessibility to nutritious foods that protect children from wasting.
Led by the Government of Pakistan, with support from UN agencies and NGOs, the Food Security and Agriculture Sector has provided life-saving assistance to nearly 7 million people and the Nutrition Sector to nearly 1 million people since the climate disaster hit the country last summer, but many needs remain unmet.

PRESS RELEASE
UNESCO Awards Funding to Pakistan to Improve Data Collection and Strengthen Policymaking for the Cultural and Creative Industries in Pakistan
UNESCO’s International Fund for Cultural Diversity (IFCD) has awarded USD 83,496 to Beaconhouse National University to undertake a project titled “Improving Data Collection among National and Provincial Statistical Agencies to Strengthen Policymaking for the Cultural and Creative Industries”.
The IFCD is a multi-donor fund established under Article 18 of the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. Its purpose is to promote sustainable development and creative economic growth in developing countries that are Parties to the 2005 Convention. Since 2010, the IFCD has provided more than USD 10 million in funding for 140 projects in developing countries. This is the first time Pakistan has been awarded funding under the IFCD.
Pakistan ratified the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions in March 2022. The Convention supports the growth and development of cultural and creative industries, and provides a new framework for informed, transparent, and participatory systems of governance for culture.
The project will be implemented by Beaconhouse National University, with technical guidance from the UNESCO Islamabad Field Office. Founded in 2003, Beaconhouse National University (BNU) is a leading liberal arts university in Pakistan, and has previously worked with UNESCO on several key interventions to support the creative economy, including the mapping of cultural and creative industries around heritage sites in Punjab.
The project will work with national and provincial statistical agencies to develop improved data collection and analysis tools for the cultural and creative sectors in Pakistan, contributing to the development of inclusive cultural policies that respond to the needs of the sector and include often overlooked voices such as women artisans. The project outcomes will strengthen evidence-based policymaking and will benefit a range of government bodies including bureaus of statistics, cultural bodies, skill development and vocational training authorities, councils of the arts, small and medium enterprise development authorities, planning and development boards, trade and investment boards, and more.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL MESSAGE ON THE WORLD AUTISM AWARENESS DAY, 2 April 2023
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE WORLD AUTISM AWARENESS DAY
2 April 2023

On World Autism Awareness Day, we celebrate the contributions of persons with autism and renew our resolve to advance their inherent rights.
Despite important progress, persons with autism continue to face social and environmental barriers to the full exercise of their rights and fundamental freedoms, in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
We must do better – by promoting inclusive education, equal employment opportunities, self-determination, and an environment where every person is respected. And as we do so, we also recognize the role of families, caregivers, and support networks in the lives of persons with autism.
Today and every day, let us fully recognize the active and diverse contributions of persons with autism to our societies – and let us work together with persons with autism to build an inclusive and accessible world for all.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF ZERO WASTE
30 March 2023
The first-ever International Day of Zero Waste reminds us of a fundamental and brutal truth: humanity is treating our planet like a garbage dump.
Every year, more than 2 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste is created, but 33 per cent of it is not properly managed in controlled facilities. Every minute, the equivalent of one garbage truck full of plastic is dumped into the ocean.
Meanwhile, pollution and chemicals are poisoning our water, air and soil. And a staggering 10 per cent of all global greenhouse gas emissions comes from growing, storing and transporting food that is never used.
We must stop trashing our only home and declare war on waste.
We need those who produce waste to design products that use fewer resources and materials, while managing waste across production cycles and extending the lives of the products they sell.
We must massively invest in modern waste management systems and policies that encourage people to re-use and recycle everything from plastic bottles to ageing electronics.
And as consumers, we must all consider the origins and impacts of the goods and products we purchase, and reuse and recycle what we can, whenever we can.
It’s time to clean up our world, and make progress towards circular, zero-waste economies — for people and planet alike.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY TO COMBAT ISLAMOPHOBIA
15 March 2023
On this International Day to Combat Islamophobia, we focus attention – and call for action – to stamp out the poison of anti-Muslim hatred.
The world’s nearly 2 billion Muslims reflect humanity in all its magnificent diversity.
But they often face bigotry and prejudice for no other reason than their faith.
Beyond structural, institutional discrimination and the wholesale stigmatization of Muslim communities, Muslims suffer personal attacks, hateful rhetoric, and scapegoating.
We see some of the worst impacts in the triple discrimination against Muslim women because of their gender, ethnicity, and faith.
The growing hate that Muslims face is not an isolated development: it is part of the resurgence of ethno-nationalism, neo-Nazi white supremacist ideologies, and violence targeting vulnerable populations including Muslims, Jews, some minority Christian communities and others.
Discrimination diminishes us all. And it is incumbent on all of us to stand up against it.
We must strengthen our defenses by pushing for policies that fully respect human rights and protect religious and cultural identities.
We must recognize diversity as richness and ramp up political, cultural, and economic investments in social cohesion.
And we must confront bigotry by working to tackle the hate that spreads like wildfire across the internet.
For well over a millennium, Islam’s message of peace, compassion, and grace has inspired people the world over.
Every great faith and tradition summons the imperatives of tolerance, respect, and mutual understanding.
At the heart, we are dealing with universal values: they animate the United Nations Charter and lie at the core of our quest for justice, human rights, and peace.
Today and every day, let us strive to realize these values and counter the forces of division by reaffirming our common humanity.

PRESS RELEASE
Having access to digital technologies is essential for women in agriculture
Islamabad 14 March 2023 - It is crucial to recognize and address the gender-based barriers that limit women's access to resources and technology in agriculture. The theme of this year's International Women's Day, "DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality," highlighted the potential of technology and innovation to level the playing field and break down these barriers.
As climate change continues to affect agriculture and smallholder women farmers, access to digital technologies can help improve their ability to adapt to these changes and build more resilient farming systems.
Florence Rolle, FAO Representative in Pakistan, emphasized the crucial role of access to digital technologies and tools for women and girls in agriculture during a panel discussion organized in Islamabad by the International Water Management Institute in connection with International Women’s Day 2023 (IWD 2023).
“Women and girls in agriculture are more impacted by the climate change, we need to ensure that women and girls have access to digital technologies so that they may get information on weather, soil quality and crop management. This informed will help them make informed decision; ultimately improving food security and their resilience”, she said.
Rolle suggested that the use of mobile phones and other digital platforms would provide smallholder women farmers with the information they need to grow their crops more effectively. She also noted that the number of girls enrolling in agricultural universities is increasing, which bodes well for the future of women in the sector and in leadership positions. Overall, her remarks highlighted the importance of empowering women and girls in agriculture by providing them with the tools they need to succeed in an increasingly challenging environment.
Further to IWD celebrations, FAO organized a panel discussion on the role of women in agriculture at an international conference on "Biodiversity of Arid Zones", featuring Prof. Dr. Ghazala H Rizwani, Director, Hamdard University Karachi, Dr. Shabana Sartaj, Associate Professor, English Literature, SAU, Tando Jam, and Dr. Reema Vistro, Lecturer Agronomy, SAU, Umerkot. The workshop was organized at the sub-campus of Sindh Agriculture University (SAU), Umer Kot.The importance of promoting gender equality in agriculture for sustainable development was highlighted, and FAO's project interventions were praised for helping women learn new, innovative, and climate-smart agriculture practices while providing them with a platform to voice their ideas. Women farmers from FAO project areas shared their experiences and views on how Women Farm Field Schools in different districts of FAO’s interventions are empowering them at the household and community levels.
FAO also celebrated International Women's Day 2023 in Quetta under the European Union funded and International Trade Centre (ITC) implemented project: Growth for Rural Advancement and Sustainable Progress (GRASP) Project, collaborating with the Women Development Department of the Government of Balochistan, UNWomen, UNHCR, and UNDP. The event brought together stakeholders to discuss how digital technology can accelerate progress towards gender equality. FAO, through its project interventions, has conducted several trainings on digital literacy and provided tablets (notepads) to men and women farmers in Balochistan. This enables them to stay better informed about markets to sell their produce, prevailing market prices, and quantity demanded in the market, empowering them to make informed decisions to sell their produce at the right price and at the right time.
Ms. Robina Wahaj, Senior Water and Land Officer, FAO also participated in a live radio program at Planet 87.6, a FM channel at Radio Pakistan and advocated for the importance of digital agriculture to uplift women in agriculture.

Title: خواتین کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر سیکرٹری جنرل کا پیغام
Content: 08 March 2023
خواتین کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر سیکرٹری جنرل کا پیغام
خواتین کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر ہم دنیا کے ہر گوشے میں، اور زندگی کے ہر شعبے میں خواتین اور لڑکیوں کی کامیابیوں پر خوشی اور مسرت کا اظہار کرتے ہیں۔
لیکن ہم یہ بھی مانتے ہیں کہ انہیں لاتعداد رکاوٹیں درپیش ہیں – نظام کی وجہ سے ہونے والی ناانصافیاں ہوں یا تشدد، معاشرے میں محرومی کا احساس ہو یا اپنی ذات اور اپنی زندگی سے متعلق حقوق سے محرومی، مشکلات در مشکلات کا ایک سلسلہ ہےجو خواتین اور لڑکیوں کو سب سے پہلے اور سب سے زیادہ اپنی لپیٹ میں لیتا ہے۔
خواتین ہوں یا لڑکیاں، مرد ہوں یا لڑکے، صنفی امتیاز و تفریق ہر فرد کو نقصان پہنچاتا ہے۔
خواتین کا عالمی دن دراصل میدانِ عمل میں اترنے کا دن ہے…
اُن خواتین کا ساتھ دینے کے لئے، جو اپنا سب کچھ قربان کر کے اپنے بنیادی حقوق کا مطالبہ کر رہی ہیں…
جنسی استحصال، بدسلوکی اور زیادتی سے تحفظ کو مضبوط سے مضبوط تر بنانے
زندگی کے ہر شعبے میں خواتین کی بھرپور شمولیت یقینی بنانے اور انہیں قیادت کے منصب تک لانے کے لئے میدانِ عمل میں اترنے کا دن۔
رواں سال خواتین کے عالمی دن کے مرکزی پیغام میں صنفی برابری کی تحریک کو آگے بڑھانے کے لئے ٹیکنالوجی اور جدت سے کام لینے کی ضرورت پر زور دیا گیا ہے۔
ٹیکنالوجی کی بدولت خواتین اور لڑکیوں کے لئے تعلیم اور مواقع کی ان گنت راہیں کھل سکتی ہیں۔
لیکن دوسری جانب اسے بدسلوکی اور نفرت پھیلانے کے لئے بھی استعمال کیا جا سکتا ہے۔
آج کے دور میں سائنس، ٹیکنالوجی، انجینئرنگ اور ریاضی کے شعبوں سے وابستہ افراد میں خواتین کا تناسب ایک تہائی سے بھی کم ہے۔
نئی ٹیکنالوجیز کی دریافت اور ترقی میں جب خواتین کی نمائندگی کم ہو گی تو یہ کہنا بے جا نہ ہو گا کہ امتیاز و تفریق کی بنیاد ابتداء میں ہی رکھ دی جاتی ہے۔
اس لئے ہمیں ڈیجیٹل تقسیم کو ختم کرنا ہوگا اور سائنس و ٹیکنالوجی کے میدان میں خواتین کی نمائندگی کو بڑھانا ہو گا۔
خواتین کو ڈیجیٹل دنیا میں شامل نہ کرنے کی وجہ سے گزشتہ ایک دہائی کے دوران کم آمدنی اور متوسط آمدنی والے ممالک اندازاً 1 ٹریلین ڈالر جی ڈی پی کا نقصان اٹھا چکے ہیں – اور اگر اب بھی عملی اقدامات نہ کئے گئے تو 2025 میں اس نقصان کی مالیت 1.5 ٹریلین ڈالر تک پہنچ سکتی ہے۔
خواتین کی بہتری پر سرمایہ لگانے میں ہر فرد، ہر کمیونٹی اور ہر ملک کی بہتری ہے۔
آپ حکومت میں ہوں یا نجی شعبے میں، یا سول سوسائٹی کا حصہ ہوں، آئیں، ہم سب ایک ہو کر قدم بڑھائیں اور اپنی اس دنیا کو خواتین، لڑکیوں، مردوں اور لڑکوں کے لئے زیادہ خوشحال بنائیں، ہر جگہ ہر فرد کو اس کا حصہ بنائیں اور سب کے لئے انصاف یقینی بنائیں۔

PRESS RELEASE
FAO, IFC, ADB & BOI Organize Symposium to Catalyze Investments in Agriculture Sector
Islamabad: Agriculture Investment Symposium was held in Islamabad to bring together key stakeholders, including investors, policymakers, farmers, development partners, and researchers, to exchange ideas, knowledge and experiences to drive investment in the agriculture sector. Attended by more than 300 participants, the symposium provided a platform for matchmaking and exploring opportunities for private investors and financial institutions to invest in the agricultural sector.
Booths for B2B meetings were setup, which served as an avenue for investors to connect with agriculture companies to exchange knowledge and access to available options related to technologies and bankable products. Several memorandum of understandings were either signed or pledged at the B2B meetings.
Jointly organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Asian Development Bank (ABD) and Federal and Provincial Boards of Investment (BOI), the symposium catalyzed investments, partnerships, and collaborations for sustainable and inclusive growth in the sector, leveraging digitalization while managing the adverse impacts of climate change.
Professor Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister for Planning, urged private investors and financial and government institutions to collaborate and work together in agriculture sector, which has high potential of economic returns and poverty alleviation. Appreciating the efforts of FAO, he highlighted that the cluster-based development was part of the government’s Vision 2025 to maximize agriculture and termed this approach as a key to our future influenced by the Michael Porter’s landmark work on “The Competitive Advantage of Nations.”
FAO’s Investment Centre also works with private sector partners through financial institutions to attract greater and more responsible private agri-food investment, said Mohamed Manssouri, Director FAO Investment Centre. It acts as a bridge between Members and financing partners to scale up investment for greater impact at country level.
Investment potential and economic benefits in eight agriculture commodities, such as apple, beef, chili, date, mango, onion, rice and tomato, were presented to induce private investors. Likewise, the financing needs identified under the living Indus Initiative for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture were also shared. This approach of the country fits very well with the Hand in Hand (HIH) Initiative of FAO, which supports transformation of agri-food systems to eradicate poverty (SDG1), end hunger and malnutrition (SDG2) and reduce inequalities (SDG10).
Other speakers at the inaugural session, including FAO Representative Florence Rolle, Khalid Gardezi, Additional Secretary, Ministry of National Food Security & Research, Zeeshan Sheikh, Country Manager, IFC, Mohammad Farooq, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Climate Change, Yasmin Siddiqi, Director ADB, and  Aamer Irshad, Head of Program, emphasized the challenges faced by the agriculture sector and proposed various reforms, policy actions and identified investment potential for the sustainable management of the agriculture sector of Pakistan under high climatic risk vulnerability.
Two interactive panel discussions were also organized on the theme of the symposium where successful entrepreneurs shared their experiences for catalyzing investment and exploiting digital technologies to enhance agricultural competitiveness, facilitated by ADB and IFC. Jamil Qureshi, Executive Director General, Board of Investment (BOI), Government of Pakistan, in his closing remarks shared the way forward and concluded the event.

Number of children without critical social protection increasing globally – ILO and UNICEF
Multiple crises set to plunge more children into poverty creating an urgent need to scale-up social protection; new report warns
Multimedia content available here
GENEVA/NEW YORK, 2 March 2023 - The number of children without access to social protection is increasing year-on-year, leaving them at risk of poverty, hunger and discrimination, according to a new report released by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF today.
More than a billion reasons: The urgent need to build universal social protection for children warns that an additional 50 million children aged 0-15 missed out on a critical social protection provision – specifically, child benefits (paid in cash or tax credits) – between 2016 and 2020, driving up the total to 1.46 billion children under 15 globally.
“Ultimately, strengthened efforts to ensure adequate investment in universal social protection for children, ideally through universal child benefits to support families at all times, is the ethical and rational choice, and the one that paves the way to sustainable development and social justice,” said Shahra Razavi, Director of the Social Protection Department at the ILO.
According to the report, child and family benefit coverage rates fell or stagnated in every region in the world between 2016 and 2020, leaving no country on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of achieving substantial social protection coverage by 2030. In Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, coverage fell significantly from approximately 51 per cent to 42 per cent. In many other regions, coverage has stalled and remains low. In Central Asia and Southern Asia; Eastern Asia and South-eastern Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa; and Western Asia and Northern Africa coverage rates have been at around 21 per cent, 14 per cent, 11 per cent and 28 per cent respectively since 2016.
Failure to provide children with adequate social protection leaves them vulnerable to poverty, disease, missed education, and poor nutrition, and increases their risk of child marriage and child labour.
Globally, children are twice as likely as adults to live in extreme poverty – those struggling to survive on less than US$1.90 (PPP*) a day – approximately 356 million children. A billion children also live in multidimensional poverty – meaning without access to education, health, housing, nutrition, sanitation, or water. Children living in multidimensional poverty increased by 15 per cent during the COVID-19 pandemic, reversing previous progress in reducing child poverty and highlighting the urgent need for social protection.
Moreover, the pandemic highlighted that social protection is a critical response in times of crisis. Nearly every government in the world either rapidly adapted existing schemes or introduced new social protection programmes to support children and families, but most fell short of making permanent reforms to protect against future shocks, according to the report.
“As families face increasing economic hardship, food insecurity, conflict, and climate-related disasters, universal child benefits can be a lifeline,” said Natalia Winder-Rossi, UNICEF Director of Social Policy and Social Protection. “There is an urgent need to strengthen, expand and invest in child-friendly and shock-responsive social protection systems. This is essential to protect children from living in poverty and increase resilience particularly among the poorest households.”
The report emphasizes that all countries, irrespective of their level of development, have a choice: whether to pursue a “high-road” strategy of investment in reinforcing social protection systems, or a “low-road” strategy that misses out on necessary investments and will leave millions of children behind.
To reverse the negative trend, the ILO and UNICEF urge policymakers to take decisive steps to attain universal social protection for all children, including:

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE
INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR DISARMAMENT AND NON-PROLIFERATION AWARENESS
5 March 2023
On this first-ever International Day for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Awareness, the global community gathers around a fundamental conviction.
Nuclear, chemical, biological, and unpredictable autonomous and other indiscriminate weapon systems have no place in our world.
Yet today, these and other threats continue to menace humanity, with record levels of military spending, rising mistrust, and geopolitical tensions that, left unchecked, could spiral into even greater conflict.
In particular, the number of nuclear weapons held in stockpiles around the world remains at around 13,000 — more than enough to destroy our planet many times over at a time when risk of use is at its highest since the Cold War.
On this important day, I call on all partners — from governments and academia, to media, civil society groups, industry, and young people — to turn up the volume on this collective emergency and raise awareness about the critical importance of disarmament and non-proliferation to humanity’s future.
I also urge leaders to take steps to strengthen the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime — including the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — and support a New Agenda for Peace with a reinvigorated vision for disarmament.
Disarmament and non-proliferation are investments in peace.
They are investments in our future.
Let’s end these threats before they end us.

Islamabad: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Government of Pakistan today signed a USD 5 million funding agreement for a project through which FAO will contribute to the Government’s efforts to recover from the devastating floods that hit the country and Balochistan in particular, in 2022.
The collaboration between FAO and the Balochistan Agriculture & Cooperatives Department (BACD) represents the first time that FAO has received funds by and through a Government in its role as recipient of funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Indeed, this project follows ADB’s approval of a USD 5 million grant to provide Emergency Flood Assistance and to strengthen the country’s disaster and climate resilience, and food security. The ADB Grant was in turn financed by the Japan Fund for Prosperous and Resilient Asia and the Pacific (JFPR) and is part of the larger USD 475 million Emergency Assistance Loan (EAL) and USD 3 million technical assistance grant approved by ADB in December 2022.
The assistance responds to the Government of Pakistan’s request to support its post-flood recovery and reconstruction efforts, and is aimed at supporting the restoration of irrigation, drainage, flood risk management, on-farm water management, and transport infrastructure in the flood-affected provinces of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh.
The additional financing of the JFPR Grant expands the scope of ADB’s post-flood rehabilitation efforts, particularly by supporting (i) urgent provision of climate-resilient seeds for staple crop cultivation and (ii) women-led livelihoods to meet basic household needs, incorporating measures to strengthen community resilience to disasters caused by natural hazards.
Through this project, FAO will ensure the provision of climate-adaptive rice seeds to 60000 farm households for the next Kharif sowing season in order to increase productivity in four Balochistan districts most affected by the 2022 floods; Nasirabad, Jaffarabad, Usta-Mohammad and Sohbatpur. The seeds will be sown over approximately 30 percent of the total rice cropping area of the target districts. FAO will also support women’s livelihoods in agriculture by providing them with durable farming toolkits to facilitate farming activities and with protective footwear for safer rice transplanting.
The project builds on FAO’s immediate response to the floods in Nasirabad division by supporting smallholder farmers in planting for the Rabi season. It also reinforces the FAO Director-General’s pledge at the International Conference on Climate Resilient Pakistan last January in Geneva, when he ensured that: “FAO will continue to play a leading role in transforming Pakistan’s agri-food systems to make them more efficient, inclusive, sustainable and resilient, a challenge that has gained in urgency following recent floods that have devastated the country’s agriculture sector.”
A grant signing ceremony was held at the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) between the Government of Pakistan and ADB. Also present were Kazim Niaz, Federal Secretary for Economic Affairs and Takahiro Yashi, the Executive Director of Japan to ADB, and a representative of the Japanese Embassy in Pakistan.

28 February 2023, Quetta – The Steering Committee on the Rule of Law Roadmap (RoLR) Balochistan convened its 6th session on 28 February, 2023 in Quetta to celebrate the successful completion of the first five-year phase of reforms and launch a new chapter for the RoL Roadmap developed for 2023-26.
During the meeting, key stakeholders renewed their commitment to advance evidence-based reforms in the rule of law sector with the aim of furthering public trust and confidence in law enforcement institutions in Balochistan.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Zahid Saleem, Additional Chief Secretary Home & Tribal Affairs, Government of Balochistan praised all institutions and departments for their dedication in implementing key reforms under the roadmap. He highlighted the importance of the new five-year chapter, which will build on achievements of the previous phase to continue to strengthen rule of law, effective administration of justice and best practices for the benefit of all citizens, especially the most marginalized ones. He thanked the European Union for its financial support, as well as UNODC for their technical support.
The RoL Roadmap has adapted a results-based methodology to inform institutional decisions and improve system-wide performance. The meeting provided a convergence platform to Rule of Law institutions and development partners to deliberate on the progress of the roadmap. Overall, the results of the first phase report an increase in the conviction rate from 20% in 2019 to 40% in 2023 for serious and violent crimes whilst the number of Under-Trial Prisoners (UTPs) reduced to 11.2% from 1122 in 2019 to 900 in 2023.
For the first time, the representatives of the Balochistan Police, Prosecution, Prisons, Levies, and Reclamation and Probation Departments presented their institutional progress against RoL provincial set targets. Challenges and successes of criminal justice institutions to address fundamental issues through sector coordination were shared. A way forward was also discussed for the implementation of RoLR against PKR 50 million allocated by the Government of Balochistan.
The 6th Steering Committee also highlighted other key successes, including 13.5% increase in forensic case submissions and 1.11% increase in the number of female police officers in Balochistan; 5% increase in persons bailed by the Balochistan Levies Force and training of 135 Levies Investigation Officers including 7 women; Prisons Management Information System (PMIS) installed and functioning in 11 prisons; training of 153 prosecutors comprising of 88% men and 11.1% women participants; MoU signed on 5 September, 2022 between Police and Prosecution Departments to improve coordination and cooperation before, during, and after the investigations; review of the Reclamation and Probation Act and a training on Legislative Drafting.
Present on the occasion, Mr. Sven Ruesch, Team Leader Governance and Education, EU Delegation in Pakistan recalled that good governance, including Efficient rule of law and human rights are among the key policy priorities of the EU - globally and in Pakistan. “The new rule of law roadmap sets important milestones for the Government of Balochistan to actively advance the delivery of justice, peace, and security for its people, particularly women and girls”, he stressed. “We are pleased to support you towards this shared objective.”
In addition to the EU Delegation, representatives from UN partner agencies of UNDP and UN Women were also present.
Ms. Jouhaida Hanano, Criminal Justice and Reforms Advisor from the UNODC Country Office in Pakistan, stressed the necessity for working through a shared responsibility to drive forward results-based change. She thanked the Government of Balochistan and RoL institutions for their steady commitment and the EU for its generous funding for continuing the momentous journey of the rule of law reforms for improved justice delivery to the people of Balochistan.
The meeting concluded with a launching ceremony of the curriculum, comprising of 12 training manuals developed in coordination and consultation with UNODC for the Criminal Justice Institutions of Balochistan. These specialized manuals have been developed and endorsed by the respective CJIs, to bridge knowledge and skills gaps of the relevant RoL Institutions at different levels. The objective is to institutionalize the integration of these manuals in the existing training regime of CJIs, covering the “Training of Trainers” and “Mentoring” phases for the sustainability of the initiative.
Mr. Ziaullah Langau, Minister of Home and Tribal Affairs for the Government of Balochistan, thanked all stakeholders for their contributions, particularly the EU for its financial support and the UNODC for its ongoing technical assistance. He emphasized the Government of Balochistan's commitment to advancing the reforms under the Rule of Law Roadmap, and improving people's lives through peace, security, and justice for all.
The 6th Steering Committee also highlighted ongoing achievements under the EU-funded ‘Deliver Justice Project’, as part of which 5 police stations have been refurbished and converted into Smart Police Stations and a Khidmat Markaz, offering speedy access to policing services for the citizens under one roof. Similarly, the Balochistan Judicial Academy has been resourced with books and research material, and refurbished with furniture, IT support and digitalization, providing the basis for setting up a state-of-the-art Judicial Academy Library and Research Centre.
The Rule of Law Roadmap was initially approved for four years (2018–2022) and expired in May 2022. A recent evaluation of the Roadmap was carried out to inform a revised RoLR to build on the trajectory for another four years (2023–2026) in order to consolidate, sustain, scale up, and institutionalize good practices, and data-informed approaches in the justice sector of Balochistan. Both the evaluation findings and the final RoLR were presented to and endorsed by the 6th Steering Committee. The revised document will be submitted to the Chief Minister of Balochistan to be presented to the cabinet for their approval.

Invitation to cover Agriculture Investment Symposium being organized by FAO in collaboration with ADB & IFC
Pakistan's agriculture sector has been facing several challenges in recent years, including low private investment, lack of access to modern technology and inputs, and limited access to markets. These challenges have contributed to a slowdown in the sector's growth. Therefore, FAO & Government of Pakistan in collaboration with IFC and ADB are organizing one-day Agriculture Investment Symposium aimed to support private investments in the agriculture sector, in line with government vision, SDGs, and Pakistan’s environment and climate change recovery strategy.
The specific objectives of the Symposium are to:
• Provide a platform to partners to present key information on investment opportunities, supporting Pakistan’s priorities and focusing on growth potential of the agriculture sector, including through digital technologies; and
• Facilitate matchmaking to mobilize private sector investment around key commodities.
This event brings together agriculture industry leaders, financial experts, and potential investors to discuss the latest trends and opportunities in the agriculture sector investment. The symposium will cover three topics, cluster based development; leveraging digitalization; adapting to climate change and will be followed by a booth fair and B2B meetings. We are expecting 250 to 300 stakeholders in this event from government, development agencies, private sector and progressive farmers.
The event will be held on February 28, 2023 (09:30 am to 4:00 pm) at Marriot Hotel, Islamabad.
Professor Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister, Ministry of Planning, Development & Special Initiative will be the chief guest at the occasion.

Visit of the Gokina village by the delegation of the Ministry of IT & Telecom and the International Telecommunication Union at the launch of Gokina Smart Village by the Honourable Minister IT & Telecom
The Smart Villagey Gokina pilot project comes under the umbrella of Smart Villages of Pakistan, a nationwide initiative launched by the MoITT in 2021 together with International Telecommunication Union (ITU), USF and Huawei. The official launching of the Gokina pilot took place on 22 February 2023 with the presence of His Excellency Mr Syed Amin ul Haque, Federal Minister, MoITT.
Education– Gokina village has a high school for boys and for girls. However, it was found that there were no science teachers, particularly in girls’ schools, which creates hurdles for students in getting benefits both, in terms of learning as well as competing for the future professional opportunities that science subject’s offer at national and international levels. The project has identified an e-education provider (Tele-Taleem) to bridge this gap.
Health– There is a medical center in the village with limited to no medical services available. The health worker is responsible to provide very basic health advice and services to the community members. It was also highlighted that the biggest challenge in getting access to health services is time consuming as it involves commuting to Islamabad, no emergency services, no doctors and absence of pharmacy etc. The project has identified an e-health provider (Sehat Kahani) to bridge this gap.
In today’s visit on 23 February 2023, MoITT and ITU together with USF, Sehat Kahani, Teletaleem, and IsDB visited the clinic and school and they had direct interactions with the community members, particularly the school girls.
In Gokina Smart Village, e-Learning and e-health services were introduced with community.
Shaiza, a 9th grade student at Islamabad Model School for girls who experienced e-Learning from her class said “I am very happy to learn science subjects through the online classes that are now offered due to these smart classrooms. We never had this opportunity in the past.”
Rania, a nurse who works for Sehat Kahani’s telemedicine clinic said “Sehat Kahani and Smart Village have filled a big gap of access to health services in Gokina. Clinic has already benefited lots of patients. Particularly, we have patients with Gyne patients/women and patients suffering from anemia. Before establishment of this clinic, these patients had to travel long distances for services and medicines and that resulted in further deterioration of their conditions. Now having e-clinic within the community with online access to doctors, these patients are getting quick and accessible health services.”
In her visit to Gokina Smart Village, Atsuko Okuda, Reginal Director of ITU Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific expressed appreciation to all partners and said “We are delighted to witness the concrete benefits of the Smart Village Pakistan and hear from the girls and health clinic staff in Gokina today. We hope that the Gokina pilot is a first step towards accelerated expansion of similar Smart Villages all across Pakistan, as part of ITU’s Smart Villages and Smart Islands initiative”.
Addressing the occasion, Dr. Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava, Director of the Telecommunication Development Bureau (BDT) of ITU stated that “The Smart Villages Initiative will digitally transform remote and rural communities in Pakistan by connecting them with digital services and improve their wellbeing and livelihoods with tech. We at ITU, in the Telecommunication Development Bureau, are proud to see this Initiative which started in Niger scaling up to accelerate inclusive digital transformation of rural villages across the world.”

UNDP - PRESS RELEASE : Ministry of Climate Change and UNDP building a Resilient Pakistan through Early Warning Systems
Islamabad, 14 February 2023— Ministry of Climate Change and UNDP Pakistan held a four-day training, supported by the Green Climate Fund, for government officials and technical teams on assembling, installing, commissioning and operating Early Warning Systems (EWS). The intervention is aligned with the Government of Pakistan and UNDP’s mandate to mainstream environmental concerns into national and sub-national development planning processes.
These Early Warning Systems will be installed in the 24 most climate-vulnerable valleys of Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This initiative, by UNDP’s GLOF-II project, is an important step towards climate adaptation and in building the resilience of communities. For any future climate-induced disasters such as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), these systems will provide timely warning for safe evacuations.
The training was executed by CAE S.p.A, an Italian firm, that specializes in Early Warning Systems. The participants included officials from the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (DMAs), and District Administrations from GB and KP governments; capacitating participants on the operations, architecture, configuration, commissioning, and installation of the systems in the challenging mountainous terrains in the north of Pakistan where the GLOF-II project is working.
The participants were given training in EWS components which comprise of advanced Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), rain gauges, snow depth sensors, water depth gauges, water discharge gauges, data loggers and warning posts. These highly sensitive gauges and sensors will generate data to prompt the relevant authorities for timely preparation and response to climate disasters such as GLOFs.
Ministry of Climate Change and UNDP’s GLOF-II Project is working with relevant provincial authorities and administration on the construction of base platforms in the project valleys. The installation is expected to commence in mid-March 2023 and will continue until September 2023.
GLOF-II project, operating in 16 valleys of Gilgit Baltistan and 8 valleys in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, aims to empower communities to identify and manage risks associated with GLOFs and related impacts of climate change, strengthen public services to lower the risk of disasters related to GLOF, and improve community preparedness and disaster response. The project also supports the development of sustainable options for livelihoods in project areas, with a particular focus on the participation of women in ensuring food security and livelihoods.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE PREVENTION OF VIOLENT EXTREMISM AS AND WHEN CONDUCIVE TO TERRORISM
12 February 2023
Terrorism is an affront to humanity.
It targets people of all ages, cultures, religions, and nationalities.
It undermines the values that bind us together.
And it threatens collective efforts to promote peace and security, protect human rights, provide humanitarian aid, and advance sustainable development.
We must be more vigilant than ever.
Terrorist and violent extremist groups are finding fertile ground on the internet to spew their vicious venom.
Neo-Nazi, white supremacist movements are becoming more dangerous by the day. They now represent the number one internal security threat in several countries – and the fastest growing.
We must act to confront the challenge.
Through prevention, by addressing the underlying conditions that can lead to terrorism in the first place.
Through inclusion, by ensuring counter-terrorism strategies reflect a wide array of voices — especially minorities, women, and young people.
And by placing human rights at the core of all counter-terrorism policies.
Today and every day, let us work together to build more peaceful, inclusive, and stable societies in which terror and violent extremism have no home.

Model Wheat Storage Facility inaugurated in Malakand to enhance wheat supply chain management in KPK
Malakand, 09 February 2023:  – The UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food Department of the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) inaugurated a state-of-the-art model wheat storage facility in Malakand today. The storage facility, which can hold up to 3,000 metric tons of wheat, was inaugurated by the Additional Secretary of Food Department, Government of KPK, Kashif Iqbal Gillani and World Food Programme Pakistan Country Director, Chris Kaye.
The Additional Secretary of Food Department applauded the joint efforts of the Government and WFP, and said, “This facility will act as a model with its improved design and testing facility which we hope to replicate in other areas of KPK given the need for expanded storage facilities in the Province.”
WFP constructed the model wheat storage facility including a training facility, office area and wheat testing laboratory at the request of the Government as part of an effort to strengthen wheat management across the province . The facility will help the food department balance the supply and demand of wheat flour to safeguard the interests of both growers and consumers. The training facility will also help build the capacities of Food Department staff and other partners in areas of wheat storage management.
During the inauguration ceremony, Chris Kaye, Country Director of WFP, said, “WFP is committed to helping strengthen food systems in Pakistan. During the recent floods, it was painfully obvious that much needs to be done to help protect and manage one of Pakistan’s most precious commodities – wheat. Improved storage capacity is a pre-requisite and a systems approach can help bring benefits to farmers and consumers.” Construction of this model warehouse is part of capacity building and strengthening of food departments to build storage infrastructure across Pakistan, he added.
The post-harvest losses are a key concern in Pakistan, primarily due to inefficient collection and handling as well as substandard storage. The additional risk factors such as extreme heat and moisture caused by climate extremes contribute to the challenge.  It was reported that inadequate and poorly maintained warehouses and sub-standard storage facilities resulted in a loss of up to 20% of the 2022 wheat crop in the flood affected areas.
The facility was initiated by WFP together with the KPK Food Department in early 2022 and has been built within the government’s storage compound in Malakand.  The facility expands the storage capacity, allowing  for a wider coverage of wheat supply in the division. It will also help with the overall management of wheat supply across the province in the event of any shortage given its strategic location and accessibility.
The construction of this facility is part of the implementation of WFP Pakistan’s new Country Strategic Plan (CSP) 2023 – 2027. This intervention aligns specifically with CSP Strategic Outcome 3: Pakistan’s food systems are resilient to shocks and support access to healthy and nutritious food by all of Pakistan’s communities 2027.

PRESS RELEASE
World will miss target of ending FGM by 2030 without urgent action – including from men and boys
Joint Statement by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem and UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation
NEW YORK, 6 February 2023 – “This year, 4.3 million girls are at risk of female genital mutilation, according to the latest UNFPA estimates. This number is projected to reach 4.6 million by 2030, as conflict, climate change, rising poverty and inequality continue to hinder efforts to transform gender and social norms that underpin this harmful practice and disrupt programmes that help protect girls.
“Female genital mutilation (FGM) violates the rights of women and girls and limits their opportunities for the future in health, education and income. Rooted in gender inequality and power imbalances, it is an act of gender-based violence that harms girls' bodies, dims their futures, and endangers their lives.
“But we know that change is possible. With just eight years left to reach the global target of eliminating FGM, only collective and well-funded action across a diverse group of stakeholders can end this harmful practice.
“Changing gender and social norms that encourage FGM is critical. Men and boys are powerful allies in the effort. Increasingly they are challenging power dynamics within their families and communities and supporting women and girls as agents of change.
“The UNFPA-UNICEF global Joint Programme on the Elimination of FGM has supported over 3,000 initiatives within the last five years where men and boys actively advocate to bring an end to the practice.
“We are witnessing significant opposition from men and boys to FGM in many countries. In Ethiopia, for example – a country with one of the highest rates of FGM globally – male opposition to the practice is 87 per cent, according to a recent UNICEF analysis.
“This year, on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM, we call on the global community to:
“Today is a reminder of the urgent need for even more targeted and concerted efforts to turn our shared goal of ending FGM into a reality. We must work together with all stakeholders – including men and boys – to protect the millions of girls and women at risk and consign this practice to history.”

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF ZERO TOLERANCE TO FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION
New York, 6 February 2023
Female genital mutilation is an abhorrent violation of fundamental human rights that causes lifelong damage to the physical and mental health of women and girls.  It is one of the most vicious manifestations of the patriarchy that permeates our world.
Some 4.2 million girls are at risk of being subjected to this act of gender-based violence during 2023 alone.  We need urgent investments and action to reach the Sustainable Development Goals target of eliminating female genital mutilation by 2030.
Female genital mutilation is rooted in the same gender inequalities and complex social norms that limit women’s participation and leadership and restrict their access to education and employment.  This discrimination damages the whole of society, and we need urgent action by the whole of society to end it.
Men and boys – brothers, fathers, health workers, teachers, and traditional leaders – can be powerful allies in challenging and ending this scourge, as this year’s theme makes clear.
I call on men and boys everywhere to join me in speaking out and stepping forward to end female genital mutilation, for the benefit of all.
On the International Day of Zero Tolerance to Female Genital Mutilation, let’s commit to social change and strong partnerships to put an end to female genital mutilation once and for all.

Animal Diseases Surveillance System to Improve Livestock Sector in Pakistan
Despite its importance in terms of income, trade, employment, livelihood and nutrition and share in agriculture GDP, livestock sector has not received the attention it deserves. In order to harness, livestock potential and development in Pakistan meaningful collaborations between organizations are required.  Taking a step in this direction Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Pakistan and the Ministry of National Food Security & Research, Government of Pakistan have initiated a Project under Technical Cooperation Program (TCP) to improve the animal disease surveillance system and establish a real-time animal disease reporting system in Pakistan. The announcement was made at a two-day inception workshop held at a local hotel in Islamabad on Wednesday.
In his welcome address, Dr. M. Akram, Animal Husbandry Commissioner, Ministry of National Food Security and Research Government of Pakistan (MoNFSR) said that this collaboration with FAO under TCP is a welcoming step. It is hoped that the feasibility study will be completed in the next six to nine months to establish animal diseases surveillance system in Pakistan. Livestock has a huge potential but we only earn USD 350 million annually in exports. In addition, we cannot meet our local per capita requirements. A majority of the livestock farmers is living on subsistence level and is unable to make livestock a commercial enterprise. Being the custodian of livestock sector in Pakistan, this is a huge challenge for the MoNFSR.  We need to enhance the productivity of our livestock as well as add value to it. Therefore, this collaboration with FAO is a very encouraging. The inception workshop will be the first milestone, as it will allow deliberations from the experts, learn about the existing disease surveillance systems in various provinces, best practices and lessons learned. The valuable suggestions from the participants will steer the feasibility study in the right direction.
Dr. Akram further added that along with the disease surveillance system, regulatory framework is equally important. The Ministry has developed a draft National Animal Health Act in accordance with the World Health Organization guidelines. It will be presented to the workshop participants for review. Their recommendations will be incorporated in the final draft. Later, it will be moved towards legislation. Upon approval, it will be the first document related to animal health at national level.
Dr. M. Afzal, Livestock expert at FAO presented the salient features of the feasibility study and shared that animal disease surveillance is a systematic process of collection, analysis, interpretation and communication of animal disease data for timely evidence-based decision-making, early warning and taking measures for controlling the disease. An accurate and timely reporting of the diseases in livestock is essential for effective disease control and prioritizing the resources required for the prevention and control of these diseases. The project aims at improvement of animal disease surveillance in Pakistan. Under the project we want to assess the current surveillance system through a tool, Surveillance Evaluation tool (SET) that is already in use by many countries in the world. The tool was developed by FAO five years ago. That will assess quality and capacity of existing animal surveillance systems.  Work already done for animal surveillance will also be reviewed. The ultimate objective is to draft an animal surveillance system that is suitable to Pakistan and develop an IT infrastructure for a robust animal diseases surveillance system for real time reporting.
Ms. Florence Rolle, FAO Representative in Pakistan thanked all the participants for attending the workshop and said that FAO has a long history of collaboration with all the stakeholders present at the workshop. It is unfortunate that livestock does not get its share in what it contributes in agriculture GDP of Pakistan. To look into this issue is extremely important for FAO so that the potential livestock has in Pakistan could be utilized fully. The participants of the workshop are experts in the field and FAO has full confidence  in their abilities to make this project a success.
Concluding the inaugural session, chief guest Capt. (Retd.) M. Asif, Additional Secretary, Ministry of National Food Security and Research said that the purpose of the workshop is to know the current animal surveillance system presently working in different provinces, what are the capacities we have, and where we deficiencies. What is the coordination system we already have, where are gaps in this coordination and how we can fill these gaps. Livestock contributes a lot in the GDP but there are some policy gaps that need to be addressed. The most important thing at the policy level is that our thinking should be based on well informed, scientific knowledge based and system from where we could get timely and reliable information. Based on that information we can have our policy interventions to address these gaps and issues. If we do not have a surveillance system, we cannot have access to international markets, or fetch the desired rates. The challenge is that Pakistan has a huge and varied landscape and every landscape has its own livestock, species, and genepool. Because of these different landscapes, habitats, specie and pedigreed animals have different responses to different diseases. If we do not have early warning system and actual information abut the disease, how it effects the animals, how we need to react to that, we will not be able to fight it. Once we have an efficient, reliable and responsive surveillance system, only then we can compete in the international markets and have sustainable livestock for our farmers.
Workshop brought together veterinary and livestock experts from all over the Pakistan.

UNHCR Pakistan launches one-off cash assistance scheme for 1.3 million Afghan refugees
ISLAMABAD, 02 February 2023: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, today launched a one-time cash assistance scheme for some 1.3 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan affected by devastating 2022 floods as well as the prevailing economic situation.
The assistance is being provided, in collaboration with the Government of Pakistan, to reach refugees who are not eligible to access social safety nets available to Pakistani citizens. The initiative is modelled on the Government’s emergency cash programme for vulnerable Pakistani families affected by floods. Registered Afghan refugees will receive up to PKR 25,000, adjusted depending on the family size.
The Minister for State and Frontier Regions (SAFRON), Muhammad Talha Mahmood, and Habib Bank Limited’s Chief Representative, Mr. Mohammad Ali Syed launched the scheme on Thursday with UNHCR’s Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, Mr. Indrika Ratwatte.  Representatives from different donor countries also attended the event.
“We are honoured to work together with our long-standing partner, the Government of Pakistan, through its SAFRON Ministry, as well as Habib Bank Limited — for the first time — to support Afghans affected by the devastating floods and who remain in difficult economic circumstances. This support comes in addition to UNHCR’s emergency flood response for Afghan refugees and affected Pakistani host communities,” said Mr. Ratwatte.
He added “the partnership is UNHCR’s first private sector engagement with the country’s banking system and is a great example of the commitment of the Government and private sector in the country to find innovative approaches to support vulnerable Afghans. I hope this partnership is something we can build on further, including in the lead up to the Global Refugee Forum later this year.”
UNHCR continues working with Pakistan as it recovers from the aftermath of last year’s devastating floods, with a special focus on areas hosting refugees. Some 800,000 refugees live in areas that were impacted by the devastating monsoon.
Muhammad Talha Mahmood, the Minister of SAFRON, welcomed ongoing international support for Afghan refugees and host communities in Pakistan.
“We have generously supported Afghan refugees in our country for over four decades. Even as we face our own challenges, we remain committed to our promise to help. But we cannot do it alone and call for additional international support at this time in line with the global commitment to share responsibility for refugees made under the UN Refugee Compact.”
Habib Bank Limited’s Chief Representative, Mr. Mohammad Ali Syed welcomed the opportunity to team up with UNHCR and the Government of Pakistan to deliver cash assistance.
“Our bank is committed to high standards of delivery and accountability. We are proud to do our part and to demonstrate how our advanced banking system can efficiently deliver this important humanitarian cash assistance to refugees in Pakistan.
Sustained international support for Pakistan is required to find solutions for Afghan refugees, particularly within the framework of the Support Platform for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees. For more information: https://ssar-platform.org/

FAO - PRESS RELEASE : Call for Strategic Partnerships to Build Resilient Communities
Call for Strategic Partnerships to Build Resilient Communities
Islamabad 31/01/23: Impact-based forecasts and warnings are increasingly being used worldwide to communicate the risks and potential impacts of climate-related disasters to the end users, thus enabling anticipatory action planning and reducing the impacts of these disasters. There is a growing understanding, need, and demand for providing scientifically accurate information for people to timely and efficiently respond to risk.
Experts and participants expressed these views during the workshop on “Impact-based Forecasting (IBF) and Anticipatory Action Planning” held on Tuesday at a local hotel in Islamabad. The workshop was organized by Pakistan Meteorological Department, in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)) and Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems for Asia and Africa (RIMES).
The workshop brought together researchers, providers and users of climate information, development practitioners, and decision-makers to review the current use of climate services and discuss the scope of IBF and anticipatory action planning in the country.
The chief guest, Mr. Idrees Mahsud, Member Disaster Risk Reduction at National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) appreciated the contribution of FAO and RIMES to resilience building of Pakistan by partnering with the government departments He said there is a need to strengthen our forecasting capabilities, dissemination mechanisms , and creating an understanding of what forecast and warning means. We still have to make a sound headway and NDMA will continue working towards that. The catastrophe in 2022 has strengthened our resolve of enhancing our national emergency operation system that will not only cater to response but also for resilience, mitigation, and preparedness before the onset of disasters.
While sharing his thoughts at the inaugural session, Mr. Mehar Sahibzad Khan (Director General, Pakistan Meteorological Department-PMD) said that Impact-Based Forecast (IBF) and Anticipatory Action (AA) are emerging topics and there is a need for standardization of these approaches. In this regard, the Pakistan Meteorological Department has been actively making progress from hazard-based forecasting, (i.e. “what the weather will be”), to impact-based forecasting, (i.e. “what the weather will do”). Currently, the IBF approach is being implemented in select districts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with the support of Provincial Agriculture Departments and is expected to be refined and extended to other districts with the passage of time.  It is pertinent to note that the process of establishing viable impact based forecasting systems and anticipatory action planning is reliant on strong collaboration and coordination among the sectoral partner agencies. Collaboration enables greater data collection, the definition of impact thresholds, exposure and vulnerabilities, interpretation of results through experience and information from the relevant partner agencies. The PMD is happy to collaborate with FAO and RIMES and is looking forward to strengthening synergies with the relevant stakeholders. This workshop is the first step in this regard.
In her closing remarks, Ms. Florence Rolle, FAO Representative in Pakistan thanked the participants for attending the workshop and urged upon the need of building strategic partnerships. The more we work in harmony, the better we can achieve our objectives. She said that all actors in a partnership might have different directions; nonetheless, the goal remains the same i.e. to provide timely assistance to people affected by natural disasters. She stressed on the significance of the support of government of Pakistan to FAO’s work and also assured them of FAO’s complete support. However, she also reiterated that government has to act as champions in putting in place mechanisms such as Impact Based Forecasting and Anticipatory Action Planning to protect the community.
Presentations were made by Dr. K J Ramesh (Senior Advisor, RIMES), Dr. Zaheer Ahmad Babar (Director National Weather Forecasting Center, PMD), Dr. Sarfaraz (Chief Meteorologist, RMC, Karachi, PMD), Ms. Asma Jawad (Director National Agro-met Center, PMD), Mr. Damien Riquet (Anticipatory Action Expert, FAO), Mr. Atif Khan (Program Manager, FBF German Red Cross), Mr. Naeem Iqbal (Social Protection and Resilience Specialist, FAO). The presentations focused on steps in implementing IBF and warning services; the importance of building partnerships for IBF and elements of partnerships; best practices for effective communication in disseminating IBF and reducing risks; IBF and warning services implementation process: Case study of Pakistan test pilot.
The presenters stressed the importance of informing and building the understanding of IBF and how it can result in saving lives and protecting livelihoods from adverse impacts of disasters through informed and timely action planning.
The attendees included officers from NDMA, Ministry of National Food Security & Research, Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation & Coordination, SUPARCO, Geological Survey of Pakistan, PCRWR, NDRMF, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), NARC, Agriculture Extension (KP, Punjab), PDMA (KP, Sindh) and Pakistan Red Crescent. Other participants included representatives from ECHO, CEVSI, WFP, UNDP, CARE-ADPC, ICIMOD, German Red Cross, and SUNGI.

The inauguration ceremony marked the commencement of eight-week’s of bulk-carrier search and visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) training courses to be held in Karachi from 30 January to 24 March 2023. These training and mentoring sessions are being conducted under the framework of UNODC’s project entitled ‘Improved National Response against Drugs and Contraband Trafficking in the Maritime Domain’ – funded by the United States State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Pakistan (INL-P). More specifically, five training courses will be delivered by Master Trainers of the PCG, Pakistan Customs, and the ANF – who were trained in VBSS and Bulk-Carrier Search by UNODC in Seychelles and Cape Town, South Africa in 2022. The Pakistani Master Trainers will be mentored by two international trainers of UNODC’s Global Maritime Crime Programme (GMCP). This series of training and mentoring sessions aims to further refine the technical skills of the Pakistani Master Trainers and to also provide training to an additional sixty fresh trainees from the PCG, Pakistan Customs and ANF on boarding operations and vessel search techniques.
While warmly welcoming the participants, Dr. Jeremy Milsom, Representative UNODC COPAK apprised the forum that UNODC had closely engaged with the Ministry of Narcotics Control during the design and implementation of this INL-funded project since October 2020. The project aims to address Pakistan’s priority capacity-building needs in the maritime domain. “UNODC COPAK adopts a holistic approach to support the Government of Pakistan in addressing various drugs and crime challenges, encompassing both domestic and transnational issues. Our ongoing Pakistan Country Programme III (2022-2025) complements the Government of Pakistan policies and programmes, focusing on drug supply reduction, drug demand reduction, rule of law and criminal justice, and counterterrorism. We are also promoting the Government of Pakistan’s regional and international cooperation in these areas”, said Dr Milsom.
Through a comprehensive presentation, Mr. David O’Connell, GMCP’s Programme Coordinator updated the participants about several capacity development interventions by UNODC under the INL-funded maritime security project. He elaborated upon the successful conduct of five VBBS training courses and six Bulk-Carrier Search training courses conducted by UNODC GMCP in Seychelles and South Africa. Seventy-four law enforcement officials (including 12 Master Trainers) of the PCG, Pakistan Customs, and the ANF were trained through these specialized training courses. “This specialized training was based on international best practices on engaging and boarding suspicious vessels at sea or in port and carrying out search and apprehension of drug traffickers and contraband smugglers in compliance with national and international maritime law”, said Mr. O’Connell.
In his remarks, Mr. Liam O’Flanagan, Deputy Consul General of the United States of America’s Consulate in Karachi, thanked Pakistan for making concerted counternarcotics efforts, as one of the main transit countries neighboring Afghanistan. He acknowledged the role played by the ANF and other Pakistani border law enforcement agencies and noted that “there is a need to further enhance Pakistan’s technical capacity – to proactively detect, deter and disrupt drug trafficking”. He also recognized the close partnership between Pakistan and the United States of America against drug proliferation.
In her closing remarks, Ms. Humaira Ahmed – Federal Secretary of the Ministry of Narcotics Control thanked UNODC and the INL for their vision and continuing capacity development, which had previously led to the successful implementation of a series of specialized training courses in Seychelles and South Africa. She highlighted that Pakistan was long exposed to the negative and wide-ranging consequences of the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances from Afghanistan. She stressed the importance of improving national countermeasures, as envisioned in Pakistan’s Anti Narcotics Policy 2019. “Pakistan continues to play a crucial role as the first line of defence for the rest of the world against the massive outflow of opiates, synthetic drugs, and new psychotropic substances from Afghanistan. Given the uncertain political situation in Afghanistan, we strongly feel that there is a need to continue such capacity development initiatives by UNODC and the INL in the future”, said Ms. Humaira Ahmed.
Sixty fresh trainees of the ANF, PCG, and Pakistan Customs will be trained through this 8-Week mentoring session, adding additional tools to the range of skills available to Pakistani maritime law enforcement agencies in working to protect the region and wider international community from the threat posed by illicit drug trafficking and contraband smuggling through Pakistan’s maritime domain.

UNHCR, UNFPA, and UNICEF work together for flood-affected communities
In the aftermath of floods in Pakistan, a strengthened partnership between UN agencies aims to improve the protection environment for vulnerable groups
Islamabad, Pakistan – 30 January 2023: UNHCR, the UN Agency Refugee Agency signed two agreements with UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, and UNICEF, the UN Children’s Fund, to improve the protection environment for refugee and host communities affected by the devastating floods, especially children and women.
The partnership comes at a time when swathes of Pakistan remain under water, including entire villages and farmlands. Thousands have been displaced, while others have returned to find their homes destroyed and key water, sanitation, and health infrastructure non-existent. In Sindh province, some affected communities can only be reached by boat, their continued isolation compounding their needs, forcing families to make impossible choices. Both child marriage and violence against children have increased in some of the most affected districts.
As the climate crisis is ratcheting up, extreme weather is wearing down the resilience of communities in Pakistan hit by repeated disasters, including in terms of protection. Findings from assessments indicate that in the most affected province, Sindh, 85 percent of key informants indicated that their community members do not have knowledge of gender-based violence services, more than 50 percent are experiencing psycho-social distress and 60 percent are not accessing treatment.
“The scale of destruction after the floods is huge, and protection needs among children and women are still growing.” according to UNHCR Representative to Pakistan, Noriko Yoshida. “Together our partnership with UNFPA and UNICEF will strengthen the collective response, as part of UN-wide efforts"
Planned joint activities with UNICEF include the distribution of 250,000 dignity kits for women and girls of reproductive age, child protection activities and mental health awareness raising campaigns and community-based activities, bolstering the capacity of District Child Protection Units with caseworkers and psychologists, in addition to mapping available services in affected communities with a particular focus on survivors of violence for case referrals and adequate response.
UNFPA activities include the distribution of 20,000 dignity kits, establishing and strengthening Gender-Based Violence (GBV) referral mechanisms of cases, setting up and operating women and girls’ friendly spaces to reduce risks and prevent further harm during after the emergency, community mobilization and outreach campaigns for GBV awareness and sensitization among community members, mapping of available services for survivors, enhancing skills of front-line GBV staff assisting communities, as well as lifesaving GBV response services such as health, psycho-social support, case management and referrals for GBV survivors.
“After the devastating floods, women and girls continue to be at risk of violence, exploitation, and abuse. They must be able to access services critical to their health and survival. UNFPA’s priority is to ensure women and girls have access to lifesaving reproductive health and protection services even in the midst of an emergency, said Dr. Luay Shabaneh.
The agreement is expected to continue in 2023 and is aimed to facilitate the transfer of resources from one UN entity to another UN entity to reach the most affected communities under the “One-UN”.

U.S. Embassy funded Improving Rule of Law in Balochistan program successfully executed by UNODC
Islamabad, Pakistan 26 January 2023 – U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome today joined United Nations Office on Drugs & Crime (UNODC) Representative Jeremy Milsom and Balochistan Police Inspector General Abdul Khalique Sheikh to celebrate the successful completion of a $4,578,696 Improving Rule of Law Program in Balochistan, funded by the U.S. Embassy and executed by UNODC. The five-year program commenced in February 2017 and concluded in December 2022. A closing ceremony was held in Islamabad to celebrate the journey and achievements of this important intervention.
In his remarks Ambassador Blome said “Today we recognize the completion of a six-year effort between the United States, Balochistan, and UNODC.  In 2017 the United States was the sole funder for this project, providing $4.5 million for the Improving Rule of Law in Balochistan project. Over the past 75 years, the United States has invested more than a billion dollars to strengthen Pakistan’s civilian law enforcement capacity and keep Pakistani citizens safe.  This has included training for more than 120,000 Pakistani police officers, incorporating international standards for crime response, investigations, and handling of evidence into their courses. We contributed to the construction of over 230 border posts along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. In Balochistan, we have provided over $20 million to purchase bullet proof vests, helmets, and vehicles to enhance law enforcement operations and keep officers safe while fighting crime.”
Ambassador Blome also highlighted U.S. flood assistance, adding “To date, we have committed more than $200 million in flood-response, disaster resilience, and food security assistance.  Our support includes urgently needed food, safe water, sanitation and hygiene improvements, financial help, and shelter assistance.  It also includes work with the Balochistan Police, including replacing police stations destroyed in the floods and providing a new wall and drainage system to better protect the Balochistan Police Training College in Quetta.  We are doing what friends and partners do in times of hardship – support each other.”
In his opening remarks, Mr. Jeremy Milsom, Country Representative, UNODC Country Office in Pakistan highlighted UNODC’s continued support towards improving the rule of law sector in Balochistan. He thanked U.S. Embassy’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) section for its support and appreciated the Government of Balochistan’s collaboration towards strengthening and reforming criminal justice institutions in the province.
The Program aimed to enhance the technical and operational capacity of the Balochistan Police through training sessions on crime scene investigation, forensic examination skills, and the provision of modern equipment. Improved cooperation between police and prosecution for better justice outcome remained a core component of the Program.
UNODC under INL funding equipped the Crime Branch of Balochistan Police with 10 Mobile Crime Scene Units, 2,250 First Responders and 250 Crime Scene Kits, as well as the renovation of Balochistan’s Forensic Science Lab. Furthermore, four Forensic Collection Units to transport evidence were also established. This has been demonstrated by Ms. Jouhaida Hanano, Advisor, Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Program, UNODC during her presentation on program achievements.
UNODC also supported the INL Program in the area of policy reforms and provided technical assistance to Balochistan Police Training Branch in needs assessment and analysis for capacity building. Specialized modules were developed, and 5517 officials were trained on multiple policing functions. Similarly, to improve citizens-state trust, the Balochistan Police, in coordination with UNODC, developed a Community Policing Policy and Plan aiming to enhance citizen trust, police response, and mutual accountability in the prevention and control of crimes, specifically against vulnerable groups.
In his closing remarks, Mr. Abdul Khalique Sheikh, Inspector General of Police Balochistan expressed his profound gratitude to U.S. Embassy’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) “Rule of Law” Program in Balochistan. He said, “These wide-reaching initiatives have made a lasting impact in the lives of common citizens. This program was a perfect arrangement where INL and UNODC extended a helping hand in areas not taken care of by government finances and beneficiaries. I would like to acknowledge and appreciate a successful completion of this five-year program in Balochistan. This has set the stage and created an enabling environment where we have further built on it by adding community policing initiative.” He conveyed his appreciation towards INL and UNODC for their invariable support and further stated that he was confident that this assistance and effort will go a long way in making Balochistan Police more responsive.
The closing ceremony highlighted major successes and the impact of the INL funded program along with challenges and lessons learned.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, a handover presentation of the Forensic Evidence Collection Units was held between U.S. Ambassador Blome and the Balochistan Police.

UNODC
Launch ceremony of Precursor Management System (PMS) – an online portal for registering and applying NOC for importing controlled precursor chemicals, by the industry
25 January 2023, Islamabad - The Ministry of Narcotics launched its newly automated Precursor Management System – an online portal for registering and applying ‘No Objection Certificate (NOC)’ for importing controlled precursor chemicals by the industry. This newly automated system has been technically supported by UNODC, through funding support by the Government of Japan.
The formal launch ceremony was chaired by Nawabzada Shahzain Bugti – Federal Minister for Narcotics Control. Other high-ranking participants included Federal Secretary Ministry of Narcotics Control, Chairman of Pakistan Chemical manufacturers Association (PCMA), and Representative of UNODC Country Office Pakistan (COPAK). Officials from various federal ministries and line departments, senior representatives from the industry and the civil society and international donor representatives also attended the ceremony.
While warmly welcoming the participants, Dr. Jeremy Milsom, Representative UNODC Country Office in Pakistan highlighted that the new web-based Precursor Management System has significantly enhanced capacities of these national authorities – to collect or receive, process, interpret data and approve requests related to import and legitimate industrial use of controlled precursor chemicals – in a more secure and real-time manner. “This technical capacity-building initiative will improve Pakistan’s precursor control regime and improve ‘ease-of-doing business’ for the Pakistani chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Hence, this capacity development has paved the way for attaining objectives of Government of Pakistan’s Anti Narcotics Policy 2019, and our shared aspirations under the provisions of UNODC’s Pakistan Country Programme III (2022-2025)”, said Dr. Milsom.
A comprehensive presentation on the PMS was delivered by Mr. Sabino Sikandar Jalal – Senior Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Narcotics Control. He apprised the participants design and functioning of web-based information management and application processing system, that has replaced manual processing system, focusing public companies’ registration, requests for importing controlled precursor chemicals for industrial use, issuance of ‘No Objection Certificate’, and submission of utilization details of imported controlled chemicals.
In his remarks, Mr. Zafar Mahmood – Former Chairman of the PCMA expressed satisfaction over the newly automated Pakistan’s Precursor Management System. He highlighted that one of the leading objectives of the PCMA was to anticipate, suggest, and respond to Government of Pakistan’s regulatory policy and practices. “The PCMA is committed to attracting new investments and improving Pakistan’s chemical exports. We continue endeavors to achieve competitiveness through sustainable growth and adoption of global best practices, in close coordination with the Government of Pakistan”, said Mr. Mahmood
In her remarks, Ms. Humaira Ahmed, Federal Secretary, Ministry of Narcotics Control highlighted that the newly automated Precursor Management System is a manifestation of Government of Pakistan’s broader vision, to automate the entire process of registration and issuance of ‘No-Objection Certificate (NOC)’ to the chemical and pharmaceutical industry for importing, exporting and utilizing controlled precursor chemicals. “The requests for grant of NOC can now be generated electronically and all steps (including document submission, utilization details and import licenses) have also been automated. It will also significantly improve transparency and trust among the public-private stakeholders concerned”, she said.
In his closing address, Nawabzada Shazain Bugti, Federal Minister for Narcotics Control thanked UNODC for its continued technical support, that led to design and automation of Pakistan’s Precursor Management System. He highlighted that the upgradation is the centerpiece of Government of Pakistan’s modernization drive, and it has greatly contributed towards Government’s long-term goals and objectives. “The Government of Pakistan is committed to strengthening its precursor control regime – in pursuance of our commitments to address the World Drug Problem – under the principle of common and shared responsibility. This upgradation has enabled the Ministry of Narcotics Control in drug regulation, and countering drug abuse and associated health issues affecting the young Pakistani strata, particularly in educational settings”, said Mr. Bugti.
Despite limited resources and technological and research gaps, the Government of Pakistan has been taking concrete measures both at the policy and operational levels. Pakistan’s National Anti-Narcotics Council is chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, that comprises several federal and provincial ministries and law enforcement agencies. Pakistan’s Anti-Narcotics Policy 2019 envisions strong drug demand reduction, supply reduction, and international cooperation. The Policy also envisions to develop an effective drug monitoring and intelligence system – for undertaking necessary supply and demand reduction activities in the affected areas and communities.

Ministry of Human Rights and United Nations Development Programme hold a dialogue on taking forward Business and Human Rights in Pakistan
Islamabad, 24 January 2023 — The Ministry of Human Rights and UNDP Pakistan held a seminar and panel discussion to identify key priorities, drivers, and recommendations for implementing Pakistan’s National Action Plan (NAP) on Business & Human Rights (BHR) in 2023.
At the dialogue, participants discussed best practices for the inclusion of rights-holders, including workers, local communities, and human rights and environmental defenders, in implementing the NAP. Further, the responsibility of the private sector to practice corporate Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) as a means to identify and address human rights challenges across value chains in Pakistan was also emphasised.
Opening the launch, the Director General of International Cooperation Ministry of Human Rights Mr. Muhammad Arshad welcomed stakeholders to the event, which included representatives of the Federal and Provincial governments, the private sector, and civil society. Referring to the need for multi-stakeholder collaboration for implementation of the NAP, Mr. Arshad highlighted, “We are pleased to share that both the formulation and now drafting of the NAP have been an inclusive process. Moreover, for effective implementation, we also need multi-stakeholder collaboration.”
Meanwhile, in his opening remarks, UNDP Assistant Resident Representative Mr. Rana Kaiser Ishaque reflected on the strength of the framework provided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), and remarked, “Through the implementation of the NAP, we can contribute towards achieving several objectives, including fulfilment of human rights, Sustainable Development Goals, and strengthening the competitiveness of Pakistan’s businesses in the global value chains.”
Following presentations by the Ministry of Human Rights and UNDP Pakistan elaborating on their joint initiatives on Business and Human Rights, a panel discussion was held with stakeholders representing the private sector and civil society. Panellists from the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance, Pakistan Textile Council, HomeNet Pakistan, and Special Talent Exchange Program shared their recommendations on practical means to establish HRDD as a common practice in the private sector in Pakistan, both through voluntary and eventually, regulatory means. They agreed that the application of HRDD in Pakistan could significantly contribute toward fulfilling fundamental labour rights and workplace standards, as well as promoting the right to work of marginalised communities.
Closing the launch, Mr. Arshad of MoHR again thanked the participants for taking advantage of this dialogue and sharing their recommendations for fostering a coherent and inclusive approach to the implementation of the NAP across Pakistan.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF EDUCATION
24 January 2023
Education is a fundamental human right.
It’s the bedrock of societies, economies, and every person’s potential.
But without adequate investment, this potential will wither on the vine.
It has always been shocking to me that education has been given such a low priority in many government policies and in international cooperation instruments.
The theme of this year’s International Day of Education reminds us that “to invest in people, prioritize education.”
Investment is critical to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4.
Last year’s Transforming Education Summit gathered the world together to reimagine education systems so every learner accesses the knowledge and skills required to succeed.
Over 130 countries made commitments to ensure that universal quality education becomes a central pillar of public policies and investments.
A Call to Action on Educational Investment and the establishment of the International Financing Facility for Education created a fresh push on domestic and international financing.
And the Summit launched a range of global initiatives to mobilize support for  education in crises settings, girls’ education, foundational learning, transforming teaching, digital tools, and green education systems.
Now is the time for all countries to translate their Summit commitments into concrete actions that create supportive and inclusive learning environments for all students.
Now is also the time to end all discriminatory laws and practices that hinder access to education. I call on the de facto authorities in Afghanistan in particular to reverse the outrageous and self-defeating ban on access to secondary and higher education for girls.
I also encourage countries to place education at the heart of preparations for the SDG Summit in 2023 and the Summit of the Future in 2024.
Most of all, I urge civil society and youth to continue calling for more and better investment in quality education.
Let’s keep the flame of transformation burning.
Let’s deliver education systems that can support equal societies, dynamic economies and the limitless dreams of every learner in the world.

UNICEF - PRESS RELEASE : Pakistan’s rains may have stopped, but children are still dying - UNICEF
Pakistan’s rains may have stopped, but children are still dying - UNICEF
This is a summary of what was said by UNICEF Representative in Pakistan, Abdullah Fadil – to whom quoted text may be attributed - at yesterday’s press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva
GENEVA/ISLAMABAD, 18 January 2023- “The rains have ended; and sadly, to a great degree, so has media attention. And yet 4 million children fight for survival near contaminated and stagnant flood waters.
"With homes destroyed, they are suffering a bitter winter, without decent shelter.
"You will have all seen the images that tell this heartbreaking story: villages turned into islands; children turned into orphans; families still living under scraps of plastic in literally freezing conditions.
"The numbers also tell a story – the story of an ongoing nightmare for the children of Pakistan.
"In the flood-affected districts, about 1.6 million children were already suffering from severe acute malnutrition, while another six million children suffer from stunting, a condition that can cause irreversible damage to children’s brains, bodies and immune systems. Post floods, UNICEF expects this situation to have worsened exponentially.
"Twenty-seven thousand schools have been washed away. And despite the ongoing tragedy, despite all the young lives at stake, UNICEF’s current appeal of US$173 million is less than half funded. This is notwithstanding our work across almost every sector, reaching millions of children.
"Yes, last week, international donors pledged over US$9 billion to help Pakistan recover from the catastrophe. This is a very generous move. But children must be at the centre of recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts.
"Real economic recovery and sustained growth can only be achieved if we make the necessary investments to meet the immediate and longer-term needs of children.
"It is also imperative that we invest in building human capital and resiliency, particularly in rural Sindh and Balochistan where much of the devastation occurred. These vulnerable communities need reliable access to essential services such as healthcare, nutrition, education, protection, hygiene, and sanitation, especially those in remote and underserved communities.
"Pakistan is a known climate hotspot, and it is only a matter of time before another large-scale climate disaster strikes the country’s children. We need flexible funding to double our efforts today; and long-term investment that addresses persistent inequities that girls and boys have faced for far too long. Thank you.”

UNIDO begins Cluster Development Agents training at NIC, NEDUET Karachi
The United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) initiated a six-week Cluster Development Agents training activity under the Poverty Alleviation and Inclusive Development Across Rural Sindh (PAIDAR) programme funded by the European Union (EU). The training at the National Incubation Center (NIC) housed at the NED University of Engineering and Technology (NEDUET) has 30 participants from five selected districts of Sindh (Thatta, Sujawal, Larkana, Tharparkar and Badin) representing community organisations, government representatives and academia.
PAIDAR is a five-year programme, implemented by UNIDO, and funded by the EU. The programme supports the government of Sindh by implementing the economic growth agenda of the Sindh Poverty Reduction Strategy in selected districts and aims to contribute to sustainable poverty reduction by improving the livelihoods of poor communities, including women and youth in Sindh province.
The six-week extensive training covers value chain analysis, business models, research and analysis, and soft and hard skills to enable the participants to become connectors between the communities in Sindh and the PAIDAR programme’s initiatives for entrepreneurship development, local problem-solving, and business opportunities—areas that need immediate support post devastation caused by the recent floods. This training will include taught lessons as well as extensive field work by the participants.
UNIDO international and national trainers/experts will be carrying out the training sessions at NEDUET for a week before the participants start their fieldwork in the selected districts of Sindh.
Badr Ul Islam, National Programme Coordinator PAIDAR while introducing the programme and training to the participants said the Cluster Development Initiative is a successful approach developed by UNIDO that has seen international success and impact as it follows a pro-poor economic growth model that creates opportunities for poor and supports broad-based and inclusive development. He urged the participants to make maximum use of the expertise of the trainers to imbibe knowledge and skills to engage communities better.
Dr Kaiser Bengali, senior economist and advisor on poverty reduction remarked that the training is a good opportunity for all participants to learn the methodology that will enable them to become a link to the community and the programme and help the community to benefit from the programme interventions on poverty reduction. He said that Sindh, through various poverty reduction and business development initiatives, is working to enable economic growth and improve the livelihoods of the people.
Pro Vice-Chancellor, NEDUET, Prof Dr Muhammad Tufail welcomed the participants and the PAIDAR team and said that the NED university is happy to collaborate with UNIDO for this training and other initiatives that can help reduce poverty in Sindh. He informed that the National Incubation Center, housed at NED has enabled some well-known startups and the university looks forward to success stories from the communities that Cluster Development Agents will be engaging with through PAIDAR

Up to 4 million children in Pakistan still living next to stagnant and contaminated floodwater
Up to 4 million children in Pakistan still living next to stagnant and contaminated floodwater
ISLAMABAD, 9 January 2023 – More than four months after a national state of emergency was declared in Pakistan, up to 4 million children are still living near contaminated and stagnant flood waters, risking their survival and wellbeing, UNICEF warned today.
Acute respiratory infections among children, a leading cause of child mortality worldwide, have skyrocketed in flood-stricken areas. In addition, the number of cases of children identified as suffering from severe acute malnutrition in flood-affected areas monitored by UNICEF nearly doubled between July and December as compared to 2021; an estimated 1.5 million children are still in need of lifesaving nutrition interventions.
“Children living in Pakistan’s flood-affected areas have been pushed to the brink,” said Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “The rains may have ended, but the crisis for children has not. Nearly 10 million girls and boys are still in need of immediate, lifesaving support and are heading into a bitter winter without adequate shelter. Severe acute malnutrition, respiratory and water-borne diseases coupled with the cold are putting millions of young lives at risk.”
In Jacobabad, a southern district where many families have little more than mere cloth to cover their makeshift shelters by stagnant floodwaters, temperatures have dropped down to 7 degrees Celsius at night. In mountainous and high-altitude areas, which have also been affected by the floods, snow has fallen, and temperatures have dropped below 0 degrees Celsius.
UNICEF and partners have started providing items such as warm clothing kits, jackets, blankets and quilts, aiming to reach nearly 200,000 children, women and men. In response to the worsening child survival crisis, more than 800,000 children have been screened for malnutrition; 60,000 were identified as suffering from Severely Acute Malnutrition - a life-threatening condition where children are too thin for their height - and referred for treatment with Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF). UNICEF health interventions have reached nearly 1.5 million people with primary health care services so far, and 4.5 million children have been immunized against Polio in 16 flood-hit districts. UNICEF and partners have also provided more than one million people with access to safe drinking water, and one million with hygiene kits. In the months ahead, UNICEF will continue to respond to urgent humanitarian needs, while also restoring and rehabilitating existing health, water, sanitation and education facilities for families returning home.
“As families begin to return to their villages, our response has moved with them,” said Fadil. “Our mobile health, nutrition and water teams continue to respond to immediate lifesaving needs, while we help restore and rehabilitate existing health, water, sanitation, and education facilities, supporting the Government’s efforts in climate-resilient recovery and reconstruction. We know the climate crisis played a central role in supercharging the cascading calamities evident in Pakistan. We must do everything within our power to ensure girls and boys in Pakistan are able to fully recover from the current disaster, and to protect and safeguard them from the next one.”
To provide immediate life-saving support, UNICEF is calling for the international community to urgently provide additional humanitarian assistance, and ensure the timely release of funding to save lives before it is too late. As the world looks to recovery and rebuilding, UNICEF urges countries to prioritize both the immediate and longer-term needs of children through the provision of principled, sustained and flexible assistance that is based on needs and allows for a response and recovery that moves with children as they return home, while building and strengthening climate-resilient infrastructure and services that can reach children and families in need with healthcare, nutrition, learning, protection, hygiene and sanitation services.
UNICEF Pakistan has permanent field offices in all four provinces and has established four hubs to bring UNICEF operations and programmes closer to the hardest hit areas. We have been working with the Government of Pakistan, UN agencies and NGO partners to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable populations in 55 calamity-affected districts, both for displaced populations and those returning to the location of their destroyed villages.
UNICEF’s current appeal of US$173.5 million to provide life-saving support to women and children affected by the floods remains only 37 per cent funded.

پاکستان میں تقریباً  40 لاکھ بچے اب بھی سیلابی پانی کے قریب  زندگی بسر کر رہے ہیں
سیلاب سے متاثرہ علاقوں میں بچوں کی بقا کا بحران بدستور شدید ہے کیونکہ سانس کی بیماریوں اور شدید غذائی کمی  کی شرح میں اضافہ ہورہا ہے
9جنوری 2023:  یونیسف نے خبردار کیا ہے کہ پاکستان میں ہنگامی حالت کے اعلان کے چار ماہ سے زائد عرصہ گزرنے کے بعد بھی تقریباً   40 لاکھ بچے اب بھی کھڑے آلودہ سیلابی پانی کے قریب زندگی گزار رہے ہیں جس سے ان کی بقا اور فلاح و بہبود کو خطرات لاحق ہیں۔
سانس کی شدید بیماریوں کی شرح،  جو دنیا بھر میں بچوں کی اموات کی سب سے بڑی وجوہات میں سے ایک ہیں، سیلاب زدہ علاقوں میں آسمان کو چھو رہی ہے ۔ اس کے علاوہ، یونیسف کی جانب سے مانیٹر کیے جانے والے  سیلاب سے متاثرہ علاقوں میں شدید غذائی کمی کے شکار  بچوں کی تعداد 2021 کے مقابلے میں جولائی اور دسمبر کے درمیان تقریبا دوگنی ہو گئی ہے؛ ایک اندازے کے مطابق 15لاکھ  بچوں کی زندگیاں بچانے کے لیے  فوری طور پر خوارک کی فراہمی کی ضرورت ہے۔
پاکستان میں یونیسف کے نمائندے عبداللہ فاضل نے کہا کہ پاکستان کے سیلاب سے متاثرہ علاقوں میں رہنے والے بچے  شدید ترین خطرات سے دوچار ہیں۔ بارش بھلے ہی ختم ہو گئی ہو، لیکن بچوں کے لیے بحران ختم نہیں ہوا ہے۔ تقریبا ایک کروڑ  لڑکیوں اور لڑکوں کو اب بھی فوری طور پر، زندگی بچانے والی مدد کی ضرورت ہے جو مناسب پناہ گاہوں کے بغیر  ایک سخت موسم ِ سرما   کا سامنا کررہے ہیں۔شدید غذائی قلت، سانس اور پانی سے پیدا ہونے والی بیماریوں کے ساتھ ساتھ سردی لاکھوں نوجوانوں کی زندگیوں کو خطرے میں ڈال رہی ہے۔
پاکستان کے ایک جنوبی ضلع جیکب آباد میں بہت سے خاندانوں کے پاس سیلاب کے پانی کے کنارے قائم   اپنی عارضی پناہ گاہوں کو ڈھانپنے کے لیے معمولی  کپڑے کے  علاوہ  کچھ  نہیں ہے، جبکہ یہاں  رات کے وقت درجہ حرارت 7 ڈگری سینٹی گریڈ تک گر جاتا ہے۔ پہاڑی اور بالائی  علاقوں میں ، جو سیلاب سے بھی متاثر ہوئے ہیں ، برف بار ی ہوچکی ہے ، اور درجہ حرارت صفر  ڈگری سینٹی گریڈ سے بھی  نیچے گر چکا ہے۔
یونیسف اور اس کے شراکت داروں نے گرم کپڑوں کی کٹس، جیکٹس، کمبل،رضائیاں اور دیگر ضروری  اشیاء فراہم کرنا شروع کر دی ہیں جن کا مقصد تقریبا دو لاکھ بچوں، عورتوں اور مردوں تک مدد پہنچانا ہے۔ بچوں کی بقا کے بڑھتے ہوئے بحران کے حل کے لیے 8لاکھ  سے زائد  بچوں میں غذائی کمی کا پتا لگانے  کے لئے اسکریننگ کی گئی ہے۔ 60ہزار بچوں  میں شدید ترین  غذائی کمی  میں مبتلا ہونے کی نشاندہی  ہوئی ہے ، جو ایک  جان لیوا  طبعی حالت  ہے جس میں بچے اپنے قد کے تناسب سے  بہت کمزور  ہوتے ہیں ۔ان بچوں کا ریڈی ٹو یوز تھراپیٹک فوڈ (آر یو ٹی ایف) کے ذریعے  علاج کیا جارہا ہے۔ یونیسف کے صحت سے متعلق اقدامات کے تحت  اب تک  تقریبا 15لاکھ  افراد کو بنیادی طبی امداد پہنچائی جاچکی ہے  اور سیلاب سے متاثرہ 16 اضلاع میں 45لاکھ  بچوں کو پولیو کے خلاف حفاظتی قطرے پلائے گئے ہیں۔ یونیسف اور اس کے شراکت داروں نے دس لاکھ سے زائد افراد کو پینے کا صاف پانی اور دس لاکھ افراد کو حفظان صحت کی کٹس بھی فراہم کی ہیں۔ آنے والے مہینوں میں، یونیسف ہنگامی  انسانی امداد  کا سلسلہ  جاری رکھے گا، جبکہ گھر واپس آنے والے خاندانوں کی مدد  کے لئے پہلے سے موجود صحت، پانی، صفائی ستھرائی اور تعلیم کی سہولیات کو  بحال کیا جائے  گا۔
عبداللہ  فاضل نے مزید  کہا، ’’جیسے جیسے خاندان  اپنے علاقوں کی طرف واپس آرہے ہیں ، ہم ساتھ ساتھ امدادی  اقدامات کر رہے  ہیں ۔ہماری موبائل صحت، غذائیت اور پانی کی ٹیمیں فوری طور پر زندگی بچانے والی امداد کی  ضروریات حل کرنے میں مصروف  ہیں، جبکہ ہم موجودہ صحت، پانی، حفظان صحت اور تعلیم کی سہولیات کو بحال کرنے میں  مدد  کرنے کے علاوہ  ماحولیاتی تبدیلی کے اثرات کے تناظر میں مستحکم  بحالی اور تعمیر نو میں حکومت کی کوششوں میں بھی حصہ ڈال رہے  ہیں۔ہم جانتے ہیں کہ ماحولیاتی بحران نے پاکستان میں قدرتی آفات کو تیز تر  کرنے میں مرکزی کردار ادا کیا ہے ۔ ہمیں پاکستان میں لڑکوں اور لڑکیوں کو موجودہ آفت سےپہنچنے والے  صدمات سے باہر نکالنے  ، اور آئندہ  آفات  سے بچانے اور محفوظ رکھنے کے  لیے اپنی سکت کے مطابق بھرپور اقدامات کرنا ہونگے‘‘۔
یونیسف نے بین الاقوامی برادری سے مطالبہ کیا ہے کہ وہ فوری طور پر اضافی انسانی امداد فراہم کرے اور زندگیاں بچانے کے لیے فنڈز کے بروقت اجراء کو یقینی بنائے، اس سے پہلے کہ بہت دیر ہوجائے ۔ جیسا کہ دنیا بحالی اور تعمیر نو کی منتظر  ہے، یونیسف ممالک پر زور دیتا ہے کہ وہ  اصولی، پائیدار اور مستحکم  امداد کی فراہمی کے ذریعے بچوں کی فوری اور طویل مدتی ضروریات  کو ترجیحی بنیادوں پر حل کریں ، کیونکہ یہ وقت کی  ضرورت ہے ، جس سے  بچوں کی گھر واپسی کے بعد بھی ان کی بحالی میں مدد  ملے گی، جبکہ  یہ امداد  بچوں اور ان کے خاندانوں کی ضروریات کے حل  کے لیے ماحولیاتی تبدیلی  کے اثرات سے محفوظ  مضبوط  بنیادی ڈھانچے اور خدمات کی تعمیر  میں بھی مد د گارہوگی   تاکہ انہیں  صحت کی دیکھ بھال کے  علاوہ  غذائیت، تعلیم ، تحفظ، صفائی  اور حفظان صحت کی خدمات بھی فراہم کی جاسکیں۔
یونیسف پاکستان کے ملک کے  چاروں صوبوں میں مستقل فیلڈ دفاتر  موجود ہیں ، جبکہ امدادی  کارروائیوں اور پروگرامز کو سب سے زیادہ ہونے والے  متاثرہ علاقوں  کے لیے  قابل ِ رسائی بنانے  کے لئے چار مزید  مراکز قائم کیے گئے  ہیں۔ ہم حکومت پاکستان، اقوام متحدہ کے اداروں اور غیر سرکاری تنظیموں  کے شراکت داروں کے ساتھ مل کر کام کر رہے ہیں تاکہ آفت سے متاثرہ 55 اضلاع میں سب سے زیادہ خطرات سے دوچار  آبادیوں  بشمول  بے گھر خاندانوں اور اپنے تباہ شدہ علاقوں  میں  واپس آنے والوں کی ضروریات کو پورا کیا جا سکے ۔
یونیسف کی سیلاب سے متاثرہ خواتین اور بچوں کی  زندگیاں بچانے کے لیے درکار  173.5 ملین امریکی ڈالر کی موجودہ اپیل  کا صرف 37 فیصد حصہ اب تک  حاصل کیا جا سکا ہے۔

UNICEF - PRESS RELEASE : Restricting female humanitarians from working and female students from access to education in Afghanistan is a ‘blatant violation of fundamental human rights’
Restricting female humanitarians from working and female students from access to education in Afghanistan is a ‘blatant violation of fundamental human rights’
Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell
NEW YORK, 26 December 2022 – “UNICEF strongly condemns the recent decree issued by the Taliban de facto authorities banning all female humanitarian workers at national and international NGOs from working across Afghanistan. This decision is a blatant violation of obligations under international humanitarian law and the most fundamental human rights of women in Afghanistan. It comes just days after the decision to ban all women from access to higher education.
“Beyond the egregious roll back of basic rights, these decisions will have far-reaching consequences for the delivery of essential services for children and families across the country – especially in the areas of health, nutrition, education and child protection – areas where female humanitarian workers have an immeasurably important role to play. This includes the programming of UNICEF, through which we provide services to 19 million people, including more than 10 million children, across the country.
“By banning female NGO workers, the Taliban de facto authorities are effectively denying these services to a significant portion of the population and putting the lives and well-being of all Afghans, especially women and children, at risk.
“UNICEF calls on the Taliban de facto authorities to immediately reverse both decisions, on higher education and humanitarian work, and to allow all female students to go back to school and female NGO workers to continue their important work in Afghanistan across the humanitarian sector.”

New York, 27 December 2022
Three years ago this month, the virus that causes COVID-19 was first detected.
The costs have been catastrophic. Millions of lives have been lost, and hundreds of millions of people have fallen ill. Economies were shattered, health systems were stretched, and trillions of dollars were lost. Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals has been thrown off track. And developing countries were often left to fend for themselves, shamefully denied the vaccines, tests or treatments they needed to protect their people.
COVID-19 will not be the last epidemic or pandemic humanity faces. As a global community, we must heed the harsh lessons of COVID-19 and make bold investments in pandemic preparedness, prevention and response.
We need better surveillance to detect and monitor viruses with epidemic potential. We need more resilient health systems supported by universal health coverage. And we need a health workforce that is well-trained, well-equipped and well-paid.
We also need equitable access to vaccines, treatments, diagnostics and life-saving technology for all countries.
And we must fight the scourge of misinformation and pseudoscience with science and fact-based information.
A pandemic cannot be fought country by country. The world must come together.  COVID-19 was a wake-up call.
On this International Day of Epidemic Preparedness, I urge all countries to stand with our efforts to ensure the world is equipped and ready to take on the health challenges to come.

Government of Pakistan and UNHCR open 11 PoR smartcard modification centres for Afghan refugees in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD – The Government of Pakistan with the support of UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has opened 11 Proof of Registration (PoR) card modification (PCM) centres across the country.
The PCM centres located in Peshawar, Quetta, Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Nowshera, Mianwali, Lower Dir, Haripur and Kohat, will serve Afghan refugees who hold Proof of Registration (PoR) cards with an expiry date of June 2023. Run by Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), these PCM centres will update, correct and modify information pertaining to the PoR card holders.
A PCM centre in Islamabad was formally inaugurated by Mr. Gohar Ahmed, the Chief Project Officer for NADRA, Mr. Farid Ullah Jan, Commissioner for Afghan Refugees (HQ), and Ms. Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR Representative in Pakistan. Representatives from the international community attended the event.
Mr. Gohar Ahmed informed that PCM operations have been extended to 11 nationwide sites equipped with 80 counters and 140 IT professionals to serve Afghan citizens more effectively. “By virtue of support from UNHCR and other development partners, PoR cardholders can register their newborn children and obtain a birth certificate,” said Mr. Ahmed.
In addition, as part of services offered by the PCM centres, registered children who turn five years of age can avail of their own PoR card. A PoR cardholder can also obtain a Family Information Certificate including for their unregistered family member recorded during the most recent verification exercise.
Mr. Farid Ullah Jan noted that it was a landmark achievement that the data of Afghan refugees were verified and updated during the DRIVE exercise conducted last year, and extended his appreciation to the donor community for their continued support and the hope that the PCM centres will enable refugees to get swift services in their respective areas.
Speaking on the occasion, the UNHCR Representative underscored the significance of the identity document which grants legal status and protects Afghan refugees from arbitrary detention and deportation during their stay in Pakistan as well as provides access to essential services. “It is important for Afghan refugees to hold updated cards that help ensure access to health, education and other facilities,” she said.
Pakistan hosts some 1.3 million registered Afghan refugees who are holding PoR cards.

Children are not only the future but present of Pakistan
National Consultative Workshop in Islamabad stresses upon elimination of child labour
Islamabad (Wednesday, December 14): A strong common collaboration among all the stakeholders is required to define and achieve the common goal of preventing child labour. Thus concluded ‘National Consultative Workshop on Elimination of Child Labour in Agriculture/Cotton, Textile and Garment Value Chains in Pakistan” held in Islamabad on Tuesday. The workshop was organized by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with International Labour Organization (ILO).
The workshop was held under the “CLEAR Cotton Project: Eliminating child labour and forced labour in the cotton, textile and garment value chains” (2018-2023). The Project was mainly funded by the European Union. Pakistan is among the four countries including Burkina Faso, Mali, and Peru where the CLEAR Cotton Project is being implemented. In Pakistan, the project is being co-implemented by FAO and ILO.
Speaking on the occasion, Ms. Khemphone Phaokhamkeo, ILO Country Director (Officer in Charge) in Pakistan said that fighting child labour is important for ILO and has been a priority since its establishment in 1919. Pakistan has also ratified 36 international conventions including the ones on the elimination of child and forced labour. As a member state of ILO, Pakistan should take steps to respect compliance of these conventions. The issue of child and forced labour in Pakistan requires our attention amongst other on three areas; Firstly, we need to ensure that all children have access to the quality education; not only up to the primary level but till the time they attain the legal age of being eligible to work. Secondly, a healthy, safe and protective work environment must be provided for the youth. Thirdly, poor should be protected under social safety nets and social protection. All adults must be provided decent work so that they don’t have to pull their children into work.
Ms. Florence Rolle, FAO Representative in Pakistan while addressing the inaugural session said that; “Looking at the statistics of the out of school children and stunting rate in Pakistan, we realize that these are the key issues that we need to address. Nonetheless, the question is how? It is often said that children are the future. In my opinion, they are the present. We need to address the present so that they become the future of Pakistan. Almost 70 percent of the child labour in Pakistan is involved in agriculture, therefore, for FAO this is a major concern. The project was first of its kind in Pakistan where we worked with the awareness raising in communities. Child labour in agriculture is not only about children being out of school, but it is also a major health issue as they are exposed to pesticides. FAO through its various initiatives is also trying to increase the outcomes of the smallholder farmers so that the vicious circle of child labour is broken.”  She reiterated that FAO will mainstream the outcomes of this project in all other projects as well. She concluded on the point that “it is always good to forge partnerships so that difficult subjects like child labour are tackled at multiple levels from different angles”.
Mr. Azhar Iqbal Malik, Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, and Human Resource Development and Mr. Syed Khalid Gardezi, Additional Secretary, Ministry of National Food Security and Research, also represented the government and their respective ministries. They appreciated the project for being inclusive by involving all stakeholders to end the threat of child labour.
Mr. Malik said that currently, child labour survey is ongoing. The findings of the survey will help to find the root causes. Meanwhile, the survey is ongoing, government is committed to end child labour.  Articles 11, 25A and 37 of the Constitution guarantee free and compulsory education for all, end of child, forced labour and slavery. Pakistani government has also ratified all the relevant ILO conventions. A strong legal environment is also prevailing at provincial level in forms of various laws. Further to this, we need suggestions for key interventions to scale up our efforts.  Mr. Malik while thanked the developing partners, specially, European Union reassured Government’s fullest support.
Mr. Gardezi appreciated the efforts made under the project. He concluded that Pakistan is seriously committed to achieve the SDG target 8.7 to end child labour by 2025. We are progressing in a right direction. However, we also expect our partners to play a positive role to support us to achieve this end. The issue of child labour requires complete attention and must be addressed with problem solving outlook with the participation of all the stakeholders.
Dr. Ulrich Thiessen, First Secretary, EU Delegation, Pakistan while sharing his thoughts said that child and forced labour fall under the eight ILO core conventions and Pakistan ratified the forced labour convention already since 1957 and child labour conventions in 2001 and 2006. These conventions are also part of the list of 27 international conventions and agreements in the EU GSP+ regulations, which offers tariff and quota free access of the Pakistani exports to the EU market constituting 66% of all exports from Pakistan to EU. Pakistan’s compliance with these 27 international conventions and agreements is also being under EU funded project “International Labour and Environmental Standards Application in Pakistan's Small and Medium Enterprises”” implemented also by ILO together with WWF since 2016. These actions fall under the EU delegation of Pakistan’s priority areas ‘Poverty reduction’ and ‘Green economic growth.
A results oriented monitoring report of 2022 termed the project a well-designed intervention, with good reflection in the country action plans and for addressing the key needs of the target groups and beneficiaries and having a balanced approach. However, it also raised concerns on slow progress and limited anchorage with relevant global platforms on child and forced labour. The report also highlighted the room for improving the flow and meaningfulness of communications on this intervention. It is time for us to reflect on whether or not these concerns are valid or not and to what extend they can be addressed. At the same time, Pakistan needs to work on a global mandatory corporate social security standard for supply chain due diligence which includes child and forced labour in the garment value chains.
Project partners and beneficiaries’ representatives concerned government collaborators, donors and development partners, civil society organizations (CSOs) and other stakeholders relevant to agriculture/cotton, textile, and garment value chains participated in this workshop and presented their achievement as part of clear cotton project across Pakistan

FAO holds validation workshops in Islamabad
Islamabad (Tuesday, December 13) The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recently organized two validation workshop in Islamabad.
First workshop was held on “Agriculture Innovation System (AIS): Assessment Findings and Recommendations” in collaboration with the Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR)  The objective of organizing this workshop was to gather feedback on the detailed assessment results and discuss way forward and finalize road map for the next phase i.e. capacity building.
Assessment of AIS is part of global three-year EU-funded project aimed at strengthening the functional capacities of National Agriculture Innovation Systems with focus on climate-relevant, productive, and sustainable transformation of agriculture and food systems. Detailed assessment of AIS was conducted during September-October 2022 by three-member assessment team comprising of a national consultant and members from Agriculture Extension & Adaptive Research Department, Punjab. Seven innovation case studies of different public sector organizations from federal and provinces were studied in four analytical dimensions i.e., functional, structural, capacity and enabling environment.
All the participants acknowledged the results of assessment and agreed with the recommendations for next phase of capacity building. They also emphasized on the need to prepare action plan for each innovation case study. Project Advisory Committee member recommended to include service and product innovation case studies in specific interventions and also include governance departments as well in training component of capacity building.
Participants also emphasized on the importance of strengthening the agriculture innovation system with the involvement of private stakeholder as it would reap long lasting benefits. Mr. Selvaraju Ramasamy Head, FAO’s Research and Extension Unit (OINR), joined the event virtually and apprised stakeholder on Tropical Agriculture Platform (TAP) and the Global TAP AIS Project.
The event was attended by 25 participants in person and through virtual participation. They included; key officials from Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC), National Agriculture Research Center (NARC), Provincial Extension and Research departments and FAO Office of Innovation (OIN).
The other workshop was held to showcase the investment potential of various commodities to a broad range of stakeholders including; the Government of Pakistan, financial institutions, resource partners and leading private sector companies.
The Hand-in-Hand Initiative (HiHi) of FAO is an evidence‐based, country‐led and country‐owned initiative. The Hand‐in‐Hand Initiative represents a bold step to eradicate poverty (SDG 1) and end hunger and all forms of malnutrition (SDG2) by accelerating agricultural transformation and sustainable rural development.
The Initiative prioritizes countries where national capacities and international support are most limited or where operational challenges, including natural or man‐made crises, are greatest. FAO facilitates in bridging prevailing issues both in terms of strengthening capacities and match making. In 2018, the Government of Pakistan analyzed, selected 33 priority commodities in line with Vision 2025 to identify potential opportunities with detailed feasibility and cost-benefit analysis for each of the commodity. The report on Cluster Development Based Agriculture Transformation also included proposed interventions, strategies and policies to transform the agriculture sector from supply-driven to demand-oriented and to be competitive in the in international markets.
In order to support Government initiative, FAO Pakistan further shortlisted 20 agricultural commodities in consultation with private and public sector stakeholders and updated feasibility studies. As a next step, validation workshop was organized to showcase the investment potential for each of the commodities to a broad range of stakeholders including the Government of Pakistan, financial institutions, resource partners and leading private sector companies.
The participants of validation workshop appreciated the FAO initiative for investment mobilization to accelerate the agriculture sector growth and shared their feedback to further strengthen this initiative. The participants also endorsed FAO upcoming investment symposium which is being planned in February 2023.

International Housing Expo 2022, Pakistan
8-11 December 2022
Building resilient communities through climate resilient housing and sustainable post disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction
UN Habitat in collaboration with Ministry of Housing and Works organized two sessions at the International Housing Expo 2022, Pakistan. The objective was to review the impact of the unprecedented floods of 2022 in Pakistan, identify challenges and actions for achieving climate resilient housing and sustainable post disaster rehabilitation and recovery.  The deliberations were focused on the need to move towards zero carbon housing and adaptation of green building technologies and practices for a sustainable built environment and need for recovery planning and framework. Move towards zero carbon housing in consideration to climate change dimension in development and ensure climate resilience. In the inaugural session, Ms. Sherry Rehman, Minister for Climate Change advocated for resilient housing to reduce climate vulnerability.
The sessions commenced with opening remarks from Mr. Iftikhar Ali Shellwani, Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Works and Mr. Shahzad Nawaz Cheema, Joint Secretary Ministry of Housing. Mr. Iftkikhar Ali Shelwani explained that it is the responsibility of the government to provide affordable housing to the people, but it needed the help of the private sector to achieve that goal. He added that the event held on the basis of the public-private partnership was the right step in that direction. Mr. Shahzad Hassan stressed on the need for immediate actions both on the ground and at policy level to mitigate the disastrous effects of Climate Change.
Experts including Dr. Shoaib Ahmad, Distinguished Professor PIMSAT; Mr. Raja Rehan Arshad, Former Lead World Bank on Disaster Risk Reduction; Ms. Nusrat Nasab CEO AKAH; Mr. Jawed Ali Khan, HPM, UN Habitat; Ms. Mio Sato, Chief of Mission, IOM, Ms, Maggie Stephenson, Recover Advisor, UNOPS; Mr. Shahid Saeed, CEO, Indus Earth Trust; Mr. Fazal Noor, Associate Professor, SSUET; Mr. Mehboob IIlahi, Former Director General, MOCC participated as panelists in two sessions.
Climate Resilient Housing: Need for Replanning
In the session on Climate Resilient Housing, Need for Replanning, Dr. Shoaib Ahmad, Distinguished Professor, PIMSAT as a keynote speaker highlighted vulnerability of Pakistan with respect to climate change and need for climate resilient affordable housing. He emphasized that future constructions must pay attention to flow of water that destroy housing every 4-5 years and government must prohibit construction in low lying areas. Building codes should be adopted at all levels. We now must build what lasts longer, and for that its important that the reconstruction and rehabilitation is compatible with local conditions, and it must take the local need scenarios into the consideration.
The panellists emphasized that it is needed to move towards resilient and zero carbon housing and incentives must be provided to private sector in order to have sustainable housing, they also need to be part of planning. Panellists also raised concerns on raising voices of rural communities who are facing challenges for affordable housing, so there is a need to include their concerns in the planning. Engage community specially women in the building climate resilient housing.
It was recommended that the opportunity offered by the post flood construction in Pakistan may be availed to revitalize zero carbon and low cost indigenous materials and vernacular construction techniques. The informal settlements are regularized and upgraded. Recovery and Reconstruction without reforms may prove to be unsustainable. This process as a first stage should involve setting up standards and institutional arrangements through broad based consultation for reconstruction with the objective of achieving climate resilient housing. To support this initiative, mapping of indigenous materials, especially zero carbon low cost construction materials is important.
Sustainable Post Disaster Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
In the session on Sustainable Post Disaster Rehabilitation and reconstruction, Mr. Raja Rehan Arshad, Senior Advisor, World Bank as a key note speaker urged on taking the disasters as an experience and learning opportunity to Build Back Better by identifying the gaps, and loopholes, which can be used to improve the national response system. The panellists emphasized that there is need for operational reforms and not major reforms​ and prioritizing people-cantered socio-economic recovery​ and also outcome based planning instead of sector based​ planning. Building back stronger and faster will reduce well-being losses by ensuring that reconstructed infrastructure can resist more intense events in the future.​
It was highlighted to ensure that post-disaster support reaches all affected population groups. This emphasizes the importance of providing reconstruction support to low-income households, which are typically more exposed, more vulnerable, and less comprehensively supported.​ Further, it was deliberated that building financing mechanisms that fast disburse affordable, low-interest financing to businesses affected by the disasters.
It was also stressed the importance of the Right Base Approach in post-disaster assessment phases, which is conscious and systematic integration of rights and right principles into the core steps of the work which is done during the disaster response, which can range from the identification of all right holders and then strengthening their capacity to claim their rights and to the duty bearers who bear the obligation to reach back and protect, ensure these rights.
Gender based recovery was also supported by providing gender-specific support for reconstruction and recovery, so that the differing needs of women and men are met. Use recovery as an opportunity to bridge the gender-resilience gap. Women may be more vulnerable to the impact of disasters; gender-specific support has the capacity to improve future resilience. The post-disasters investments we make must not only be materialistic investments but also the investment in people. We must mainstream the considerable talent from all age groups to not only solve our issues but also to utilize their unutilized potential in a constructive way.
The Chief Guest Federal Minister for Law and Justice, Mr. Azam Nazir Tarar stressed the need to implement the existing laws to transform the ideas into reality. The Chief Guest concluded the session with an urge to make the cities better, sustainable, and livable for the current as well as the generations to come.

UNHCR supported exhibition brings together female artists from Pakistan and Afghanistan
The painting exhibition to mark 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, displayed artworks created by refugee and Pakistani women aimed at highlighting the importance of safe space
ISLAMABAD - Seven Pakistani and Afghan refugee artists showcased their art in a three-day exhibition held between 8 and 10 December, organized by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency at the Pakistan National council of Arts (PNCA) in Islamabad.
The public exhibition, organised to mark 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, tells the stories of talented women from all over Pakistan to advocate for gender equality, and strengthen the link between local and international action to end violence against women, through their paintings.
Diana, an artist from Afghanistan, explained the dreams of women in her country through her pieces. “In these paintings called “safe space”, I show myself flying, where my arms symbolize my abilities and strength to reach my goals,” she added.
At the launch ceremony, UNHCR Deputy Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Tammi Sharpe underscored that over 43 million forcibly displaced and stateless women and girls face heightened risk of gender-based violence. “Across the world, women and girls are bearing the brunt of wars,” she said. She said that beyond women’s economic empowerment, we must strive for a world where women can live without fear of violence.
Women and girls also face higher risks and greater burdens from the impacts of climate change, including the devastating floods witnessed in Pakistan this year.
The 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence Campaign, which runs annually from 25 November to 10 December, is intended to generate awareness, and mobilize action to prevent gender-based violence (GBV). The focus of years theme “Activism to End Violence against Women and Girls”, is aimed at the prevention of GBV, mobilizing public support, amplifying the voices of diverse feminist women’s movements, increasing long-term, sustainable and flexible funding for girl-led and women’s rights organizations, strengthening of protection mechanisms and promoting the leadership of women and girls.
UNHCR in Pakistan provides assistance to survivors and promotes activities for prevention, and risk mitigation of gender-based violence, thanks to the generous contribution of the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), France, Italy, Japan, Netherlands and other committed donors from the private sector including Novo Nordisk.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON HUMAN RIGHTS DAY
NEW YORK, 10 DECEMBER 2022
The world is facing unprecedented and interlocking challenges to human rights.
Hunger and poverty are increasing – an affront to the economic and social rights of hundreds of millions of people.
Civic space is shrinking.
Media freedom and the safety of journalists are in dangerous decline in almost every region of the world.
Trust in institutions is evaporating, especially among young people.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased levels of violence against women and girls.
Racism, intolerance and discrimination are running rampant.
New human rights challenges are emerging from the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.
And we are only beginning to grasp the threat posed to human rights by some new technologies.
These trying times call for a reignition of our commitment to all human rights - civil, cultural, economic, political and social.
The Call to Action I launched in 2020 positions human rights at the centre of solutions to the challenges we face.
This vision is reflected in my report on Our Common Agenda, which calls for a renewed social contract, anchored in human rights.
The 75th anniversary of the landmark Universal Declaration on Human Rights next year must be an opportunity for action.
I urge Member States, civil society, the private sector and others to put human rights at the heart of efforts to reverse today’s damaging trends.
Human rights are the foundation for human dignity, and the cornerstone of peaceful, inclusive, fair, equal and prosperous societies.
They are a unifying force and a rallying cry.
They reflect the most fundamental thing we share – our common humanity.
On this Human Rights Day, we reaffirm the universality and indivisibility of all rights, as we stand up for human rights for all.

Today is a day to remember and pay tribute to the victims and survivors of genocides across the world. It is a day to reexamine our collective failure to prevent this crime in the past, and to redouble prevention efforts for the present and the future.
More than 70 years after the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the threat of genocide remains present in many places around the world. Discrimination and hate speech, the early warning signs of genocide, are on the rise everywhere.
We must do more to promote strong political leadership and resolute action against these dangerous trends. We must do more to live up to our commitment to liberate humanity from the scourge of genocide.
I recently visited Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where I had the privilege of meeting survivors of atrocity crimes.
Their moving testimony was a forceful reminder of the individual suffering, pain and horror of genocide and atrocity crimes.
I call on every Member State to take concrete steps to protect communities at risk, including minorities, and address discrimination and persecution.
States have the primary obligation for preventing genocide, but religious and community leaders, civil society, the private sector and the media – including social media platforms, play an essential role.
On this International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide, I urge all stakeholders to use all means at their disposal to prevent and end this crime.

International Day Against Corruption
9 December 2022
Corruption threatens our security.
It drives organized crime.
It corrodes our economy.
It crushes opportunities for development.
And it traps people in cycles of inequality and poverty.
On International Anti-Corruption Day, and every day, we can all act to stop corruption.
And we must.
Because our communities are losing out on trillions of dollars and countless opportunities.
As we face growing financial uncertainty, escalating conflicts, and climate disasters, it is more important than ever to end corruption.
UNODC is responding. This year we established our first ‘anti-corruption’ regional hubs in Africa and Latin America, to bring our assistance and expertise closer to the point of delivery.
We have enhanced our cross-border cooperation through the GlobE Network, with membership of 127 entities from 69 countries, and we have teamed up with the World Bank to bolster asset recovery efforts around the globe.
In times of emergencies, it is critical to have anti-corruption safeguards in place.
COVID-19 response and recovery efforts highlighted that with significant amounts of money come significant risks.
Anti-corruption efforts will prove essential to safeguard climate finance and to ensure that the green transition is not undermined by corrupt practices.
Youth and children have the most at stake. Bolstering anti-corruption education is central to our work to connect, engage and empower the next generations. This includes working to help shield sports from corruption.
As the guardian of the UN Convention against Corruption, we support over 185 countries to cooperate and take action to fight corruption. Next year, the Convention celebrates its 20th anniversary.
It is an opportunity to double global efforts to tackle corruption and ensure integrity across the board and around the world.
FAO Marks Emergency Response Plan Completion
Islamabad ( Friday, 2 December): Under the Project ‘Livelihood and Food Security Improvement Fund for the Flood Affected Areas of Pakistan’ funded by USAID, Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO), provided Rabi assistance packages to the most vulnerable farmers. These packages included certified wheat seed bags and fertilizers (UREA and DAP). A total of 65,115 households, including women headed households, were provided assistance in all four provinces of Pakistan.
An event was held at National Agriculture Research Council (NARC) on Thursday to mark the completion of the Flood Emergency Response Plan. Ambassador Donald Blome, Embassy of United States of America, Pakistan was the chief guest while Mr. Zafar Hassan, Federal Secretary for Ministry of Food Security and Research spoke on behalf of the Ministry.
Speaking on the occasion, Ms. Florence Rolle, FAO Representative in Pakistan) said that Flood Emergency Response Plan; including selection of beneficiaries, procurement and distribution was completed in a record time of two months that is a huge achievement for FAO.  Ms. Florence said that we faced many challenges, but with strong collaboration with all stakeholders including government agriculture departments, smallholder farms, USAID, all suppliers and vendors, the emergency response plan was completed in time. This is an example of how stronger collaborations can help in the development of the agriculture sector in Pakistan. She thanked USAID and also other donors like EU, ECHO, JICA, and Japan for helping in executing the emergency response plan. She said that there is still need to do more and hoped that the event will result in more synergies and collaborations.
H.E Ambassador Donald Blome expressed concern on the immense loss of life, livestock and infrastructure and said that this has been an extraordinarily difficult year for Pakistan. He further added that USA is very proud to be a part of the rehabilitation process of flood affectees. Apart from that, USA has a long history of helping Pakistan in agriculture development in the form of green revolution, improving agricultural lands, water management, and upgradation of agricultural universities, irrigation systems restoration, and water storage platforms. USA has also played a major role in the electrification of Pakistan. The Ambassador said that together both the countries have accomplished so much and he hopes to continue that. USA will continue to help Pakistan under the Green Alliance Framework with renewed focus on the nexus of water, agriculture and energy. To achieve that USA will facilitate public and private investments. He appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to making required changes to face the challenges of climate change to build a sustainable future.
Mr. Zafar Hassan, Secretary National Food Security and Research, said that Pakistan has experienced the worst floods in its history. The country has faced economic loss of around USD 30 billion. The year has not been good for the agriculture sector. He said that the government is grateful to FAO and USAID for their support and assistance but added that we cannot always look up to donor agencies for help. The COP27 conference was a major breakthrough in pushing for global financing for calamities. However, he said that we can only survive if we work on self-reliance and self-sustainability. Mr. Zafar emphasized on promoting better ways of agriculture, producing better seeds, and providing better education for farmers. He congratulated Ms. Florence Rolle for leading the efforts of relief assistance and making it a success story.
Eight beneficiary farmers (two from each province) were also invited to the event. They shared their account of the losses and challenges they faced during and after the floods. They appreciated the provision of assistance packages which saved them from borrowing more money for purchase of wheat seeds and fertilizers. They said that the use of fertilizers will increase crop production and allow them to put food on their tables for almost a year.
In the end a field demonstration was arranged to show the American Ambassador the traditional methods of sowing practiced by majority of the farmers in Pakistan, while climate smart agriculture technologies developed at NARC were also shown to motivate the farmers to adopt latest techniques and technologies.
Dr. Ghulam Mohammad Ali, Chairman Pakistan Agriculture Research Council , Dr. Shahzad Asad, Director General NARC, senior government officials, donors and media representatives also participated in the event.

UNESCO, Geological Survey of Pakistan and Stakeholders highlighted the importance of Geoscience and Geological Heritage
Islamabad, 07 December- Earth Sciences provide us with invaluable knowledge about our planet, its systems and its 4.6-billion-year history. This knowledge is essential for responding to present-day challenges of human society, such as preserving our Earth’s resources for future generations, mitigating the impact of global warming and risks of geological hazards. To highlight the geological heritage of Pakistan, Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP) is looking forward to collaborating with UNESCO’s International Geoscience and Geoparks Programme (IGGP) to formulate strategies to promote geo-tourism in the country. Geo-tourism will promote important geological sites while conserving natural, cultural, and geological heritage.
In this regard, UNESCO and Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP) organized a consultation meeting on 07th December, 2022 at Islamabad. Representatives of federal and provincial government organizations as well as academia participated in the event.
In his welcome remarks, Dr. Sajjad Ahmad, Director General of GSP, highlighted the importance of preserving the unique geological features of international importance and geo-heritage of the country combined with tourism as Geotourism. Geoparks are believed to represent the paleo-geological as well as paleo-environmental record of a region and provide an insight to the appropriate use of natural resources.
Dr. Youssef Filali-Meknassi, Director UNESCO Islamabad in his remarks elaborated that Geoparks and tourism together provide an important spectrum that may help in promotion of the tourism industry in Pakistan. It can help to develop policies and plans to conserve the unique geological features of international importance and geological heritage of the country.
Mr. Hassan Mahmood Yousafzai, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division), in his remarks extended full support for the UNESCO’s International Geoscience and Geoparks Programme in Pakistan and assured that Ministry would extend its full support for the GSP planned activities. The development of geoparks will bring improvement in the economic and social scetor of the country. It will boost geotourism and will provide friendly environment for the researchers, community and tourists.
Capt. Rtd. Shehbaz Tahir Nadeem, Joint Secretary Development, Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division), in his concluding remarks appreciated GSP for its role and interest in establishing the IGGP Programme in Pakistan.
Director General GSP Dr. Sajjad Ahmad in his concluding remarks said that two subcommittees comprised of relevant Government Organizations and researchers will be announced very soon followed by a National Committee on IGGP to launch and implement the Programme in Pakistan.
Substantive deliberations will lead in formulation of a roadmap for the geoscience research and geoparks programme in Pakistan. There was consensus on the fact that there is a lot of potential in the country to promote its geological heritage such as Salt Range, Margala Hills National Park, Triple junction of three mightiest mountain ranges at Juglot, Khunjrab National Park, Chundargup mud volcanoes in Hingol National Park and Nagarparkar area Sindh.

As we commemorate the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, we need to recognize that the legacy of the transatlantic trade of enslaved Africans reverberates to this day, scarring our societies and impeding equitable development.
We must also identify and eradicate contemporary forms of slavery, such as trafficking in persons, sexual exploitation, child labour, forced marriage and the use of children in armed conflict.  The latest Global Estimates of Modern Slavery on forced labour and forced marriage reveal that, in 2021, some 50 million persons were thus enslaved, and this number has been growing.
The most marginalized groups remain particularly vulnerable, including ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, migrants, children and persons with diverse gender identities and sexual orientations.  The majority of these vulnerable persons are women.
On this International Day, I call on Governments and societies to recommit to eradicating slavery.  Increased action needs to be taken with full participation of all stakeholders, including the private sector, trade unions, civil society and human rights institutions.  I also urge all countries to protect and uphold the rights of victims and survivors of slavery.

This year’s International Day of Persons with Disabilities shines a light on the role of innovation in fuelling an accessible and equitable world.
Our world is confronting a cascade of crises that are disproportionally impacting persons with disabilities.
We need transformative solutions to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals and leave no one behind.
This requires greater public-private sector collaboration to develop strategies for, with and by persons with disabilities.
The cornerstone of this cooperation must be the active participation of persons with disabilities in their full diversity, and their full inclusion in all decision-making processes.
Innovation and technology can be powerful tools for inclusion.
They can enhance access to information, education, and lifelong learning. And they can open new avenues for persons with disabilities to participate in the workforce and society at large on an equal basis.
But to realize the promise of technology we must close the digital divide and safeguard human rights in the digital space.
For our part, the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy presents a concrete road map to advance disability inclusion and accessibility across the work of the Organization.
From headquarters to the field, we are working to assess, address and promote digital accessibility and lead by example on disability inclusion.
On this day and every day, let us work together in finding innovative solutions to build an accessible and equitable world for all.

HIV prevention and treatment progress for children, adolescents, and pregnant women nearly flat over past few years – UNICEF
Unprecedented stagnation comes on top of an existing and growing gap in treatment between children and adults.
NEW YORK, 28 November 2022 – Around 110,000 children and adolescents (0-19 years) died from AIDs-related causes during 2021, according to the latest UNICEF global snapshot on children and HIV and AIDS. Meanwhile, another 310,000 were newly infected, bringing the total number of young people living with HIV to 2.7 million.
Ahead of World AIDS Day, UNICEF warns that progress in HIV prevention and treatment for children, adolescents, and pregnant women has nearly flatlined over the past three years, with many regions still not at pre-COVID-19 service coverage. This comes on top of an existing and growing gap in treatment between children and adults.
“Though children have long lagged behind adults in the AIDS response, the stagnation seen in the last three years is unprecedented, putting too many young lives at risk of sickness and death,” said UNICEF Associate Chief of HIV/AIDS Anurita Bains. “Children are falling through the cracks because we are collectively failing to find and test them and get them on life-saving treatment. Every day that goes by without progress, over 300 children and adolescents lose their fight against AIDS.”
Despite accounting for only 7 per cent of overall people living with HIV, children and adolescents comprised 17 per cent of all AIDS-related deaths, and 21 per cent of new HIV infections in 2021. Unless the drivers of inequities are addressed, UNICEF warns, ending AIDS in children and adolescents will continue to be a distant dream.
However, the snapshot points out that longer-term trends remain positive. New HIV infections among younger children (0-14 years) dropped by 52 per cent from 2010 to 2021, and new infections among adolescents (15-19 years) also dropped by 40 per cent. Similarly, coverage of lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) among pregnant women living with HIV increased from 46 per cent to 81 per cent in a single decade.
While the total number of children living with HIV is on the decline, the treatment gap between children and adults continues to grow. In UNICEF HIV-priority countries, ART coverage for children stood at 56 per cent in 2020 but fell to 54 per cent in 2021. This decline is due to several factors including the COVID-19 pandemic and other global crises, which have increased marginalisation and poverty, but is also a reflection of waning political will and a flagging AIDS response in children. Globally, an even lower percentage of children living with HIV had access to treatment (52%), which has only marginally increased over the past few years.
Meanwhile, coverage among all adults living with HIV (76%) was more than 20 percentage points higher than among children. The gap was even larger between children and pregnant women living with HIV (81%). Alarmingly, the percentage of children between the ages of 0-4 years living with HIV and not on ART has been rising over the past seven years, climbing to 72 per cent in 2021, as high as it was in 2012.
Many regions – Asia and the Pacific, the Caribbean, Eastern and Southern Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa, and West and Central Africa – also experienced drops in treatment coverage in pregnant and breastfeeding women during 2020, with Asia and the Pacific and the Middle East and North Africa seeing further declines in 2021. Except for West and Central Africa, which continues to see the highest burden of mother-to-child transmission, none of the aforementioned regions have recovered to the coverage levels achieved in 2019. These disruptions put the lives of newborn babies at increased risk. In 2021, more than 75,000 new child infections occurred because pregnant women were not diagnosed and initiated on treatment.
“With renewed political commitment to reaching the most vulnerable, strategic partnership and resources to scale up programmes, we can end AIDS in children, adolescents and pregnant women,” said Bains.

PRESS RELEASE
Time to vow to end VAW (violence against women)
Islamabad, November 25, 2022: Violence against women is one of the most prevalent human rights violation across the globe. It is a life-threatening health and protection issue. 32 per cent of women have experienced violence in Pakistan. Half of these women never sought help or told anyone about the violence they had experienced. Statistics are not believed to paint a full picture of pain and loss, the stories of survivors do.
Gender-based violence takes many insidious forms in the real world to online platforms including physical, sexual, psychological and digital violence. Any form of violence affects survivors’ physical and mental health, may cause anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or behaviors, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Survivors may lose their sense of individuality, dignity, or self-worth.
One of the most prevalent forms of violence these days is digital violence or virtual abuse of women and girls. Digital violence includes online sexual harassment, cyberbullying and non-consensual use of images and video. Globally, 85 percent of women reported witnessing digital violence, and nearly 40% have experienced it personally. Hate and devaluation of women online cause long-term psychological, emotional and physical distress. According to global statistics, nine out of ten women (92%) report that online violence harms their sense of well-being and over a third (35%) have experienced mental health issues due to online violence. Digital violence impacts professional and economic livelihoods of women and girls who depend on online and social media spaces.
Women and girls have the right to feel safe in all spaces, wherever they are. On the day International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, 16 Days of Activism against Violence against Women have been initiated. It is time for everyone to reflect on how to end gender-based violence. UNFPA is working hard with other partners on the campaign by raising awareness, mobilizing advocacy and inspiring action to end gender-based violence, child marriage and other harmful practices.
UNFPA works hard to end gender-based violence by 2030 through empowering women and girls with information about their bodies and rights; and engaging men and boys to change the attitudes with information on why gender-based violence is harmful. UNFPA also supports the system to help survivors of GBV access medical care, legal services, and psychosocial support and advocates for strong legal protections for survivors of violence.

MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF SOLIDARITY
WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE
29 November 2022
We commemorate the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People at a time of diminished hope for peace.
I am deeply saddened by the growing number of Palestinian civilians who have lost their lives in the spiral of violence engulfing the occupied West Bank. Each casualty fuels fear and yet more violence. I urge all parties to take immediate steps to reduce tensions and break this deadly cycle.
The long-standing drivers of conflict – including the ongoing occupation, settlement expansion, home demolitions and evictions – heighten anger, despair, and hopelessness.
Meanwhile, Gaza continues to endure debilitating closures and humanitarian crises. I reiterate my call on the parties to engage to end the closures of Gaza and improve living conditions of all Palestinians.
UNRWA remains a vital lifeline for Palestine refugees.
I commend the donors for their support and urge all to step up and provide predictable and sufficient funding to enable UNRWA to fully deliver on its mandate.
The United Nations’ position is clear: peace must advance – the occupation must end.
We are steadfast in our commitment to realize the vision of two States – Israel and Palestine – living side by side in peace and security, with Jerusalem as the capital of both States.
Together, let us reaffirm our support to the Palestinian people in their quest to achieve their inalienable rights and build a future of peace, justice, security, and dignity for all.

PRESS RELEASE
WFP and its partners embark on the New Strategic Plan to address Pakistan’s food security and nutrition needs
Islamabad, 23 November 2022: The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Pakistan launched its new Country Strategic Plan (CSP) 2023-2027, which marks WFP’s progressive shift from its traditional role as a provider of food assistance to a provider of support for inclusive and equitable national policy and capacity development.
Mr. Chris Kaye, Country Director of WFP Pakistan, presented the new CSP at the Executive Board Meeting in Rome, Italy, and said, “Building on the broad consultations with stakeholders and benefitting from the evaluation of the current CSP, WFP formulated the new CSP by putting the partnership with the government at the center of its interventions.”
He added; “The work of WFP in Pakistan over the next five years will encompass livelihoods, social protection, food systems, and humanitarian response”. The strategic plan comes at a critical time when the country is reeling from the devastating impacts of the floods, disrupting the lives and livelihoods of millions. Mr. Kaye further said that the current needs and response to the flood emergency in Pakistan underpin the need for investment in strengthening the country’s resilience to climate change, supporting access to nutritious food, and reinforcing food systems.
The four strategic outcomes of the CSP underscore WFP’s increasing focus on enabling and supporting national and provincial institutions to address the country’s food security and nutrition needs. Also, the outcomes will promote equal access to resources, prepare for and respond to emergencies, and build resilience to confront the challenges posed by climate change and other shocks.
The Federal Minister of Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety of Pakistan, Ms. Shazia Atta Marri, recognized the longstanding partnership of WFP with the Government of Pakistan in her remarks at the Executive Board meeting and said, “WFP’s CSP provides a vision which is aligned with the priorities of the Government, both at the federal and provincial levels.”
She highlighted the mutual trust and accountability between the two partners, with specific reference to implementation of the large-scale stunting prevention programme, the ‘Benazir Nashonuma Programme’. The programme is one of the most innovative and comprehensive efforts of any Government to tackle stunting in South-East Asia.
“We recognize the competence and professionalism of WFP to help implement a technical programme that will have a lasting impact not only on the future of women and children, but also on the communities and the country as a whole,” Minister Marri added.
The new CSP was approved by WFP’s Executive Board in Rome and will come into effect from January 1, 2023.

About WFP
WFP is the world's leading humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide, delivering food assistance in emergencies and working with communities to improve nutrition and build resilience. Each year, WFP assists some 80 million people in around 80 countries.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, 25 November 2022
Violence against women and girls is the most pervasive human rights violation in the world.
Every 11 minutes, a woman or girl is killed by an intimate partner or family member — and we know that other stresses, from the COVID-19 pandemic to economic turmoil, inevitably lead to even more physical and verbal abuse.
Women and girls also face rampant online violence, from misogynistic hate speech, to sexual harassment, image abuse and grooming by predators.
This discrimination, violence and abuse targeting half of humanity comes at a steep cost. It limits women’s and girls’ participation in all walks of life, denies their basic rights and freedoms, and blocks the equal economic recovery and sustainable growth our world needs.
Now is the time for transformative action that ends violence against women and girls.
This means governments designing, funding and implementing national action plans to tackle this scourge.
It means involving grassroots and civil society groups at every stage of decision-making.
It means ensuring that laws are implemented and respected, so survivors see their rights to justice and support upheld.
It means supporting public campaigns that challenge patriarchal norms and promote different forms of masculinities that reject misogyny and violence.
And as this year’s theme — “UNITE: Activism to End Violence Against Women and Girls” — reminds us, it means standing with activists around the world who are calling for change and supporting survivors of violence. I call on governments to increase funding by 50 per cent to women’s rights organizations and movements by 2026.
Let’s take a stand and raise our voices in support of women’s rights.
Let’s proudly declare: We are all feminists.
Let’s consign violence against women and girls to the history books.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON AFRICA INDUSTRIALIZATION DAY
20 November 2022
Countries across Africa are facing a perfect storm: armed conflicts, rising food and energy insecurity, skyrocketing inflation and debt, shrinking fiscal space, and mounting climate catastrophes.
Yet despite these challenges, Africa includes some of the world’s fastest growing economies with the potential to lead in the global energy transition.
Strengthened public-private partnerships and multilateral cooperation are needed to advance inclusive, resilient, and sustainable industrial development in Africa.
A new financial architecture with greater access to finance and lower cost of capital is key unlocking investments at scale.
We must work collectively to boost entrepreneurship, harness the potential of new technologies, expand opportunities for youth, women and girls, build climate resilience, and foster competitiveness and trade.
We must also work together to realize the objectives of the African Continental Free Trade Area, the African Union’s Agenda 2063, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
On Africa Industrialization Day, let us join forces to build a more sustainable, peaceful, and prosperous continent for all.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE WORLD TOILET DAY
19 November 2022
Improving sanitation is a highly cost-effective way to transform people’s lives.
The benefits of better sanitation go far beyond public health. Safe toilets and sanitation improve nutrition, help to manage scarce water resources, and promote school attendance and work opportunities, particularly for women and girls.
Every dollar invested in toilets and sanitation is repaid five-fold in lower health costs and increased productivity, education, and jobs.
Yet we are seriously off track to keep our promise of safe toilets for all by 2030 – a crucial indicator in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Investment in sanitation systems is too low and progress remains too slow.
3.6 billion people still suffer the indignity of living without a safe toilet. Every day, over 700 children die from diseases caused by poor sanitation, hygiene, and unsafe water.
On this World Toilet Day, we focus on the impact of inadequate sanitation systems on groundwater – how they spread human waste into rivers, lakes, and soil, polluting the water resources under our feet.
This issue has been neglected for too long because it happens out of sight – underground, and amidst the poorest communities.
Today, let us shine a light on the vital role of safe toilets in all aspects of sustainable development – both visible and invisible.
And let us act with urgency and ambition to deliver on the basic human right to water and sanitation for all people, everywhere.

UNDP
PRESS RELEASE
UNDP and Islamic Relief partner to support the flood-affected communities in Sindh
Islamabad, 18 November 2022—In a signing ceremony today, UNDP and Islamic Relief announced a partnership to support the flood-affected communities in Sindh. The partnership will create income opportunities for households affected by the floods and support the construction of community infrastructures.
The devastating floods in Pakistan have affected 33 million people. Recently launched Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) highlights that millions have become homeless, livelihoods are heavily impacted, and critical infrastructure has been wiped out. Estimates of total damages and losses are around $30 billion.
Floods have particularly impacted the poorest and most vulnerable districts. Poverty rates for many flood-affected districts in Sindh and Balochistan, two of the most impacted provinces, were even higher. Before the floods, households in calamity-hit communities showed an average poverty rate of more than 31 percent, well above the national average of 21.9 percent.
In response, UNDP and Islamic Relief will help communities with cash for work opportunities. An initial target of 10,000 cash-for-work hours will be set, with an increased focus on the inclusion of women. Simultaneously, rehabilitation schemes will also be identified in the selected districts that can be started immediately.
While speaking at the signing ceremony, UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative Knut Ostby highlights, “Aligned with UNDP’s Flood Recovery Vision, through this partnership, we aim to revive livelihoods and rehabilitate critical infrastructure in impacted districts of Sindh.”
“The scale of devastation has been unprecedented for which no one was prepared. Islamic Relief strongly believes that collaborations and partnerships are vital in this hour of need to reach the most in need before another crisis emerges. Our strong community connections are helping us to reach the most in need,” states Mr. Asif Sherazi, Country Director of Islamic Relief Pakistan.
This collaboration is an extension of UNDP and Islamic Relief's global and regional partnership in reaching and building resilience in conflict-affected areas.

UNICEF - PRESS RELEASE : UNICEF calls for investment in world’s first child-focused climate risk financing solution
UNICEF calls for investment in world’s first child-focused climate risk financing solution
Focusing on eight cyclone-prone countries across multiple regions, the $30 million risk transfer financing platform seeks to support 15 million children, youth and women over an initial three-year pilot.
SHARM EL SHEIKH, 16 November 2022 – UNICEF is launching a new climate financing initiative to enhance countries’ climate resilience and disaster preparedness for children and youth and bolster protection for children from the impacts of future climate-related disasters.
The Today and Tomorrow initiative is an integrated climate change finance solution that, for the first time, combines funding for immediate climate resilience and risk prevention programmes for children today, with an innovative use of risk transfer finance provided by the insurance market for cyclone disasters tomorrow. The combined financing platform is designed to help countries address the current and growing impacts of the climate crisis while preparing for future emergencies and rapidly responding to them when they occur.
“The risks of climate change are no longer hypothetical. They are here. And even while we work to build communities’ resilience against climate disasters, we have to become much better in pre-empting risks for our children,” said Karin Hulshof, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Partnerships. “We know more climate disasters are in the making. We just do not know where or when they will hit.”
Children and youth are a critically vulnerable population group that is among the most affected by disaster risk and climate change, including the effects of extreme weather events such as cyclones. Last year, UNICEF’s Children’s Climate Risk Index estimated 400 million children (nearly 1 in 6 children globally) are currently highly exposed to cyclones.
In its initial three-year pilot, UNICEF’s Today and Tomorrow will focus on eight countries in four global cyclone basins - Bangladesh, Comoros, Haiti, Fiji, Madagascar, Mozambique, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. To take this effort forward, UNICEF is raising $30 million for the initiative and is calling for additional private and public partners to take action and join UNICEF in helping to close the intensifying humanitarian financing gap for disaster protection for children and youth.
Climate harm in childhood lasts for life and perpetuates and deepens inequality and poverty across generations. However, the unique needs of children are not directly addressed by existing Risk Transfer mechanisms. This leaves a global humanitarian financing gap, or ”Child Protection Gap”, that encompasses hundreds of millions of children and youth.
UNICEF’s Today and Tomorrow is the first pre-arranged and event-based climate disaster risk financing mechanism that specifically targets this Child Protection Gap, with full support for the Tomorrow portion of the risk transfer instrument, secured from the German and UK governments under the newly launched G7-V20 Global Shield against Climate Risks.
“We are pleased to support UNICEF in advancing the world’s first child-centred financial protection tool for climate-related hazards and show the new G7/V20 Global Shield Against Climate Risks at work,” said Heike Henn, a Director at the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). “We expect that UNICEF’s Today and Tomorrow Initiative will deliver in three areas: first, increased uptake of ex-ante risk financing solutions by governments through knowledge sharing and increased familiarity with risk financing instruments; second, improved institutional and operational shock resilience of development institutions, and third and most importantly, closing the disaster risk protection gap for the most vulnerable people, especially children and mothers.”
"The UK is proud to be a partner in the new Global Shield against climate and disaster risks, and to co-fund the Global Shield Finance Facility," said Rt. Hon. Andrew Mitchell, Minister of State in the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office. "We strongly support bringing pre-arranged and trigger-based financing to the humanitarian sector, and I’m delighted that the Facility will expand its work as part of the Shield, including this new grant to UNICEF to enable them to protect up to 15 million children, young people and their families across Africa, the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific and respond rapidly if tropical cyclones hit."
Cyclones and the disasters they trigger, such as floods and landslides, represent the fastest-growing category of climate-influenced disasters and are a major cause of losses and damages worldwide.  UNICEF’s research has shown that investments that reduce exposure to and negative impacts from cyclones and other hazards can considerably reduce overall climate risk for millions of children.
“UNICEF is the first UN institution, as well as one of the largest humanitarian organisations worldwide, to take out a bespoke disaster risk coverage for the protection of children, youth and parents, especially mothers,” said Simon Young, a Senior Director in the Climate and Resilience Hub at WTW, the advisory that designed the insurance solution. “As such, UNICEF is pioneering proof of concept for other organisations in the field. The decisive action by UNICEF can be a catalyst for more efficient, reliable, and quicker humanitarian crisis finance.”
As well as pressing governments and big businesses to rapidly reduce emissions, UNICEF urges leaders to take immediate action to protect children from climate devastation by adapting the critical social services they rely on. UNICEF also urges parties to find and fund solutions to support those who will face climate losses and damages beyond the limits to which communities can adapt.

Celebrations mark 30 years of DAFI scholarship programme in Pakistan
Some 2,800 refugee lives transformed in Pakistan since 1992 thanks to German-funded scholarship programme and support of the Commissionerate of Afghan Refugee Affairs
ISLAMABAD, 15 November 2022 – UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and Inspire Pakistan, celebrated in Islamabad today 30 years of the DAFI scholarship programme for refugees. The Albert Einstein German Academic Refugee Initiative (DAFI) scholarship programme has transformed the lives of over 2,800 refugee students across Pakistan since 1992, and over 21,500 learners around the world.
The German-backed programme provides scholarship opportunities for third level undergraduate students, majoring in fields including medicine, engineering, social and behaviour sciences, business administration, mathematics and computer sciences.
The DAFI scholarship programme contributes to the promotion of self-reliance of refugees by equipping them with the necessary skills, knowledge and professional qualifications for future employment. The programme is aimed at the development of highly qualified and skilled human resources that can play a vital role not only in Pakistan but also for the reconstruction of their country of origin.
“By investing in education, students will contribute to the economy of their host country and support their communities once they return to rebuild their lives,” underscored UNHCR Representative to Pakistan, Noriko Yoshida. “By enabling refugees to fulfil their potential, the scholarship programme has a transformative effect and changes their lives forever.”
The scholarships are awarded on a competitive basis with regard to merit, excellence and financial need. The programme grants scholarships to deserving young refugees enrolled in recognised universities, colleges and polytechnics in Pakistan.
In 2022, half of the 175 scholarships were awarded to women, compared to a quarter previously. This increase followed intensive outreach efforts to refugee communities and awareness raising on women’s higher-level education opportunities and support available. In addition, a new two-year DAFI Bridge programme for science and technology aimed at women studying at higher secondary level was launched.
“Education does more than teach academic skills – it provides students with a safe place to grow and learn life skills, such as cooperation, responsibility, and respect,” noted Qaiser M. Siddiqui, CEO of Inspire Pakistan, which is implementing the DAFI programme.
Joining the celebrations was Ambassador of Germany to Pakistan, H.E. Alfred Grannas, Chief Commissioner, Saleem Khan, Commissionerate of Afghan refugees (CCAR), as well as members of the international community.
Noting that the funding for the scholarship programme illustrates the commitment of Germany to supporting refugees and host communities, scholars were eager to convey their appreciation to Ambassador Grannas as well as to the Government of Pakistan and third level institutions across the country for the opportunity to continue their studies to third level.
“DAFI has opened so many doors to me and many others,” concluded Marwah Sadat, a DAFI scholar and host for the event. “Thanks to the financial support of the scholarship programme, I could focus on my studies and achieve my dreams,” noted the bachelor’s graduate in Media Studies from Iqra National University, Peshawar.

World Science Day for Peace and Development 2022
Islamabad, 10 November — Since 2001, the World Science Day for Peace and Development, is celebrated to highlight the important role of science in society and the need to engage the wider public in debates on emerging and important contemporary issues relevant to science. This year theme of the day is Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development. It is being celebrated within the International Year of Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development, which has been kicked off on 8 July 2022 at UNESCO Headquarters, Paris, France.
The applications of basic sciences are vital for advances in medicine, industry, agriculture, water resources, energy planning, environment, communications, and culture’, affirmed the United Nations General Assembly on 2 December 2021, when it endorsed the proposal for an International Year of Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development. World Science Day is contributing to the Year in 2022 by celebrating this theme.
‘We need more basic science to achieve The 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals’, the United Nations General Assembly noted in December 2021. It is true that the share of domestic research expenditure devoted to basic sciences varies widely from one country to another. According to data from the UNESCO Science Report 2021 for 86 countries, some devote less than 10% of their research expenditure to basic sciences and others more than 30%.
Having a capacity in basic sciences is in the interests of both developed and developing countries, given the potential for applications to foster sustainable development and raise standards of living.
This year, UNESCO Islamabad in collaboration with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation Standing Committee on Scientific and Technological Cooperation (COMSTECH), the Pakistan Science Foundation (PSF), the Commission on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the South (COMSATS), the Economic Cooperation Organization Science Foundation (ECOSF), and the Pakistan Academy of Sciences (PAS), organizing an event linked to this year’s World Science Day for Peace and Development, at the COMSTECH Secretariat, Islamabad on 16 November 2022. During the event, experts will cover the areas of basic sciences like role of Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics in our daily lives and sustainable development. Participants will include representatives of several embassies and high commissions, government officials, scientists, students, teachers, researchers, science communicators and science journalists.

Pakistan SDG Investments & Climate Financing Facility
Established to mobilize private sector investments for development
Islamabad, 9 November 2022—Ministry of Finance, Government of Pakistan, and UNDP Pakistan launched the SDG Investments & Climate Financing Facility today to mobilize private sector investments and promote dynamic Financing for the Development portfolio for Pakistan.
“This is a timely initiative for accelerating Financing for Development in Pakistan”, said the honorable Finance Secretary of Pakistan, Mr. Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh, while launching the Facility. “We must call on the private sector and international stakeholders to expand the financing pool and reach out to marginalized populations.”
In a video message, Ms. Kanni Wignaraja, UNDP Assistant Secretary General, Assistant Administrator, and Regional Director, Regional Bureau of Asia and the Pacific, stated, “We will need to combine grants and credits, public and private sector financing, international and domestic borrowing, and new resources to recover, rebuild and prevent further catastrophes.”
Mr. Knut Ostby, Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan, reiterated, “The vision of the Facility entrusted by the Government of Pakistan and UNDP Administrator is aimed at enabling Pakistan to take bold choices to protect and restore our fragile planet, and at the same time drive down poverty and inequality.”
The Facility’s launch event was chaired by Finance Secretary Mr. Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh, with UNDP’s Regional Director Ms. Kanni Wignaraja giving a video address. Others in attendance included UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative Mr. Knut Ostby; UNDP Pakistan Assistant Resident Representative and Chief, Development Policy Unit, Ms. Ammara Durrani; Section Chief, Financing for Development Section, UNESCAP, Ms. Subathirai Sivakumaran; UNDP Senior Advisor on Financing for Development Mr. Haroon Sharif; Former Ambassador and Facility member Ms. Naghmana Hashmi; as well as representatives from the government, development partners, members of the diplomatic corps, representatives of international missions and UN Agencies, civil society, leaders of the private sector and media.
Climate-induced catastrophic floods in Pakistan have afflicted more than a third of the country, with a critical need to address the widening recovery gap and development needs. Recently launched Post Disaster Needs Assessment Report (PDNA), led by the Government of Pakistan’s Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, and supported by the UN with the technical facilitation of UNDP, the World Bank, the European Union, and the Asian Development Bank estimated the total floods damage at $14.9 billion, total loss at $15.2 billion, and total needs at $16.3 billion.
At the same time, financing climate action - including mitigation and adaptation measures - requires large investments. Therefore, significant finances are also needed to prepare Pakistan’s economy to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The IMF estimates Pakistan’s annual financing gap for the SDGs at $3.72 billion for 2020-2030, and the NDC estimates that $ 7 billion to $14 billion must be raised for climate adaptation in the country.
The public sector requires more fiscal space, and there is potential for more from the private sector. Therefore, meeting the demand for financing climate action and SDG achievement requires a well-designed, evidence-based strategy backed by a deep understanding of challenges and available options. In this context, the UNDP-Government Facility aims to leverage Pakistan’s structural transformation through private sector investments in the SDGs, climate resilience, and disaster risk financing as core pillars of the country’s sustainable economy.
The SDG Investments & Climate Financing Facility will identify, develop, and leverage high-impact SDG-aligned and climate financing value propositions with the potential to attract investments from various national and international investors, including financial markets.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
REMARKS DURING JOINT PRESS ENCOUNTER
WITH PRIME MINISTER OF PAKISTAN SHEHBAZ SHARIF
Sharm El-Sheikh, 7 November 2022
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
There are moments in our life that become unforgettable and that mark us deeply. My last visit to Pakistan was one of these moments. To see an area flooded that is three times the size of my country, Portugal. To see the loss of life, the loss of crops, the loss of livelihoods. To see the dramatic impact in the lives of people, all over the country, and at the same time to see the courage, the resilience, and the generosity of the Pakistani people.
I knew that generosity when I was High Commissioner for Refugees looking at the way Pakistanis have shared everything to receive millions and millions of Afghan refugees. But this time I could witness that generosity with the testimony that I will never forget from women and men that decided to leave their property and leave their assets to go and rescue other people’s assets and property instead of protecting their own. Now, these examples of generosity are examples that should be imitated by the international community, The international community has a duty to massively support Pakistan in this moment and there are different ways to do this.
The UN is proud to be associated with the Government of Pakistan for the international donor conference in which we will try to obtain from the international community the kind of massive support that is needed for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the areas impacted by these tragic events.

But more needs to be done. The Prime Minister has said, if there is any doubt about loss and damage go to Pakistan. There is loss and there is damage. And this COP needs to recognize it and needs to define a clear roadmap to deal with it. This should include the creation of an institutional framework and financing in order to address the problems of loss and damage. I hope that Pakistan will be able to benefit from these developments.
Pakistan is also a victim of being a middle-income country. Because it is a middle-income country, Pakistan has not benefited from debt relief at the level that should be necessary for the country. One of the proposals that I've been making is that for countries like Pakistan, there should be a way to swap the payment of their debt for investments in rehabilitation and recovery and reconstruction from a natural disaster like the one that just occurred.
My appeal to the international financial institutions and to the G20 that will be meeting soon in Bali is to create the conditions for mechanisms of debt relief of middle-income countries impacted by natural disasters the size of the one Pakistan had, in order to allow resources to be devoted to the investments in resilience and in recovery and reconstruction that are necessary.
Again, Pakistan is a victim from the fact that being a middle-income country it has no access to concessional funding. There is no reason why middle-income countries that are dramatically impacted by climate change shouldn’t have access to concessional funding. I believe that in the context of the Bretton Woods system, this is something that needs to be reviewed. I hope the G20 will also be able in this regard to promote the necessary reforms because it depends on decisions of the boards and those countries that will gather in the G20 have the majority of the boards of the IMF and the World Bank, and also in relation to many other regional international development banks and other financial institutions.
Let's be clear. Pakistan deserves massive support directly from the international community. Pakistan deserves loss and damage to be considered as a reality and for that reality to be recognized through financial mechanisms that I hope this conference will be able to decide. And finally, it is important to review the way the international financial system works in order for Pakistan to have access to effective debt relief and to have access to the concessional funding that is necessary for the levels of reconstruction and rehabilitation that are huge.
The UN will be side by side with Pakistan and I want to once again express our total solidarity with the people and the government of Pakistan and my strong appeal for the international community to be able to correspond to the generosity that Pakistanis have always shown. Thank you very much.

UNICEF
SUMMARY
This is a summary of what was said by UNICEF’s Director of the Division of Global Communication and Advocacy, Paloma Escudero – to whom quoted text may be attributed – on the climate crisis, record flooding and what must happen for children at COP27
8 Nov Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.
“Good morning from the COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh. UNICEF is here working with youth climate activists from around the world to spotlight the impact of the climate crisis on the poorest children.
“According to a UNICEF analysis released today, 27.7 million children in 27 countries have been impacted by flooding so far this year, just in 2022 and counting.
“In Chad, the Gambia and north-east Bangladesh the worst floods in a GENERATION were recorded this year. For Pakistan, the floods were the worst on record.
“These rolling disasters are straining the ability of governments and the international community to respond at the enormous scale needed. And placing millions of children as we speak TODAY at severe risk of starvation, disease, exploitation and death.
“I saw this myself last week when I was in Pakistan visiting the worst-affected areas. There, 11 million children are in need of immediate assistance.
“In Larkana, I met a 15-year-old girl called Sugrah, who showed me the rubble of her beloved home. Two months earlier, as floodwater seeped into her house, the roof above her began to collapse.
“Terrified, she grabbed her younger brothers and sisters and fled to a nearby bypass, where they lived for weeks in a makeshift tent made of plastic bags and sticks.
“But Sugrah was lucky. In a village where the flood water reached 5 feet, or 1.5 meters, villagers told us that not all the children who tried flee made it.
“Now consider Sugrah’s story, but multiply it by the highest factor.
“In the weeks since the unprecedented floods devastated Pakistan, the emergency has become a multi-headed monster.
“Pakistan’s worst floods in 100 years have killed at least 615 children, and left 10 million girls and boys needing immediate, lifesaving support.
“The floods have contaminated drinking water, which is spawning deadly water-borne diseases such as acute watery diarrhea, which compounds already acute malnutrition. Estimates suggest close to 1.6 million children in flood areas could be suffering from severe acute malnutrition.
“The stagnant water is a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, increasing the risk of malaria and dengue. There are crises on top of crises.
“Without urgent action, many more vulnerable children and young people will lose their lives in the days and weeks to come. And without climate action, hundreds of millions more will almost certainly suffer like those in Pakistan.
“We are reaching final warnings. Right now Pakistan is drowning in the world’s inaction.
“One of the most important but heartbreaking things about climate change is that its most horrific impacts are often reserved for those who are least responsible for creating the problem.
“International climate scientists found the recent Pakistan floods were made worse by climate change, and predicted the intensity of the country’s rainfall will “significantly” increase as the planet continues to warm. Pakistan is on the frontlines of the climate crisis but its contribution to global emissions is less than 1 percent.
“In Africa, just like in Pakistan, children are paying the price for a climate disaster not of their making.
“From the extreme drought and risk of famine in Somalia to the erratic rains across the Sahel, UNICEF is being challenged to respond at an unprecedented scale to emergencies that have all the markings of climate-induced disasters.
“So, today, from the floor of COP27, UNICEF challenges world leaders to also respond at an unprecedented scale.
“PREVENTING - governments and big business must prevent a climate catastrophe by rapidly reducing emissions.
“PROTECTING - UNICEF urges leaders to take immediate action to protect children from climate devastation by adapting the critical social services they rely on.
“PREPARING – prepare children for the changing world by educating them on climate change, teaching them how to respond to disasters and equipping them with green skills for future jobs.

“PRIORITISING - Last year, developed countries agreed to double support for adaptation to $40 billion a year by 2025. At COP27, they must present a credible roadmap with clear milestones on how this will be funded, as a step to delivering at least $300bn per year for adaptation by 2030. At least half of all climate finance should flow towards adaptation and children should be PRIORITISED in these decisions.
“And, let us remember, communities can only adapt to so much. UNICEF also urges world leaders to agree immediate funding for the children who are facing, and will face, irreversible climate losses and damages. Governments MUST close the finance gap for addressing loss and damage at COP27.
“Decisions about climate change – including in these halls – need to be inclusive, especially of young people from the most-affected places. But let’s also be clear: We don’t need young people to keep raising the alarm; we need people with power to start acting.
“Alternatively, if discussions continue to dominate over deeds, then the catastrophe for the children of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Chad, Nigeria and so many others, will be nothing compared to what is to come.


UNICEF
FACT SHEET
Over 27 million children at risk as devastating floods set records across the world.
Number of children affected by flooding in Chad, Gambia, Pakistan and north-east Bangladesh highest in over 30 years
SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt/GENEVA/NEW YORK, 8 November 2022 - As COP27 gets underway in Egypt, UNICEF warns this year has brought overwhelming flooding to at least 27.7 million children in 27 countries worldwide.
A large majority of the 27.7 million children* affected by flooding in 2022 are among the most vulnerable and are at high risk of a multitude of threats including death by drowning, disease outbreaks, lack of safe drinking water, malnutrition, disruption in learning, and violence.
“We are seeing unprecedented levels of flooding all around the world this year, and with it, an explosion in threats to children,” said Paloma Escudero, head of the UNICEF delegation for COP27. “The climate crisis is here. In many places, the flooding is the worst it has been in a generation, or several. Our children are already suffering at a scale their parents never did.”
The aftermath of floods is often more deadly for children than the extreme weather events that caused the flooding. In 2022, floods have contributed to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria, cholera and diarrhea:
·                  In Pakistan, more than 1 in 9 children under five admitted to health facilities in flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan were found to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition.
·                  In Chad, 465,030 hectares of farmland were destroyed, worsening the already dire food insecurity situation.
·                  In Malawi, torrential rains and flooding by tropical storm Ana in January 2022 caused extensive damage to water and sanitation systems, which created the perfect conditions for a cholera outbreak. The outbreak has claimed the lives of 203 people, out of which 28 are children. To date, 1,631 children have been infected with cholera.
·                  Together with other climate shocks and conflict, floods have caused the projected number of children in South Sudan facing high levels of food insecurity to surpass the rates seen during the conflict in 2013 and 2016. Additionally, the United Nations recently warned that some communities are likely to face starvation if humanitarian assistance is not sustained and climate adaptation measures are not scaled-up.
In addition to threatening the lives of millions of children, the flood waters have disrupted essential services and displaced countless families:
·                  The recent floods in Pakistan damaged or destroyed nearly 27,000 school buildings, forcing 2 million children to miss school.
·                  In South Sudan, 95 UNICEF supported nutrition sites have been affected by floods, hampering the delivery of life-saving and preventative malnutrition services for 92,000 children.
·                  An estimated 840,000 children were displaced by floods in Nigeria in recent months.
·                  Heavy rains and flooding in Yemen triggered floods causing extensive damage to shelters in displacement sites. Up to 73,854 households were affected, and 24,000 households were displaced.
“COP27 provides an opportunity to chart a credible roadmap with clear milestones for finance for climate adaptation and solutions for loss and damage,” said Paloma Escudero. “Young people from the most affected places on Earth are drowning in climate inaction. Enough is enough. Lives are on the line – children need action now.”
As well as pressing governments and big business to rapidly reduce emissions, UNICEF urges leaders to take immediate action to protect children from climate devastation by adapting the critical social services they rely on. Adaptation measures, like creating water, health and education systems that stand up to flooding and drought, will save lives.
Last year, developed countries agreed to double support for adaptation to $40 billion a year by 2025. At COP27, they must present a credible roadmap with clear milestones on how this will be delivered, as a step to delivering at least $300bn per year for adaptation by 2030. At least half of all climate finance should flow towards adaptation.
UNICEF also urges parties to find solutions to support those who will face climate losses and damages beyond the limits of what communities can adapt to. UNICEF is calling on governments to close the finance gap for addressing these irreversible changes for children.
AT COP27, UNICEF CALLS ON ALL PARTIES TO:
1.    PREVENT. Revisit their national climate plans to cut emissions drastically and urgently to prevent a climate catastrophe.
2.    PROTECT. Secure clear action on adaptation that protects every child from the accelerating impacts of climate change through the Global Stocktake and Global Goal on Adaptation
3.    PREPARE. Advance climate change education and meaningful participation to prepare children and youth through the Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) Action Plan
4.    PRIORITIZE. children and youth by accelerating climate finance investment in climate-resilient social services that reach the most at-risk children, and unlock progress on loss and damage
5.    Commit to child-sensitive climate action by aligning with and operationalizing the Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action
UNICEF’s immediate humanitarian response to flood affected countries is wide-ranging across all sectors: health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), child protection, and education. A lack of funding, however, has hampered the response in many countries. For instance, the funding gap for the humanitarian response in Pakistan currently stands at 85 per cent.
UNICEF is working to strengthen resilience of communities and health infrastructure to withstand disaster-related hazards, and increasingly linking our work on humanitarian response and longer-term climate adaptation.
Notes to editors:
* For this analysis, which is the first of its kind, UNICEF utilized official numbers collected by government emergency agencies or the United Nations Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In some countries, disaggregated data for children affected by floods was available. In countries with no disaggregated data, UNICEF estimated the number of children affected by flooding by extrapolating the percentage of children in the national population.

UNESCO - PRESS RELEASE : UNESCO Reaffirms Commitment to “UN Plan of Action on Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity” on its 10th Anniversary
UNICEF - PRESS RELEASE : Schools for more than 2 million children in Pakistan remain inaccessible due to devastating floods – UNICEF

UNESCO Reaffirms Commitment to “UN Plan of Action on Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity” on its 10th Anniversary
Islamabad, 3rd November 2022: UNESCO under its Multi-Donor Program on Freedom of Expression and Safety of Journalists marked the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists (IDEI). The event was held in collaboration with the Delegation of the European Union to Pakistan, the Embassy of Sweden, and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Some seventy participants from diverse backgrounds joined the event, observing the need to ensure the freedom of expression and safety of journalists.
This year completes the 10 years of the UN Plan of Action on Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity (UNPA). It is the first concerted effort to address attacks and impunity of crimes against journalists globally. Adopting a holistic approach, it brings together UN bodies, national authorities, media, and civil society organizations together to promote a safer environment for media workers. The anniversary is a milestone to reaffirm, recommit and reposition efforts to advance the UN plan.
Pakistan was amongst the five countries in which the UNPA was piloted. Initiatives were also taken at the regional level. During the event held today, experts shed light on the efforts that took place during the decade. The recently enacted ‘Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act 2021’, states to implement best practices provided for in the UNPA.
The International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists recognizes the far-reaching consequences of impunity, especially of crimes against journalists in limiting fundamental freedoms, especially the freedom of expression. According to the UNESCO observatory, in Pakistan, 14 journalists lost their lives while doing their professional duties in the past two years. Independent research highlights extremely low levels of convictions against the killings of these journalists. This day asks member states to investigate these cases to reduce the impunity against these crimes.
Speaking at the occasion Her Highness Dr Riina Kionka, Ambassador of the European Union Delegation to Pakistan stated, “The protection of journalists is a concern for us all: a free press is a global public good that we should not take for granted. Putting an end to impunity for crimes against journalists is a must if we want to uphold freedom of expression and media freedom”.
Former Senator Farhat Ullah Babar graced the occasion and reiterated that enacted laws need to be implemented to ensure rule of law and governance.
Mr. Youssef Felali-Meknasi, Country Representative and Director, UNESCO thanked the participants and stated, “As media freedom mirrors our freedom to express, we need to increase our efforts to protect and safeguard our fundamental freedoms.

Schools for more than 2 million children in Pakistan remain inaccessible due to devastating floods – UNICEF
ISLAMABAD/NEW YORK, 3 November 2022 – Schools for more than 2 million children in Pakistan remain completely inaccessible after the most severe flooding in the country’s history destroyed or damaged nearly 27,000 schools in the country.
“Almost overnight, millions of Pakistan’s children lost family members, homes, safety, and their education, under the most traumatic circumstances,” said UNICEF’s Global Director of Education Robert Jenkins, upon returning from flood-affected areas in Pakistan. “Now, faced with the uncertainty of when they’ll be able to return to school, and having already endured some of the world’s longest school closures due to the pandemic, they are experiencing yet another threat to their future.”
More than two months since the devastating floods engulfed large areas of Pakistan, the tops of school buildings are only just becoming visible in some of the flood-hit areas. It is estimated that it will be weeks, even months before the flood waters completely subside.
In addition to places of learning, schools are critical in providing children with access to healthcare, psychosocial support, and immunization. The longer schools remain closed, the greater the risk of children dropping out altogether, increasing their likelihood of being forced into child labor and child marriage, and exposure to other forms of exploitation and abuse.
Many of the hardest-hit districts were already among the most vulnerable communities in Pakistan. Before the current emergency, one-third of boys and girls in flood-affected areas were already out of school and 50 per cent of children suffered from stunting. These deprivations may be further exacerbated by prolonged school closures.
During the height of the pandemic, schools across Pakistan were fully or partially closed for 64 weeks between March 2020 and March 2022 – some of the world’s longest school closures. Less than six months on, the destruction caused by the extreme floods means schoolchildren are once again locked out of learning. Excessive damage to infrastructure, including electricity and internet connectivity, has left remote learning largely inaccessible.
UNICEF has established more than 500 temporary learning centres in the worst-affected districts and supported teachers and children with education supplies. To support children’s mental and physical health, UNICEF is training teachers on psychosocial care and health screenings and is preparing for back-to-school and enrolment activities for those schools that have been cleaned and rehabilitated.
“For some children, who had never been enrolled in school before, these learning centres are their very first experience of education. We need to do all that we can to ensure they continue learning when they return to their homes,” said Jenkins.

پاکستان  میں تباہ کن سیلاب کے بعد 20لاکھ سے زائد بچے اب بھی  اسکولوں کی بحالی کے منتظر ہیں : یونیسف
اسلام آباد/نیو یارک، 3 نومبر 2022:  پاکستان میں تباہ کن سیلاب کے بعد 20لاکھ سے زائد بچے اب بھی اپنے اسکولوں کی بحالی کے منتظر ہیں ۔ ملک کی تاریخ کے بدترین سیلاب نے تقریباً 27 ہزار اسکولوں کو  جزوی یا مکمل نقصان پہنچایا ہے۔
یونیسف کے گلوبل ڈائریکٹر آف ایجوکیشن رابرٹ جینکنز نے پاکستان میں سیلاب سے متاثرہ علاقوں  کے دورے سے واپسی پر بتایا ،  ’’پاکستان کے لاکھوں بچے راتوں رات  انتہائی تکلیف دہ حالات میں اپنے خاندان کے افراد، گھروں،  ذاتی تحفظ  اور تعلیم کی سہولت سے محروم ہو گئے۔  اب انہیں ایک غیر یقینی صورتحال کا سامنا ہے کہ وہ اسکول واپس آسکیں گے یا نہیں ،  حالانکہ  وبائی مرض کی وجہ  انہیں اسکولوں کی جس بندش کا سامنا کرنا پڑا وہ دنیا کی طویل ترین بندشوں میں سے ایک تھی ،اور  اب ان کے مستقبل کو مزید خطرات کا سامنا ہے ۔‘‘
پاکستان کے اکثر علاقوں کے تباہ کن سیلاب سے متاثر  ہونے کے دو ماہ  بعد اب سیلابی پانی میں ڈوبے  اسکولوں کی چھتوں کے کچھ حصے نظر آنا شروع ہوگئے ہیں۔ اندازوں کے مطابق سیلابی پانی کو مکمل طور پر اترنے میں اب بھی ہفتے یا مہینے لگ سکتے ہیں۔
تعلیم و تربیت کے علاوہ  اسکول بچوں کو صحت کی دیکھ بھال، نفسیاتی مدد، اور حفاظتی ٹیکوں تک رسائی فراہم کرنے میں اہم  کردار ادا کرتے ہیں۔اسکولوں کی بندش کے دورانیے میں اضافہ سے ، بچوں کے تعلیم ترک کرنے کا خطرہ  بڑھ جائے گا،  جس سے مزدوری اور کم عمری کی شادیوں پر مجبور ہونے کے علاوہ   استحصال اور بدسلوکی  کے امکانات  میں بھی  اضافے کا خدشہ  ہے۔
سیلاب سے  سب سے زیادہ متاثر ہونے والے  اضلاع پہلے ہی  پاکستان کے سب سے زیادہ خطرات سے دوچار علاقوں میں سے ہیں۔ موجودہ ہنگامی صورت حال  سے قبل بھی سیلاب سے متاثرہ علاقوں میں ایک تہائی لڑکے اور لڑکیاں اسکولوں سے باہر تھے اور 50 فیصد بچے غذائی کمی  کا شکار تھے۔ طویل عرصے تک اسکولوں کی بندش سے ان محرومیوں  میں مزید اضافہ ہو سکتا ہے۔
وبائی مرض کے عروج کے دوران بھی  ، پاکستان بھر میں اسکولوں کو  مارچ 2020 اور مارچ 2022 کے درمیان مکمل یا جزوی طور پر 64 ہفتوں کے لئے بند کردیا گیا تھا ۔ اب  چھ ماہ سے بھی کم عرصے کے بعد، شدید سیلاب کی وجہ سے ہونے والی تباہی  کی بدولت  اسکولوں کے بچے ایک بار پھر تعلیم  سے محروم  ہوگئے ہیں۔ بجلی اور انٹرنیٹ کنیکٹوٹی سمیت بنیادی ڈھانچے کو  پہنچنے والے شدید نقصان نے ریموٹ لرننگ کو بھی  بڑی حد تک ناقابل رسائی بنا دیا ہے۔
اس صورت حال سے نمٹنے کے لیے یونیسف نے ملک کے سب سے زیادہ متاثرہ اضلاع میں 500 سے زائد عارضی تعلیمی مراکز قائم  کیے ہیں اور اساتذہ اور بچوں کو تعلیم کی فراہمی شروع کردی  ہے۔ بچوں کی ذہنی اور جسمانی صحت کے فروغ کے لیے یونیسف اساتذہ کو نفسیاتی نگہداشت اور صحت کی نگرانی  کی تربیت دے رہا ہے اور ان اسکولوں  میں جن کی صفائی اور بحالی کا عمل مکمل ہوگیا  ہے ، ان میں ’اسکول واپسی ‘  اور داخلوں کی سرگرمیاں شروع کرنے  کی تیاری کر رہا ہے ۔
رابرٹ جینکنز کا  مزید کہنا ہے کہ ’’ جن بچوں  نے پہلے کبھی  داخلہ نہیں لیا ، یونیسف کے قائم کیے ہوئے  اسکول ان کے لیے  تعلیم کا پہلا تجربہ ہیں۔  ہم ایسے تمام اقدامات  اٹھائیں گے جس سے  اس بات کو یقینی بنایا جاسکے کہ جب بچے  اپنے گھروں کو واپس آئیں تو وہ تعلیم کا سلسلہ  جاری رکھیں۔‘‘

People of Manjhand (Jamshoro) start returning to work through rapid infrastructure rehabilitation project launched by Pakistan Workers Federation, ILO and the Government of Pakistan
ISLAMABAD - After launching a “rapid infrastructure rehabilitation” Project for the flood-affected people in Hanna Orak Baluchistan, ILO supports the Government of Pakistan in rolling out emergency employment project now in Jamshoro Sindh. The project will be delivered through Pakistan Workers Federation and will generate around 5,000 of person days of employment for the people of Manjhand.
Sindh and Baluchistan are among the provinces which are hardest hit by the devastating floods of 2022. In a rapid assessment done by the ILO, 50 per cent employment is lost or disrupted in Sindh topping all other provinces. This employment disruption and loss is mostly in agriculture sector and other informal parts of the economy. Women working in the agriculture sector are further disadvantaged because of the floods.
Mr Sajid Hussain Turi, Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and HRD, lauded the ILO for its immediate response to the crisis caused by the floods saying, rapid infrastructure rehabilitation is not only a means to injecting cash by bringing people back to work but also a way of ensuring that dignity of people is respected in the process of recovery and reconstruction.
The rapid infrastructure reconstruction project launched in Manjhand Jamshoro is a small drop in the ocean, but a project that is scalable and can be complemented through an integrated approach that provides health, education, social services, and protection to people along with daily wages for the work they carry out, commented Mr Manzoor Khaliq, ILO Officer In charge for CO Pakistan. The project will ensure that employment opportunities created are in line with international labour standards and that no children is engaged in labour and women and men are provided equal opportunities.
Secretary Workers Welfare Board, Mr Saleh Jumani, ILO Officer In charge for CO Pakistan, Mr Manzoor Khaliq, Mr Waqar Memon, Pakistan Workers Federation joined the Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and HRD during his community visit where they met with those who have been registered with the emergency employment project and girls and boys who are enrolled with the nonformal education sessions organised in the community.
Explaining to the guests visiting the community of Manjhand, Mr Asad Memon, PWF, said that women in Sindh have indigenous skills and we are leveraging these by helping them make rallies and other local crafts and they will be assisted in making market linkages so these products can be sold.
Medical Officers of Sindh Employees Social Security Institution examined the affected community and provided basic medicine. The launching ceremony was attended by the senior leadership of PWF.

UNODC - PRESS RELEASE : UNODC SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES TRAINING ON ‘ADVANCE INVESTIGATION SKILLS’ FOR BALOCHISTAN LEVIES FORCE
UNODC SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES TRAINING ON
‘ADVANCE INVESTIGATION SKILLS’ FOR BALOCHISTAN LEVIES FORCE
01 November 2022, Islamabad: UNODC Criminal Justice and Legal Reforms Programme in collaboration with Balochistan Levies Force has successfully completed the ‘Advance Investigation Skills’ training for Investigation Officers of the Balochistan Levies Force. This initiative is funded by European Union under the larger ambit of the Rule of Law Project in Balochistan.
The trainings were conducted for 3 batches of Investigation Officers at the Levies Headquarters in Quetta. Training for the 1st batch was held from 22-26 August 2022 with the participation of 20 Investigation Officers. This was followed by a training on 17-21 October for 25 participants including 3 women and, concluded with the 3rd batch on 24-28 October for 27 Investigation Officers including 4 women. The last two training sessions are of particular importance due to the unprecedented participation of women levies officials in the investigation skills trainings organized by UNODC. Prior to this, ‘Basic Investigation Skills’ training was conducted earlier this year in June and July 2022. UNODC planned a series of trainings for the Investigation Officers to progress gradually from basic to advance investigation skills.
This landmark initiative aims to bring professional effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of services by building on core competencies such as crime scene management, learning of advanced laws, investigation skills, handling of gender-based violence cases, community policing, and forensics evidence gathering. The training was broken down into modules to enhance the understanding of best practices and application of skills for effective and efficient investigation, interrogation, and interviewing of victims, witnesses, and suspects. The training programme also focused on stress management, professionalism, and a positive behavioural change while assuming duty.
In his closing remarks, Mr. Zahid Saleem, Additional Chief Secretary Home and Tribal Affairs Department stated, “The Levies have demonstrated their characteristic role for security in the entire length and breadth of the Province. They have made great sacrifices for maintenance of peace. Levies Force is our pride. Levies are the protectors of Balochistan. We are pained at the martyrdom of soldiers of Levies in Mastung, Chaman and Loralai”.
At the conclusion of the training, Mr. Zahid Saleem and Mr. Qadir Baksh Pirkani, Director General Balochistan Levies Force distributed certificates of completion to the graduating Investigation Officers of the Balochistan Levies force.
The trainees expressed their satisfaction with the skills learned and thanked UNODC for its continued efforts to support them in this essential learning process.

UN-HABITAT
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MESSAGE

UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif 2022 World Cities Day
Act Local to Go Global

We have only about 87 months, 380 weeks or 2600 days left to implement the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The best way to do so is by ensuring our cities and communities are sustainable.
These are big words. What I mean to say is that sometimes the solution to the challenges we are facing such as the Covid-19 pandemic, on-going conflicts and climate disasters is starring us in the face.
At UN-Habitat we work with communities and city managers every day. Cities and communities have the power to help Governments translate policy into practice.
With the right tools, local leaders can take action on critical needs such as housing, climate adaptation and safety.
City managers very often engage the right partners and find solutions by working together with their communities.
But going from local to global is a two-way street. We need all levels of government and all stakeholders to become partners. We need to work alongside each other to rescue the SDGs.
This is the key to an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient global habitat. One where we live in harmony with nature.
The theme for this year’s World Cities Day 2022 is “Act Local to Go Global”. More than ever, we need to work towards achieving transformative change in our cities to build the future we want.
UN-Habitat has been at the forefront of localizing the Sustainable Development Goals. We help by continuing to advocate for practical ways to incorporate the SDGs in local plans; creative ways to collect and use data to inform decision-
making; and most importantly, provide guidelines to ensure wider opportunities for women, youth and the disabled to participate in the making and implementation of action plans. Participatory budgeting being one such example.
We also offer technical expertise to cities, train urban planners and advocate for strengthening the voice of local and regional governments in the global arena.
On World Cities Day, let us confront urban challenges and forge lasting transformative solutions by finding those solutions together. Let’s act local to go global.

UNICEF - PRESS RELEASE : Climate devastation in Pakistan is an ominous precursor of catastrophes to come
Climate devastation in Pakistan is an ominous precursor of catastrophes to come
Statement by George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia, after visiting flood-affected areas in Pakistan.
Islamabad/Kathmandu, 28 October 2022 - “As the catastrophic climate disaster continues to upend the lives of millions of children in Pakistan, it is the most vulnerable boys and girls who are paying the steepest price.
“The children I have met here have lost everything: loved ones, cherished schoolbooks, the only homes they ever knew, their schools, their sense of security.
“As the flood waters and the media attention recede, the crisis in Pakistan has become an acute child survival crisis. Frail, hungry children are fighting a losing battle against severe acute malnutrition, diarrhoea, malaria, dengue fever, typhoid, acute respiratory infections, and painful skin conditions. As well as physical ailments, the longer the crisis continues, the greater the risk to children’s mental health.
“Nearly 10 million children need immediate, lifesaving support. Hundreds have already lost their lives. Over 1 in 9 children here suffers from severe acute malnutrition – a life-threatening condition. Panic-stricken parents are searching for food to bring even a simple meal home to their children.
“In a camp in Sohbatpur, Balochistan, I met Farida, who had fled her beloved home with her five children when the floods struck. She was worried sick about her one-year-old daughter, Rasheeda, who was visibly frail and weakened by acute malnutrition.
“Their story is one among millions. As winter looms, boys and girls crammed inside flimsy tents, when they are lucky enough to have one, will continue to succumb to diseases which in normal times are preventable and treatable.
“The boys and girls of Pakistan desperately need our support to survive. And yet the international appeal for Pakistan remains severely underfunded. Hundreds more children will lose their lives in the coming weeks if international support does not come in to scale up interventions.
“But this story of climate devastation is not only the story of Pakistan.
“In 2022 alone, climate-induced floods have ravaged Pakistan, Bangladesh, northern India and Afghanistan, leaving over 15 million boys and girls in need of assistance.
“Extreme heatwaves have scorched the crowded cities of the region, with temperatures climbing up to 48 degrees. Glaciers have continued to melt in Pakistan and Bhutan, while landslides in Nepal have swept away children’s homes and rising sea levels continue to threaten the very existence of Maldives.
“Children have played no part in creating the climate catastrophe in South Asia, yet they are the ones paying the biggest price. This climate catastrophe is threatening the health, wellbeing, and the very survival of over 616 million boys and girls who call this region their home.
“Governments must urgently protect the critical water, sanitation and hygiene, health and education services on which boys and girls so direly depend. They must also urgently make sure every boy and girl has the skills and knowledge they need to survive and thrive in a climate-changed world.
“But first and foremost, global leaders must urgently limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is the only way to save children’s lives.
“Without urgent global action, the climate devastation we have seen in Pakistan will, I fear, only be a precursor of many more child survival catastrophes to come.”

Flood Damages and Economic Losses Over USD 30 billion and Reconstruction Needs Over USD 16 billion - New assessment
Post-Disaster Needs Assessment calls for urgent support to implement a Recovery and Reconstruction that ‘Builds Back Better’
ISLAMABAD, October 28, 2022 - A damage, loss, and needs assessment following the unprecedented floods in Pakistan calls for ‘building back better’, based on the principles of the poor first, transparency, inclusion, and climate resilience. The assessment estimates total damages to exceed USD 14.9 billion, and total economic losses to reach about USD 15.2 billion. Estimated needs for rehabilitation and reconstruction are at least USD 16.3 billion, not including much needed new investments to strengthen Pakistan’s adaptation to climate change and overall resilience to future climate shocks, or reconstruction needs of affected private entities.
Housing; Agriculture and Livestock; and Transport and Communications sectors suffered the most significant damage, at USD 5.6 billion, USD 3.7 billion, and USD 3.3 billion, respectively. Sindh is the worst affected province with close to 70 percent of total damages and losses, followed by Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab.
The Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives led the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), which was conducted jointly with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the European Union (EU), the United Nations agencies with technical facilitation by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank. The PDNA, in addition to estimating damages, economic losses and recovery and reconstruction needs, also assesses broader macro-economic and human impacts and recommends principles along which to develop a comprehensive recovery and reconstruction framework.
The floods affected 33 million people and more than 1730 lost their lives. They are particularly impacting the poorest and most vulnerable districts. The situation is still evolving, with flood waters stagnant in many areas, causing water-borne and vector-borne diseases to spread, and more than 8 million displaced people now facing a health crisis. The crisis thus risks having profound and lasting impacts on lives and livelihoods. Loss of household incomes, assets, rising food prices, and disease outbreaks are impacting the most vulnerable groups. Women have suffered notable losses of their livelihoods, particularly those associated with agriculture and livestock.
The PDNA Human Impact Assessment highlights that the national poverty rate may increase by 3.7 to 4.0 percentage points, potentially pushing between 8.4 and 9.1 million more people below the poverty line. Multidimensional poverty can potentially increase by 5.9 percentage points, implying that an additional 1.9 households+ are at risk of being pushed into non-monetary poverty.
Compounding the existing economic difficulties facing the country, the 2022 floods are expected to have a significant adverse impact on output, which will vary substantially by region and sector. Loss in gross domestic product (GDP) as a direct impact of the floods is projected to be around 2.2 percent of FY22 GDP. The agriculture sector is projected to contract the most, at 0.9 percent of GDP. The damage and losses in agriculture will have spillover effects on the industry, external trade and services sectors.
The Government is providing immediate relief to the impacted communities and supporting the early recovery, while aiming to ensure macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. Moving forward, as recovery and reconstruction spending rises, the loss in output could be mitigated. Yet, significant international support will be needed to complement Pakistan’s own commitment to increase domestic revenue mobilization and save scarce public resources, and to reduce the risk of exacerbating macroeconomic imbalances.
Although the early loss and damage estimates may increase as the situation is continuously evolving on the ground, the PDNA lays the groundwork for an agenda for recovery and reconstruction that is designed to build back a better future for the most affected people in Pakistan. While the recovery will require massive efforts for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, buildings and livelihoods, it will also be an opportunity to strengthen institutions and governance structures.
The report puts forth recommendations for developing a comprehensive recovery framework. While the primary focus will be on the affected areas, such framework presents an opportunity to embed systemic resilience to natural hazards and climate change in Pakistan’s overall development planning. This tragic disaster can be a turning point, where climate resilience and adaptation, increased domestic revenue mobilization and better public spending, and public policies and investments better targeted to the most vulnerable populations; all figure at the core of policy making going forward.
In the short term, targeted mechanisms such as social assistance and emergency cash transfers, provision of emergency health services, and programs to restore shelter and restart local economic activities, particularly in agriculture, should be prioritized. Reconstruction and rehabilitation should rest on key principles of: participatory, transparent, inclusive, and green recovery for long-term resilience—“building back better”; pro-poor, pro-vulnerable, and gender sensitive, targeting the most affected; strong coordination of government tiers and implementation by the lowest appropriate level; synergies between humanitarian effort and recovery; and a sustainable financing plan.
Given Pakistan’s limited fiscal resources, significant international support and private investment will be essential for a comprehensive and resilient recovery. The Pakistani authorities are committed to accelerate reforms to generate additional domestic fiscal resources and improve efficiency and targeting of public spending. Beyond the immediate needs of floods reconstruction, these reforms, while protecting the most vulnerable, will be important to generate fiscal space to invest more broadly into more climate-resilient infrastructure and adaptation to climate change, as well as to build buffers to face future shocks, while addressing macroeconomic imbalances. This commitment of the Government will also be key to mobilize further international support as well as to unlock private sector sources of financing—both of which will be absolutely critical to face the current climate change-induced shock.
The ADB, the EU, the UNDP and the World Bank are fully committed to working with the Government and people of Pakistan during the ensuing recovery phase, and to increase the country’s climate resilience.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE WORLD CITIES DAY
31 October 2022
On this World Cities Day, we recognize the critical role of urban areas in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
Next year marks the mid-point to the deadline to reach the SDGs.
Yet an honest look reveals a bleak picture.
Across a range of critical goals – from poverty and hunger to gender equality and education – we are not seeing progress, but backsliding.
The consequences are dramatic: escalating climate chaos, growing poverty, rising inequalities, and more.
We must change course – and we can.
This year’s theme of World Cities Day highlights how: ‘Act Local to Go Global.’
The goals are global in scope, but implementation is local.
And that means implementation happens largely in cities:
Today, more than half of all people live in urban areas – by 2050, over two-thirds will do so.
Cities generate over 80 per cent of global GDP – and account for over 70 per cent of carbon emissions.
Many cities are already leading the transition to renewable energy, setting credible net-zero targets and building climate-resilient infrastructure.
I encourage them to work with their governments and sister cities across the world to share experiences and help raise ambition.
The actions cities take locally to create a sustainable world will reverberate globally.
And the transformative policies they pioneer today can catalyze change that will save lives and livelihoods everywhere tomorrow.
On World Cities Day, let us resolve to work with cities to build a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient world for all.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY TO END IMPUNITY FOR CRIMES AGAINST JOURNALISTS
2 November 2022
A free press is vital to a functioning democracy, exposing wrongdoing, navigating our complex world, and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.
Yet, more than 70 journalists have been killed this year simply for fulfilling this role in society.  Most of these crimes go unsolved. Meanwhile, a record number of journalists are incarcerated today, while threats of imprisonment, violence, and death keep growing.
A surge in disinformation, online bullying and hate speech, particularly against women journalists, is contributing to the stifling of media workers around the world. Intimidation through the abuse of legal, financial and other means is undermining efforts to hold the powerful accountable. These trends threaten not only journalists, but society as a whole.
The UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists aims to create a safe and free environment for all media workers.  As we mark its 10th anniversary, I call on governments and the international community take the necessary steps to protect our journalists.  We must end a common culture of impunity and enable journalists to do their essential work.
On this International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, let us honour our media workers, and stand up for truth, justice and human rights for all.

·       National and international NGOs supporting food, health, non-food items (NFI), water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
·       The members of Pakistan Humanitarian Forum (PHF) provided immediate response and rescue services in 84 flood-affected districts, reaching over 2.6 million people.
·       Earlier this month (6 October), the IFRC Emergency Appeal was revised to CHF 55 million (US$54.9 million). (Aims to assist 1 million people through immediate and long-term support in relief, health, water, sanitation and hygiene, livelihood, protection and risk reduction).
·       UN and its partners have established hubs (Quetta, Peshawar and Multan) to improve field coordination and information sharing between the provincial and district level.
·       Three hubs in Sindh: Karachi, Hyderabad and Sukkur.
·       Karachi hub supports logistics through Karachi port and airport as well as engagement and coordination with provincial authorities, including the Sindh PDMA.
·       Hyderabad hub provides support to 15 districts; Sukkur hub covers eight districts.
·       On 4 October, the revised Pakistan Floods Response Plan (FRP) was released, appealing for US$816 million to cover the most urgent needs of 9.5 million people in need. More funding is urgently needed to cover the growing humanitarian needs.
·       23% (US$ 110 M) is committed against the US$ 816 M appeal with US$ 205 M pledged. The government claims to have received pledges of about US$ 1.1 billion, however, the flash appeal caters to the absolute prioritized populations and needs who need help to stay alive.

Challenges for women & girls in the flood-affected areas
·          Pakistan's flood crisis is particularly tough on poor women. Estimates show that 650,000 women currently located in flood-affected areas in Pakistan are in need of access to maternal health services, and that as many as 73,000 had to deliver babies during September 2022. Malnourished pregnant women are also at risk of giving birth to low birthweight babies who will be malnourished. Women already have insufficient food and water to consume but in this case they do not eat and drink whole day just to avoid to go for defecating. This is also creating malnutrition in women. The situation of pregnant women is worse. There are no arrangements in most of the camps. One of our NHN organization reported that in one of the camps in Sind two women delivered babies without having anything, no clothes for the baby. nothing and no trained birth attendant. Women form their camp managed her delivery which is off course would have health issues. There had been no arrangement of any transport to take that to the hospital as well. It was also seen that lady doctors are not there at the relief or medical camps and women having issues are not able to communicate to male doctors. This happened in the end of September 2022.
·        Floods doubled the protection risks for women and children. Family separation, theft, Gender based violence, rapes—women and girls remain vulnerable. More than half of the women in Sindh and KP have insufficient access to latrines. Women and girls do not have access to menstrual hygiene items and this is causing sever issues of maintaining their hygiene. In some places at Sindh where the hygiene kits / dignity kits have been distributed, there is no mechanism of disposal. These used materials cannot be properly disposed of. There are no latrines in the camps. Women wait whole day to go in groups in night and whole day they can't go. This is another level of distress.
·        Gender disparity in Pak healthcare system contributing to dismal health of women. The World Health Organization expressed deep concerns about the potential for a "second disaster in Pakistan: a wave of diseases and deaths" following the unprecedented floods and mostly it will affect women & children.
·        Floods have triggered the dire need of protection mechanisms and restoration of the security and dignity of the displaced women.
·        Women have safety issues left and right," there is a likelihood of more assault and harassment cases. Cases of disputes/violence against were reported during the relief distribution.
·        As compared to men women are less likely to receive information through digital media, in flood camps and affected areas.
·        Pattan, HANDS- NHN member organizations has disseminated information on PSEA through focal persons and volunteers in Sindh and Punjab
·        Majority of women have lost their livelihoods (especially women working in the fields). So they will have no cash flow for another six to eight months or may be for years.
·        The upcoming winter season is haunting these women and they want to rebuild their houses at the earliest and want to leave the camps, however there is 2 -5 ft flood water surrounding their areas.

National Drug Use Survey 2022-24
26 October 2022
Drug abuse has emerged as an issue potentially endangering human society in terms of health hazards, crimes, money laundering, economic & terrorism etc. it becomes even more challenging and threatening when dynamics of drug abuse and varieties of drugs and fast changing and spreading without any boundaries, which is leading to exponential rise in drug abuse across the globe in general and Pakistan in specific. Pakistan, being contiguous to major drug producing areas, is more prone and susceptible to drug abuse which has manifested in the increased number of addicts across the country.
Given the increased vulnerability of youth in terms of drugs abuse, there is a dire need to studying its dynamics in Pakistan on the basis of factual data, to understand the underlying causes. In the backdrop, the Government of Pakistan is launching survey called, “National Drug Use Survey 2022-23” in order to collect data related to trends in drugs abuse, factors behind such indulgence and consequents impacts on the fabric of society, which shall subsequently enable the stakeholders to formulate an appropriate, comprehensive and effective policy to cope with this menace on fronts of prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and awareness.
Keeping in view global nature of the challenge, we must reiterate shared responsibility. A balanced, integrated and proactive approach shall enable to achieve the goals and objectives of drug abuse prevention and awareness. We therefore need to join hands to check the spread of drug abuse in order to safeguard our societies.

“National Drug Use Survey Pakistan 2022-24, Launched!”
26 October 2022, Islamabad – Today, the Ministry of Narcotics Control, Government of Pakistan, U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime jointly launched the National Drug Use Survey Pakistan 2022-24 in Islamabad.
In 2012 and 2013, UNODC in collaboration with the Ministry of Narcotics Control, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and other national stakeholders conducted a national survey on drug use to estimate the extent and patterns of drug use in Pakistan. The overall results of the survey revealed that approximately 6 percent of the population – 9 percent of the adult male population and 2.9 percent of the adult female population - equivalent to 6.7 million people - had used a substance other than alcohol and tobacco in the preceding year.
This year the World Drug Report 2022 revealed an estimated 284 million people worldwide had used drugs in 2020. Cannabis remains by far the world’s most used drug, and the report also notes an increase in use of amphetamines. Globally, the report estimates that 11.2 million people worldwide injected drugs during the period of the study. Around half of this number were living with hepatitis C, 1.4 million were living with HIV, and 1.2 million were living with both.
Since the previous survey, there have been changing trends of drug use in the region, especially anecdotal information of a rapid increase in the use of synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine. To have scientific data on the current situation of drug use in Pakistan, the national drug use survey 2022-24 will be conducted to provide reliable evidence of the extent to which the population is using drugs and suffering from drug use disorders. This survey will be comprised of a household survey and high-risk drug use study that will have national coverage, including the major districts in each province. This survey is being carried out jointly by the Ministry of Narcotics Control and UNODC with financial support from U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.
Dr Jeremy Milsom Representative UNODC in his welcome remarks thanked Mr Nawabzada Shazain Bugti, Federal Minister for Narcotics Control, and his Ministry for their support in taking lead on the survey and U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) for their gracious financial support to conduct the national drug use survey and drug prevention and treatment interventions in the country, he also mentioned that the comprehensive data on drug use patterns and trends is key to developing effective prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programmes and the Survey report will serve to promote thoughtful discussions, inform policies and strengthen national cooperation.
Mr Andrew J. Schofer – Deputy Chief of Mission, U.S. Embassy Islamabad in his speech thanked the Federal Minister for Narcotics Control, UNODC, and other dignitaries for their partnership. DCM Schofer further stated that, “through this project, the U.S. Embassy’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) will support the Government of Pakistan to provide evidence-based information to shed light on changing patterns of drug use and allow for stronger implementation of programs and refinement of policies.  The launch of the survey is an important milestone in the availability of evidence-based information on drug use in Pakistan, filling an often-overlooked gap.  The information and recommendations contained in the completed survey report will help to save lives by informing the development of drug prevention and treatment programs and suggesting needed policy or regulatory changes. The United States is proud to partner with the Government of Pakistan on drug demand reduction efforts.  To date, INL has provided $24 million U.S. dollars – that’s 522 million Pakistani rupees – of support for drug treatment and prevention efforts in Pakistan.  I am also pleased to share with you that this year we celebrate the 75-year anniversary of the partnership between the United States and Pakistan.  The U.S. government, through INL, has invested more than $1 billion dollars over the last 40 years to improve citizen security and enhance law enforcement capacity across Pakistan.”

منشیات کے استعمال کے قومی سروے 24-2022 کے آغاز پر
وزیراعظم اسلامی جمہوریہ پاکستان کا پیغام
26 اکتوبر 2022
منشیات کی عادت انسانی معاشرے کے لئے ایک ایسے مسئلے کی شکل اختیار کر چکی ہے جو اسے مختلف بیماریوں، جرائم، اور منی لانڈرنگ کے ساتھ ساتھ زیرزمین معیشتوں، عسکریت پسندی اور دہشت گردی وغیرہ کی سرپرستی کی شکل میں اقتصادی مشکلات کا شکار بھی بنا سکتا ہے۔موجودہ حالات میں اس چیلنج کی پیچیدگی مزید بڑھ گئی ہے کیونکہ منشیات کی عادات کے محرکین اور ان کی اقسام میں تیزی سے تبدیلیاں آ رہی ہیں اور یہ سرحدوں سے ماورا پھیل رہے ہیں جس کی وجہ سے دنیا بھر میں بالعموم اور پاکستان میں بالخصوص منشیات کے استعمال میں بے پناہ اضافہ دیکھنے میں آ رہا ہے۔ پاکستان چونکہ منشیات پیدا کرنے والے بعض علاقوں کے زیادہ قریب ہے اس لئے اس کے منشیات کی لپیٹ میں آنے کا خطرہ زیادہ ہے جس کا اندازہ ملک بھر میں نشہ کے عادی افراد کی بڑھتی تعداد سے لگایا جا سکتا ہے۔
منشیات کی وجہ سے نوجوانوں کو درپیش بڑھتے خطرات کے پیش نظر پاکستان میں اس کے محرکین کا مطالعہ کرنے کے لئے حقائق پر مبنی اعدادوشمار کی اشد ضرورت ہے تاکہ اس کے اصل محرکین اور اسباب کو سمجھا جا سکے۔ اس پس منظر میں حکومتِ پاکستان کی جانب سے منشیات کے استعمال کے رجحان سے متعلق اعدادوشمار جمع کرنے، اور اس عادت کے پس پردہ عوامل اور معاشرے پر ان کے اثرات کو سمجھنے کے لئے کے لئے "منشیات کے استعمال کے قومی سروے، 23-2022" کے نام سے سروے کا آغاز کیا جا رہا ہے جس کی بدولت متعلقہ اداروں اور دیگر فریقوں کو منشیات کی روک تھام، علاج معالجے، بحالی اور آگاہی کے میدان میں اس لعنت سے نمٹنے کے لئے موزوں، جامع اور موثر پالیسیاں وضع کرنے میں مدد ملے گی۔
اس چیلنج کی عالمگیر نوعیت کو پیش نظر رکھتے ہوئے ہمیں یہ بات بھی باور کرانی چاہئے کہ یہ ایک مشترکہ ذمہ داری ہے۔ ایک متوازن، مربوط اور فعال سوچ اور لائحہ عمل کے ذریعے ہی منشیات کی روک تھام اور آگاہی کے مقاصد کو حاصل کیا جا سکتا ہے۔ لہٰذا، ہم سب کو مل کر اپنے اپنے معاشرے کو محفوظ بنانے کے لئے منشیات کا پھیلاؤ روکنے کے لئے کام کرنا ہو گا۔

"پاکستان میں منشیات کے استعمال کے قومی سروے، 24-2022، کا آغاز کر دیا گیا"
اسلام آباد (26 اکتوبر 2022) – وزارتِ انسدادِ منشیات، حکومت پاکستان، امریکی محکمہ خارجہ کے منشیات و نفاذِ قانون کے بین الاقوامی امور کے بیورو، آئی این ایل اور اقوامِ متحدہ کے دفتر برائے انسدادِ منشیات و جرائم، یو این او ڈی سی  کی جانب سے مشترکہ طور پر 'پاکستان میں منشیات کے استعمال کا قومی سروے، 24-2022'، کا آغاز  کر دیا گیا۔
2012 اور 2013 میں یو این او ڈی سی نے وزارتِ انسدادِ منشیات، امریکی محکمہ خارجہ کے منشیات و نفاذ قانون کے بین الاقوامی امور کے بیورو آئی این ایل اور ملک کے دیگر متعلقہ اداروں اور فریقوں کے ساتھ مل کر پاکستان میں منشیات کے استعمال کے رجحانات کا اندازہ لگانے کے لئے ایک قومی سروے کیا۔ سروے کے مجموعی نتائج سے پتہ چلا کہ تقریباً 6 فیصد آبادی نے گزشتہ سال کے دوران شراب اور تمباکو کے علاوہ کسی نشہ آور مواد کا استعمال کیا۔ ان میں 9 فیصد بالغ مرد اور2.9 فیصد بالغ خواتین شامل تھیں، جبکہ ان افراد کی کل تعداد 6.7 ملین تھی۔
رواں سال منشیات کی عالمی رپورٹ، 2022، کے مطابق دنیا بھر میں اندازاً 284 ملین افراد نے 2020 میں منشیات کا استعمال کیا۔ بھنگ، حشیش یا Cannabis تاحال دنیا میں سب سے زیادہ استعمال ہونے والا نشہ آور مواد ہے اور اس رپورٹ کے مطابق بعض مرکب ادویات کے نشہ آور استعمال میں بھی اضافہ دیکھنے میں آیا ہے۔ اسی مدت کے دوران ایک اندازے کے مطابق دنیا بھر میں 11.2 افراد نے ٹیکے والے نشہ آور مواد کا استعمال کیا۔ ان میں تقریباً نصف افراد ہیپاٹائٹس سی کا شکار تھے، 1.4 ملین افراد ایڈز کے مرض میں مبتلا تھے اور 1.2 ملین افراد ایسے تھے جنہیں یہ دونوں امراض لاحق تھے۔
گزشتہ سروے کا موازنہ موجودہ حالات کے ساتھ کرنے پر اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ خطے میں منشیات کے استعمال کے رجحانات میں تبدیلی آئی ہے  جن میں سنتھیٹک مثلاً زود اثر منشیات کے استعمال میں تیزی سے اضافہ خاص طور پر قابل ذکر ہے۔ پاکستان میں منشیات کے استعمال کی موجودہ صورتحال کے بارے میں سائنسی بنیادوں پر معلومات اور اعدادوشمار حاصل کرنے کے لئے منشیات کے استعمال کا قومی سروے 24-2022 کیا جا رہا ہے جس کی بدولت معتبر شواہد میسر ہوں گے کہ آبادی میں منشیات کا استعمال کس حد تک ہے اور کس قدر لوگ  نشے سے پیدا ہونے والے مسائل کا شکار ہیں۔ سروے کے دوران ایک گھرانہ سروے کے ساتھ ساتھ منشیات کے استعمال کے شدید خطرے پر ایک تحقیقی رپورٹ بھی تیار کی جائے گی جس میں ملک گیر کوریج کے ساتھ ہر صوبے کے بڑے اضلاع کو شامل کیا جائے گا۔ یہ سروے وزارتِ انسدادِ منشیات اور یو این او ڈی سی کی مشترکہ کاوش ہو گی جس کے لئے امریکی محکمہ خارجہ کے منشیات و نفاذِ قانون کے بین الاقوامی امور کا بیورو، آئی این ایل، مالی تعاون کر رہا ہے۔

PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS PROGRAMME (PrEP) LAUNCHED BY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT, GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNITED NATIONS
Lahore 15 OCTOBER 2022—The Health Department of Government of Punjab, in partnership with the United Nations in Pakistan, launched the Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Programme (PrEP) in Lahore yesterday.
PrEP is considered a ‘game changer’ in the prevention of HIV. Even though it has been more than 10 years since the first evidence of the efficacy of daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was published, much of the PrEP scale-up is still highly concentrated in a small number of countries. Health Department, Government of Punjab in partnership with the United Nations in Pakistan, set a precedent in the country by launching community-based- PrEP for key populations and sero-discordant couples. PrEP does not replace condoms but offers an additional HIV prevention choice. Community-based PrEP dispensation is critical because CBOs working in Punjab have outreach programs and can play a pivotal role in creating awareness and ensuring stigma-free access to PrEP programmes.
With support from UNAIDS along with WHO and UNDP, the Government of Pakistan developed guidelines and standard operating procedures for community and health facility-based dispensation of PrEP. The launch event was organized under the leadership of the Director General Health Services of the Health Department Punjab in partnership with UNAIDS, UNDP and WHO. Before the launch event, a training was held with ART Centre staff from around the Punjab province on ensuring effective and evidence-based PrEP services.
Dr. Awias Gohar, Project Director PACP shared that between 2010 and 2020, Pakistan has seen an increase of 84% in new HIV infections and unless we take bold steps today, we will not be able to halt further new infections and PrEP is a step in the right direction. Addressing the participants, he further emphasized that “PrEP offers a significant strategic opportunity to precision target prevention programmes for key populations. For the administering of PrEP to sero-discordant couples and key populations, formal linkages have been established between ART Centres and the outreach component of the current programme. This approach utilizes outreach workers at the frontline to engage individuals who are at risk for HIV. Their main task is to connect members from the community to public health services, so that they can be reached by HIV prevention programs that will now include PrEP. Outreach workers disseminate HIV prevention packages, provide safe sex education materials and support for behaviour changes, and most importantly, refer the community for HIV testing and counselling and created linkages with ART treatment centres.”
Asim Raza, Additional Secretary Coordination and vertical programs, primary and secondary Health Department of Punjab shared that “The Punjab AIDS Control Program is providing free of cost counselling, testing and treatment services for more than two decades to people living with HIV. Given the recent expansion, the program now has its network of centers expanded to all of the 36 districts of Punjab. The program has forty-five centers that are located in teaching and DHQ hospitals. The program has its own advanced diagnostic bio-safety level 3 laboratory. It is stated with great pride that due to this laboratory the program provides free PCR and CD4 tests for HIV patients that are very expensive if done from any private lab. The dedication of the program and its staff is commendable. The provision of free of cost services such as testing and medication and the program’s robust lost to follow up mechanism is truly remarkable. Since July 2016 the program has screened 2,041,998 persons for HIV. The program since its inception has registered 35,976 HIV positive persons and currently 17,154 positive persons are on regular treatment. It is very proudly stated that the program has been successful in ensuring 204 HIV negative births from HIV positive mothers. In Punjab the leading cause of HIV transmission is from quackery. The re-usage of medical instruments by quack doctors and dentists cause HIV transmission and once a person becomes a carrier he is surely to transmit it to their spouse. This is why we believe that PrEP is ground breaking as it will curtail the transmission of HIV between spouses. Used along with other preventive measures the results will be not short of remarkable. I would like to commend the community based organizations present here for their services and support. They play key role in linking community members to treatment centers and keep strong in face of every stigma and discrimination. We as a nation also must work on changing our behavior towards the stigma and discrimination that is present when it comes to HIV/AIDS. Many HIV patients never opt for testing and treatment due to the fear of this disease. It is our responsibility to create environments that are warm and welcoming so every HIV patient can get treatment without fear, stigma and discrimination.
In the end he thanked the UN global partners, the UNDP, UNAIDS, UNICEF and WHO for their extensive support in healthcare services in Punjab especially for HIV/AIDS and, thanked all for supporting this launch of PrEP that will definitely change things for the better
Dr Rajwal Khan, Strategic Information Adviser, UNAIDS Country Office, Pakistan and Afghanistan congratulated the Health Department Government of Punjab for formally launching the PrEP programme and said, “We are impressed by the political commitment and concrete actions by the government to address the needs of communities. Ensuring a supportive, enabling environment free from stigma and discrimination will help achieve the targets of the Punjab AIDS Strategy 2021-2025 and contribute effectively towards ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Community outreach workers and counselors have the advantage of being able to reach people who are at risk. The integration of community-led HIV prevention programs and the meaningful participation of communities are critical to ensure that policies and services are responsive to community needs.”
Heather Doyle, Programme Manager for the HIV Global Fund grant at UNDP, participated in the launch on behalf of UNDP and added that “UNDP has been honored to work closely with Punjab AIDS Control Program (PACP), UNAIDS and the community partners to push this initiative forward. We look forward to continuing this partnership so that everyone who needs PrEP has access.”
Several members from the community-based organizations and representatives from key populations participated in the launch and expressed hope that chances of new HIV infections will get reduced through PrEP uptake. According to research, when taken daily as directed, PrEP can reduce the risk of HIV infections by more than 90 percent.

Trade and Industry should prioritize sustainable development framework including climate action – The UN and FPCCI
The United Nations and Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) organized ‘UN and Private Sector Consultation: Exploring Potential for Sustained Collaboration’ at a local hotel in Karachi on Wednesday last week. The Head of the UN Resident Coordinator’s Officer (UNRCO), Shah Nasir Khan, the Senior Vice President FPCCI, Muhammad Suleman Chawla, VP Engineer, M.A. Jabbar, Dr. Jawaid Qureshi, and Dr. Farhan Ahmed, the Convener and Deputy Convener of the UN Committee of FPCCI participated in it. The UN officials from UNRCO, UNIDO (UN Industrial Development Organization), UNDP (UN Development Program), UNICEF (UN Children’s Fund), UN Women, FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization), WFP (World Food Programme), and UN Global Compact Network from Pakistan, and Bangladesh orientated the participants  on the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for Pakistan for 2023-2027, importance of engagement with the private sector, financing for sustaining development and business and human rights.  Officials from public and private sector, academia, NGOs and civil society, women, representatives of youth, and the Turkish Consul General, Cemal Sangu participated in the event.
Keeping in view the sustainable development goals (SDGs), the UN in Pakistan has set five priorities (outcomes) for Pakistan for the next 5 years that include basic social services (health, nutrition, WASH, education, social protection) , gender and women empowerment, climate change and environment, sustainable inclusive economic growth and decent work, and governance (rule of law, ethics, transparency, and accountability for the public and private sectors). The participants of the event provided their valuable input to the UN for consideration of their framework. The draft framework now is being reviewed by the government of Pakistan before its final approval.
Mr. Barkaat Ali (Development Coordination Officer-UNRCO) while highlighting the seriousness of engagement with the private sector shared that globally US$ 5-7 trillion were required per year to achieve SDGs and the annual gap was US$ 2.5 trillion. Similarly, Pakistan, according to one estimate, required US$ 31 billion per annum between 2019 and 2030 to achieve its targets. The collaboration between the Government, the private sector and the UN was thus critical. Mr. Shah Nasir Khan informed that UNSDCF would require US$ 4.7 billion for its implementation out of which US$ 1.16 billion (24%) were available. These funds are deployed for development of various sectors under different programs and initiatives including trade, industry, entrepreneurial development, gender equality, women empowerment, youth development, etc. The audience were briefed on various projects of the UN in Pakistan. The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres recently visited Pakistan and sought help from the international community for Pakistan to respond to the unprecedented floods which have cost an estimated loss of US$ 30 billion to the country.
The SVP FPCCI, Muhammad Suleman Chawla, highly appreciated the efforts of the UN agencies and their financial and technical assistance in various sectors. He lauded the efforts of the Central Standing Committee of UN Affairs of FPCCI and its Convener, Dr. Jawaid Qureshi, for holding such productive events. He informed that FPCCI has various standing committees like health, education, environment, women entrepreneurship and women empowerment, etc., which contribute to social and economic development, including the SDGs.
In the panel discussion, the VP Engineer, M.A. Jabbar, stated that the governance system in Pakistan is very weak. There is a lack of transparency, accountability, participation of all the stakeholders, collaboration, and cooperation. There is a trust deficit between the public and private sectors. However, there is a serious need to overcome these gaps. He cited various examples of hazardous effects of industrial waste, pollution, noise pollution, and ignorance by most of the industrialists and private sector. However, there are companies that have high concerns and measures to protect the natural environment He advised that the Government of Sindh and the Federal Government should reconsider their agreement on setting up a railway infrastructure to dispatch coal of Thar to the industrial zones of Punjab, etc. for energy production. Rather, they should establish a coal-fired plant in Thar and put the energy into the national grid.
The UN representatives also highlighted various serious issues concerning climate change, global warming, and challenges to the biodiversity and ecosystem caused by environmental degradation and its cost to the society and economy. The developed countries caused the highest degradation to the environment, but now they are considering impactful measures for carbon neutral or net zero effect. The Indus Basin system of rivers is creating livelihood for millions of people in Pakistan and neighbouring countries. Ms. Shahnaz Wazir Ali, President SZABIST University, ex-Minister of State for Education and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Social Sector emphasized on the governance mechanism to bring systematic reforms. She stated that to combat the environmental challenges, there is a serious need that universities should introduce new courses and specialized degree programs on water management, gender studies, violence and justice, etc.
Dr. Jawaid Qureshi added that the environmental changes cause lack of rains and droughts as well as heavy rains and floods, deforestation, sea erosion, etc. The coastal belt of Thatta and Badin has been eroded by the sea, which has engulfed 30 million acres of land, and there is a dire need of planting mangroves there, and reforestation. Many countries have 25% or more of their land covered with forests, while we have only 2% forest cover. One recent example is the loss by the floods 2022. Generally, there is little awareness and model examples in Pakistan on issues like corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainability, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns by investors and shareholders, responsible consumption and production (CSP), public-private partnership (PPP) for provision of public services, etc.
Finally, FPCCI team represented by the SVP, Muhammad Suleman Chawla, and the UN team represented by Shah Nasir Khan agreed to continue such interactions between the two organizations for attaining the outcomes of the sustainable development cooperation framework (SDCF) for Pakistan for 2023-2027, keeping a high priority on climate action.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL
DAY FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
13 October 2022

Climate disasters are hurting countries and economies like never before.
Ever-rising greenhouse gas emissions are supercharging extreme weather events across the planet.
I saw first-hand the devastation unleashed by the recent floods in Pakistan.
These increasing calamities cost lives and hundreds of billions of dollars in loss and damage.
Three times more people are displaced by climate disasters than war.
Half of humanity is already in the danger zone.
The world is failing to invest in protecting the lives and livelihoods of those on the front line.
Those who have done the least to cause the climate crisis are paying the highest price.
Entire populations are being blindsided by cascading climate disasters without any means of prior alert.
People need adequate warning to prepare for extreme weather events.
That is why I am calling for universal early warning coverage in the next five years.
Early warning systems – and the ability to act on them -- are proven life-savers.
This is shown clearly by a new report today from the World Meteorological Organization and United Nations Office of Disaster Risk Reduction.
The report reveals that such services are woefully lacking for those who need them most.
At the COP27 climate conference in Egypt, I will launch an action plan to provide early warning systems for all within five years.
I urge all governments, international financial institutions and civil society to support it.
This new report is yet another reminder that real and concrete action on loss and damage must be global priority.
Delivering on loss and damage at COP27 will be an important litmus test for rebuilding trust between developed and developing countries.
On this International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction, I call on all countries to invest in early warning systems and support those who lack capacity.
Extreme weather events will happen.
But they do not need to become deadly disasters.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE TO THE TENTH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE GIRL CHILD
New York, 11 October 2022

On the 10th anniversary of the International Day of the Girl Child, we celebrate the lives and achievements of girls across the world.
When girls are supported to realize their human rights, they can reach their potential and create a better world for themselves, their communities and societies.
When girls are educated, they are more likely to lead healthy, productive and fulfilling lives.
When girls receive the right healthcare, they grow up with greater self-confidence and bodily autonomy.
When girls understand their rights, including the right to live without the threat of violence, they are more likely to stay safe and report abuse.
Many girls today face enormous challenges.
They may have had their education ended by the COVID-19 pandemic.
They may have been forced from their homes by conflict.
They may be unable to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights.
I am extremely concerned by the continued exclusion of girls from school in Afghanistan. This is deeply damaging to girls themselves, and to a country that desperately needs their energy and contributions.
I once again urge the Taliban to let girls learn.
Now more than ever, we must renew our commitment to work together so that girls enjoy and exercise their rights and can play a full and equal part in their communities and societies.
Investing in girls is investing in our common future.
On the International Day of the Girl Child, let’s redouble our efforts to make sure girls everywhere are healthy, educated and safe.

UN & Government of Pakistan JOINT PRESS RELEASE
The revised ‘2022 Pakistan Floods Response Plan’ (FRP) was shared with UN member states and humanitarian organizations today in Geneva. The revised appeal urgently seeks US $ 816 million to respond to the growing lifesaving needs of the people – a jump of US $ 656 million from the initial appeal of US $160 million. This increase is a reflection of the rising needs and the unprecedented scale of destruction caused by the current climate-induced disaster which has affected a population of 33 million, cost 1,600 lives and threatens hundreds of thousands more as a second disaster looms within the first one. Over 2 million homes have been destroyed or damaged, forcing people to live under open skies exposed to threats of dengue, malaria, and the biting cold of the fast-approaching winter. More than 1,500 health and support facilities are badly damaged and unable to respond to the growing needs. 13,000 km of roads are badly damaged, making it extremely difficult – and, at times, impossible - to reach families in need.
The focus of this appeal is on the provision of urgent and lifesaving humanitarian assistance and protection to 9.5 million people until 31 May 2023, with a focus on the 34 most affected districts in Balochistan, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. This prioritization is based on the number of houses damaged and destroyed, available projections of water level changes, and the population of displaced people in the districts. It aims to enable a more cohesive response for people in areas that have been most severely affected, and to foster a focused, multi-sectoral approach.
The Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman headlined the unimaginable scale of loss and damage caused by unprecedented climate-induced floods in Pakistan. She highlighted that the scale of catastrophe had gone beyond all previous climate disasters, affecting a population larger than the size of many countries. She referred to the continued inundation of large swathes of the country in pestilent water, pointing to the health risks such flooding posed. She added that Pakistan had sustained a complex and multi-sectoral exogenous shock to its economic body, and should not be expected to struggle alone in the frontlines of this climate apocalypse, while contributing less than one percent to the total global carbon emissions. Calling for a ‘coalition of the willing’ to effectively respond to this calamity, she outlined specific and urgent requirements in the areas of health, food security and rehabilitation. Considering that it was a race against time to support the people affected by the floods, she echoed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres saying that it was not a question of solidarity but of climate justice.
The Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths in his remarks said, “People in Pakistan are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, where catastrophic flooding has taken a devasting toll on the most vulnerable. We are now in a race against time ahead of the winter season and funding is now urgently needed so humanitarians can prepare to respond to rising health, hunger and other debilitating needs.”
The WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, “The water has stopped rising, but the danger has not, we are on the verge of a public health disaster. Many more lives than were lost in the floods could be lost in the coming weeks if we don’t mobilize greater support for Pakistan. WHO will do everything we can to support the people of Pakistan now, and in the coming months and years as you recover and rebuild. And even as we respond to the emergency in Pakistan, we must remember that unless we address the existential threat of climate change, we will be responding to emergencies like this and worse more often.”
The Minister for Economic Affairs Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said that this catastrophe was a climate warning to the world at the expense of Pakistan. He added that the losses were as of now assessed in billions of dollars, with large areas of land still inundated, making it impossible for people associated with agriculture to go back to sowing crops. He underscored the importance of saving each life, by helping the Government’s efforts for flood relief.
The United Nations Pakistan Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Julien Harneis said "We are now entering a second wave of death and destruction due to the floods." He added that the new funds will go towards food security, health care, clean drinking water, and sanitation.
The Chief Executive Officer of Save the Children, Inger Ashing represented the Pakistan Humanitarian Forum at the occasion. She called on the donors to step up and fully fund this lifesaving response. She praised the efforts of the government as well as the humanitarian network in Pakistan for their relief efforts.
The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar paid a special tribute to both national and international first responders and humanitarian civil society organizations who had been working tirelessly to provide relief to those in need. She highlighted, “With our characteristic resilience and endurance, and support of the international community, we are determined to overcome this challenge and bounce back stronger. There is a long road ahead of us. We would continue to count on sustained attention and support of the international community as we transition to the huge task of sustainable rehabilitation and reconstruction.” She noted the need to equip people to not only survive but also to thrive after the crises.
The international community including UN member States, UN agencies, and international humanitarian organizations participated in the event and delivered statements of solidarity and support for the people of Pakistan, in the wake of the climate-induced catastrophe.
An initial US $160 million flash appeal was made to address immediate needs based on estimates just a month ago. The support of the international community to the initial appeal of US $ 160 million allowed the humanitarian community to respond to immediate life-saving needs. However, the results of the recent needs assessments, that led to up-scaling of the Flash Appeal to US $ 816 million, revealed that much more was needed to save those struggling to survive the aftermath of the floods.
The Government of Pakistan, the United Nations, humanitarian and philanthropy organizations, and local communities have been working hard to provide assistance to flood-affected areas across Pakistan. The international community has stepped forward with valuable assistance. This support has been in terms of multi-purpose cash, as well as the provision of healthcare, medicines, food, water, shelter, education, and protection. However, despite all these efforts, the unprecedented nature of the floods has resulted in huge resource gap, which is hampering the relief efforts. International support is crucial in complementing the ongoing humanitarian operations, as part of solidarity, commitment, and burden sharing.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF NON-VIOLENCE
2 October 2022
The International Day of Non-Violence celebrates not only Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday, but the values he embodied that echo across the decades: peace, mutual respect, and the essential dignity shared by every person.
Sadly, our world is not living up to those values.
We see this through growing conflicts and climate chaos. Poverty, hunger and deepening inequalities. Prejudice, racism and rising hate speech. And a morally bankrupt global financial system that entrenches poverty and stymies recovery for developing countries.
We can defeat these challenges by embracing Gandhi’s values and working across cultures and borders to build a better, more peaceful future for all.
By investing in people’s health, education, decent jobs and social protection to prevent people from falling and catch them when they do.
By ensuring access to financing and debt relief for all countries.
By supporting developing countries as they build resilient infrastructure and protect populations from the impacts of climate change, while also accelerating the transition from planet-killing fossil fuels to renewable energy.
By securing and upholding the rights and dignity of all people — especially the most vulnerable, and girls and women who are too often denied their basic rights.
By taking concrete action for inclusion, recognizing multi-cultural, multi-religious and multi-ethnic societies as a richness, not a threat.
Gandhi’s life and example reveal a timeless pathway to a more peaceful and tolerant world.
Let us walk this path together, in solidarity, as one human family.

WRITTEN MESSAGE FOR THE WORLD MARITIME DAY
"New Technologies for greener shipping"
29 September 2022
Maritime transport represents more than 80% of global trade. The war in Ukraine –and the Black Sea Grain Initiative – have reminded us of the vital role of shipping in feeding the world.
The theme of this year's World Maritime Day, "New technologies for greener shipping", highlights the need for sustainable shipping solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect the environment and align with the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
The maritime sector must accelerate its voyage to decarbonization.
Without concerted action, emissions from shipping are projected to grow by up to 250 per cent by 2050 over 2008 levels. Governments and private companies need to work together to harness innovative technologies such as digitalization and automation and foster a just transition that includes developing countries and promotes renewable energy and alternative fuels.
The vessels to be deployed in this decade will determine whether the shipping sector achieves net zero emissions by 2050. Smarter and greener zero emission ships must become the default choice and commercially available for all by 2030.
As shipping continues to connect humanity, it must play an essential part in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and building a fair and prosperous future for people and planet.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS
New York, 26 September 2022
On the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, we reject the claim that nuclear disarmament is some impossible utopian dream.
Eliminating these devices of death is not only possible, it is necessary.
At a moment of rising geopolitical division, mistrust and outright aggression, we are in danger of forgetting the terrible lessons of Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the Cold War, and inciting a humanitarian Armageddon.
Last month, at their tenth Review Conference, the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons came close to consensus on a substantive outcome. While this unique moment failed to result in the outcome we so desperately need, we urge all States to use every avenue of dialogue, diplomacy and negotiation to ease tensions and reduce risk.
More broadly, we need a new vision for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. My proposed New Agenda for Peace calls for meaningful disarmament and developing a common understanding of the multiple threats before us so we can end the nuclear threat, once and for all.
Eliminating nuclear weapons would be the greatest gift we could bestow on future generations. On this important day, let us commit to forging a new consensus around defusing the nuclear threat for good and achieving our shared goal of peace.

Over half a billion dollars pledged to tackle severe wasting since July in unprecedented international response to deepening child malnutrition crisis
At least 60 per cent of commitments will directly support UNICEF’s work in 15 countries hardest hit by the food and nutrition crisis
Multimedia content available to download here
NEW YORK, 22 September 2022 — Governments, philanthropies, and private donors have pledged approximately US$577 million since July in response to the deepening child malnutrition crisis – with at least 60 per cent of that amount committed to directly supporting UNICEF’s work.
Roughly US$280 million of the over half billion raised was pledged today at The Child Malnutrition Crisis: Pledging to Save Lives – a high-level event co-hosted by UNICEF, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), and the government of Senegal at UNICEF Headquarters in New York.
The governments of Canada, Ireland, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom; and the Aliko Dangote Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), the Eleanor Crook Foundation, the Greta Thunberg Foundation, Humanitarian Services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and King Philanthropies came together at the high-level event during the 77th annual United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to address the growing food crisis.
The commitments were made as climate-driven drought, conflict, and rising food prices continue to drive up emergency levels of severe wasting in young children worldwide. In 15 countries hardest hit, including in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, a child is being pushed into severe malnutrition every minute, according to a recent analysis by UNICEF.
“An escalating malnutrition crisis is pushing millions of children to the brink of starvation – and unless we do more, that crisis will become a catastrophe,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “UNICEF is immensely grateful for the pledges we have received, but we need further unrestricted funding to reach children before it is too late. We cannot stand by and let children die – not when we know how to prevent, detect, and treat severe wasting.”
Today’s commitments build upon pledges made in July, when USAID Administrator Samantha Power announced an unprecedented contribution of US$200 million to UNICEF to detect and treat severe child wasting. At that time, an additional US$50 million was pledged by private philanthropies including Philanthropist and Chair of the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) Sir Chris Hohn, the Eleanor Crook Foundation (ECF), The CRI Foundation, and The ELMA Relief Foundation, to address the malnutrition crisis.
“The truth is that the majority of children facing severe malnutrition, nearly two-thirds of children, live in places that don’t normally receive humanitarian aid,” said USAID Administrator Samantha Power. “We are working to change that, to recognize that treatment for severe malnutrition should be accessible not just in humanitarian settings, but in non-crisis settings as well.”
Severe wasting – which makes children dangerously thin – is the most visible and lethal form of undernutrition. Weakened immune systems increase the risk of death among children under 5 by up to 11 times compared to well-nourished children.
In response, UNICEF has scaled up its efforts in 15 countries most affected by the malnutrition crisis. Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Yemen are included in an Acceleration Plan calling for US$1.2 billion to help avert a rise in child deaths and mitigate the long-term damage of severe wasting.
The pledges to UNICEF will help provide services for the early prevention, detection and treatment of child wasting, and expand access to life-saving ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and other essential nutritious commodities needed during crises.
During today’s event, UNICEF and partners also launched an expansion of the Child Nutrition Fund, a long-term multi-partner financing mechanism to support the early prevention, detection and treatment of child wasting. By working with governments to consolidate and strategically allocate financial resources, the Child Nutrition Fund aims to accelerate global progress and end the cycle of severe child wasting.
“We are witnessing an unprecedented child malnutrition crisis. The fact that many millions of children have to experience severe malnutrition in their first few years of life is unacceptable,” said Co-founder and Chair of CIFF Chris Hohn. “We already know many of the solutions for prevention, early detection and treatment of child wasting but we need to do more to ensure these solutions are scaled. This requires sustainable long-term and coordinated funding. The early success of the Child Nutrition Fund is incredibly encouraging and its expansion into becoming the largest centralised response to combat child wasting at scale is exactly what’s needed. I am pleased to announce the CIFF intends to allocate an additional $40 million for addressing child wasting.”
“As we face global challenges, including the ripple effects of COVID-19, we should always keep acute malnutrition and stunting as priorities on the multilateral agenda,” said Minister Counsellor at the Permanent Mission of Senegal to the United Nations Diamane Diome. “Working with national and international stakeholders, such as USAID, UNICEF, the World Food Programme and other multilateral and bilateral partners, Senegal has made great progress in this regard. This shows that we can overcome the challenge of child acute malnutrition and stunting, if we work collaboratively and with a sense of urgency, on the basis of our shared values. Senegal is committed to sharing the experience and lessons it has learned in the process. That is why I am happy to take part in this timely meeting alongside USAID and UNICEF.”
###
Canada’s Minister of International Development and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency Harjit S. Sajjan said:
“Acute malnutrition can be prevented, and the effects mitigated, if detected and treated early. Together we can put a stop to this—but we must act now. Working alongside allies like USAID and with partners like UNICEF, the World Food Programme and Nutrition International, Canada continues to be part of the solution.”
Ireland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney T.D. said:
“The world has reached a crossroads where climate change, continuous conflict in many regions, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now the war in Ukraine have converged to deepen and accelerate global food and nutrition insecurity. Together we must do more - and do it urgently. Today Ireland was pleased to announce a pledge of €50 million over three years towards accelerating the global response for the prevention, early detection, and treatment of child wasting. This will be additional to Ireland’s commitment made at the 2021 Nutrition for Growth Summit of €800 million over five years. We look forward to working closely with USAID, UNICEF and other global partners on this critical work in the months and years ahead.”
Kingdom of the Netherlands’ Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Liesje Schreinemacher said:
“To ease the current food and nutrition crisis, we must all increase our efforts. That’s why the Kingdom of the Netherlands invests in a new partnership with UNICEF to focus on the prevention of undernutrition among children, women and adolescents in Sub-Saharan Africa.”
CEO, Board Member of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Mark Suzman said:
“I’m encouraged by the unified response to today’s crisis, but it’s not enough for us to respond to this disaster. We must also do everything in our power to prevent the next one with long-term, sustainable investments. The foundation’s $20 million pledge to the UNICEF Child Nutrition Fund today doubles our previous commitment and will expand the fund’s focus to include life-saving nutrition products that prevent wasting for the most vulnerable. Together, we can create a future where every child can reach their full potential.”
CEO of the Eleanor Crook Foundation William Moore said:
"The Eleanor Crook Foundation is proud to be part of this incredible coalition of funders and make an additional commitment to combat the worsening child wasting crisis. With cost-effective and life-saving treatments like ready-to-use therapeutic food available, no child should suffer or die of malnutrition. In life, there are no silver bullets, but when it comes to keeping malnourished children alive, RUTF is as close as one comes. I applaud all of the donors who have stepped up during this moment of global crisis and plea for others to come to the table. This is progress but it's not the finish line, and millions more children need our help."
Climate and environmental activist Greta Thunberg said:
“Millions of children are currently being affected by the floods in Pakistan and the drought in Somalia, the latest signs of an accelerating climate crisis. People in these countries have done next to nothing to contribute to the crisis, yet they are among the ones being affected the most. We must all do what we can to support emergency relief work on the ground, and call on our governments to stop ignoring the climate crisis and prevent further suffering.”
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Director, Humanitarian Services, Sharon Eubank said:
“The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is pleased to expand our long-term collaboration with UNICEF and pledge $5 million in support of the No Time to Waste Malnutrition campaign. This funding comes in small increments from hard-working families and from widows who have limited incomes and from little children themselves. It was given by Latter-day Saints so that mothers will have healthier pregnancies and births and they can offer therapeutic food and micronutrients to their children who might be at risk.”
President and CEO of King Philanthropies Kim Starkey said:
“At King Philanthropies, we deploy grants and impact investments to catalyze solutions at the intersection of climate change and extreme poverty. Malnutrition sits squarely and stubbornly at this intersection. Those who will be most affected by climate change are those in extreme poverty, who also suffer most significantly from malnutrition. These individuals did the least to cause climate change. Yet it gravely threatens their livelihoods in agriculture, food security, and the nutritional status of their families. Today, King Philanthropies enthusiastically says yes to this initiative to fight severe malnutrition and wasting.”

PRESS RELEASE
UNICEF Geneva Palais briefing note on the harrowing situation children face as floods continue to devastate Pakistan
This is a summary of what was said by UNICEF Pakistan Chief Field Officer in Balochistan, Gerida Birukila – to whom quoted text may be attributed - at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
GENEVA/ISLAMABAD, 20 September 2022 – “Next week marks a month since catastrophic floods uprooted more than 3.4 million children from their homes. The violent rapids have already claimed the lives of more than 550 children. Without a significant surge in support, we fear many more children will lose their lives.
“Even after three weeks, large parts of the flood-affected areas are still submerged under water. Many of the roads and bridges have either been washed away or damaged. Thousands of families in the 81 calamity-hit districts are still cut off and desperately need support. Families have no food, clean water or medicines.
“Lack of food means a lot of the mothers are now anaemic and malnourished and have very low-weight babies.
UNICEF has been on the ground since Day 1 supporting the Government of Pakistan’s flood response. Immediately following the floods, we dispatched US$ 1 million in prepositioned supplies, with an additional US$ 3million of supplies delivered and being dispatched to the worst affected districts. We have set up 71 mobile health camps, and have set up temporary learning centres to help children cope with trauma.
“The world needs to come together and help the children in Pakistan. Our funding appeal for US$ 39 million is still less than a third funded, and the needs of children will only continue to grow. Together we can save lives by delivering lifesaving health, nutrition, WASH, protection, and education services to every child in Pakistan who needs it the most.

Peace is a noble and necessary pursuit, and the only practical pathway to a better, fairer world for all people.
Yet in too many places, in too many contexts, we are failing the cause of peace.
The theme of this year’s International Day of Peace — “End Racism, Build Peace” — reminds us of the many ways racism poisons people’s hearts and minds and erodes the peace we all seek.
Racism robs people of their rights and dignity. It inflames inequalities and mistrust. And it pushes people apart, at a time when we should be coming together, as one human family, to repair our fractured world.
Instead of fighting each other, we should be working to defeat our true enemies: racism, poverty, inequality, conflict, the climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
We should tear down structures that sustain racism, and lift up human rights movements everywhere.
And we should drown out the vicious voices of hate speech with a united and sustained cry for truth, understanding and mutual respect.
On this important day, a time to observe 24 hours of non-violence and cease-fire, we renew our call for all people to do more than lay down their weapons.
We call on them to re-affirm the bonds of solidarity we share as human beings and get down to the business of building a better, more peaceful world.

UN Women, the Ministry of Law & Justice and the Bureau of International Narcotics & Law Enforcement Affairs Launch a New Programme: “TAHAFFUZ”
Islamabad, 14 September 2022: UN Women in collaboration with the Ministry of Law & Justice and completely funded by the Bureau of International Narcotics & Law Enforcement (INL) of the US Department of State, jointly launched the initiation of a programme “Preventing and Protecting Women from Violence through Enhanced Access to Justice and Services, TAHAFFUZ”. The programme, which focuses on preventing violence against women and enhancing their access to justice will be implemented in 5 districts of Punjab and Sindh, as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory from 2022 till 2024.
UN Women Deputy Country Representative Jacqui Ketunuti welcomed the distinguished participants and introduced the TAHAFFUZ programme to the audience. She said, “Building on the successes of the previous phase of this project, UN Women will address the issue of violence against women (VAW) through a holistic approach, targeting all the key stakeholders from government institutions, justice and security sector officials, as well as civil society. Using gender and social inclusion strategies, the programme will ensure VAW is addressed from all angles and institutions that facilitate women in accessing justice are strengthened to deliver accessible, quality and gender-responsive services.”
The programme aims to tackle the issue of violence against women (VAW) in a holistic way through evidence-based legislation & policy interventions, strengthening capacity of duty bearers, enhancing coordination and increasing awareness.
While addressing the National Launch Event of the Programme, INL Director Lori Antolinez said, “the U.S. government is awarding $1.5 million to UN Women to help Pakistani women better access justice and legal services via TAHAFFUZ. This continues years of INL’s support and partnership with the Pakistani government, Pakistani citizens, and UN Women. In 2016, INL was the sole funder for Phase One of the UN Women program, providing $3.5 million. Gender inclusivity and women’s empowerment in law enforcement and criminal justice is a top priority for INL in Pakistan.  INL supports programs to improve women’s access to justice through improved law enforcement response to gender-based violence.  More and better trained women law enforcement professionals mean superior delivery of justice to Pakistani women.”
During the life of the programme, TAHAFFUZ will strengthen capacity of law enforcement officials through improving knowledge and attitudes on gender, enhancing handling of cases of VAW along with improved coordination between security and justice sector stakeholders, forensic officers, and medical examiners.
In his keynote address, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Mr. Azam Nazeer Tarar highlighted the steps taken by the Government of Pakistan towards preventing and protecting women against violence. He thanked INL and UN Women for extending their support, said, “Many progressive laws have been enacted in Pakistan and a strong legislative framework exists – we need to make sure it is implemented in letter and spirit so that the citizens of our country, especially the women, are able to benefit from it. This programme will help create a safe and enabling environment for women and girls so that they may play an active role in national progress and sustainable development.”
Chairperson National Commission on the Status of Women, Ms. Nilofar Bakhtiar, MNA and Parliamentary Secretary, MOLJ Ms Mehnaz Akbar Aziz also spoke at the National Launch Event.
This year marks the 40-year anniversary of partnership between INL and Pakistan under the banner of “Justice, Security, and Prosperity,” with more than $1 billion invested over four decades by the United States government to improve public safety and enhance law enforcement, prosecutorial, and judicial capacity across Pakistan.

INL works in more than 60 countries to help combat crime and corruption; improve police institutions; and promote court systems that are fair and accountable. Find out more about INL at: http://www.state.gov/j/inl/.

UNICEF - PRESS RELEASE : PBC and UNICEF form Synergy to Promote Family-Friendly Policies at Workplace
PBC and UNICEF form Synergy to Promote Family-Friendly Policies at Workplace
Islamabad/Karachi, 13 September, 2022 - The Pakistan Business Council (PBC) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today, to promote gender equity and family-friendly policies in the workplace amongst 94 corporate members of PBC and 150 affiliate organizations.
The objective of this two-year partnership is to raise awareness on family-friendly policies in the workplace and in that regard, provide guidance and technical support to private sector companies.
Additionally, this partnership would help support the development of gender conducive and family-friendly workplaces and increases awareness about child rights and responsible business practices through events and public advocacy.
Emphasizing the need for businesses to acknowledge and incorporate family-friendly policies, said Mr. Ehsan Malik, Chief Executive Officer, PBC said, “Businesses are likely to attract and retain more female employees if they have a comprehensive maternity and childcare policies. PBC looks forward to partnering with UNICEF, to use their knowledge and expertise to advocate for better family-friendly policies in the private sector.”
Placing women and children at the heart of business practices is aligned with international principles on responsible business. PBC and UNICEF are collaborating to bring Pakistan in line and at par with global trends, norms and best practices.
“As the leading advocate for child rights in the world, UNICEF is committed and endeavours to protect families so their children could grow and develop to their full potential in a conducive environment,” said Mr. Abdullah A. Fadil UNICEF Representative in Pakistan.
“By enhancing family well-being through workplace policies, UNICEF and PBC will work together to secure more positive outcomes for children,” he added.
UNICEF works with the Government of Pakistan, civil society organizations and other partners in the country to advance children’s rights for their survival, protection, development and participation, guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Pakistan is a signatory.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON UNITED NATIONS
DAY FOR SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATION
12 September 2022
In this era of unprecedented challenge and upheaval, solutions lie in solidarity.
South-South and triangular cooperation are critical for developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate disruption, address the global health crisis, including COVID-19 recovery, and achieve all 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
It is important that Southern-led development solutions are shared far and wide.
South-South and triangular cooperation must play an ever-increasing role in resolving our common challenges.
But that does not absolve the wealthier nations of their responsibilities to work constructively with the developing world, especially to reduce growing inequalities between and within nations.
As we commemorate the United Nations Day for South-South Cooperation,
I encourage all nations and communities to redouble cooperation and build bridges to achieve an equitable and sustainable future for all.

To Build Forward Better, Recovery and Reconstruction must be Climate Resilient
Islamabad, 12 September 2022—UNDP Pakistan’s Resident Representative Knut Ostby is speaking tomorrow at the Geneva Press Briefing on the ongoing flood situation in Pakistan, UNDP’s role, and efforts required to help Pakistan Build Forward Better.
The briefing will be on Tuesday, 13 September 2022, between 1:30-2:30 pm (PST). The link will be shared tomorrow after the briefing.
Background:
The 2022 floods are a climate disaster on massive scale. One third of the country is submerged. Over 1,400 lives were lost. 33 million people have been affected; millions of people are homeless.
Half of all districts in Pakistan are reporting impact. 1.7 million houses were reportedly damaged or destroyed. Around 3.6 million acres of crops and orchards have also been affected to date.
This is clearly a disaster caused by climate change. Along with the humanitarian support, the recovery must start now, and recovery and reconstruction must be climate-smart.
The priority is to create the conditions to give people the means to restore their livelihoods so that they can get back on their feet. UNDP has already started working in this space, liaising with partners and the Government of Pakistan on the needs assessment. For early recovery, UNDP is also pivoting its existing programming.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE OZONE LAYER
UNITED NATIONS - MEDIA ADVISORY : World Leaders to Make Ambitious Commitments to Transform Education at UN Summit
16 September 2022
Today, we celebrate 35 years of the Montreal Protocol’s success in protecting the stratospheric ozone layer against synthetic chemicals that also cause climate heating.  Thanks to a global agreement, humanity has averted a major health catastrophe due to ultraviolet radiation pouring through a massive hole in the ozone layer.
The Montreal Protocol is a success because, when science discovered the threat we all faced, governments and their partners acted.  We adopted a global environmental agreement that has been universally ratified and decisively implemented.
The Montreal Protocol is a powerful example of multilateralism in action.  With the many problems facing the world – from conflicts to growing poverty, deepening inequality and the climate emergency – it is a reminder that we can succeed in working together for the common good.
The Montreal Protocol has already contributed to tackling the climate crisis.  By protecting plants from ultraviolet radiation, allowing them to live and store carbon, it has avoided up to an extra 1 degree Celsius of global warming.  The Protocol’s work to phase out climate-heating gases and improve energy efficiency through its Kigali Amendment can further slow climate disruption.
But, only by mirroring the cooperation and speedy action of the Montreal Protocol elsewhere can we stop the carbon pollution that is dangerously heating our world.  We have a choice: collective action or collective suicide.
On this International Day, let us pledge to emulate the cooperation shown by the Montreal Protocol to end the climate crisis and all our common challenges.  And let us continue to back the Montreal Protocol’s essential work.

World Leaders to Make Ambitious Commitments to Transform Education at UN Summit
New York, 9 September – The UN Secretary-General is convening Heads of State and Government, together with youth, non-governmental actors and the private sector to a Summit on Transforming Education on 16, 17 and 19 September 2022, during the 77th session of the UN General Assembly. The Summit is a key initiative of Our Common Agenda launched by the Secretary-General in September 2021.
WHY:
More than 90% of the world’s children have had their education interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Other crises — conflicts, a shrinking economy, the energy crunch and food insecurity — have deepened the global education crisis, which in turn, is provoking severely negative consequences on many fronts. It is also threatening gains in the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals and in particular, Goal 4 on Education. The Transforming Education Summit will seek to regain lost time and renew the collective commitment to education and lifelong learning as a pre-eminent public good. The Summit will be approached through 5 key topics: Schools, Curricula and Lifelong Learning, Teachers, Digital Transformation and Education Finance.
OUTCOMES:
Key outcomes will include the UN Secretary-General’s Vision Statement on Transforming Education, as well as a Global Youth Declaration. In addition, and following months of consultations, Heads of State and Government will make national commitments on 19 September.
WHO:
All voices will be heard
The Leaders Day on 19 September will be preceded by engagements on Mobilization and Solutions on Friday, 16 and Saturday, 17 September respectively. The Mobilization Day on 16 September will be youth-led and youth-organized and will serve to convey the collective recommendations of youth on transforming education to decision and policymakers, informed by the Summit Youth Declaration. The Solutions Day on 17 September will provide a platform for partners, including UN agencies, NGOs, civil society organizations and private sector partners, to mobilize collective support to launch or scale up initiatives connected to the 5 Thematic Action Tracks. During the Leaders Day, a limited number of thematic sessions will be held to place a focus on cross-cutting priorities for transforming education.
WHEN:
16 September (9:30-18:00 EDT) The Mobilization Day
17 September (9:00-18:00 EDT) The Solutions Day
19 September (10:00 to 19:00 EDT) The Leaders Day

Secretary-General’s remarks following a briefing on the floods by Sindh province’s Chief Minister, Syed Murad Ali Shah
Sukkur, 10 September
It is difficult not to feel deeply moved when we hear such a detailed description of tragedy, of the loss of life, of destruction, the loss of property, the loss of livelihoods. Listening to you I see that there is no loss of hope. But that hope, to materialize, needs the international community to recognize three basic facts.
First, as you said, humanity has been waging war on nature, and nature strikes back. But nature strikes back in Sindh, but it was not Sindh that has made the emissions of greenhouse gases that have accelerated climate change so dramatically. So, there is a very unfair situation, in relation to the level of destruction that we are seeing, here, in Sindh.
And so, it is essential for the international community to understand three things, and obviously, developed countries have an absolutely key role to play in international financial institutions, joining them.
First is that Pakistan, including Sindh, need today massive financial support to overcome this crisis. And I've been saying – and you repeated it - this is not a matter of generosity, it's a matter of justice.
Second, we need to stop the madness with which we are treating nature. According to the scientific community, we need to reduce emissions by 45 per cent until 2030. I'm not talking about the end of the century, I’m not talking about 2050, I am talking about now. Now is the time to reduce emissions. This will be essential in the discussions in Cairo of the [COP27].
But the fact is that we are already living in a world where climate change is acting in such a devastating way. So, there must be massive support to what usually is called adaptation, which means to build resilient infrastructure and to support resilient communities and to create conditions for those that are in the hotspots of climate change. Pakistan is one of the hotspots of climate change. For those countries to be able to prepare for the next disaster and to be able to resist the next disaster, this needs a huge investment and this investment needs to be provided.
That's why we are asking for a strong increase in the financing for adaptation, of resilient infrastructure. At the same time, there has not yet, until now, been a serious discussion -about conditions for a serious discussion- on loss and damage.
And then, I would like to say that what the UN is doing in Pakistan is a drop in the ocean of what is needed. We are perfectly aware of our limited capacity and resources. But one thing you can be absolutely sure, we are in total solidarity with the Pakistani people. We will do everything we can, not only to use our limited capacities, but to raise awareness and to request those that have the capacity to support Pakistan - to request that they do it, they do it now, they do it massively, and that they do it also looking into the preparation of this country to face future challenges, to be able to protect the population when those future challenges are coming.
Our commitment, our very strong and emotional solidarity is something you can count on.
Thank you very much.

Remarks by the Secretary-General following meeting with “first responders” - citizens who volunteered to help their community in the floods’ aftermath
Larkana, 10 September
Ladies and gentlemen,
I was extremely impressed by what you have told us today. You have shown an enormous courage, an enormous generosity and you are true symbols of solidarity.
I can imagine each one of you, with the monsoon coming, with great stress, your house destroyed and you in danger. You were able, not only to think about yourselves, but to think about the others, and to help rescue the others. That is a fantastic example for the world.
I had, during my visit, excellent briefings by the different centres in Islamabad, in Sukkur and in my visit to Balochistan. I heard all the numbers: the number of people that died, cattle that died, number of people needing assistance, all the numbers. It was very well presented, which means that those that are coordinating the response know exactly what they are doing.
But your testimony is much more important. It’s not about numbers, it’s about people, about the farmers that have lost their crops, about those that have lost members of their family, about those that have seen their houses destroyed, about those that have lost their cattle, about those that have no money to pay the loans that they have contracted to be able to plant.
It was these people that each one of you was rescuing, helping to escape these horrible floods.
Unfortunately, now in the world, there are many people who are selfish and only think about themselves. But I know if we use your example of solidarity, generosity and courage, to ask the world to have the same attitude in support of Pakistan, for Pakistan to be able to help all those I have described and that are suffering so much.
You are helping your neighbour.
In the world - this is only one world - so the neighbours in general of Pakistan need to be as generous are you were with your neighbours.
Thank you very much for your work that was very important.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
PRESS CONFERENCE WITH FOREIGN MINISTER OF PAKISTAN
10 September 2022, Karachi, Pakistan
[as delivered]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of the media.
We have declared war on nature. And, as we see here in Pakistan, nature is striking back, with devastating consequences.
Climate change is super-charging the destruction of our planet.
I have seen many humanitarian disasters in the world, but I have never seen climate carnage on this scale. I have simply no words to describe what I have seen today: a flooded area that is three times the total area of my own country, Portugal.
Over 1,300 lives were lost. Tens of millions of people homeless. One-third of this vast country submerged. Livestock and crops wiped out.
But behind these numbers lie unquantifiable depths of human suffering.
But I have also seen great heights of human endurance and heroism – from emergency workers to ordinary people helping their neighbors.
Of course, we can quote numbers that are appalling, but this is a question about people who suffer: the families that have lost their houses, or members of the family. The farmers who have lost their crops or their livestock. Those who no longer have the livelihoods they need to sustain their lives.
At the same time, the most emotional moment for me during this visit was to listen to a group of women and men who have sacrificed their possessions, the possibility to rescue things from their own houses. They left everything to help neighbours to be rescued, to help neighbours to come out of houses that were falling apart, and to be able to reach safety with them.
This extraordinary generosity of poor people has touched me deeply and I hope this example will be followed by all those in the world that have power to support Pakistan in this hour of need.
I want to pay tribute to the gigantic efforts of the Pakistani authorities – civilian and military, national and regional.
I also want to thank the civil society, humanitarian organizations and also my UN colleagues who have rushed in. I also want to take profit to thank all those donors who have started to support Pakistan in this terrible hour.
The needs are enormous – and I urge massive and urgent financial support for Pakistan. And this is not just a question of solidarity or generosity. It is a question of justice. Pakistan is paying the price of something that was created by others.
I have called this a monsoon on steroids, and there is nothing natural about disasters of this scale.
Climate change caused by human activity is supercharging storms and catastrophes in Pakistan, but also in Chad, the Horn of Africa with their terrible drought and the risk of famine, and beyond.
All these countries did not cause the problem – but they are paying the price.
These extreme weather events have the fingerprints of human activity all over them – specifically, the burning of fossil fuels heating our planet.
The G20 countries are responsible for 80 per cent of today’s emissions – 1 per cent, 80 per cent – and developed economies are responsible for the vast majority of greenhouse gases throughout history.
Here from Pakistan, I want to reinforce a clear point:
Wealthier countries are morally responsible for helping developing countries like Pakistan to recover from disasters like these, and to adapt, to build resilience to climate impacts that unfortunately will be repeated in the future.
As is painfully evident, those impacts are skyrocketing.
People living in high climate vulnerability conditions, including in South Asia, are 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts. Nearly half of humanity is now in this category, the overwhelming majority in the developing world.
As Pakistan is deluged, as famine stalks the Horn of Africa, rich countries must step up adaptation finance.
At least half of all climate finance must go to adaptation and climate resilience for countries like Pakistan to be able to face the next floods in a way that protects their citizens and protects their economy and their wealth.
All countries – with the G20 leading the way – must boost their national emissions reduction targets every year, until the world’s 1.5C temperature limit is guaranteed, and we are at risk of making it irreversibly impossible.
I have seen an epic human tragedy here in Pakistan, but I also have seen the future.
As our planet continues to warm, all countries will increasingly suffer losses and damage from climate beyond their capacity to adapt.
Today, it’s Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country, wherever you live.
This is a global crisis. As the [Foreign] Minister said, it demands a global response.
Thank you.

Secretary-General’s Remarks to the press following meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the National Flood Response and Coordination Center in Islamabad
Islamabad, 9 September 2022
Prime Minister,
Allow me, first, a few words to the Pakistani people, and then to people around the world.
To the Pakistani people: I am no stranger to Pakistan. I have a love affair with your country since 17 years ago, when I started my functions as High Commissioner for Refugees.  I have always witnessed their enormous generosity, receiving at the [time] more than 6 million Afghan refugees, protecting, assisting them, sharing your meagre resources with them. I've seen your generosity, helping each other, helping family, helping communities.
When I came in 2005, because of the earthquake, when I came in 2010, because of the floods, and when I came later, during the dramatic incursion of terrorism around the Swat Valley and further, closer to Islamabad. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced, and I was there, with them.
And so, I know what it means for the Pakistani people, this unprecedented natural disaster. There is no memory of anything similar to what has happened with the impact of climate change on Pakistan. And I want to reassure you, that we'll do everything possible to mobilize the international community, to support your country, and to support all of you in this very dramatic situation in which, beyond the numbers - the numbers are appalling - but beyond the numbers, I see the families that have lost their loved ones. I see the families that lost their houses. I see the families that lost their crops. I see the families that lost their jobs, and that are living in desperate conditions at the present moment.
I have seen the enormous effort, that response from civil servants, the government, from the army, from the NGOs, from the population, even an extraordinary demonstration of solidarity within the provinces of Pakistan.
And I want to say a few words to the international community. Pakistan needs massive financial support to respond to these crises that have costed, according to some estimates that I've heard today, about $30 billion, and counting.
That support is entirely necessary. And it is not a matter of solidarity. It's a matter of justice. Pakistan has not contributed in a meaningful way to climate change. The level of emissions in this country is relatively low. But Pakistan is one of the most dramatically impacted countries by climate change. It is on the front lines of the impact of climate change. It is absolutely essential that this is recognized by the international community, especially by those countries that have contributed more to climate change. And that effective solidarity, effective justice is now shown by mobilizing massive support for relief, for rehabilitation or for reconstruction after these devastating impacts of the monsoon, of accelerated melting glaciers.
At the same time, this is the moment to say that we are heading into a disaster. We have waged war on nature and nature is striking back and striking back in a devastating way. Today in Pakistan, tomorrow in any of your countries.
We need to stop the increase in emissions and start reducing them now. At the same time, we need to mobilize much more resources to support those countries that need to build resilience. It is what is called adaptation that need to create the conditions to resist to the impact of these devastating disasters caused by climate change.
And at the same time, as a matter of justice to put seriously on the table in the next Conference of States Parties to the convention [on climate change], the question of loss and damage that is something that has been, [until] now, not discussed seriously in international climate talks. This is a time to mobilize the efforts of everybody to mitigate climate change. And this is the time to mobilize every group of people to support massively the Pakistani people in this dramatic moment.

Secretary-General’s remarks at press conference with the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari
Islamabad, 9 September 2022
Ladies and gentlemen of the media, good afternoon.
I’m here to express my deep solidarity with the Pakistani people over the devastating loss of life, human suffering and physical damage caused by this year’s floods. A problem of the densification of climate change.
Today, I was briefed by Prime Minister Sharif, Foreign Minister Bhutto, and other senior members of the government on the latest developments.
Some regions of Pakistan have just experienced their wettest August on record. And rainfall in some provinces was up to eight times higher than usual. Climate change is there.
Tomorrow, I will see the impact of the floods in different areas of the country.
But we have all seen media images of the extraordinary destruction. I can only imagine the power and ferocity of the water as it bore down on villages, roads, bridges and everything else in its path. It was clearly terrifying – a wall of water.
My heart goes out to everyone who has lost loved ones in this tragedy, and all those who have been affected by the loss of their homes, their businesses and their livelihoods.
I visited Pakistan many times when I was High Commissioner for Refugees. Pakistan hosts one of the most effective and generous refugee operations of the world, in support of millions of Afghans.
So, this is not my first visit to Pakistan. I have a love affair with the Pakistani people for 17 years. I was, in 2005, talking to the victims of the earthquake. I remember the devastation of floods in 2010. And I remember being with displaced people when you had these terrorist attacks going down in the Swat Valley and coming close to Islamabad and seeing how dramatic their situation is. And, many times, in Balochistan, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, I saw how [Pakistani] communities would generously host Afghan refugees. And one thing I have always discovered in Pakistan, was the way people would support other people. Pakistanis or Afghans, communities would support other communities with an enormous sense of generosity and solidarity.
And so, it is very emotional for me to see the level of suffering that so many Pakistanis are having at the present moment. Because it is heartbreaking to see such a generous people going through this crisis.
No country deserves this fate, but particularly not countries like Pakistan that have done almost nothing to contribute to global warming.
Pakistan and other developing countries, from the Horn of Africa to the Sahel, are paying a horrific price for the intransigence of big emitters that continue to bet on fossil fuels, in the face of science, common sense and basic human decency.
Even today, emissions are rising as people die in floods and famines.
This is insanity. This is collective suicide.
From Pakistan, I am issuing a global appeal: stop the madness; end the war with nature; invest in renewable energy now.
And as the crisis gathers pace, it’s clear that most countries are nowhere near prepared.
Developed countries must step up and provide Pakistan and other countries on the frontlines with the financial and technical resources they need to survive extreme weather events like these deadly floods.
Half of all climate finance must go to adaptation and resilience in the developing world. Developed countries must produce a credible roadmap to back their commitment to double their financial support.
Loss and damage from the climate crisis is not a future event. It is happening now, all around us. I urge governments to address this issue at COP 27 with the seriousness it deserves.
Ladies and gentlemen of the media,
The United Nations is on the ground to support the Pakistani government’s relief efforts. We and the civil society are making good use of the funds released from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund, and we are stepping up our efforts through an air bridge from Dubai.
Our people have delivered food or cash assistance to hundreds of thousands of people in Balochistan and Sindh, tons of emergency supplies to support children and women. But let’s be clear, what we have done is a drop in the ocean of the needs of the Pakistani people.
Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are living in camps, and many more – 6 million, as far as I know, are with host communities, that are sharing everything with them.
An important reason for my visit is to draw the attention of the international community to this climate catastrophe, and to appeal for massive support. Pakistan needs massive financial support for the relief and then, for the recovery.
And, as I said this morning – and I repeat- this is not a matter of solidarity or generosity; it is a matter of justice.
Before I conclude, allow me to say a few words about the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second.
On behalf of the United Nations, I extend my sincere condolences to the Queen’s family and to the people of the United Kingdom and the wider Commonwealth.
Queen Elizabeth exemplified the values of calmness, dignity, and grace. For as long as I can remember, she has been a reassuring presence on the global stage.
Thank you.
Q: [On compensation for losses because of the historical policies of industrialized countries that are contributing to global warming.]
SG: Well, it is obvious that there are a number of countries in the world – we calculate about 15 hotspots - where countries are particularly vulnerable and are already paying a heavy price in relation to climate change.
Climate change is not a problem of the future. Climate change is a problem of today.  It is happening, people are suffering. And that is why I said in my intervention, and I repeat now, the questions of loss and damage need to be seriously discussed. And that discussion that I hope will take place in the COP in Cairo, hopefully will be translated by an effective support from the developed world to the most impacted developing countries to build resilience and to adapt to the circumstances that were created by others. That is why this is not a matter of generosity; it is a matter of justice.
Q: [Is the Flash Appeal going to be enough?]
SG: When there is a crisis anywhere in the world, we issue in the next few days a so-called Flash Appeal and the Flash Appeal has not as an objective to gather the funds to solve the problem. It has as an objective to raise some funds to start being able to act. We need much more than what was in that Flash Appeal and especially the Government of Pakistan must be supported directly by the international community.
We have discussed today the possibility of organizing, and we are ready to organize it together with the Pakistani Government – of course, this is a decision for the Pakistani Government to take - as soon as there is a clear assessment of the needs - mostly in relation to relief but also in relation to really mitigation and reconstruction to organize an international conference aiming at global mobilization of support to Pakistan at the levels which are many billions - let's be clear - at the levels that will be necessary to solve the problem.
Flash Appeals are something that we launch in any circumstances in the world just to allow for agencies to start providing the minimum relief as the first step.
Q: [On donor’s conference; would other governments be generous enough?]
SG: Of course, I am worried [by] the fact that we're witnessing some reductions in official development aid. We have several of our operations severely underfunded. So, there is a concern in relation to that. But this is not a usual event. This is an unprecedented event.
And so, I think these will first of all, help us put again climate change in the front line of international agenda. Climate change has been losing ground in international agenda, both in relation to political development and in relation to even the media coverage. And it's absolutely essential to put it again in its national agenda because climate change is the defining issue of our time. And based on that I have hopes that a conference – being able to show- I mean the images are absolutely, I mean, appalling. I believe a conference will be able to [raise] consciousness that people work and to mobilize the support that is needed.
This support is not only thinking about these floods.  Let's not forget that monsoons have not ended, that the melting of glaciers will go on and for a number of years will still increase. So, we need to support Pakistan, to be prepared for the future - not only to respond to the present crisis.
Q: [On possibility of debt write off for Pakistan.]
SG: If there is anything, I have been talking all the time - especially since the beginning of the COVID - is the absolute need to have effective mechanisms of debt relief for developing countries that are on the verge of financial collapse.
We had just one initiative, as you remember, the suspension of the payment of debt now for two years, for least developed countries, but there are no mechanisms of debt relief. There is a framework that has been very slow, and only three countries applied because it's not effective at all. And there are no mechanisms of debt relief in place, especially for middle income countries.
And this is something I've been putting as much as I can in the agenda of the G7 and the G20 of the meetings of the IMF and World Bank.  I will not stop this campaign because I think it's absolutely essential. The risks for the world of a group of countries having defaults would be extremely high.
We discussed today some creative ideas that we are trying to put on the table in different scenarios, namely, in relation to climate change.
One of those ideas, that I very much cherish and we are trying to promote as we speak, is in relation to debt swaps for investments in adaptation, which means the country, instead of paying its debt, invests that money in transition for a green economy and in building resilience against the impacts of climate change.
This idea was born in our discussions with small island developing states that are, as you know, some of the most impacted countries in the world and some of them risk to disappear. And we are making a strong campaign with those that have power in the international financial institutions to adopt as a practice instruments of debt relief and an improvement of our climate action, the possibility that these swaps instead of paying the debt, you invest in adaptation to a green economy.
Q: [How can Pakistanis trust that United Nations will help?]
SG: If there is something that the United Nations, and me in particular, have been insisting very strongly in the last few years is the absolute need of developed countries to fully fulfill their commitments in the Paris Agreement in relation to support to developing countries.
We were behind the campaign that was made for adaptation to be taken seriously and that led to the promise – let’s see what happens to the promise – of $40 billion per year in support for adaptation in developing countries, and we are in the first line of putting in the agenda of the COP - loss and damage. So, we are really doing everything we can to push those issues in the agenda and to pressure for them to happen.
But it is not the United Nations that decides those things. It is Member States themselves, and it is the international financial institutions that manage to a certain extent, if management is the right word to [use] - the global financial system. And if there is something that I have been saying loud and clear, it is that our global financial system is morally bankrupt.
Q: [On Jammu and Kashmir; is Secretary-General ready to mediate?]
SG: As a matter of fact, if there is something that I have been always offering, it is my good offices in mediation.
But as you know, the Indian side considers that this is a bilateral matter to be solved only by Pakistan and India, and the mediation of the United Nations has not been accepted until now.
On the other hand, we have been very active in relation to the clear affirmation that human rights must be respected.

UNSG Guterres applauds efforts of Government and people of Pakistan, and calls for substantial and sustained support and solidarity from the international community to overcome the enormous challenges posed by the unprecedented climate-induced floods in Pakistan
United Nations Secretary-General (UNSG) Antonio Guterres visited Pakistan on 9-10 September 2022 to show solidarity with the people of Pakistan, braving a colossal climate-induced natural disaster caused by unprecedented rains and floods across the country. The two-day visit comprised high-level meetings, briefings, interactions with displaced people, first responders, UN country representatives, civil society and media.
The UNSG called on Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif. Several members of the Federal Cabinet joined the meeting. The PM expressed his gratitude for the Secretary-General’s personal attention to situation arising from the floods and greatly appreciated his visit and concern for the affected people. The PM informed the UNSG about the efforts of the Government of Pakistan in addressing the daunting challenges posed by the flash floods, including the provision of Rs.35 billion cash relief through Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), rescue and relief operations, and delivery of humanitarian assistance in coordination with all national stakeholders and with support of international partners. While appreciating the UNSG’s video message for the UN Flash Appeal, the PM highlighted that with less than 1% of global carbon emission Pakistan is facing brunt of natural calamities in the form of heat waves, glacial outbursts, droughts, torrential rains and unprecedented monsoons. The PM called for urgent mitigation and adaptation efforts in addition to mobilizing support for recovering and rebuilding from such extreme climate events.
The UNSG said that countries like Pakistan, who have done almost nothing to contribute to global warming, do not deserve this. He added, “I know how volunteers, civil servants, army, NGOs have been working together in a remarkable way to mitigate the suffering of Pakistani people”. The UNSG stated, “My voice is at the service of Government and people of Pakistan. I have seen the enormous generosity of Pakistanis in protecting and assisting more than 6 million Afghan refugees and helping each other in previous calamities such as during the earthquake and floods. My admiration for this country is limitless”. He assured that the UN would do everything in its capacity to help people of Pakistan. The UNSG appealed to the international community to provide massive support to Pakistan for not only relief assistance but also for rehabilitation and climate resilient reconstruction. He emphasized that it was not just a matter of solidarity but a matter of justice, as countries like Pakistan who have not contributed to climate change are amongst the frontline countries impacted by climate change.
The UNSG was briefed on the overall ground situation, humanitarian activities and coordination amongst national and international stakeholders at the National Flood Response and Coordination Centre (NFRCC). The PM and the UNSG also had a joint presser.
The UNSG held delegation level talks with Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, followed by a joint press stakeout. A broad range of issues related to the recent floods and climate change came under discussion. The FM noted that one-third of the country was inundated, around 33 million people affected across the country, over 1300 lives lost including more than 400 children, nearly 800,000 livestock perished, more than 1.7 million houses and 6000 km of roads have been destroyed or damaged. The Foreign Minister said that though the people impacted by the floods have made no contribution to the climate change, they were suffering the most due to it, and therefore, it was the shared responsibility of the international community to do its utmost to assist the millions of affectees to return to normal lives and livelihoods in a sustainable manner. The FM emphasised that it was critical that the momentum on the Flash Appeal, which was jointly launched by the Government of Pakistan and the UN, was sustained and looked forward to the UNSG’s support in further mobilizing the international community for the subsequent phase of sustainable rehabilitation and reconstruction.
The UNSG stressed that an important reason for his visit was to draw the attention of the international community to this climate catastrophe and to appeal for massive support for Pakistan. UNSG told the reporters, “I’m here to express my deep solidarity with the Pakistani people over the devastating loss of life and human suffering caused by this year’s floods”. The Secretary General said that it was not only a matter of solidarity but a matter of justice. The UNSG reiterated that “today it is Pakistan, tomorrow it can be anywhere else”. The UNSG commended the Government of Pakistan’s strong leadership in the flood response efforts and reiterated the United Nations’ engagement to continue supporting the government’s relief efforts. He reaffirmed his commitment to galvanizing international support for the people of Pakistan through the recently launched Flash Appeal and Floods Response Plan and shared that funds have been released from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). The UN Secretary-General thanked the Government and the Foreign Minister for the facilitation provided to support international partners to scale up their efforts in support of Pakistan.
The Secretary General reaffirmed full support and cooperation of the UN both for ongoing humanitarian relief work as well as for long term recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. The Secretary General discussed various ideas for mobilizing finance and for enhancing fiscal space for Pakistan’s efforts to rehabilitate and reconstruct. Both sides exchanged views on how to reinforce climate action, with special emphasis on supporting the adaptation efforts of developing countries through debt swaps.
The UNSG, accompanied by the PM and the FM, visited flood affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan including Sukkur, Larkana, Mohenjo Daro, and Usta Muhammad, where he was given an overview of the rescue and relief efforts of the Government of Pakistan and national and international partners. The UNSG got first-hand assessment of the on-ground situation by the displaced people, civil society, first responders and others. The FM shared deep appreciation and acknowledgement of UNSG’s visit and efforts for international awareness raising, show of solidarity with the Pakistani nation, and mobilization of necessary support from the global community.

UNDP - PRESS RELEASE : UNDP and USAID Award Scholarships to Women Lawyers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

UNDP and USAID Award Scholarships to Women Lawyers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Peshawar, 8 August 2022 – UNDP and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) awarded scholarships to ten women law students and stipends to ten women lawyers in a ceremony today. The event was organized by UNDP and Khyber Pakthunkhwa (KP) Bar Council. The scholarships and stipends will help the recipients to complete their legal studies and post-graduation apprenticeships.
At the ceremony, UNDP also handed over 824 law books and 64 sets of law criminal and civil law journals to the libraries of district bar associations in Orakzai, Kurram, North Waziristan, and South Waziristan. These will generate new knowledge and skills among lawyers to deliver quality legal counsel and advice to litigants in the Merged Districts of KP province.
Since 2012, UNDP has supported women lawyers and law students across 18 District and Tehsil Bar Associations in KP and Merged Areas. UNDP has also trained more than 800 legal professionals who are members of the KP Bar Council including 75 women lawyers on gender justice and gender-responsive justice delivery. UNDP undertakes this work to encourage and empower more women to enter the legal profession in this region, where women are significantly under-represented in the justice sector.
The event was also attended by Mr. Muhammad Ali Jadoon, Vice Chairperson, KP Bar Council and Ms. Chamila Hemmathagama, Programme Manager, Rule of Law Programme, UNDP, and representatives from the District Bar Associations.
In his address, Mr. Muhammad Ali Jadoon, Chairperson, KP Bar Council, extended his gratitude to UNDP and USAID for their efforts to strengthen District Bar Associations to improve access to justice for all. He also congratulated the scholarship and stipend recipients and assured them that the, “KP Bar Council and Bar Associations will do their very best to ensure a gender-responsive and safer working environment for the women lawyers.”
Ms. Chamila Hemmathagama, Programme Manager, UNDP Rule of Law Programme, also appreciated and thanked the KP Bar Council and USAID for their long-term partnership and support in this important work to empower women lawyers in the region. “I hope the scholarships and stipends awarded today will allow the recipient women lawyers and law students to succeed in their chosen careers as legal professionals and inspire more women to join this noble profession in years to come. We must continue to work together in creating a supportive environment for more women to play an active role in the justice sector in the Merged Areas as well as make justice accessible to all regardless of one's gender or social status.”
The UNDP Pakistan’s Rule of Law Programme is implementing a range of interventions to strengthen security and justice sector governance in Pakistan.

UNDP - PRESS RELEASE : Multiple crises halt progress as 9 out of 10 countries fall backwards in human development, UNDP report warns
Floods in Pakistan: 350,000 USD from UNESCO for heritage recovery
Paris and Islamabad, 8 September 2022 – Today, as UN Secretary-General António Guterres started a three-day visit to Pakistan, UNESCO announced the mobilization of an emergency amount of 350,000 USD to help recovering flood-damaged cultural heritage sites. The Organization is also working in the field of education, to quickly provide distance learning solutions.
UNESCO is deeply concerned by severe and unprecedented monsoon rainfall, which has caused widespread flooding and landslides in 72 districts across Pakistan since June 2022. Around 33 million people have been impacted, and some 6.4 million people are currently in need of assistance. The floods have resulted in a significant loss of life, as well as loss of livelihoods, shelter and social and cultural life.
“First of all, our thoughts are with the families who have lost a loved one, the injured, all those who have been forced to leave their homes and with the authorities. UNESCO stands with them,” said Audrey Azoulay, Director-General.
Cultural heritage has also been damaged by the floods, including the UNESCO World Heritage sites ‘Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro’ and ‘Historical Monuments at Makli, Thatta’. Karez in Balochistan, a traditional irrigation system on Pakistan’s World Heritage Tentative List, the Amri site museum and the Sehwan folk and craft museum, both in the Jamshoro District, have also been reported as damaged by the recent floods.
Supporting national recovery plans and local cultural practices
“As part of its mandate, UNESCO will provide assistance to restore this heritage”, announced Audrey Azoulay. “Based on needs analysis conducted by our office in Islamabad, we decided to mobilize right now 350,000 dollars from our heritage and emergency funds.”
·        150,000 USD from the World Heritage Fund to support recovery and prevention measures at Moenjodaro and Thatta World Heritage sites, including long-term mitigation of the impact of natural disasters.
·        200,000 USD from the Heritage Emergency Fund for cultural heritage, cultural practices and intangible heritage elements at risk in the Balochistan, Swat and Larkana districts.
Cultural practices, such as crafts and music, which are often an important source of income, have also been severely disrupted. The UNESCO foreseen activities will aim to support not only the national response plans but also the knowledge bearers, artisans, crafts people and artists who have lost their livelihoods due to the floods on the other.
The UNESCO office in Islamabad is also working with the authorities of Pakistan to rapidly provide distance learning solutions to ensure continuity of education. UNESCO headquarters has already mobilized 50,000 USD to finance the actions will be implemented, in particular in the province of Sindh.

Multiple crises halt progress as 9 out of 10 countries fall backwards in human development, UNDP report warns
8 September 2022 – Islamabad: The world is lurching from crisis to crisis, trapped in a cycle of firefighting and unable to tackle the roots of the troubles that confront us. Without a sharp change of course, we may be heading towards even more deprivations and injustices, warns the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The latest Human Development Report, “Uncertain Times, Unsettled Lives: Shaping our Future in a Transforming World”, launched today by UNDP, argues that layers of uncertainty are stacking up and interacting to unsettle life in unprecedented ways. The last two years have had a devastating impact for billions of people around the world, when crises like COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine hit back-to-back, and interacted with sweeping social and economic shifts, dangerous planetary changes, and massive increases in polarization.
For the first time in the 32 years that UNDP have been calculating it, the Human Development Index, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standard of living, has declined globally for two years in a row. Human development has fallen back to its 2016 levels, reversing much of the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
The reversal is nearly universal as over 90 percent of countries registered a decline in their HDI score in either 2020 or 2021 and more than 40 percent declined in both years, signaling that the crisis is still deepening for many.
While some countries are beginning to get back on their feet, recovery is uneven and partial, further widening inequalities in human development. Latin America, the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have been hit particularly hard.
“The world is scrambling to respond to back-to-back crises. We have seen with the cost of living and energy crises that, while it is tempting to focus on quick fixes like subsidizing fossil fuels, immediate relief tactics are delaying the long-term systemic changes we must make,” says Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “We are collectively paralyzed in making these changes. In a world defined by uncertainty, we need a renewed sense of global solidarity to tackle our interconnected, common challenges.”
The report explores why the change needed isn’t happening and suggests there are many reasons, including how insecurity and polarization are feeding off each other today to prevent the solidarity and collective action we need to tackle crises at all levels. New calculations show, for instance, that those feeling most insecure are also more likely to hold extreme political views.
“Even before COVID-19 hit, we were seeing the twin paradoxes of progress with insecurity and polarisation. Today, with one-third of people worldwide feeling stressed and fewer than a third of people worldwide trusting others, we face major roadblocks to adopting policies that work for people and planet,” says Achim Steiner. “This thought-provoking new analysis aims to help us break this impasse and chart a new course out of our current global uncertainty. We have a narrow window to re-boot our systems and secure a future built on decisive climate action and new opportunities for all.”
To chart a new course, the report recommends implementing policies that focus on investment — from renewable energy to preparedness for pandemics, and insurance—including social protection— to prepare our societies for the ups and downs of an uncertain world. While innovation in its many forms—technological, economic, cultural—can also build capacities to respond to whatever challenges come next.
“To navigate uncertainty, we need to double down on human development and look beyond improving people’s wealth or health,” says UNDP’s Pedro Conceição, the report’s lead author. “These remain important. But we also need to protect the planet and provide people with the tools they need to feel more secure, regain a sense of control over their lives and have hope for the future.”

UNHCR - PRESS RELEASE : UNHCR hands over thousands of tents, other emergency relief items to Sindh government
UNHCR hands over thousands of tents, other emergency relief items to Sindh government
KARACHI, 6 September 2022: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has handed over thousands of tents and other emergency relief items to the Sindh government,t which will benefit hundreds of thousands of flood-affected people in the province.
The first three of nine scheduled flights arrived on Monday in Pakistan – with the other six scheduled this week. UNHCR trucks carrying relief items are also on the road from Uzbekistan, with more convoys scheduled. Emergency relief items are being transported from Peshawar, which has already reached Sukkur Humanitarian Response Facilities.
A total of 18,800 tents, 310,000 blankets, 76,000 buckets, 56,500 jerrycans, 67,500 plastic tarpaulins, 112,000 Sleeping mats, 150,000, mosquito nets, 140,000 Solar Lamps, 24,700 kitchen sets, 32,000 Sanitary napkins, 4,500 Soap and 3,500 Dignity Kits are being given to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority in Sindh province.
UNHCR’s Assistant Representative for Protection, Leyla Nugmanova called on Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah. The CM’s team briefed the UNHCR officials about the current situation in various flood-affected districts and the damage it caused.
The UNHCR Representative and Director General of PDMA, Syed Salman Sha,h signed a memorandum to hand over the items for immediate distribution to people affected by the floods.
The Sindh chief minister welcomed UNHCR’s contribution, terming it timely and important as needs are massive. The world is yet to understand the scale of this disaster and the devastation by floods.
“UNHCR is lending all possible support to Pakistan in this hour of need,’’ said Leyla Nugmanova, UNHCR Assistant Representative for Protection in Pakistan.
“Based on our forty years of partnership and Pakistan’s extraordinary generosity for refugees, we cannot let the country and its people handle this colossal tragedy alone. The world has to understand what the people in Pakistan are going through and has to step in to help fast,” she added.
UNHCR has been part of the monsoon response since July, when the agency started to provide relief items and assistance for refugees and host communities. In addition, UNHCR directly provided tents to the flood-affected refugees and host communities through its partners.

UNICEF Geneva Palais briefing note on the impact of the Pakistan floods on children and families and UNICEF’s response
This is a summary of what was said by UNICEF Pakistan Representative Abdullah Fadil – to whom quoted text may be attributed - at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
GENEVA/ISLAMABAD,2 September 2022 – “Over the past few weeks, torrential monsoon rains have broken a century-long record and dumped more than five times the 30-year average for rainfall in some provinces, killing more than 1200 people, including about 400 children, while washing away or damaging over 1.1 million houses and destroying vital infrastructure children rely on to access essential services, such as schools and hospitals. At least 18,000 schools have been damaged or destroyed across the country due to the floods. We estimate that 16 million children are impacted and 3.4 million of these children are in need of humanitarian support.
“Exacerbating this horrendous situation, many of the 72 hardest-hit districts were already amongst the most vulnerable ones in Pakistan. 40 per cent of children were already suffering from stunting before the floods hit. Many children are now at heightened risk, without a home, school, or even safe drinking water.
“There is therefore a risk of many more child deaths. And the situation will only continue to deteriorate as winter is just 8 weeks away in some parts of the country.
“There is now a high risk of water-borne, deadly diseases spreading rapidly -- diarrhoea, cholera, dengue, malaria. Without adequate sanitation, communities are increasingly having to resort to open defecation, putting them at high risk of contracting diseases.
“Relief and rescue operations are still extremely hard to carry-out - around 160 bridges and 5,000 kilometres (3,200 miles) of roads have been destroyed or damaged, 3.5 million acres of crops affected and about 800,000 livestock lost. Yet lifesaving rescue and relief efforts are indispensable, and UNICEF is distributing humanitarian supplies in all affected provinces.
“In terms of UNICEF’s response, we have already delivered immediate emergency services and supplies worth over USD $2 million, including drinking water, water purification tablets, hygiene kits, medicines, vaccines, therapeutic food for children, pregnant and lactating women, and mosquito nets.
“In the coming days and weeks, we aim to reach children and families first with lifesaving medical equipment, essential medicines, vaccines and safe delivery kits, safe drinking water and water-treating tablets, and sanitation supplies, nutrition supplies, mosquito nets.  We also want to help children resume learning and will support the Government to reestablish critical services for children as soon as possible.
“Additional life-saving emergency medical and WASH supplies are expected to reach Pakistan from our hub in Copenhagen within days. But many more airlifts will be needed.
“In order to be able to achieve this, as part of the UN flash appeal of $160 million to support the flood response led by the Government of Pakistan, UNICEF is appealing for US$37 million to reach approximately 3.4 million children in need of life-saving support. UNICEF has launched flash appeals globally and members of the public and the private sector can make donations via the Pakistan appeals page of the UNICEF global https://www.unicef.org/appeals/pakistan.
“We urgently need these funds and resources to allow us to continue to provide lifesaving medical equipment, essential medicines, vaccines, safe drinking water, hygiene kits, mosquito nets and delivery kits, as well as funds to ensure service outreach for delivery.
“We know that any emergency like this runs the risk of increasing protection risks for children, undermining the resilience and psychosocial wellbeing of children and their parents, leaving many experiencing distress. Children are exposed to a wide range of new flood-related physical risks and hazards, including from damaged buildings, drowning in flood waters and snakes. Children with disabilities are experiencing increased vulnerability as access to essential services is disrupted. With the large numbers of displaced families, we must ensure that any children who become separated from their parents or caregivers are identified, protected and ultimately reunited with their families.
“The sad reality is, as we have seen all around the world, climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and more destructive, and it is children who are too often paying the price.
“Pakistan ranks 14th out of 163 countries on UNICEF’s Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI), placing the country in the 'Extremely high risk' classification category in the Index. Urgent climate action is absolutely critical to protect this and future generations.  As such, UNICEF urges world leaders, governments, and businesses around the world to listen to children and prioritise actions that protect them from impacts, while accelerating work to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

پاکستان  میں سیلاب سے بچوں  اور ان کے خاندانوں پر اثرات اور یونیسف کے اقدامات کے  متعلق یونیسف جنیوا پیلے میں منعقدہ  بریفنگ کا احوال
درج ذیل متن آج  جنیوا کے ’پیلے ڈیس  نیشنز‘ میں   یونیسف پاکستان کے نمائندے عبداللہ فاضل کی بریفنگ  کا خلاصہ ہے  اور یہ متن ان کے نام سے شائع کیا جاسکتا ہے
جنیوا۔ اسلام آباد۔ 2ستمبر 2022:   "گذشتہ چند ہفتوں میں، مون سون کی طوفانی بارشوں نے گزشتہ صدی کا ریکارڈ توڑ دیا ہے اور کچھ صوبوں میں 30 سال کی اوسط سے پانچ گنا زیادہ بارشیں ہوئی ہیں، جس سے تقریباً 400 بچوں سمیت 1200 سے زائد افراد ہلاک ہوئے ہیں، جبکہ 11لاکھ  سے زائد مکانات یا تو مکمل طور پر بہہ گئے ہیں یا ان کو نقصان پہنچا ہے،  اور بچوں کو ضروری خدمات فراہم کرنے والا اہم انفراسٹرکچر جیسا کہ  اسکول اور اسپتال بھی تباہ ہوچکا ہے ۔ سیلاب کی وجہ سے ملک بھر میں کم از کم 18ہزارا سکول تباہ ہو چکے ہیں یا انہیں نقصان پہنچا ہے۔ ہمارا اندازہ ہے کہ ایک کروڑ 60لاکھ  بچے متاثر ہوئے ہیں اور ان میں سے 34لاکھ  بچوں کو انسانی امداد کی ضرورت ہے۔‘‘
’’یہ  خوف ناک صورت حال اس طرح مزید  پیچیدہ ہوگئی ہے کہ ملک کے سب سے متاثرہ 72 اضلاع میں سے بیشتر پہلے ہی مختلف شدید خطرات سے دوچار تھے۔  سیلاب کی زد میں آنے سے پہلے ہی 40 فیصد بچے سٹنٹنگ کا شکار تھے۔ بہت سے بچے اب گھر، اسکول، یا یہاں تک کہ پینے کے صاف پانی  کی سہولیات سے محروم اور  شدید ترین  خطرات کی زد  میں ہیں۔‘‘
"اس لیے بہت سے بچوں کی موت کے خطرے کا بھی سامنا  ہے اور صورتحال مزید خراب ہوتی جارہی ہے، کیونکہ ملک کے کچھ حصوں میں سردیوں  کا موسم شروع ہونے میں صرف 8 ہفتے رہ گئے ہیں۔
"اس کے علاوہ اب  پانی سے پیدا ہونے والی، مہلک بیماریوں، اسہال ، ہیضہ، ڈینگی اور ملیریا کے تیزی سے پھیلنے کا خطرہ  بھی موجود ہے  ۔ مناسب صفائی ستھرائی کی سہولیات کی غیر دستیابی کی وجہ سے  لوگوں کو رفع حاجت کے  لیے کھلی جگہوں  کا استعمال   کرنا پڑ رہا ہے، جس سے انہیں بیماریاں لاحق ہونے کا خطرہ  مزید بڑ ھ رہا ہے۔‘‘
’’ امدادی   کارروائیوں کی انجام دہی اب بھی انتہائی مشکل ہے - تقریباً 160 پل اور 5,000 کلومیٹر (3,200 میل)  سڑکوں کو نقصان پہنچا ہے یا مکمل طور پر  تباہ ہو چکی ہیں، 35لاکھ ایکڑ  پر پھیلی ہوئی فصلیں متاثر ہوئی ہیں اور تقریباً 800,000 مویشی ضائع ہو گئے ہیں۔ اس کے باوجود  انسانی جانیں بچانا اور امدادی سرگرمیاں ناگزیر ہے، اور یونیسف تمام متاثرہ صوبوں میں انسانی بنیادوں پر سامان تقسیم کر رہا ہے۔‘‘
"یونیسف کی جانب سے امداد کے طور پر ، ہم نے پہلے ہی 20لاکھ  امریکی ڈالر سے زیادہ مالیت کی فوری ہنگامی خدمات اور سامان فراہم کر دیا ہے، جس میں پینے کا پانی، پانی صاف کرنے کی گولیاں، حفظان صحت کا سامان ، ادویات، ویکسین، بچوں، حاملہ اور دودھ پلانے والی خواتین کے لیے  دوا آور  خوراک، اور مچھر دانیاں  شامل ہیں۔‘‘
"آنے والے دنوں اور ہفتوں میں، ہم نے  بچوں اور خاندانوں تک سب سے پہلے جان بچانے والے طبی آلات، ضروری ادویات، ویکسین اور محفوظ ڈیلیوری کا سامان ، پینے کا صاف پانی اور پانی کو صاف کرنے والی گولیاں، صفائی کا سامان، خوراک، اور مچھر دانیاں  پہنچانی ہیں۔ ہم بچوں کی تعلیم  کو دوبارہ شروع کرنے میں بھی مدد کرنا چاہتے ہیں اور جلد از جلد بچوں کے لیے اہم خدمات دوبارہ شروع کرنے میں حکومت کی مدد کریں گے۔‘‘
’’امید ہے کہ اضافی جان بچانے والی ایمرجنسی میڈیکل اور صفائی کی  سپلائی کچھ دنوں میں ہمارے مرکز کوپن ہیگن سے پاکستان پہنچ جائے گی۔ لیکن مزید بہت  سی ائیر لفٹس کی ضرورت ہوگی۔‘‘
’’اس مقصد کے لیے، حکومت پاکستان کی رہنمائی  میں سیلاب سے نمٹنے کے لیے اقوام متحدہ کی 160 ملین ڈالر کی فلیش اپیل کے تحت، یونیسف تقریباً 34لاکھ  بچوں کی زندگیا ں بچانے اور ان  کو زندگی کی ضروریات کی فراہمی  کے لیے 37 ملین امریکی ڈالر کی اپیل کر رہا ہے۔ یونیسف نے عالمی سطح پر فلیش اپیلوں کا آغاز کیا ہے اور عوامی اور نجی شعبے کے اراکین یونیسیف گلوبل https://www.unicef.org/appeals/pakistan  کے پاکستان اپیل پیج کے ذریعے عطیات دے سکتے ہیں۔‘‘
"ہمیں فوری طور پر ان فنڈز اور وسائل کی ضرورت ہے تاکہ ہمیں زندگی بچانے والے طبی آلات، ضروری ادویات، ویکسین، پینے کا صاف پانی، حفظان صحت کا سامان ، مچھر دانیاں اور ڈلیوری کا سامان فراہم کرنے کے ساتھ ساتھ ا ن خدمات کو لوگوں تک پہنچانے کے لیے بھی فنڈز کی ضرورت ہے۔‘‘
"ہم جانتے ہیں کہ اس طرح کی کوئی بھی ہنگامی صورت حال بچوں کے تحفظ کو لاحق خطرات کو بڑھاتی ہے، بچوں اور ان کے والدین کی مشکلات کا سامنا کرنے کی قوت   اور نفسیاتی بہتری  کو نقصان پہنچاتی ہے، جس سے بہت سے لوگوں کو پریشانی کا سامنا کرنا پڑتا ہے۔ بچوں کو سیلاب سے متعلق جسم اور جان کو لاحق خطرات کے علاوہ بھی  تباہ شدہ عمارتوں، سانپوں اور سیلاب کے پانی میں ڈوبنے سمیت بہت سے  خطرات کا سامنا کرنا پڑتا ہے ۔ ضروری خدمات تک رسائی منقطع ہونے کی وجہ سے معذور بچوں کو اور زیادہ خطرے کا سامنا ہے۔ بے گھر ہونے والے خاندانوں کی بڑی تعداد کے پیش نظر ، ہمیں اس بات کو یقینی بنانا چاہیے کہ کوئی بھی بچہ جو اپنے والدین یا دیکھ بھال کرنے والوں سے بچھڑ جائے، اس کی شناخت ہو،  اور تحفظ کے ساتھ  بالآخر اس  کے خاندان سے واپس ملا دیا جائے۔‘‘
’’ہم نے پوری دنیا میں دیکھا ہے  اوریہ ایک افسوسناک حقیقت ہے کہ  موسمیاتی تبدیلی موسم کے تحت پیش آنے والے   شدید  واقعات  کی تعداد اور شدت کو مسلسل بڑھا رہی  ہے، اور اس کی قیمت اکثر یہ بچے  ادا کر رہے ہیں۔‘‘
"یونیسف کے چلڈرن کلائمیٹ رسک انڈیکس (CCRI) میں پاکستان 163 ممالک میں 14 ویں نمبر پر ہے، اس  انڈیکس  کے تحت پاکستان کی درجہ  بندی  'انتہائی زیادہ خطرے سے دوچار' کے زمرے میں کی گئی  ہے۔ موجودہ  اور آنے والی نسلوں کے تحفظ کے لیے ماحول کے تحفظ کے لیے فوری اقدامات اٹھانے کی ضرورت  ہے  ۔ اسی طرح، یونیسف عالمی رہنماؤں، حکومتوں اور دنیا بھر کے کاروباری اداروں پر زور دیتا ہے کہ وہ بچوں کی بات سنیں اور گرین ہاؤس گیسوں کے اخراج کو فوری  طور پر کم کرنے کے لیے اپنی  کوششوں  کو تیز کریں اور بچوں کو ان مضر  اثرات سے بچانے والے اقدامات کو ترجیح دیں۔

Title: Pakistan 2022 Floods Response Plan
Content: 02 September 2022
The “2022 Pakistan Floods Response Plan (FRP)” was jointly launched by Government of Pakistan and the United Nations, simultaneously in Islamabad and Geneva.
Pakistan has been enduring severe monsoon weather since June 2022, which saw areaweighted rainfall 67 per cent above normal levels in that month alone. As of 27 August, rainfall in the country is equivalent to 2.9 times the national 30-year average. This has caused widespread flooding and landslides, with severe repercussions for human lives, property and infrastructure. To date, 72 districts across Pakistan have been declared ‘calamity hit’ by the
Government of Pakistan. These numbers remain dynamic given the ongoing rains, and the number of calamity-declared districts is expected to increase.

Joint Launch of 2022 Pakistan Floods Response Plan by Government of Pakistan and the United Nations
The “2022 Pakistan Floods Response Plan (FRP)” was jointly launched today by Government of Pakistan and the United Nations, simultaneously in Islamabad and Geneva. The FRP is being launched in the backdrop of devastating rains, floods and landslides that have impacted more than 33 million people in different parts of Pakistan. Over 1,100 people including over 350 children have lost their lives, more than 1,600 people have been injured, over 287,000 houses have been fully and 662,000 partially destroyed, over 735,000 livestock have perished and 2 million acres of crops have been adversely impacted, besides severe damage to communications infrastructure.
The FRP focuses on the needs of 5.2 million people, with life-saving response activities amounting to US$ 160.3 million covering food security, assistance for agriculture and livestock, shelter and non-food items, nutrition programmes, primary health services, protection, water and sanitation, women’s health, and education support, as well as shelter for displaced people.
The FRP highlights the main humanitarian needs, the efforts and steps taken by the Government of Pakistan to handle these challenges in collaboration with the UN and other partners, and sets out a well-coordinated and inclusive plan of action to respond to the needs of the affected people. The FRP is holistic, with a multi-sectoral approach covering the thematic clusters of food security and agriculture, health, nutrition, education, protection, shelter and non-food items, water, sanitation and hygiene. Moreover, Pakistan continues to host more than 3 million Afghans with generosity and compassion, and like previous occasions, the at least 421,000 refugees living in flood-affected areas are included in the FRP.
Delivering the keynote address, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said, “The Government’s efforts are being supported by the Pakistani nation with people, civil society and humanitarian organizations stepping forward in a big way to complement the relief work with our characteristic generosity and philanthropic spirit. The Prime Minister’s Flood Relief Fund 2022 has also been established to facilitate people all over the country and overseas to contribute to the flood relief efforts.” The FM added that “this Appeal is expected to address only a part of the overall requirements and will, therefore, complement the broader effort.” The FM underscored that the international community’s “full support and solidarity with the people of Pakistan at this time would go a long way in alleviating their suffering and in helping to rebuild their lives and communities”.
In his video message, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres shared that “the people of Pakistan face the unrelenting impact of heavy rains and flooding – worst in decades”. UNSG added that “the Government of Pakistan’s response has been swift. It has released national funds, including in the form of immediate cash relief. But the scale of needs is rising like the flood waters. It requires the world’s collective and prioritized attention.”
The Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal highlighted that “Pakistan being a negligible contributor to the overall carbon footprint, is still among the top ten countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and with extreme weather events which we have experienced from earlier this year like the heat waves, forest fires, multiple glacial lake-outburst-floods and now these disastrous monsoon floods.”
The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Julien Harneis said: “This super flood is driven by climate change - the causes are international and so the response calls for international solidarity.” He further added, “Across Pakistan, I have seen government workers, ordinary people, out in the rain and water, saving lives and giving the little they have to those who have lost everything. We, in the international community, need to step up and stand with the people of Pakistan. This appeal is the absolute minimum we need from the international community for life-saving assistance and services. The people of Pakistan deserve our support.”
Chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Lieutenant General Akhtar Nawaz gave a detailed briefing on the current humanitarian situation and efforts of the Government of Pakistan, supported by humanitarian partners in carrying out rescue and relief operations.
Mr. Xavier Castellanos Mosquera, Under-Secretary-General for National Society Development and Operations Coordination, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said, “IFRC is committed to assisting the affected communities in these unprecedented floods in Pakistan. Together with Pakistan Red Crescent, we have launched an initial emergency appeal through which we are seeking funds to assist 324,000 people in Health, Safe drinking water, Emergency Shelter, and Livelihoods. The IFRC is working together with the Government of Pakistan and the UN agencies to have a coordinated response to ensure we reach the most vulnerable and affected populations, providing access to basic necessities to all”.
Mr. Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees shared that “today, the international community – including my own agency – must help the people in need in Pakistan. We urgently need global support and solidarity for Pakistan”.
The launch event was well attended by the Diplomatic Corps both in Islamabad and Geneva, heads of UN agencies in Pakistan, representatives of international organizations, IFIs, civil society and media. The participants offered condolences and expressions of solidarity on the loss of precious lives and damage to infrastructure by the floods, and assured their continued support to the relief, rescue, rehabilitation, and reconstruction efforts of Pakistan.
Pakistan is a country with experience and capacity in responding to humanitarian emergencies and has made major strides in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the scale and magnitude of the current floods is unprecedented, whereby, the country received rainfall equivalent to 2.9 times the national 30-year average – a grave manifestation of Climate Change induced disasters. It is important that the international community shows solidarity with Pakistan and complements its national efforts in combating the direct and inter-related impacts of the current floods.

اسلام آباد۔ 30اگست 2022:  حکومت پاکستان اور اقوام متحد ہ نے  اپنے مشترکہ ’’پاکستان فلڈ ریسپانس پلان  (ایف آر پی) 2022‘‘ کا آغاز آج بیک وقت اسلام آباد اور جنیوا میں کردیا ۔ منصوبے کا اجر۱ ء حالیہ  تباہ کن بارشوں، سیلاب اور لینڈ سلائیڈنگ کے پس منظر میں کیا جا رہا ہے جن سے  پاکستان کے مختلف حصوں میں تین کروڑ تیس لاکھ سے زیادہ افراد متاثر ہوئے، 350 سے زائد بچوں سمیت 1100 سے زائد افراد اپنی جان سے ہاتھ دھو بیٹھے، 1600 سے زائد افراد زخمی ہوئے ، 287,000 سے زائد گھر مکمل اور 662,000 جزوی طور پر تباہ، 735,000 سے زائد مویشی ہلاک اور ملکی مواصلاتی ڈھانچے کے علاوہ   20لاکھ ایکڑ پر پھیلی ہوئی فصلوں کو بھی  شدید نقصان پہنچا۔
اس منصوبے کے تحت 16کروڑ 30لاکھ  امریکی ڈالر کی لاگت سے پانچ کروڑ بیس لاکھ متاثرین  کے لیے   زندگی کے تحفظ پر مبنی  سرگرمیاں شروع کی جائیں گی، جن میں غذائی تحفظ، زراعت اور مویشیوں کے لیے امداد،   عارضی پناہ گاہیں اور غیر خوراکی اشیاء کی فراہمی ، غذائیت کے پروگرام، بنیادی صحت کی خدمات، تحفظ اور پانی  کی فراہمی کے علاوہ صفائی ستھرائی، خواتین کی صحت، اور تعلیم کے ساتھ ساتھ بے گھر لوگوں کے لیے پناہ گاہیں بھی شامل ہیں۔
ایف آر پی  کا مقصد بنیادی انسانی ضروریات، اور حکومت پاکستان کی جانب  سے اقوام متحدہ اور دیگر ا داروں کے ساتھ مل کر سیلاب کے نتیجے میں پیدا ہونے  والی  مشکلات سے نمٹنے کے لیے کی جانے والی کوششوں اور اقدامات  کو نمایاں کرنا ہے، اور ان ضروریات کو پورا کرنے کے لیے ایک مربوط اور جامع منصوبہ ترتیب دینا ہے۔ ایف آر پی ایک کثیر شعبہ جاتی نقطہ نظر   کا حامل جامع منصوبہ ہے  ، جس میں فوڈ سیکیورٹی اور زراعت، صحت، غذائیت، تعلیم، تحفظ، پناہ گاہیں اور غیر غذائی اشیاء، پانی، صفائی اور حفظان صحت کا احاطہ کیا گیا ہے ۔ مزید برآں، پاکستان فیاضی اور ہمدردی کے جذبات کے تحت 30 لاکھ سے زائد افغان شہریوں کو جگہ  دینے کا سلسلہ جاری رکھے ہوئے ہے، اور گزشتہ مواقع کی طرح، سیلاب سے متاثرہ علاقوں میں رہنے والے کم از کم 421,000 مہاجرین کو ایف آر پی میں شامل کیا گیا ہے۔
تقریب سے  خطاب کرتے ہوئے، وزیر خارجہ  پاکستان، بلاول بھٹو زرداری نے کہا، "پاکستانی قوم کی طرف سے حکومت کی کوششوں کی حمایت کی جا رہی ہے، عوام، سول سوسائٹی اور رفاحی تنظیمیں خصوصی سخاوت اور انسان دوستی کے جذبے کے ساتھ بڑے پیمانے پر امدادی کام کر رہی ہیں۔ وزیراعظم کا فلڈ ریلیف فنڈ 2022 بھی قائم کیا گیا ہے تاکہ ملک بھر اور بیرون ملک مقیم لوگوں کو سیلاب کی امدادی سرگرمیوں میں حصہ ڈالنے میں سہولت فراہم کی جا سکے۔ وزیر خارجہ نے مزید کہا کہ "اس اپیل سے مجموعی ضروریات کے صرف ایک حصے کے پورا ہونے  کی توقع ہے مگر اس سے مجموعی  اہداف کی جانب پیش رفت ہوگی۔" وزیر خارجہ نے اس بات پر زور دیا کہ عالمی برادری کی پاکستان کے لوگوں کے ساتھ اس وقت مکمل حمایت اور یکجہتی ان کے مصائب کو کم کرنے اور ان کی زندگیوں اور کمیونٹیز کی تعمیر نو میں مدد دینے میں اہم کردار ادا کرے گی۔
اپنے ویڈیو پیغام میں اقوام متحدہ کے سیکرٹری جنرل، انتونیو گوتریس نے کہا : "پاکستانی عوام کو گزشتہ کئی دہائیوں میں سے سب سے بدترین  بارشوں اور سیلاب کے شدید اثرات کا سامنا ہے  "۔ انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ "حکومت پاکستان نے تیزی سے امدادی سرگرمیاں شروع کی ہیں اور  فوری نقد امداد کے علاوہ  قومی فنڈز جاری کیے ہیں،  لیکن پاکستان کی ضروریات بھی سیلابی پانی کی طرح بڑھ رہی ہیں، لہٰذا اسے دنیا کی اجتماعی اور ترجیحی توجہ کی ضرورت ہے۔‘‘
وزیر منصوبہ بندی احسن اقبال کا کہنا تھا کہ ’’پاکستان  مجموعی طور پر کاربن فوٹ پرنٹ میں بہت معمولی  حصہ دار ہونے کے باوجود موسمیاتی تبدیلیوں کے خطرے سے دوچار اولین دس ممالک میں شامل ہے، اور اس سال کے شروع سے ہی  ہم نے شدید گرمی ، جنگلات میں آگ، متعدد برفانی جھیلوں کے پھٹنے  سے آنے والے سیلاب اور اب مون سون کے یہ تباہ کن سیلاب کا سامنا کیا ہے۔‘‘
پاکستان میں مقیم اقوام متحدہ کے انسانی خدمات کے کوآرڈینیٹر جولین ہارنیس نے کہا: ’’یہ شدید سیلاب موسمیاتی تبدیلیوں کی وجہ سے ہے ۔ چونکہ اس  کے  اسباب بین الاقوامی ہیں اس لیے  اس کے خلاف رد عمل  بین الاقوامی یکجہتی کا مطالبہ کرتا ہے۔‘‘ انہوں نے مزید کہا، ’’پاکستان بھر میں، میں نے حکومتی اہلکاروں اور عام لوگوں کو بارش اور پانی میں باہر نکلتے، جانیں بچاتے اور سیلا ب میں اپنا سب کچھ کھو دینے والوں کی مدد کرتے دیکھا ہے۔ عالمی برادری کو بھی پاکستانی عوام کے ساتھ کھڑے ہونے کی ضرورت ہے۔ ہماری اپیل ہے کہ  بین الاقوامی برادری  ہمیں کم از کم  زندگی بچانے والی امداد اور خدمات  فراہم کرے۔ پاکستانی عوام ہماری حمایت کے مستحق ہیں۔‘‘
نیشنل ڈیزاسٹر مینجمنٹ اتھارٹی (این ڈی ایم اے) کے چیئرمین لیفٹیننٹ جنرل اختر نواز نے موجودہ انسانی صورتحال اور حکومت پاکستان کی کوششوں کے بارے میں تفصیلی بریفنگ دی۔
انٹرنیشنل فیڈریشن آف ریڈ کراس اینڈ ریڈ کریسنٹ سوسائٹیز (آئی ایف آرسی) کے انڈر سیکرٹری جنرل برائے نیشنل سوسائٹی ڈویلپمنٹ اینڈ آپریشنز کوآرڈینیشن مسٹر زیویئر کاسٹیلنوس موسکویرا نے کہا، ’’آئی ایف آرسی  پاکستان میں ان شدید سیلابی  باشوں سے  متاثرہ علاقوں کے  لوگوں کی مدد کے لیے پرعزم ہے۔ پاکستان ریڈ کریسنٹ کے ساتھ مل کر ہم نے ایک ابتدائی ہنگامی اپیل کا آغاز کیا ہے، اورہم 324,000 لوگوں کو صحت، پینے کے صاف پانی، ہنگامی پناہ گاہوں اور ذریعہ معاش میں مدد کے لیے فنڈز جمع کر رہے ہیں۔ آئی ایف آر سی حکومت پاکستان اور اقوام متحدہ کے اداروں  ساتھ مل کر کام کر رہا ہے تاکہ ہم سب کو بنیادی ضروریات تک رسائی فراہم کرتے ہوئے کمزورترین  اور شدید متاثرہ آبادیوں تک رسائی  کو یقینی بنانے کے لیے ایک مربوط لائحہ عمل ترتیب دے سکیں۔‘‘
اقوام متحدہ کے ہائی کمشنر برائے مہاجرین ، فلیپو گرانڈی نے کہا  کہ "آج، میری اپنی ایجنسی سمیت  بین الاقوامی برادری کو پاکستان کے مصیبت زدہ  لوگوں کی مدد کرنی چاہیے۔ ہمیں پاکستان کے لیے عالمی حمایت اور یکجہتی کی فوری ضرورت ہے۔‘‘
تقریب میں اسلام آباد اور جنیوا دونوں میں سفارتی کور، پاکستان میں اقوام متحدہ کے اداروں کے سربراہان، بین الاقوامی تنظیموں کے نمائندوں، IFIs، سول سوسائٹی اور میڈیا نے بھرپور شرکت کی۔ شرکاء نے سیلاب سے قیمتی جانوں کے ضیاع اور انفراسٹرکچر کو پہنچنے والے نقصانات  پر تعزیت اور یکجہتی کا اظہار کیا اور پاکستان کی امداد، بچاؤ، بحالی اور تعمیر نو کی کوششوں میں اپنے مسلسل تعاون کا یقین دلایا۔
پاکستان میں انسانی ہنگامی صورتحال سے نمٹنے کا تجربہ اور صلاحیت موجود ہے اور اس نے پائیدار ترقی کے اہداف (SDGs) کے حصول میں بڑی پیش رفت کی ہے۔ تاہم، موجودہ سیلاب کے پیمانے اور شدت کی  مثال نہیں ملتی، جس کے تحت، ملک میں 30 سالہ قومی اوسط کے 2.9 گنا کے برابر بارش ہوئی جو کہ موسمیاتی تبدیلی سے پیدا ہونے والی آفات کا ایک سنگین مظہر ہے۔ یہ ضروری ہے کہ عالمی برادری پاکستان کے ساتھ یکجہتی کا مظاہرہ کرے اور موجودہ سیلاب کے براہ راست اور باہمی تعلق کے اثرات سے نمٹنے کے لیے اس کی  قومی کوششوں کی تکمیل  میں مدد کرے۔

Half of health care facilities globally lack basic hygiene services – WHO, UNICEF
Newly established global estimate on hygiene reveals the risk of disease spread and infections to patients and health care providers
30 AUGUST 2022 | Geneva, New York – Half of health care facilities worldwide lack basic hygiene services with water and soap or alcohol-based hand rub where patients receive care and at toilets in these facilities, according to the latest Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) report by WHO and UNICEF. Around 3.85 billion people use these facilities, putting them at greater risk of infection, including 688 million people who receive care at facilities with no hygiene services at all.
“Hygiene facilities and practices in health care settings are non-negotiable. Their improvement is essential to pandemic recovery, prevention and preparedness. Hygiene in health care facilities cannot be secured without increasing investments in basic measures, which include safe water, clean toilets, and safely managed health care waste,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health. “I encourage Member States to step up their efforts to implement their 2019 World Health Assembly commitment to strengthen water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in health care facilities, and to monitor these efforts.”
The latest report, “Progress on WASH in health care facilities 2000–2021: special focus on WASH and infection prevention and control”, has for the first time established this global baseline on hygiene services – which assessed access at points of care as well as toilets – as more countries than ever report on critical elements of WASH services in their hospitals and other health centres. For hygiene, data are now available for 40 countries, representing 35% of the world’s population, up from 21 countries in 2020 and 14 in 2019.
The newly established global estimate reveals a clearer and more alarming picture of the state of hygiene in health care facilities. Though 68% of health care facilities had hygiene facilities at points of care, and 65% had handwashing facilities with water and soap at toilets, only 51% had both and therefore met the criteria for basic hygiene services. Furthermore, 1 in 11 (9%) of health care facilities globally have neither.
“If health care providers don’t have access to a hygiene service, patients don’t have a health care facility,” said Kelly Ann Naylor, UNICEF Director of WASH and Climate, Environment, Energy, and Disaster Risk Reduction (CEED). “Hospitals and clinics without safe water and basic hygiene and sanitation services are a potential death trap for pregnant mothers, newborns, and children. Every year, around 670 000 newborns lose their lives to sepsis. This is a travesty – even more so as their deaths are preventable.”
The report notes that contaminated hands and environments play a significant role in pathogen transmission in health care facilities and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Interventions to increase access to handwashing with water and soap and environmental cleaning form the cornerstone of infection prevention and control programmes and are crucial to providing quality care, particularly for safe childbirth.
Coverage of WASH facilities is still uneven across different regions and income groupings:
·       Facilities in sub-Saharan Africa are lagging on hygiene services. While three-quarters (73%) of health care facilities in the region overall have alcohol-based hand rub or water and soap at points of care, only one-third (37%) have handwashing facilities with water and soap at toilets. The vast majority (87%) of hospitals have hand hygiene facilities at points of care, compared to 68% of other healthcare facilities.
·       In the Least Developed Countries, only 53% of health care facilities have access on-premises to a protected water source. To compare, the global figure is 78% with hospitals (88%) doing better than smaller health care facilities (77%), and the figure for eastern and south-eastern Asia is 90%. Globally, around 3% of health care facilities in urban areas and 11% in rural areas had no water service.
·       Of the countries with available data, 1 in 10 health care facilities globally had no sanitation service. The proportion of health care facilities with no sanitation services ranged from 3% in Latin America and the Caribbean and in eastern and south-eastern Asia to 22% in sub-Saharan Africa. In the Least Developed Countries, just 1 in 5 (21%) had basic sanitation services in health care facilities.
·       The data further reveals that many health care facilities lack basic environmental cleaning and safe segregation and disposal of health care waste.
The report is being launched at World Water Week taking place in Stockholm, Sweden. The annual conference, which runs from 23 August to 1 September, explores new ways to tackle humanity’s greatest challenges: from food security and health to agriculture, technology, biodiversity and climate.

Women and girls bearing the brunt of the Pakistan Monsoon floods
Islamabad, 30 August 2022 — Of the 6.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance following the Monsoon rains, floods, and landslides in Pakistan, more than 1.6 million are women of childbearing age. The Government of Pakistan estimates that around 33 million people across the country are affected, including an estimated 8.2 million women of reproductive age.
UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, estimates that almost 650,000 pregnant women in the flood-affected areas require maternal health services to ensure a safe pregnancy and childbirth. Up to 73,000 women expected to deliver next month will need skilled birth attendants, newborn care, and support. In addition, many women and girls are at an increased risk of gender-based violence (GBV) as almost 1 million houses have been damaged.
“Pregnancies and childbirth can’t wait for emergencies or natural disasters to be over. This is when a woman and baby are vulnerable and need the most care. UNFPA is on the ground, working with partners, to ensure that pregnant women and new mothers continue receiving life-saving services even under the most challenging conditions,” says UNFPA Pakistan Representative ai Dr. Bakhtior Kadirov.
The humanitarian situation is being compounded by severe impacts on infrastructure. More than 1,000 health facilities are either partially or fully damaged in Sindh province, whereas 198 health facilities are damaged in affected districts in Balochistan. The damage to roads and bridges has also compromised girls' and women's access to health facilities.
“We will continue supporting health facilities with the equipment and human resources to be fully operational despite the challenging humanitarian conditions,” said Dr. Kadirov.
UNFPA is scaling up its emergency response to provide life-saving reproductive health services and commodities, including dignity kits, for women and girls. UNFPA Pakistan has, so far, procured 8,311 dignity kits, 7,411 Newborn Baby Kits, and 6,412 Clean Delivery Kits for immediate delivery to Sindh, Balochistan, KP, and Punjab.  Distribution of these kits has already started. UNFPA also provides life-saving reproductive health services across Pakistan, including referral of complicated cases during pregnancy and delivery.
The UN agency is also prioritizing gender-based violence prevention and response services, including medical and psychosocial support to survivors of GBV.

PRESS RELEASE
Special Advisor to World Food Programme, HRH Princess Sarah Zeid of Jordan concludes her week-long visit with appreciation and aspirations for Pakistan’s efforts in improving maternal and child health and nutrition
Islamabad, 27 August 2022: The World Food Programme (WFP) Special Advisor on Maternal & Child Health and Nutrition, Her Royal Highness Princess Sarah Zeid of Jordan, concluded her week-long visit to Pakistan, where she saw first-hand how WFP is supporting the Government of Pakistan in addressing malnutrition through the Benazir Nashonuma Programme, particularly stunting that affects 12 million or up to two-thirds of children in Pakistan.
During her stay, the first stop of HRH Princess Sarah Zeid was district Badin in Sindh where she together with the Federal Minister of Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety, Ms. Shazia Atta Marri, visited the Benazir Nashonuma Facilitation Centre. There, and at a Community Health Centre, the Princess interacted with lady health workers, midwives and mothers to explore the maternal and child health challenges faced by local communities. The partnership between WFP and the Government of Pakistan under the Benazir Nahsonuma Programme supports more than 150,000 women and children with vital health and nutrition assistance, aiming to reach 1.7 million over the next three years.
“I am inspired to see how some of the most vulnerable mothers and children are receiving essential nutrition support combined with conditional cash transfers as part of the Benazir Nashonuma Programme. It is incredible to see the positive change in Pakistan since my last visit in 2019”, said Princess Sarah while sharing her experience.
In Islamabad, she visited a chakki (small-scale mill) – part of WFP’s Chakki Programme - to see how the process of fortification works and how it is enabling WFP to prevent malnutrition in up to 70% of Pakistan’s population while also providing employment in the local community. WFP currently supports fortification of food by adding crucial vitamins and minerals to wheat flour in 50 small-scale flour mills in Pakistan.
The Princess met with high-level government officials in Karachi and Islamabad, including the President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Chairman Senate, Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani, and other key Ministers, to appreciate their efforts in prioritizing maternal and child health nutrition to eliminate malnutrition in the country. During her meetings with the Government officials, the Princess advocated for maintaining a focus on pregnant mothers and young children while scaling up nutritional support to older children and adolescents – from 1000 to 8000 days – ensuring total growth and development.
Commenting on the Benazir Nashonuma programme's success, Princess Sarah Zeid said “The Government’s decision to scale up the programme across the country shows how investment in mother and child nutrition is being prioritized to break intergenerational cycles of malnutrition, poverty and exclusion putting mothers, children, communities and nations on track for fulfilling their full potential. I am already looking forward to seeing the impact of this scaling up in a future visit to Pakistan,” added Princess Sarah.
Her Royal Highness will share her learnings and best practices on maternal nutrition from Pakistan at relevant global fora after her visit.
The World Food Programme assists the Government of Pakistan in malnutrition prevention activities, enhancing social and public sector capacity to identify, target and assist nutritionally vulnerable populations. The target is that children under 5 years of age, adolescent girls and women of reproductive age, have improved nutrition in line with national targets in Pakistan Vision 2025.
Note to the Editor: The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability, and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters, and the impact of climate change.

UN allocates $3 million from the Emergency Fund for the flood response in Pakistan
(Islamabad, 25 August 2022): The UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$ 3 million to UN agencies and partners in Pakistan to respond to the floods. This will be used for health, nutrition, food security, and water and sanitation services in flood-affected areas, focusing on the most vulnerable.
The floods have caused widespread destruction across the country. Millions of children, women, and men have been affected since mid-June, and over a thousand lives have been lost. People have lost their homes, livestock, harvest-ready crops, and their only sources of livelihood. Infrastructure across the country has suffered massive damage, and roads, bridges, and buildings have been washed away.
The government is conducting search and rescue operations, providing relief supplies and preparing a cash assistance program. The UN, and non-government organizations, have been working alongside the government to provide support.
This $3 million CERF allocation will bring the UN’s humanitarian assistance for the flood response up to US$ 7 million. The ongoing assistance by UN agencies includes medical supplies and services by WHO, safe water and nutrition by UNICEF, support for maternal health by UNFPA, food assistance by WFP, vaccination of livestock by FAO and shelter for refugees by UNHCR.

PRESS RELEASE
War in Ukraine has left nearly 1,000 children killed or injured.
Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell
NEW YORK, 22 August 2022 – “At least 972 children in Ukraine have been killed or injured by violence since the war escalated nearly six months ago, an average of over five children killed or injured each day.
“And these are just the figures the UN has been able to verify. We believe the true number to be much higher.  

“The use of explosive weapons has caused most of the child casualties. These weapons do not discriminate between civilian and combatant, especially when used in populated areas as has been the case in Ukraine – in Mariupol, Luhansk, Kremenchuk, and Vinnytsia. The list goes on and on.
“Once again, as in all wars, the reckless decisions of adults are putting children at extreme risk. There are no armed operations of this kind that do not result in children being harmed.

“Meanwhile, beyond the horror of children being killed or physically hurt in attacks, almost every child in Ukraine has been exposed to deeply distressing events, and those fleeing violence are at significant risk of family separation, violence, abuse, sexual exploitation, and trafficking.

“The start of the school year in just over a week’s time is a stark reminder of how much children in Ukraine have lost.
“Ukraine’s education system has been devastated by the escalation of hostilities across the country. Schools have been targeted or used by parties, resulting in families not feeling safe to send their children to school. We estimate that 1 in 10 schools have been damaged or destroyed.

“All children need to be in school and learning, including children caught up in emergencies. Children in Ukraine and those displaced by this war are no exception.
“UNICEF continues to call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and for all children to be protected from harm. This includes ending the brutal use of explosive weapons in populated areas and attacks on civilian facilities and infrastructure.
“Ukraine’s children urgently need safety, stability, access to safe learning, child protection services, and psychosocial support.
“But more than anything, Ukraine’s children need peace.”

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR INTERNATIONAL YOUTH DAY
12 August 2022
Today, we celebrate International Youth Day, and the power of partnerships across generations.
This year’s theme — “Intergenerational Solidarity: Creating a World for All Ages” — reminds us of a basic truth: we need people of all ages, young and old alike, to join forces to build a better world for all.
Too often, ageism, bias and discrimination prevent this essential collaboration. When young people are shut out of the decisions being made about their lives, or when older people are denied a chance to be heard, we all lose.
Solidarity and collaboration are more essential than ever, as our world faces a series of challenges that threaten our collective future.
From COVID-19 to climate change, to conflicts, poverty, inequality and discrimination, we need all hands on deck to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and build the better, more peaceful future we all seek.
We need to support young people with massive investments in education and skills-building — including through next month’s Transforming Education Summit.
We also need to support gender equality and expanded opportunities for young people to participate in civic and political life
It’s not enough to listen to young people — we need to integrate them into decision-making mechanisms at the local, national and international levels.
This is at the heart of our proposal to establish a new Youth Office at the United Nations.
And we need to ensure that older generations have access to social protection and opportunities to give back to their communities and share the decades of lived experience they have accumulated.
On this important day, let’s join hands across generations to break down barriers, and work as one to achieve a more equitable, just and inclusive world for all people.

UNICEF - WHO
JOINT STATEMENT
NEW YORK/GENEVA, 1 August 2022 – “As global crises continue to threaten the health and nutrition of millions of babies and children, the vital importance of breastfeeding as the best possible start in life is more critical than ever.
“This World Breastfeeding Week, under its theme Step up for breastfeeding: Educate and Support, UNICEF and WHO are calling on governments to allocate increased resources to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding policies and programmes, especially for the most vulnerable families living in emergency settings.
“During emergencies, including those in Afghanistan, Yemen, Ukraine, the Horn of Africa, and the Sahel, breastfeeding guarantees a safe, nutritious and accessible food source for babies and young children. It offers a powerful line of defense against disease and all forms of child malnutrition, including wasting.
“Breastfeeding also acts as a baby’s first vaccine, protecting them from common childhood illnesses.
“Yet the emotional distress, physical exhaustion, lack of space and privacy, and poor sanitation experienced by mothers in emergency settings mean that many babies are missing out on the benefits of breastfeeding to help them survive.
“Fewer than half of all newborn babies are breastfed in the first hour of life, leaving them more vulnerable to disease and death. And only 44 per cent of infants are exclusively breastfed in the first six months of life, short of the World Health Assembly target of 50 per cent by 2025.
“Protecting, promoting, and supporting breastfeeding is more important than ever, not just for protecting our planet as the ultimate natural, sustainable, first food system, but also for the survival, growth, and development of millions of infants.
“That is why UNICEF and WHO are calling on governments, donors, civil society, and the private sector to step up efforts to:
· Prioritize investing in breastfeeding support policies and programmes, especially in fragile and food insecure contexts.
· Equip health and nutrition workers in facilities and communities with the skills they need to provide quality counselling and practical support to mothers to successfully breastfeed.
· Protect caregivers and health care workers from the unethical marketing influence of the formula industry by fully adopting and implementing the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes, including in humanitarian settings.
· Implement family-friendly policies that provide mothers with the time, space, and support they need to breastfeed.

PRESS RELEASE
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police, Government of Japan, and UNDP launch the first ever Policing Plans for the Merged Areas
Islamabad, 21 July 2022—Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police, Government of Japan, and UNDP launched the first ever Policing Plans for the Merged Areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at an event in Islamabad today.
The Policing Plans are for seven districts of Merged Areas: Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and Kurram. The Plans provide a roadmap for the smooth transition of the post–merger local policing system to the formal policing and justice system in the Merged Areas.
The plans also present a context-specific framework to deliver people-centred policing services through collaborative partnerships with local communities and other agencies of the criminal justice system. Furthermore, the plans also propose recommendations to federal, provincial, and district-level decision makers in addressing resource and capacity gaps.
The launch event highlighted the importance of joint efforts between KP Police and development partner to foster a people–centred policing system in the Merged Areas. These efforts are crucial to restoring public security services, rule of law, sustainable peace, and development in the region.
Speaking at the event Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mr. Moazzam Jah Ansari said, “I extend my sincere gratitude to my team in KP Police and UNDP for their exceptional work in developing the very first Policing Plans for the Merged Areas. The Plans present a necessary road map to guide the post-merger transition in policing and better service delivery to the people. On behalf of the KP Police, I extend my sincere thanks to UNDP for its technical advice and assistance, and the Government of Japan for its generous funding. The next critical phase is the successful implementation of the Policing Plans across Merged Areas, and I look forward to UNDP and the Government of Japan’s continued assistance in this regard.”
His Excellency Mr. WADA Mitsuhiro, Japanese Ambassador to Pakistan thanked UNDP and KP Police for their pioneering efforts to strengthen policing in the Merged Areas.  “Improving the local police service in Merged Areas is a key priority in ensuring a smooth transition to equitable public security and justice delivery in the post-merger districts. Therefore, the development of the Police Plans is a crucial milestone in achieving this essential objective. I congratulate the KP Police and UNDP for their pioneering work and the Government of Japan is honoured to support this important initiative.”
“UNDP will continue to provide technical support to KP Police in the implementation of the Policing Plans in the Merged Areas,” highlighted UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative Mr Knut Ostby while speaking during the event. “The Policing Plans will guide the trajectory for a better policing system that is responsive to the needs of local communities. In addition to this, the infrastructure support to build new police stations and training former Levies and Khasadars who were recently integrated into KP Police will complement and add value to this crucial transition phase in the Merged Areas.”
The initiative also includes infrastructure development support to build five new police stations in districts Bajaur, Mohmand, North Waziristan and Kurram, and train 278 former Levies and Khasadars who were recently integrated into the KP Police.
This is being implemented under UNDP's Strengthening Rule of Law Programme, which supports both supply and demand sides of the rule of law, justice, and security sector by strengthening institutional capacity, and citizen rights, and by deepening the ongoing efforts to secure peace and stability.

PRESS RELEASE
World population to reach 8 billion on 15 November 2022
Amid falling growth rates, global population projected to peak around 10.4 billion in the 2080s
New York, 11 July – The global population is projected to reach 8 billion on 15 November 2022, and India is projected to surpass China as the world’s most populous country in 2023, according to World Population Prospects 2022, released today on World Population Day.
“This year’s World Population Day falls during a milestone year, when we anticipate the birth of the Earth’s eight billionth inhabitant. This is an occasion to celebrate our diversity, recognize our common humanity, and marvel at advancements in health that have extended lifespans and dramatically reduced maternal and child mortality rates,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres.  “At the same time, it is a reminder of our shared responsibility to care for our planet and a moment to reflect on where we still fall short of our commitments to one another,” he added.
The global population is growing at its slowest rate since 1950, having fallen under 1 per cent in 2020. The latest projections by the United Nations suggest that the world’s population could grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion in 2050. It is projected to reach a peak of around 10.4 billion people during the 2080s and to remain at that level until 2100.
World Population Prospects 2022 also states that fertility has fallen markedly in recent decades for many countries. Today, two-thirds of the global population lives in a country or area where lifetime fertility is below 2.1 births per woman, roughly the level required for zero growth in the long run for a population with low mortality. The populations of 61 countries or areas are projected to decrease by 1 per cent or more between 2022 and 2050, owing to sustained low levels of fertility and, in some cases, elevated rates of emigration.
More than half of the projected increase in the global population up to 2050 will be concentrated in eight countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania. Countries of sub-Saharan Africa are expected to contribute more than half of the increase anticipated through 2050.
“The relationship between population growth and sustainable development is complex and multidimensional” said Liu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. “Rapid population growth makes eradicating poverty, combatting hunger and malnutrition, and increasing the coverage of health and education systems more difficult. Conversely, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, especially those related to health, education and gender equality, will contribute to reducing fertility levels and slowing global population growth.”
In most countries of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, the share of population at working age (between 25 and 64 years) has been increasing thanks to recent reductions in fertility. This shift in the age distribution provides a time-bound opportunity for accelerated economic growth per capita, known as the “demographic dividend”. To maximize the potential benefits of a favourable age distribution, countries should invest in the further development of their human capital by ensuring access to health care and quality education at all ages and by promoting opportunities for productive employment and decent work.
The share of global population at ages 65 and above is projected to rise from 10 per cent in 2022 to 16 per cent in 2050. At that point, it is expected that the number of persons aged 65 years or over worldwide will be more than twice the number of children under age 5 and about the same as the number under age 12. Countries with ageing populations should take steps to adapt public programmes to the growing numbers of older persons, including by establishing universal health care and long-term care systems and by improving the sustainability of social security and pension systems.
Global life expectancy at birth reached 72.8 years in 2019, an improvement of almost 9 years since 1990. Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average global longevity of around 77.2 years in 2050. Yet in 2021, life expectancy for the least developed countries lagged 7 years behind the global average.
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all three components of population change. Global life expectancy at birth fell to 71.0 years in 2021. In some countries, successive waves of the pandemic may have produced short-term reductions in numbers of pregnancies and births, while for many other countries, there is little evidence of an impact on fertility levels or trends. The pandemic severely restricted all forms of human mobility, including international migration.
“Further actions by Governments aimed at reducing fertility would have little impact on the pace of population growth between now and mid-century, because of the youthful age structure of today’s global population. Nevertheless, the cumulative effect of lower fertility, if maintained over several decades, could be a more substantial deceleration of global population growth in the second half of the century,” added John Wilmoth, Director of the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

JOINT PRESS RELEASE
COVID-19 pandemic fuels largest continued backslide in vaccinations in three decades
WHO and UNICEF sound the alarm as new data shows global vaccination coverage continued to decline in 2021, with 25 million infants missing out on lifesaving vaccines
GENEVA/NEW YORK,15 July 2022 – The largest sustained decline in childhood vaccinations in approximately 30 years has been recorded in official data published today by WHO and UNICEF.
The percentage of children who received three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) – a marker for immunization coverage within and across countries – fell 5 percentage points between 2019 and 2021 to 81 per cent.
As a result, 25 million children missed out on one or more doses of DTP through routine immunization services in 2021 alone. This is 2 million more than those who missed out in 2020 and 6 million more than in 2019, highlighting the growing number of children at risk from devastating but preventable diseases. The decline was due to many factors including an increased number of children living in conflict and fragile settings where immunization access is often challenging, increased misinformation and COVID-19 related issues such as service and supply chain disruptions, resource diversion to response efforts, and containment measures that limited immunization service access and availability.
“This is a red alert for child health. We are witnessing the largest sustained drop in childhood immunization in a generation. The consequences will be measured in lives,” said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director. “While a pandemic hangover was expected last year as a result of COVID-19 disruptions and lockdowns, what we are seeing now is a continued decline. COVID-19 is not an excuse. We need immunization catch-ups for the missing millions or we will inevitably witness more outbreaks, more sick children and greater pressure on already strained health systems.”
18 million of the 25 million children did not receive a single dose of DTP during the year, the vast majority of whom live in low- and middle-income countries, with India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ethiopia and the Philippines recording the highest numbers. Among countries[1]   with the largest relative increases in the number of children who did not receive a single vaccine between 2019 and 2021 are Myanmar and Mozambique.
Globally, over a quarter of the coverage of HPV vaccines that was achieved in 2019 has been lost. This has grave consequences for the health of women and girls, as global coverage of the first dose of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is only 15%, despite the first vaccines being licensed over 15 years ago.
It was hoped that 2021 would be a year of recovery during which strained immunization programmes would rebuild and the cohort of children missed in 2020 would be caught-up. Instead, DTP3 coverage was set back to its lowest level since 2008 which, along with declines in coverage for other basic vaccines, pushed the world off-track to meet global goals, including the immunization indicator for the Sustainable Development Goals.
This historic backsliding in rates of immunization is happening against a backdrop of rapidly rising rates of severe acute malnutrition. A malnourished child already has weakened immunity and missed vaccinations can mean common childhood illnesses quickly become lethal to them. The convergence of a hunger crisis with a growing immunization gap threatens to create the conditions for a child survival crisis.
Vaccine coverage dropped in every region, with the East Asia and Pacific region recording the steepest reversal in DTP3 coverage, falling nine percentage points in just two years.
“Planning and tackling COVID-19 should also go hand-in-hand with vaccinating for killer diseases like measles, pneumonia and diarrhea,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “It’s not a question of either/or, it’s possible to do both”.
Some countries notably held off declines. Uganda maintained high levels of coverage in routine immunization programmes, whilst rolling out a targeted COVID-19 vaccination programme to protect priority populations, including health workers. Similarly, Pakistan returned to pre-pandemic levels of coverage thanks to high-level government commitment and significant catch-up immunization efforts. To achieve this in the midst of a pandemic, when healthcare systems and health workers were under significant strain, should be applauded.
Monumental efforts will be required to reach universal levels of coverage and to prevent outbreaks. Inadequate coverage levels have already resulted in avoidable outbreaks of measles and polio in the past 12 months, underscoring the vital role of immunization in keeping children, adolescents, adults, and societies healthy.
First dose measles coverage dropped to 81 per cent in 2021, also the lowest level since 2008. This meant 24.7 million children missed their first measles dose in 2021, 5.3 million more than in 2019. A further 14.7 million did not receive their needed second dose. Similarly, compared to 2019, 6.7 million more children missed the third dose of polio vaccine and 3.5 million missed the first dose of the HPV vaccine- which protects girls against cervical cancer later in life.
The sharp two-year decline follows almost a decade of stalled progress, underscoring the need to not only address pandemic-related disruptions but also systemic immunization challenges to ensure every child and adolescent is reached.
WHO and UNICEF are working with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and other partners to deliver the global Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030), a strategy for all countries and relevant global partners to achieve set goals on preventing diseases through immunization and delivering vaccines to everyone, everywhere, at every age.
“It’s heart-breaking to see more children losing out on protection from preventable diseases for a second year in a row. The priority of the Alliance must be to help countries to maintain, restore and strengthen routine immunization alongside executing ambitious COVID-19 vaccination plans, not just through vaccines but also tailored structural support for the health systems that will administer them,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
The IA2030 partners call on governments and relevant actors to:
· Intensify efforts for catch-up vaccination to address backsliding on routine immunization, and expand outreach services in underserved areas to reach missed children and implement campaigns to prevent outbreaks;
· Implement evidence-based, people-centred, and tailored strategies to build trust in vaccines and immunization, counter misinformation and increase vaccine uptake particularly among vulnerable communities;
· Ensure current pandemic preparedness and response and the global health architecture strengthening efforts lead to investment in primary health care (PHC) services, with explicit support to strengthen and sustain essential immunization;
· Ensure political commitment from national governments and increase domestic resource allocation to strengthen and sustain immunization within PHC;
· Prioritize health information and disease surveillance systems strengthening to provide the data and monitoring needed for programmes to have maximum impact; and
· Leverage and increase investment in research to develop and improve new and existing vaccines and immunization services that can achieve community needs and deliver on IA2030 goals.

About Immunization Agenda 2030:
The Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) is an ambitious global strategy to maximize the lifesaving impact of vaccines -one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions of all time. IA2030 aims to reduce by half the number of children who still miss out on essential vaccines, achieve 500 introductions of new or under-used vaccines in low- and middle-income countries, and achieve 90 per cent coverage for key life-saving vaccines. Achieving these goals would avert over 50 million deaths and help build healthcare systems that can withstand the impact of pandemics and deliver rapid vaccination response. The strategy was endorsed by all countries through the 73rd World Health Assembly and is a commitment of IA2030 partners comprised of UN agencies, global health initiatives (such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the Measles & Rubella Initiative), non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, faith-based organizations and academia.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD YOUTH SKILLS DAY
15 July 2022
Today, we highlight the importance of transforming youth skills for the future of work.
Young people are disproportionately impacted by interlinked global crises, from climate change to conflicts to persistent poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these fragilities. In 2020 alone, youth employment fell by 39 million. Today, 24 million young people remain at risk of not returning to school.
The pandemic also accelerated the transformation of the labour market, adding uncertainty and widening the digital divide. We must ensure the right of young people to effective and inclusive education, training, and lifelong learning. That requires ramping up youth skills development, while investing in Technical Vocational Education and Training, broadband connectivity, and digital skills.
That is why I will convene a Transforming Education Summit in September that will bring together world leaders, youth and other education actors. Young people are drivers of change and must be fully engaged in decisions affecting their future. Guided by the United Nations Youth 2030 strategy, I urge everyone to act for youth skills development as a priority, at the Summit and beyond.
Together, let us build a more just and thriving workforce, rescue the Sustainable Development Goals and leave no one behind.
I wish you a happy World Youth Skills Day.

PRESS RELEASE
Around 3 in 4 youth lack skills needed for employment, new report says
Ahead of World Youth Skills Day, UNICEF and the Education Commission call for urgent investment to address the global learning and skills crisis
NEW YORK, 13 July 2022 – Nearly three quarters of young people aged 15 to 24 in 92 countries with available data are off-track to acquire the skills needed for employment, according to a new report published today by the Education Commission and UNICEF ahead of World Youth Skills Day.
Recovering learning: Are children and youth on track in skills development? features analyses on skills development in early childhood, and among children of primary school age and youth. The data highlight low levels of skills among children and young people across all age groups, with young people in low-income countries the least likely to have the skills required to thrive, particularly in future employment opportunities, decent work, and entrepreneurship.
“An inspired, skilled generation of children and young people is critical for prosperity, progression, and the success of societies and economies. Yet, the majority of children and young people across the world have been failed by their education systems, leaving them uneducated, uninspired, and unskilled -- the perfect storm for unproductivity,” said UNICEF Director of Education Robert Jenkins. “Investment in cost-effective, proven solutions to fast-track learning and skills development for today’s generation and future generations is urgently needed to address this crisis.”
With high rates of out-of-school young people and low attainment of secondary-level skills, countries worldwide are facing a skills crisis, with the majority of youth unprepared to take part in today’s workforce, the report notes.
Deep disparities across countries and among those from the poorest communities are increasing inequalities. In at least 1 in 3 low-income countries with available data, more than 85 percent of young people are off-track in the secondary-level, digital, and job-specific skills attainment, the report notes.
"To give young people the best chance to succeed and recover learning losses due to the pandemic, we need to support them holistically. But we can't recover what we don't measure. We need to know where children and youth are in building the range of skills they need and monitor their progress. That's why the Education Commission, UNICEF, and partners have been working to address critical data gaps, including the launch of the World Skills Clock to help track progress on and raise awareness around youth skills attainment around the world so we can target urgent action to prepare this generation to thrive in the future," said Education Commission Executive Director Liesbet Steer.
Data from 77 countries show that less than three-quarters of children aged between 3 and 5 years old are developmentally on track in at least three out of the four domains of literacy-numeracy, physical, social-emotional, and learning. At approximately 10 years old, the majority of children in low- and middle-income countries are unable to read and understand a simple text. These foundational skills are the building blocks for further learning and skills development, the report notes.
Basic literacy and numeracy; transferable skills including life skills and socioemotional skills; digital skills, which allow individuals to use and understand technology; job-specific skills, which support the transition into the workforce; and entrepreneurial skills are essential for children to thrive. These skills are also critical for the development of societies and economies.
UNICEF and the Education Commission are urging governments to reach every child with quality education and break down the barriers that put them at risk of dropping out; assess children’s learning levels and provide tailored catch-up classes to bring them up to speed; prioritize foundational skills to build a strong base for lifelong learning; and support psychosocial health and well-being by providing holistic support. The report outlines the need for more extensive data on the skills gap among children and young people across all age groups.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON NELSON MANDELA INTERNATIONAL DAY
18 July 2022

Today, the world honours a giant of our time; a leader of unparalleled courage and towering achievement; and a man of quiet dignity and deep humanity.
Nelson Mandela was a healer of communities and a mentor to generations.
He remains a moral compass and reference to us all.
Madiba walked the path to freedom and dignity with steely determination – and with compassion and love.
He showed that each and every one of us has the ability – and responsibility – to build a better future for all.
Our world today is marred by war; overwhelmed by emergencies; blighted by racism, discrimination, poverty, and inequalities; and threatened by climate disaster.
Let us find hope in Nelson Mandela’s example and inspiration in his vision.
Today and every day, let us honour Nelson Mandela’s legacy by taking action.
By speaking out against hate and standing up for human rights.
By embracing our common humanity – rich in diversity, equal in dignity, united in solidarity.
And by together making our world more just, compassionate, prosperous, and sustainable for all.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD POPULATION DAY
11 July 2022
This year’s World Population Day falls during a milestone year, when we anticipate the birth of the Earth’s eight billionth inhabitant.
This is an occasion to celebrate our diversity, recognize our common humanity, and marvel at advancements in health that have extended lifespans and dramatically reduced maternal and child mortality rates.
At the same time, it is a reminder of our shared responsibility to care for our planet and a moment to reflect on where we still fall short of our commitments to one another.
Amidst COVID-19, the climate crisis, wars and conflicts, humanitarian emergencies, hunger and poverty, our world is in peril.
We still live in a world of vast gender inequality – and we are witnessing renewed assaults on women’s rights, including on essential health services. Complications related to pregnancy and childbirth are still the leading cause of death among girls aged 15 to 19.
Reaching a global population of eight billion is a numerical landmark, but our focus must always be on people.
In the world we strive to build, 8 billion people means 8 billion opportunities to live dignified and fulfilled lives.
When we act on our shared values, we contribute to our common future.
Let us work together towards greater equality and solidarity to ensure that our planet can support our needs and those of future generations.
Let us protect human rights and the ability of all individuals to make informed choices about whether and when to have children.
And let us renew our promise to fully implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for a sustainable and inclusive future for all eight billion of us, leaving no one behind.

PRESS RELEASE
UNDP INL and the Anti-Narcotics Force Pakistan hold ground-breaking ceremony and launch event
Islamabad, June 30: UNDP, U.S. State Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) and the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) Pakistan held a ground-breaking ceremony and launch event for INL supported projects at the ANF Academy in Islamabad. The key objectives of the projects are to provide new residential facilities and an academic block for women, and to assist ANF Academy in improving its training capacities.
The project amounting to a total of $1.2 million is expected to be completed in September 2023. The four-story building will include an academic block for the ANF Academy, and a dedicated residential facility for ANF women trainees and those from other counter narcotics law enforcement agencies.
The new women’s hostel will accommodate approximately 25 ANF women, which will increase women’s participation in ANF training activities. The academic block will provide classrooms and training halls to accommodate an estimated 60 additional men and women trainees. It will therefore allow ANF to train more men and women officers. Furthermore, the new premises will also avail space for personnel from other counter narcotics law enforcement agencies to undertake research and analysis.
The project ‘Countering Production and Trade in Illegal Drugs Through Improved Training Facilities for the ANF & Enhancing the Training Capabilities of the Anti-Narcotics Force’ is an important work stream of INL and UNDP’s broader efforts to improve training facilities and academic capabilities of the ANF Academy..
Director-General ANF Mr. Ghulam Shabbir Narejo highlighted that “INL and UNDP are trusted partners of ANF and have been supporting many critical capacity building and infrastructure development projects in Pakistan. They have contributed significantly to deliver effective counternarcotic law enforcement.” He also extended his appreciation to INL and UNDP for its ongoing support and partnership with ANF, to build stronger and highly professional law enforcement in Pakistan.
Speaking at the occasion, UNDP Resident Representative a.i. Ms. Aliona Niculita spoke about UNDP and INL’s ongoing strategic support to enhance law enforcement capacities across Pakistan. “UNDP and INL in partnership with ANF and other law enforcement institutions have worked on multiple projects including but not limited to, the Joint Police Training Center in Nowshera, Police Training Center in Quetta, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Prosecution Academy, and the Anti-Narcotics Force Academy. We hope that our initiatives will play a significant role in building efficient law enforcement agencies with skilled professionals to strengthen the rule of law and better serve the public in Pakistan. I am hopeful that the addition of the women’s hostel will encourage more women to join the Anti-Narcotics Force and progress in their careers, that is crucial for stronger law enforcement. This is one of the many interventions INL and UNDP are working on together to strengthen rule of law in Pakistan, enhance skills and capabilities of law enforcement officials and increase women’s representation in the forces”
United Nations Resident Coordinator a.i. Ms. Mia Sato stressed on the significance of increasing women’s representation in law enforcement forces. “Pakistan recognizes the benefits of recruiting, training, and promoting more women officers but there are also multiple challenges in this regard. Creating an enabling environment for women in the force to thrive and encourage others to join is crucial and a positive first step”.
Assistant Secretary U.S. State Department INL Todd Robinson said that this groundbreaking event demonstrates the long-term partnership between the US Government and Pakistan, this year we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the partnership between INL and Pakistan under the banner of “Justice, Security, and Prosperity”, with more than $1 billion invested by INL over four decades to improve citizen security and enhance law enforcement capacity across Pakistan. “Global practices have shown that diverse workforces lead to more effective and broader decision-making, and diversity is critical for establishing and maintaining public trust in policing “.  He also expressed his thanks to UNDP for its tireless efforts as the project’s implementing partner and highlighted that today is an important milestone in INL, ANF and UNDP partnership to strengthen Pakistan’s law enforcement forces.
Federal Secretary Ministry of Narcotics-Control Ms. Humaira Ahmad said that the Ministry is committed to work together with its development partners to peruse our common objectives in combatting illicit drugs transiting through Pakistan. Promoting recruitment, retention, advancement, and gender mainstreaming of women police in Pakistan is an important step in this journey”.
Chief Guest Federal Minister Narcotics Honourable Mr. Nawabzada Shazain Bugti congratulated UNDP, INL and ANF on their efforts to increase women’s representation in the force. “Women in Pakistan are strong, resilient and motivated to excel in any field and this intervention will provide them a conducive environment at ANF to thrive in”.
This project is being implemented under the UNDP's Strengthening Rule of Law Programme, which supports both supply and demand sides of the rule of law, justice, and security sector by strengthening institutional capacity, citizen rights, and by deepening the ongoing efforts to secure peace and stability.

PRESS RELEASE
Staggering scale of grave violations against children in conflict revealed in new UNICEF analysis
Between 2016 and 2020, average of 71 verified grave violations against children every day
NEW YORK/GENEVA, 28 June 2022 – Between 2005 and 2020, the United Nations verified over 266,000 grave violations against children committed by parties to conflict in more than 30 conflict situations across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, UNICEF said today in a new report[1].  This figure is a fraction of the violations believed to have occurred, as access and security constraints, among others, and the shame, pain, and fear that child and family survivors suffer often hamper the reporting, documentation and verification of grave violations against children in situations of armed conflict.
The report – 25 years of children and armed conflict: Taking action to protect children in war – found that between 2005 and 2020 more than 104,100 children have been verified as killed or maimed in situations of armed conflict; more than 93,000 children have been verified as recruited and used by parties to conflict; at least 25,700 children have been verified as abducted by parties to conflict; parties to conflict have raped, forcibly married, sexually exploited, and committed other grave forms of sexual violence against at least 14,200 children. The United Nations verified more than 13,900 incidents of attacks against schools and hospitals and verified no fewer than 14,900 incidents of denial of humanitarian access for children since 2005.
“This report lays out in the starkest possible terms the world’s failure to protect its children from grave violations during times of armed conflict,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Grave violations devastate children, families, and communities – and they tear at the fabric of society, making it even harder to restore and sustain peace, security, and stability. We must refuse to accept violations against children as an unavoidable outcome of war.”
Based on sixteen years of data from the Secretary-General’s Annual Report on Children and Armed Conflict, the report illustrates the impact that armed conflicts have had on children, by presenting trends of grave violations across the world and over time. The report examines how information on the documented patterns of grave violations is being used to respond to children’s needs and how engagement with parties to conflict – State and non-State actors alike[2]– enables ending and preventing grave violations.
The annual number of verified violations has gradually increased since 2005[3], surpassing 20,000 in a year for the first time in 2014 and reaching 26,425 in 2020. Between 2016 and 2020, the daily global average of verified grave violations stood at an alarming 71 violations. The elevated number of violations observed in recent years demonstrates the dramatic impact that armed conflict – and increasingly complex and protracted protection crises[4] – have on children.
The report notes that many children suffer from more than one violation, increasing their vulnerability. For example, abduction is often combined with or leads to other violations, particularly recruitment and use and sexual violence. Children – especially girls – who have been abducted and/or associated with parties to conflict are exposed to elevated risks of sexual violence, including rape, sexual exploitation and forced marriage.
The report found that grave violations against children were committed by all parties to conflict, States and non-State actors alike. Between 2016 and 2020, State actors – including national and international forces and coalitions – were responsible for at least 26% of all violations. In comparison, non-State actors accounted for about 58% of all verified violations, underscoring the importance of engagement with all parties to conflict, including non-state actors, to meaningfully end and prevent violations against children.
In order to bolster accountability, parties to conflict listed in the Secretary-General’s annual report on children and armed conflict develop and implement Action Plans with specific, concrete, and time-bound actions to establish sustainable measures to protect children from the impact of conflict. Between 2005 and 2021, a total of 37 Action Plans have been signed by parties to conflict in 17 conflict situations. Around 70 per cent of Action Plans were signed with non-State actors, with the remaining 30 per cent signed with State actors. The report lays out several examples highlighting the critical value and impact of Action Plans in bringing about positive change for children, both in the immediate and long terms, as well as outlining challenges and obstacles.
The ever-growing number of armed non-State actors, the development and employment of new means and methods of warfare, the use of improvised explosive devices and other explosive weapons, particularly in populated areas, are just some of the many factors contributing to the creation of unprecedented challenges for the protection of children in situations of armed conflict.
The report also found:
·       Children from poorer backgrounds and children of specific status or characteristics[5]  – including refugee, internally displaced and indigenous children, among others – remain at heightened risk of grave violations.
·       Available sex-disaggregated data indicates that verified incidents of grave violations have predominantly affected boys. [6]For instance, in 2020, boys accounted for 73 per cent of all child victims, with the vast majority of child victims of recruitment and use (85 per cent boys), abduction (76 per cent boys) and killing and maiming (70 per cent boys) being boys. In comparison, girls accounted for one-fourth (26 per cent) of all child victims, including 98 per cent of child victims of rape and other grave forms of sexual violence.
·       Between 2016 and 2020, 79 per cent of all verified child casualties – or about 41,900 children – occurred in only five situations: Afghanistan (30 per cent), Israel and the State of Palestine (14 per cent), Syria (13 per cent), Yemen (13 per cent) and Somalia (9 per cent).
·       The use of explosive weapons, particularly in populated areas and those with wide area effect, are a persistent threat to children and their families. In 2020 alone, explosive weapons and explosive remnants of war were responsible for at least 47 per cent of all child casualties, resulting in more than 3,900 children killed and maimed.
It is important to note that the increase in verified violations over time also underscores the increasing strength of the monitoring and reporting mechanism over the years. The development of guidance on monitoring and reporting, the training and capacity building of UN and its partners’ staff on documenting grave violations, and the awareness raising of families and communities on the protection risks for children, have all contributed to strengthen the mechanism and enabled it to collect increased information on grave violations against children.
Whilst the overall ability of the United Nations to document and verify incidents of grave violations has increased over time, it has fluctuated from one year to another, from one situation to another, and from one violation to another. In this regard, and based on all of the above, direct comparisons between situations, years, or violations should be undertaken with caution.
“UNICEF and our partners will not waver in our work to prevent grave violations against children,” said Russell. “With more children affected by conflict, violence, and crises now than at any time since the Second World War, this work has never been more urgent.”
The report recommendations, based on the evidence and analysis presented, aim to mobilize all concerned stakeholders, including parties to conflict, States, and the UN Security Council, to effectively and sustainably protect children and to accelerate action at local, national, regional, and global levels.
In addition to calling on parties to conflict, and states, to abide by their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law, the report includes recommendations on:
·       how to better provide adequate care and response services to children affected by conflict,
·       ways to improve data disaggregation and analysis for better response and prevention,
·       how to support Country Task Forces on Monitoring and Reporting (CTFMRs) to accelerate action, and improve CTFMR engagement with governments;
·       ways to better engage with parties to conflict to develop Action Plans and sustainably protect children.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON MICRO-, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES DAY
27 June 2022
Micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises represent around 90 per cent of global businesses, more than 60 percent of employment and half of GDP worldwide. They are the economic lifeblood of communities around the world.
But they have also been disproportionately impacted by a host of challenges that are disrupting economies -- from climate catastrophe to COVID-19 to the global fallout from the war in Ukraine.
The theme of this year’s Day, “Resilience and Rebuilding”, highlights the vital role of micro-, small and medium sized enterprises for a fair and sustainable recovery.
Strengthening small businesses helps fight poverty, create jobs and safeguard livelihoods, particularly for the working poor, women and youth.  We must all do more to support these enterprises in building resilience to external shocks and pursuing sustainable business models.
On this International Day of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, let us renew our commitment to leverage their full potential, rescue the Sustainable Development Goals and build a more prosperous and just world for all.

JOINT PRESS RELEASE
Federal Steering Committee assures strong commitment for EU-supported ‘Deliver Justice Project’ implemented by UNDP, UNODC and UN Women
Islamabad, 20 April 2022—The Federal Steering Committee (FSC) of the ‘Deliver Justice’ programme was held today at the Economic Affairs Division (EAD), where key federal and provincial government stakeholders and development partners came together to amplify programme oversight and to discuss challenges and opportunities.
The ‘Deliver Justice’ programme aims to support reform processes to ensure delivery of people-centered justice, enhance access to justice for all, particularly women and marginalized groups; and improve service delivery of the security sector in line with constitutional safeguards and international standards. Implemented in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Merged Areas, the programme is funded by the European Union and jointly implemented by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
Joint Secretary Economic Affair Division, Ms. Anita Turab chaired the meeting and thanked the European Union for its continued support for the rule of law and building capacity of relevant institutions. In her opening remarks, Ms. Turab emphasized that the Government of Pakistan has a strong commitment and interest in reinforcing the rule of law and justice system in Pakistan. She added, “The Government of Pakistan is pleased to partner with UNDP, UNODC and UN Women to implement the reform agenda smoothly under the EU-funded Rule of Law Programme in KP and Balochistan.”
In his welcome remarks, the Head of Cooperation of the European Union Delegation to Pakistan, Mr. Ovidiu Mic, reiterated the EU’s commitment to join forces with Pakistan to actively advance the delivery of justice, peace, and security for the people, particularly women and girls. He emphasized that “this work is also an essential part of the priorities of the EU-Pakistan Strategic Engagement Plan agreed in 2019.”
The inception phase of this programme last year provided the building blocks to support the current engagements and make a transition towards successful implementation of the programme. Enhanced partnerships at federal and provincial levels, engaging all key stakeholders in the rule of law sector including the Legal Aid and Justice Authority (LAJA) and the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) at the federal level, the Judicial Academies, the Courts, the Home Departments and relevant offices, were recognised as key achievements under the project.
On the occasion, the UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative, Mr. Knut Ostby, thanked the Government of Pakistan and the European Union for their continued support in strengthening the rule of law and access to justice in Pakistan. He said, “UNDP has been a long-standing partner of the Government of Pakistan in supporting and strengthening Rule of Law institutions for enhanced service delivery, and improving access to justice for citizens, particularly the most vulnerable and the marginalized. UNDP is privileged to be a long-standing partner in the development and implementation of Rule of Law roadmaps.”
UN Women Pakistan Representative, Ms. Sharmeela Rassool, in her remarks said, “UN Women is delighted to be part of this joint programme, and the core of our work focuses on supporting women, girls, and vulnerable segments of society access formal justice mechanisms. While in parallel we will build up the capacity of our government partners to provide justice and redressal mechanisms in an efficient, empathetic and gender sensitive manner.”
UNODC Pakistan Representative, Mr. Jeremy Milsom, assured UNODC’s commitment towards accelerating progress and catalyzing valuable reform in rule of law and criminal justice system through this project. “This first FSC meeting marks yet another milestone for this programme. As we all know, Provincial Steering Committee meetings have been successfully conducted both in Balochistan and KP in January this year. We are looking forward to the success of this meeting as well.”
During the meeting, the work plan for the current year was presented to the committee. The work plan included working alongside law enforcement agencies to strengthen rule of law, including initiation of trainings for two thousand police personnel from the Merged Areas. Refurbishment of the Prison Academy, seven district prisons in the Merged Areas and five central prisons will also take place. For Balochistan, work will commence on establishing smart police stations along with Police Facilitation centers. This workplan also includes establishment of smart classrooms in Balochistan Judicial Academy and Police Training College, Quetta. Prison Management Information System (PMIS) is also planned to be developed and implemented in the prison facilities of Balochistan.

UNWOMEN
PRESS RELEASE
UN Women Pakistan and the Centre for International Peace and Stability (CIPS) at National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST) signed an MOU
UN Women Pakistan and the Centre for International Peace and Stability (CIPS) at National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST) signed an MOU to collaborate on advancing gender-responsive peacekeeping operations. The signing ceremony took place at CIPS in Islamabad on June 24, 2022. It was signed between Ms. Sharmeela Rassool, Country Representative UN Women Pakistan and Major General (retd.) Muhammad Salim Raza, HI (M), Principal NIPCONS, NUST.
The MOU aims at strengthening organizational collaboration on issues relating to Gender Equality and Diversity through reciprocated partnership and training mechanisms for peacekeepers.
Pakistan is the largest and longest troop-contributing countries for UN peacekeeping forces around the globe, having deployed 200,000 forces since 1960. Pakistan also became the first country to achieve the goal of deployment of 15% female staff officers as nearly 450 women have served in UN missions. “UNSCR 1325 is the cornerstone of our peacekeeping operations. We recognize the differential role played by women in making communities more peaceful and resilient,” said Brig ® Mirza Saleem Beig, HOD UN Peacekeeping Training.
UN Women leads the mandate on implementing UNSCR 1325 relating to Women, Peace and Security Agenda (WPS) that aims to ensure women’s priorities are central to peacebuilding at all levels. To achieve this goal, it addresses social, cultural and political barriers and protection risks that limit women’s full participation in achieving and sustaining peace. In the peacekeeping sphere, women involvement ensures greater access to marginalized communities, helps in promoting human rights and the protection of civilians, and encourages women to become a meaningful part of peace and political processes.
“UN peacekeepers from Pakistan embody the spirit and values of Pakistani society as peace ambassadors. This MOU is a first step in strengthening integration of gender perspective in the training curriculum and further increasing women’s participation at all levels of peace processes,” said UN Women Country Representative Ms. Sharmeela Rassool.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY AGAINST DRUG ABUSE AND ILLICIT TRAFFICKING
26 June 2022
This year’s International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking shines a spotlight on the impact of drug challenges in health and humanitarian crises.
Conflicts, climate disasters, forced displacement and grinding poverty create fertile ground for drug abuse — with COVID-19 making a bad situation even worse. At the same time, people living through humanitarian emergencies are far less likely to have access to the care and treatment they need and deserve.
Meanwhile, criminals are profiting from people’s misery, with cocaine production at record highs, and a five-fold increase in seizures of methamphetamines and a near-quadrupling of amphetamine seizures over the last decade.
On this International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, we renew our commitment to ending this scourge and supporting those who fall victim to it.
This includes non-discriminatory policy solutions centred around people, health and human rights, underpinned by strengthened international cooperation to curb the illicit drug trade and hold accountable those who profit from human misery.
We must also strengthen science-based treatment and support services for drug users, and treat them as victims who need treatment rather than punishment, discrimination and stigma — including treatment for those living with infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.
We cannot allow the world’s drug problem to further shadow the lives of the tens of millions of people living through humanitarian crises.
On this important day, let us commit to lifting this shadow once and for all, and giving this issue the attention and action it deserves.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE SEAFARER
25 June 2022
The world counts on seafarers.
Their contribution is immeasurable. Ships transport a remarkable 90 per cent of the world’s commodities — from grains and energy, to consumer goods and much more. Without ships and the women and men who work on them, economies would stall and people would starve.
Seafarers worldwide have faced immense challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic — including contracts extended long beyond their expiry dates and maximum periods of service, and challenges related to vaccinations, medical care and shore leave.
This year’s theme — “Your Voyage, Then and Now” — is an opportunity to recognize the vital role seafarers play, and look to the future.
Above all, this means listening to seafarers themselves. They know better than anyone their needs and what this industry needs to do to address key challenges. This includes the expansion of social protection, better working conditions, addressing the crew-change crisis, adopting new digital tools to enhance safety and efficiency, and making this industry greener and more sustainable.
On this International Day of the Seafarer, we renew our commitment to supporting seafarers everywhere, and honouring the knowledge, professionalism and experience they bring to this essential industry.

PRESS RELEASE
Global hunger crisis pushing one child into severe malnutrition every minute in 15 crisis-hit countries
Ahead of G7 summit, UNICEF appeals for US$1.2 billion to meet urgent needs of 8 million children at risk of death from severe wasting
Multimedia content is available to download here
NEW YORK, 24 June 2022 — Almost 8 million children under 5 in 15 crisis-hit countries are at risk of death from severe wasting unless they receive immediate therapeutic food and care – with the number rising by the minute, UNICEF warned today as world leaders prepare to meet at the G7 summit.
Since the start of the year, the escalating global food crisis has forced an additional 260,000 children – or one child every 60 seconds – to suffer from severe wasting in 15 countries bearing the brunt of the crisis, including in the Horn of Africa and the Central Sahel. This rise in severe wasting is in addition to existing levels of child undernutrition that UNICEF warned amounted to a ‘virtual tinderbox’ last month.
“We are now seeing the tinderbox of conditions for extreme levels of child wasting begin to catch fire,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Food aid is critical, but we cannot save starving children with bags of wheat. We need to reach these children now with therapeutic treatment before it is too late.”
Soaring food prices driven by the war in Ukraine, persistent drought due to climate change in some countries, at times combined with conflict, and the ongoing economic impact of COVID-19 continue to drive up children’s food and nutrition insecurity worldwide, resulting in catastrophic levels of severe malnutrition in children under 5. In response, UNICEF is scaling up its efforts in 15 most affected countries. Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Yemen will be included in an acceleration plan to help avert an explosion of child deaths and mitigate the long-term damage of severe wasting.
Severe wasting – where children are too thin for their height – is the most visible and lethal form of undernutrition. Weakened immune systems increase the risk of death among children under 5 by up to 11 times compared to well-nourished children.
Within the 15 countries, UNICEF estimates that at least 40 million children are severely nutrition insecure, meaning they are not receiving the bare minimum diverse diet they need to grow and develop in early childhood. Further, 21 million children are severely food insecure, meaning they lack access to enough food to meet minimum food needs, leaving them at high risk of severe wasting.
Meanwhile, the price of ready-to-use therapeutic food to treat severe wasting has soared by 16 per cent in recent weeks due to a sharp rise in the cost of raw ingredients, leaving up to 600,000 additional children without access to life-saving treatment and at risk of death.
As leaders prepare to meet at the G7 summit, UNICEF is calling for US$ 1.2 billion to:
·       Deliver an essential package of nutrition services and care to avert what could be millions of child deaths in 15 highest burden countries, including prevention programmes to protect maternal and child nutrition among pregnant women and young children, early detection and treatment programmes for children with severe wasting, and the procurement, and distribution of ready-to-use therapeutic food.
·       Prioritize the prevention and treatment of severe wasting in all global food crisis response plans by ensuring budget allocations include preventive nutrition interventions as well as therapeutic food to address the immediate needs of children suffering from severe wasting.
“It is hard to describe what it means for a child to be ‘severely wasted,’ but when you meet a child who is suffering from this most lethal form of malnutrition, you understand – and you never forget,” said Russell. “World leaders gathering in Germany for the G7 Ministerial have a small window of opportunity to act to save these children’s lives. There is no time to waste. Waiting for famine to be declared is waiting for children to die.”
###
Notes to Editors
The rate of increase in child wasting is based on publicly available estimates for January and June 2022 as found in National Nutrition Cluster estimates (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and DRC), Integrated Phase Classification Acute Malnutrition Analyses (Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen, Madagascar and Haiti), Humanitarian Appeals for Children (Ethiopia, Afghanistan), and Humanitarian Needs Overviews (Sudan). The total number of children projected to suffer from severe wasting in January and June 2022 was estimated to be 7,674,098 and 7,934,357 respectively, an increase of 260,259 additional children.
As a result of the global food crisis, UNICEF also estimates that the cost of treatment of child wasting has already increased by an estimated 16 per cent, driven largely by increases in the price of essential nutrition commodities and their raw materials.

PRESS RELEASE
Schools ill-equipped to provide healthy and inclusive learning environments for all children – UNICEF, WHO
NEW YORK, GENEVA, 24 June 2022 – Despite a steady decline in the proportion of schools without basic water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, deep inequalities persist between and within countries, UNICEF and WHO said today. Schoolchildren in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and fragile contexts are the most affected, and emerging data shows that few schools have disability-accessible WASH services.
“Far too many children go to schools without safe drinking water, clean toilets, and soap for handwashing—making learning difficult,” said Kelly Ann Naylor, UNICEF Director of Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Climate, Environment, Energy, and Disaster Risk Reduction. “The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of providing healthy and inclusive learning environments. To protect children’s education, the road to recovery must include equipping schools with the most basic services to fight infectious diseases today and in the future.”
“Access to water, sanitation and hygiene is not only essential for effective infection prevention and control, but also a prerequisite for children’s health, development and well-being,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health. “Schools should be settings where children thrive and not be subjected to hardship or infections due to lack of, or poorly maintained, basic infrastructure.”
Schools play a critical role in promoting the formation of healthy habits and behaviours, yet many still lacked basic WASH services in 2021. According to the latest data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP):
·       Globally, 29 per cent of schools still lack basic drinking water services, impacting 546 million schoolchildren; 28 per cent of schools still lack basic sanitation services, impacting 539 million schoolchildren; and 42 per cent of schools still do not have basic hygiene services, 802 million schoolchildren.
·       One-third of children without basic services at their school live in LDCs, and over half live in fragile contexts.
·       Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania are the only two regions where coverage of basic sanitation and hygiene services in schools remains under 50 per cent; sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where coverage of basic drinking water services in schools remains under 50 per cent.
·       Achieving universal coverage in schools globally by 2030 requires a 14-fold increase in current rates of progress on basic drinking water, a three-fold increase in rates of progress on basic sanitation, and a five-fold increase in basic hygiene services.
·       In LDCs and fragile contexts, achieving universal coverage of basic sanitation services in schools by 2030 would require over 100-fold and 50-fold increases in respective current rates of progress.
·       Improving pandemic preparedness and response will require more frequent monitoring of WASH and other elements of infection prevention and control (IPC) in schools, including cleaning, disinfection and solid waste management.
·       Providing disability-accessible WASH services in schools is key to achieving inclusive learning for all children. Still, only a limited number of countries report on this indicator and national definitions vary, and far fewer provide disability-accessible WASH.
·       Emerging national data shows that disability-accessible WASH coverage is low and varies widely between school levels and urban and rural locations, with schools more likely to have accessible drinking water than accessible sanitation or hygiene.
·       In half the countries with data available, less than a quarter of schools had disability-accessible toilets. For example, in Yemen, 8 in 10 schools had toilets, but only 1 in 50 schools had disability-accessible toilets.
·       In most countries with data, schools were more likely to have adapted infrastructure and materials – such as ramps, assistive technology, learning materials – than disability-accessible toilets. For example, in El Salvador, 2 in 5 schools have adapted infrastructure and materials, but just 1 in 20 have disability-accessible toilets.

PRESS RELEASE
Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.
Everyone has the Right to Seek Safety
Pakistan and UNHCR mark World Refugee Day
ISLAMABAD, 20 June 2022 – World Refugee Day is an international day designated by the United Nations to honour refugees around the globe. It falls each year on June 20 and celebrates the strength and courage of people who have been forced to flee their home country to escape conflict or persecution.
Reflecting the global 2022 theme, “Whoever. Wherever. Whenever. Everyone has the Right to Seek Safety,” an event was held in Islamabad to express solidarity with refugees and appreciation for the enduring generosity of the communities hosting them, attended by representatives of the Government of Pakistan, international community and partners as well as refugees.
Speaking on the occasion, Ms. Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR’s Representative in Pakistan said that amid its own challenges, Pakistan has remained a steadfast host of those in need of international protection.
“This is also a day when we thank those who have welcomed newcomers into their communities. Pakistan has been a generous host to millions of refugees for more than 40 years,” she said. “The international community must mobilize more support to assist refugees and their host communities in this country.”
Pakistan now has some 1.3 million registered refugees and estimated 1.5 million Afghans of other status, which includes some 250,000 Afghans who have arrived since August 2021 according to the government.
Chief Guest, the Federal Minister for States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON), Senator Muhammad Talha Mahmood, drew attention to the plight of refugees and called for support to host communities. “The financial challenges of Pakistan in hosting more than three million Afghans in the country, including some 1.3 million Afghan refugees, requires sustainable, dedicated and generous support of the international community,” he noted.
Highlighting the need for sustainable durable solutions, the Minister further underscored that the international community must come forward to play their role under international responsibility and burden sharing, in line with the Global Compact on Refugees. “Voluntary return of Afghans in safety and dignity is the preferred solution for Pakistan,” he added.
Inspiring attendees in Islamabad, Dr. Saleem Rehman, regional winner of the 2021 Nansen Award, reminded those present, including refugees, to never give up and continue to pursue their dreams.
Numerous events related to World Refugee Day have taken place in other cities including Peshawar and Quetta, bringing together refugees and host communities and ensuring their voice is heard.

PRESS RELEASE
United Nations World Food Programme launches lifesaving nutrition intervention in Pakistan in partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu & Kashmir, 20 June 2022 — As part of the United Nations World Food Programme’s partnership with King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSRelief), WFP launched its Community-Based Management of Acute Malnutrition Programme (CMAM) in Pakistan today, aimed at preventing malnutrition in children under 5 years of age and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) in 14 vulnerable districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK).
The launch event was attended by the Deputy Head of Mission of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia H.E. Mr. Mohammad Kalaf Al-Enzi, Minister of Health in AJK Mr. Nisar Ansar Abdali, Minister of Finance in AJK Mr. Majid Khan, Director of KSRelief Dr. Khalid M. Al-Othmani, Deputy Country Director of WFP Ms. Rathi PalaKrishnan, representatives from the provincial governments of KP and AJK, civil society, and academia.
In her welcoming remarks, Ms. Rathi PalaKrishnan thanked KSRelief for the generous support and said: “As leaders of our organizations, communities, districts, provinces and states, let us all continue embarking on the journey to fight undernutrition and eradicate hunger for the children of Pakistan, and their children’s children”.
Her strong encouragement to put malnutrition on top of the agenda was followed by a presentation of the CMAM programme by WFP Pakistan. Through this project, WFP aims to support 57,500 malnourished children and PLW out of which 30,444 are children and 27,056 are PLW.
H.E. Mr. Mohammad Kalaf Al-Enzi stated: “We the people of Saudi Arabia will always stand with the people of Pakistan to fight against malnutrition in children, pregnant & lactating women of vulnerable districts of KP and AJK. I am very happy for the joint venture of KSRelief and the World Food Programme, and for taking this amazing initiative”.
Minister of Finance Mr. Majid Khan in his remarks said that the government of AJK strongly appreciates the much-needed support from KSRelief and WFP and stated: “we want our mothers and children to be healthy and have a bright future”. Minister of Health Mr. Nisar Ansar Abdali highlighted the sustainability and long-term benefits of the implementation modality of the CMAM programme, which includes capacity strengthening of the Government’s Lady Health Workers (LHWs) and local community workers.
Pakistan has an extraordinarily high and persistent level of child undernutrition, which increases morbidity and mortality, impacts physical and cognitive growth, diminishes learning capacity and school performance, and leads to lower adult productivity. In response to this critical situation and recognizing the need for providing holistic multisectoral approach, WFP has been implementing nationwide programmes to treat and prevent undernutrition in the country. This includes the CMAM programme, which is implemented in conjunction with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Dr. Khalid Muhammad Al-Othmani in his comments said: “On behalf of KSRelief I would like to thank the World Food Programme for helping us to support 57,500 malnourished children and pregnant & lactating women suffering from different kinds of diseases in the affected areas of KP and AJK. For many years, these regions have also been impacted by various risks and natural calamities”.
The event aimed to advocate the importance of fighting malnutrition and raise awareness amongst stakeholders and policy makers about the grave situation where currently the annual burden of wasting is estimated at 5 million children in Pakistan. Other participants at the event shared their views on the urgency to fight this silent emergency, with a shared vision that the integration of community-based management of acute malnutrition will address many of the urgent needs to combat malnutrition in the targeted districts of the programme.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN CONFLICT
19 June 2022
Sexual violence in conflict is a tactic of war and repression that terrorizes populations, destroys lives and fractures communities.
Perpetrators rarely face the consequences of their actions. Instead, it is the survivors who carry the burden of stigma and trauma throughout their lives, often doubly brutalized by harmful social norms and victim-blaming.
On this International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict, we stand in solidarity with survivors and commit to supporting the most vulnerable women, girls, men and boys as they struggle to live in dignity and peace in the midst of humanitarian crises.
This includes increasing support for victims and displaced women, girls and boys who are vulnerable to trafficking and sexual exploitation, and those from marginalized, remote and rural areas where justice and protection systems are weak.
It means bolstering national justice systems and rule of law capacities, so perpetrators are held accountable for their crimes, and victims receive timely medical and psychosocial support.
It means upholding the rights of survivors, and treating them with respect and understanding, while giving them the opportunity to help mend their fragmented communities.
It means supporting women-led civil society organizations working to break down the social, economic and cultural barriers that deny women and girls their rights to protection, equality and justice.
And it means addressing the underlying causes of sexual violence in conflict — from inequalities, to institutional weaknesses and militarization — and strengthening early warning systems to prevent these crimes from happening in the first place.
With increased political resolve and financial resources, we can match words with action and end the scourge of sexual violence in conflict, once and for all.

PRESS RELEASE
UNHCR Deputy Chief concludes visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan, urges support to address humanitarian needs
The UN Refugee Agency’s Deputy High Commissioner Kelly T. Clements visited Afghanistan and Pakistan this week to focus attention on the dramatic humanitarian situation facing Afghans and the need to continue to support displaced people – including host communities, refugees and returnees, and women and girls.
Inside Afghanistan, UNHCR with partners works to assist some 3.5 million displaced by conflict, and provides crucial aid to help meet the needs of vulnerable people, including targeted reintegration support to many of the millions of refugees who have returned over the years.
“UNHCR continues to support Afghanistan, as it has for 40 years, but is now intensively trying to support internally displaced, returnees and refugees, including by expanding its presence throughout the country. ”
During her four days in Afghanistan, UNHCR’s deputy chief met with interim officials and visited Herat Province, in the west of the country. She inaugurated a women’s business centre - a facility for women-run firms including kiosks for various shops as well as computer literacy, English language training, and counselling resources.
Clements sat with women and girls in meetings in Herat and Kabul and heard their concerns, highlighting the need for an inclusive human rights-based approach to support voluntary return and sustainable reintegration.
“The women (in Afghanistan) are extremely resilient. They talked about education. They talked about the need for livelihoods. They talked about wanting to be a part of public life in Afghanistan. They want to educate their girls, to be a part of shaping the future of the country,” Clements said.
Since last August, Afghanistan’s women and girls have increasingly experienced limits on their access to education, ability to freely move without a male relative, and requirements to wear face coverings. Girls have been prevented from attending school above year six in most of the country.
So far in 2022, UNHCR has provided cash, winter support, shelter materials and other household assistance to nearly one million vulnerable Afghans. UNHCR’s $340 million appeal for its Afghanistan operations is only 57 per cent funded, while the Humanitarian Response Plan for $4.4 billion, has received only 32 per cent.
In Pakistan, the Deputy High Commissioner highlighted the precious right to asylum and thanked the people and government for generously hosting millions of Afghans for more than 40 years. Pakistan now has some 1.3 million registered refugees, and 1.5 million Afghans of undetermined status, which includes some 250,000 Afghans who have arrived since August 2021 according to the government.
The Deputy High Commissioner met with Pakistan’s Foreign Minister, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, and Minister of States and Frontier Regions, Muhammad Talha Mahmood, among other officials. Her discussions focused on the need for peace in Afghanistan and lasting solutions for the refugee population in neighbouring countries.
Clements welcomed the ongoing commitment of Pakistan to register the births of refugee children and issuing birth certificates and the provision of more than 1,700 university places to ensure that Afghans can access to advanced studies.
The Deputy High Commissioner encouraged Pakistan to remain steadfast in its attention to Afghans in exile and called for strengthened international support.
“Afghans need to see they are not alone and that the international community stands with them, and appreciates Pakistan’s enduring willingness to include refugees in its communities and services,” Clements said.
Clements traveled to Haripur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, where she met with Afghans, including girls and women, in a refugee village established in 1979, and noted their strength and determination to shape their own futures and contribute to their communities.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD REFUGEE DAY
20 June 2022
On World Refugee Day, we reflect on the courage and resilience of those fleeing war, violence, and persecution – and we recognize the compassion of those who welcome them.
Today, the global refugee population is at a record high.
The war in Ukraine has triggered the largest and fastest displacement in Europe since World War II.
Together with the women, children, and men fleeing conflict elsewhere in the world, the total number of forcibly displaced people has reached 100 million – a grim indictment of our times.
This year’s World Refugee Day affirms a fundamental tenet of our common humanity: everyone has the right to seek safety – whoever they are, wherever they come from, and whenever they are forced to flee.
International law is clear:
The right to seek asylum is a fundamental human right.
People escaping violence or persecution must be able to cross borders safely.
They must not face discrimination at borders or be unfairly denied refugee status or asylum due to their race, religion, gender, or country of origin.
They cannot be forced to return if their lives or freedom would be at risk.
And like every human being, they should be treated with respect.
But safety is just the first step.
Once out of harm’s way, refugees need opportunities.
Opportunities to heal, to learn, to work, and to thrive.
Opportunities to return home if they so choose, or to rebuild their lives elsewhere, in safety and dignity.
Across the world, refugees have brought new life, prosperity, and rich cultural diversity to their host communities.
Protecting refugees is a responsibility we all share.
Today, let us pledge to do more for refugees everywhere – and for the countries that host them while themselves facing a cascade of challenges.
Let us stand together in solidarity.
Let us defend the integrity of the international protection regime.
And let us never lose sight of our common humanity.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR COUNTERING HATE SPEECH
New York, 18 June 2022
Hate speech incites violence, undermines diversity and social cohesion, and threatens the common values and principles that bind us together.
It promotes racism, xenophobia and misogyny; it dehumanizes individuals and communities; and it has a serious impact on our efforts to promote peace and security, human rights, and sustainable development.
Words can be weaponized and cause physical harm. The escalation from hate speech to violence has played a significant role in the most horrific and tragic crimes of the modern age, from the antisemitism driving the Holocaust, to the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.
The internet and social media have turbocharged hate speech, enabling it to spread like wildfire across borders. The spread of hate speech against minorities during the COVID-19 pandemic provides further evidence that many societies are highly vulnerable to the stigma, discrimination and conspiracies it promotes.
In response to this growing threat, three years ago, I launched the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech. This provides a framework for our support to Member States to counter this scourge while respecting freedom of expression and opinion, in collaboration with civil society, the media, technology companies and social media platforms.
Last year, the General Assembly came together to pass a resolution calling for inter-cultural and inter-religious dialogue to counter hate speech – and proclaimed the International Day we mark today for the first time.
Hate speech is a danger to everyone and fighting it is a job for everyone. This first International Day to Counter Hate Speech is a call to action. Let us recommit to doing everything in our power to prevent and end hate speech by promoting respect for diversity and inclusivity.

The event aimed to advocate the importance of fighting malnutrition and raise awareness amongst stakeholders and policy makers about the grave situation where currently the annual burden of wasting is estimated at 5 million children in Pakistan. Other participants at the event shared their views on the urgency to fight this silent emergency, with a shared vision that the integration of community-based management of acute malnutrition will address many of the urgent needs to combat malnutrition in the targeted districts of the programme.

PRESS RELEASE
United Nations Development Programme launches the Business and Human Rights (B+HR) project in Pakistan in partnership with the Government of Japan
Karachi, 16 June 2022—As part of a global partnership with the Government of Japan in 17 countries, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) launched its Business and Human Rights (B+HR) project in Pakistan yesterday, aimed at promoting responsible business conduct, with a particular focus on promoting corporate Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD).
The launch event was attended by representatives from the Embassy and Consulate-General of Japan, UNDP, Japanese corporations operating in Pakistan, the Pakistan Japan Business Forum, civil society, and academia. The participants shared their views on the current challenges and opportunities in accelerating B+HR in Pakistan, with a shared vision that the integration of human rights principles in business practices would promote not only the rights of the workers, but also increase business opportunities for the corporations.
UNDP Pakistan provided an overview of the B+HR project to key stakeholders, including Japanese companies in Pakistan and local partners. The event aimed to advocate the relevance of HRDD, a key focus area of the project. It was also an opportunity to raise awareness amongst provincial stakeholders about Pakistan’s National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights (NAP), launched in September 2021.
UNDP Pakistan’s Assistant Resident Representative Mr. Rana Kaiser Ishaque thanked the Government of Japan for its support in strengthening human rights protections across business activity in Pakistan and said, “Through this partnership, UNDP aims to raise awareness on the importance of corporate HRDD.” Mr. Tadayoshi Hiraki, Commercial Attaché at the Embassy of Japan, highlighted that this project would provide an opportunity for Japanese companies to mainstream the human rights-based approach, thereby enhancing their corporate social responsibility and attracting further investment. Mr. Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Director International Cooperation at the Federal Ministry of Human Rights, shared key initiatives taken by the Ministry to promote responsible business practices in Pakistan and reiterated, “The project will further enhance multistakeholder coordination required for the effective implementation of the NAP.”
Following the opening remarks, UNDP highlighted the two objectives of the project—provision of technical guidance to the private sector on the implementation of HRDD; and supporting the Government of Pakistan in the implementation of the NAP (the development of which UNDP has supported the Ministry of Human Rights with since 2018). This was followed by two panel discussions with a detailed emphasis on the above-mentioned objectives.
During the first panel on the role of duty-bearers in protecting human rights in business activity in Pakistan, speakers discussed the importance of policy documents such as the NAP in promoting responsible business activity in Pakistan, and measures to bolster their effective implementation. Speakers in the panel included Shahzad Ahmad Khan from the Ministry of Human Rights, Anis Haroon from the National Commission for Human Rights, Noreen Bashir from the Sindh Human Rights Department, and Zulfiqar Shah from the Sindh Human Rights Commission.
During the second panel, speakers discussed both opportunities and challenges for the practice of corporate human rights due diligence in Pakistan and provided recommendations for stakeholder collaboration to build both awareness and capacity of the private sector in this regard. Mr. Kazunori Yamaguchi from the Japan External Trade Organization, Mr. Kalim Farooqui from the Pakistan-Japan Business Forum, Ms. Kiran Khawaja from Indus Motors Ltd/Toyota, and Ms. Farhat Perveen from NOW Communities were the speakers of the second panel.

PRESS RELEASE
Nearly 37 million children displaced worldwide – highest number ever recorded
Ahead of World Refugee Day, UNICEF urges governments to strengthen protection and access to services for refugee, migrant and displaced children
NEW YORK, 17 June 2022 – Conflict, violence and other crises left a record 36.5 million children displaced from their homes at the end of 2021, UNICEF estimates – the highest number recorded since the Second World War. This figure includes 13.7 million refugee and asylum-seeking children† and nearly 22.8 million children who are internally displaced due to conflict and violence.
These figures do not include children displaced by climate and environmental shocks or disasters, as well as those newly displaced in 2022, including by the war in Ukraine.
The record number of children displaced is a direct result of cascading crises – including acute and protracted conflicts such as in Afghanistan, fragility in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo or Yemen and linked shocks exacerbated by the impacts of climate change. Just like fragility, child displacement is spreading fast. During the previous year, the global number of displaced children increased by 2.2 million.
"We can't ignore the evidence: The number of children being displaced by conflict and crises is rapidly growing – and so is our responsibility to reach them," said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. "I hope this alarming number will move governments to prevent children from being displaced in the first place – and when they are displaced, to ensure their access to education, protection, and other critical services that support their wellbeing and development now and in the future."
Crises like the war in Ukraine – which has caused more than 2 million children to flee the country and displaced 3 million internally since February – come on top of this record high.  Additionally, children and families are also being driven from their homes by extreme weather events, such as by drought in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, and severe flooding in Bangladesh, India and South Africa. There were 7.3 million new displacements of children as a consequence of natural disasters in 2021.
The global refugee population has more than doubled in the last decade, with children making up almost half of the total. Over a third of displaced children live in Sub-Saharan Africa (3.9 million or 36 per cent), one quarter in Europe and Central Asia (2.6 million or 25 per cent), and 13 per cent (1.4 million) in the Middle East and North Africa.
As the number of displaced and refugee children reaches a record high, access to essential support and services like healthcare, education and protection is falling short. Around two-thirds of all refugee children are enrolled in primary school, while only around one-third of refugee adolescents are in secondary school.
Uprooted children – whether refugee, asylum seeker or internally displaced – can face grave risks to their well-being and safety. This is particularly true for the hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied or separated children who are at heightened risk of trafficking, exploitation, violence and abuse. Children account for approximately 34 per cent of detected trafficking victims globally.
UNICEF urges Member States to adhere to their commitments to the rights of all uprooted children, including commitments established under the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) and the Global Compact for Migration (GCM), and to invest further in data and research that reflects the true scale of the issues facing refugee, migrant and displaced children.
UNICEF calls on governments to take six actions to achieve equal rights and opportunities for all refugee, migrant and displaced children:
1.            Provide equal support to all children – wherever they come from;
2.            Recognize refugee, migrant and displaced children as children first and foremost – with rights to protection, development and participation;
3.            Increase collective action to ensure effective access to essential services – including health care and education – for all uprooted children and families regardless of status;
4.            Protect refugee, migrant and displaced children from discrimination and xenophobia;
5.            End harmful border management practices and child immigration detention; and
6.            Empower refugee, migrant and displaced youth to unleash their talents and realize their full potential.

Notes to editors:
The figure includes refugees under mandate of UNHCR and UNRWA, respectively, as well as children of Venezuelan origin displaced abroad as reported separately by UNHCR.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF FAMILY REMITTANCES
16 June 2022
The International Day of Family Remittances recognizes the contributions of hundreds of millions of migrant workers to their communities of origin.
Family remittances are not only a main source of income for households, but account for a substantial portion of the Gross Domestic Product in many low-and-middle income countries. Global remittances are three times greater than Official Development Assistance and help reduce poverty, improve health and education, and advance gender equality.
This year’s theme, “Recovery and Resilience through Digital and Financial Inclusion”, highlights an urgent priority. Nearly half the world’s population cannot access the internet. And COVID-19 has exacerbated the digital divide.
We must accelerate our efforts to bring everyone online, while investing in digital tools and financial inclusion for all. The cost of remittances must be brought close to zero to help families manage their obligations efficiently.
The war in Ukraine is also impacting remittances and aggravating the widespread cost of living crisis. As countries redirect traditional development assistance to meet immediate needs, protecting the function and delivery of remittances is vital. This will strengthen resilience, drive economic growth and foster social inclusion.
On this Day of Family Remittances, let us renew the commitment of the Sustainable Development Goals to leave no one behind.

PRESS-RELEASE
UNDP and Jazz commit to accelerate digital inclusion amongst women
Islamabad, 08 June 2022—Reiterating their commitment to accelerate digital inclusion in the country, Jazz and UNDP Pakistan organized a ‘Girls in ICT’ event highlighting the importance of digital skills for women and promoting Digital Gender Inclusion through enhanced access to ICTs (Information and Communications Technology).
According to the GSM Association (GSMA) there exists a significant digital gender gap in Pakistan where approximately 38% of women are less likely than men to own a smartphone, and 49% do not use mobile internet.[1] Furthermore, there are drastic differences in levels of ICT access between different population groups, particularly the rural and marginalised women and girls.
Considering this prevailing scenario, the event included a panel discussion on ‘How to enhance Digital Literacy amongst school-going girls?’ with chief guest SAPM on Youth Affairs, Shaza Fatima Khawaja; Additional Secretary of Ministry of IT & Telecommunications, Ayesha Moriani; Director Communications and Sustainability at Jazz, Fatima Akhtar; and Founder of AGAHI and Lecturer at NUST, Puruesh Chaudhary. Ideas were exchanged on multi-level solutions to ensure safe and meaningful access to digital technology and ICTs for girls.
Speaking at the event, SAPM on Youth Affairs reiterated the commitment of the incumbent government to quality education, investment in health, and financial inclusion for women and girls. SAPM said that the Prime Minister's Youth Program is ensuring gender parity for maximum engagement of young girls through hi-tech skills trainings, business loans, and gender quotas in the laptop scheme.
"Access, affordability, and lack of literacy remain core impediments for women’s inclusion in ICT. To further our vision for an inclusive and digital Pakistan, there is an immediate need to facilitate participation of women in technology through public and private cooperation," said Shaza Fatima Khawaja, SAPM Youth Affairs.
“The Girls in ICT agenda is an area that UNDP Pakistan sees as a key opportunity for youth and women’s economic empowerment. We are keen to continue our support in this area as we move forward in developing a digital space that holds many untapped opportunities for women's economic empowerment in Pakistan, and in the region,” said Amir Goraya, Assistant Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan.
Speaking at the event, Jazz CEO, Aamir Ibrahim, said, “Considering the importance of women to lead Pakistan into the future, Jazz has programs in place to enhance digital literacy among girls, maximising women-led enterprises in the startup ecosystem, promoting diversity & inclusion within our workplace besides enabling women to access health, financial, and other life-enhancing services through mobile broadband. It is heartening to see government representatives championing women inclusion in ICT because their support is absolutely necessary to achieve our objectives.”
Numerous students at the event participated in a group activity to brainstorm ideas on promoting inclusion of girls and women in the ICT space. These ideas were then presented to the audience and panel. Aziza Soleh, Founder of the startup MountainShop, a part of Jazz and UNDP’s recently concluded SDG Bootcamp, took to the stage to share her entrepreneurial journey as well.
UNDP Pakistan’s Youth Empowerment Programme has been working towards the economic empowerment of Pakistani youth with a particular focus on women and minorities. Some of the initiatives relevant to promoting women in ICT include digiskills training with over 2,000 young girls from KP; supporting the world’s largest annual start-up competition for women and technology, She-Loves-Tech, which has supported over 130 women-led tech startups over the past three years; and supporting Sehat Kahani in training 500 women doctors and 500 nurses and healthcare staff in digital health service delivery.
Jazz is playing a critical role in addressing many of the wider gender inequalities by digitally enabling women to access health, financial, and other life-enhancing services. As part of the GSMA’s Connected Women Commitment Initiative, Jazz has committed to increase the proportion of women by 8 percent in its mobile internet customer base by 2023. Its digital financial service, JazzCash has already met its GSMA Connected Women target two years ahead of time with 22 percent women subscribed to JazzCash wallets. GSMA in its ‘Making internet-enabled phones more affordable in low and middle-income countries’ 2022 Report has also recognized Jazz’s Digit 4G smart feature phone as a successful rollout to address the digital gender gap.

Islamabad (7 June 2022), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) together with all its public and private partners under the Project for Agri-Food and Agro-Industry Development assistance in Pakistan (PAFAID) celebrated World Food Safety Day to encourage healthy food practices to increase the sustainable production and consumption of safe foods to improve health outcomes.
The United Nations General Assembly established World Food Safety Day in 2018 to raise awareness of this important issue. WHO announced the theme for this year’s World Food Safety Day, “Safer food, better health”.  UNIDO joins the World Food Safety Day campaign to ensure safe food for all.

Opening the World Food Safety Day celebration, Ms. Nadia Aftab, UNIDO Country Representative, said “Food producers need to adopt good practices and must make sure that the food is safe. Improved food safety contributes to food security and lowers malnutrition, which ultimately reduces the burden on public health infrastructure”. She also appreciated the Government of Japan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for funding PAFAID, and the MNSFR, the public and private counterparts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces for their continuous support for the effective implementation of PAFAID and ensuring Food security in the country.
Ms. Ritsuko Hagiwara, Representative JICA, stressed on the importance of food safety, and further apricated both the public and private stakeholders on raising awareness on world food safety day. Speaking at the occasion, Dr. Khurshid Ahmed DG National Veterinary Laboratory MNSFR said, “Agriculture is a priority area for the Government of Pakistan to ensure food security for all segments of the society.” He added, “Food Safety is inevitable to prevent food-borne illnesses and helps reduce the burden on public health infrastructure and for your products to reach export markets. Therefore, I would like to appreciate the work UNIDO is doing and the hard work all the departments are carrying out on the ground on daily basis to ensure the public has access to safe food.”
The representatives of KPFSHFA, LDD, and the LCB also shared their remarks on food safety at the occasion. Ms. Lubna Tajik, Lead National Project Coordinator PAFAID, shared the achievements of the project and highlighted the contributions of UNIDO and its public and private partners in food safety.

JOINT PRESS RELEASE
PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS PROGRAMME (PrEP) LAUNCHED BY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT, GOVERNMENT OF SINDH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNITED NATIONS
Karachi 07 JUNE 2022—The Health Department of Government of Sindh, in partnership with the United Nations in Pakistan, launched the Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Programme (PrEP) in Karachi today.
PrEP is considered a ‘game changer’ in the prevention of HIV. Even though it has been more than 10 years since the first evidence of the efficacy of daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was published, much of the PrEP scale-up is still highly concentrated in a small number of countries. Health Department, Government of Sindh in partnership with the United Nations in Pakistan, set a precedent in the country today by launching community-based- PrEP for key populations and sero-discordant couples. PrEP does not replace condoms but offers an additional HIV prevention choice. Community-based PrEP dispensation is critical because CBOs working in Sindh have outreach programs and can play a pivotal role in creating awareness and ensuring stigma-free access to PrEP programmes.
With support from UNAIDS along with WHO and UNDP, the Government of Pakistan developed guidelines and standard operating procedures for community and health facility-based dispensation of PrEP. The launch event was organized under the leadership of the Director General Health Services of the Health Department Sindh in partnership with UNAIDS, UNDP and WHO. Immediately following the launch event, a training will be held with ART Centre staff from around the Sindh province on ensuring effective and evidence-based PrEP services.
During an interactive dialogue session, Dr. Ershad Kazmi, Additional Director, CDC Health Department of Sindh shared that between 2010 and 2020, Pakistan has seen an increase of 84% in new HIV infections and unless we take bold steps today, we will not be able to halt further new infections and PrEP is a step in the right direction. Addressing the participants, he further emphasized that “PrEP offers a significant strategic opportunity to precision target prevention programmes for key populations. For the administering of PrEP to sero-discordant couples and key populations, formal linkages have been established between ART Centres and the outreach component of the current programme. This approach utilizes outreach workers at the frontline to engage individuals who are at risk for HIV. Their main task is to connect members from the community to public health services, so that they can be reached by HIV prevention programs that will now include PrEP. Outreach workers disseminate HIV prevention packages, provide safe sex education materials and support for behaviour changes, and most importantly, refer the community for HIV testing and counselling and created linkages with ART treatment centres.”
Ms. Yuki Takemoto, UNAIDS Country Director Pakistan and Afghanistan congratulated the Health Department Government of Sindh for formally launching the PrEP programme and said, “We are impressed by the political commitment and concrete actions by the government to address the needs of communities. Ensuring a supportive, enabling environment free from stigma and discrimination will help achieve the targets of the Sindh AIDS Strategy 2021-2025 and contribute effectively towards ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Community outreach workers and counselors have the advantage of being able to reach key populations including hard-to-reach communities The integration of community-led HIV prevention programs and the meaningful participation of communities are critical to ensure that policies and services are responsive to community needs.”
Ms. Aliona Niculita, Officer In-Charge, UNDP Pakistan added “The HIV response in Pakistan requires bold leadership and evidence-based approaches. UNDP is proud to partner with community-based organizations, and the Sindh CDC and the National AIDS Control Program in bringing PrEP, an effective HIV prevention tool, to communities who need this service the most.”
Heather Doyle, Programme Manager for the HIV Global Fund grant at UNDP, participated in the launch on behalf of UNDP and added that “UNDP has been honored to work closely with Sindh CDC, UNAIDS and the community partners to push this initiative forward. We look forward to continuing this partnership so that everyone who needs PrEP has access.”
Several members from the community-based organizations and representatives from key populations participated in the launch and expressed hope that chances of new HIV infections will get reduced through PrEP uptake. According to research, when taken daily as directed, PrEP can reduce the risk of HIV infections by more than 90 percent. One community representative said, “Since we don’t have vaccination for HIV as we have for COVID 19, PrEP is a gift of medical science to the communities that can help prevent HIV among those who are at higher risk. While a vaccine or cure may one day end the HIV epidemic, PrEP is a powerful tool that has the potential to alter the course of the HIV epidemic in Pakistan in the coming years.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people at substantial risk of HIV should be offered pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV infection (PrEP). PrEP is the use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs by people who do not have HIV infection in order to prevent the acquisition of HIV. WHO Representative in Pakistan, Dr Palitha Mahipala expressed that PrEP should not replace or compete with effective and well-established HIV prevention interventions, rather it should be an additional prevention choice in a comprehensive package of services that also includes HIV testing, counselling, provision of condoms, lubricants, ARV treatment for partners with HIV infection and harm reduction interventions for people who use drugs. While many people who could benefit most from PrEP belong to key population groups that may face legal and social barriers to accessing health services.
“PrEP is a novel approach to HIV prevention that requires continuing collaboration between patients and health care providers, as effectiveness requires adherence to daily medication and regular medical visits for monitoring, counselling and testing,” said Dr. Syed Faisal Mehmood, Associate Professor and Section Head, Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine at Aga Khan University.
About UNAIDS

MEDIA ADVISORY
Thousands to gather for UN Ocean Conference to launch a fleet of innovative solutions to stop rapid decline of our ocean’s health
Rising sea levels, ocean warming and acidification pose a threat to biodiversity, food security and livelihoods
The ocean – our biggest ally against climate change – is in serious trouble. The UN Ocean Conference (27 June to 1 July), co-hosted by Portugal and Kenya, is a unique opportunity to boost collective efforts and find science-based solutions to effectively address the challenges that the ocean is now facing.
According to the World Meteorological Organization’s State of the Global Climate 2021 report, the world's oceans in 2021 grew to their warmest and most acidic levels on record. Carbon emissions from human activities are causing ocean warming, acidification and oxygen loss, which in turn threaten organisms and ecosystem services, and negatively impact food security, the tourism industry and the economy.
The science is clear: the ocean — critical to combatting climate change, boosting economic growth and reducing biodiversity loss — is seriously degraded, and if present trends continue, there will be catastrophic consequences for the planet.
Heads of Government and State together with leaders from the private sector, the scientific community and other partners will gather at the Conference to chart a new pathway that would ensure the protection and conservation of the ocean and its resources.
In addition to plenary sessions, there will be 8 interactive dialogues focusing on a wide range of ocean issues: from addressing marine pollution to promoting ocean-based economies to increasing scientific knowledge and transfer of marine technology. These dialogues offer individuals and communities opportunities to forge bold commitments to advance ocean action.
The official programme will be accompanied by four special events focusing on youth, the sustainable blue economy, fresh- and saltwater interlinkages and ocean action at the local and regional level.
·       Youth and Innovation Forum, Cascais, Portugal (24-26 June)
The Youth and Innovation Forum will be a platform for advancing ocean action and implementing youth-led solutions. It will seek to help young entrepreneurs and innovators scale up their initiatives, projects and ideas through professional training and matchmaking with mentors, investors, the private sector and government officials.
·       Localising Action for the Ocean: Local and Regional Governments Forum, Matosinhos, Portugal (25 June)
This will be a space for local and regional governments and other stakeholders to announce new voluntary commitments in support of Ocean Action. The event will also seek to facilitate a discussion on opportunities and initiatives that can support sustainable adaptation for coastal cities and regions, including financing innovation and scaling up ocean protection.
·       High-Level Symposium on Water, Lisbon, Portugal (27 June)
This Symposium is an opportunity to bring together political leaders and high-level decision makers dealing both with “fresh” and “salt” water, reflecting on how to better connect these two communities to guarantee an integrated vision of the water cycle. By doing so, the symposium seeks to strengthen the role of water and ocean in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement
·       Sustainable Blue Economy Investment Forum, Cascais, Portugal (28 June)
The forum is an opportunity to establish a common language for a sustainable ocean economy and to explore how to build synergies between integrated Ocean Management Plans, trade finance, marketing and distribution value chains and the private sector.

PRESS RELEASE
Secure land tenure a landmark step for agricultural transformation in Gilgit-Baltistan with IFAD assistance
6 June 2022 – Skardu - Here today in Skardu, for the first time in the recent past of Gilgit-Baltistan, secure land tenure titles were given for 322 possessions to the households of village Kharfaq, District Ghanche, Baltistan. The women headed households also benefited and received the land titles.
The chief guest Mr. Shuja Alam, Commissioner Baltistan Division and IFAD Country Director Pakistan, Hubert Boirard awarded the land tenure titles to household from the village at the regional office of Economic Transformation Initiative, Gilgit-Baltistan (ETI-GB) at Skardu.  Under the project secure land titles will be provided to around 30 000 household for a total of 50 000 acres, thanks to the historical policy reforms introduced by the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan with the assistance of IFAD. At the occasion were also present, Mr. Muhammad Raza, Deputy Commission, Ghanche; Mr. Zakir Hussain, Additional Secretary, Tourism Department, GB; Mr. Nasrullah, Deputy Director, Water Management Department, Ghanche; Mr. Muahmmad Naseem, Deputy Chief Planning, Planning and Development Department, GoGB; Mr. Sadaqat Hussain, Regional Programme Manager, AKRSP; Mr. Fida Muhammad, Country Programme Officer, IFAD; Ms. Sumaira, Country Programme Analyst, IFAD and staff of the regional coordination unit, ETIGB.
Speaking at the occasion, Mr. Hubert Boirard, Country Director, IFAD highlighted the exceptional achievements obtained under the ETI-GB programme in terms an new irrigated land developed (42 000 acres already), Farm to market roads (381 km) and professional farm organization supported (223). He attributed the success of ETI-GB to the multiple innovative ways to implement this programme and in particular the community lead approach, the excellent collaboration between line department, government of GB, implementing partners and ETI-GB project management unit. This land titling distribution will initiate a new dynamic in agriculture. By doubling the surface of the farm of around 30 % of the rural population, the income and food security at farm level will be now and for the future guarantee.
At the occasion, Mr. Shuja Alam, Commission Baltistan expressed his sincere gratitude to the IFAD for its assistance and stressed for continuation of this successful project in the remaining districts of GB. He also congratulated the households for receiving the land titles and urged them to continue their hard work for cultivating the land to ensure their food security and prosperity.
ETIGB is a 7 year initiative co-financed by Government of Gilgit-Baltistan and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The USD 120 million investment project is implemented in the overall province of Gilgit-Balistan and focus on new irrigation and land development, farm to market roads and professional business oriented farmers’ organisation development.
Cultivated land being the most important resource for the rural households regarding food security and livelihoods has been fragmenting over time with the increasing population. The average landholding in the focused districts was 0.6 acre per household as a baseline situation, which represented an unviable economic unit of farming thus compelling outmigration in most cases. With the intervention of ETI-GB the average landing holding for the 1/3rd of rural population has been more than doubled offering an opportunity to improve livelihoods and food security.
Secure land title have been a complex challenge. For the last 36 years (since 1986), land titling has remained pending in unsettled areas of Gilgit-Baltistan. This has been, among others, a key constraint for the population regarding investment in land development, agribusiness and most importantly inability to present it as a collateral for access to formal finance. Secure land titling was one of the policy reform agenda under the ETIGB to facilitate economic transformation processes.
The Policy of Secure Land Tenure, particularly covering the 50,000 acres to be brought under irrigation  and cultivation under IFAD assisted ETIGB in District; Ghizer, Ghanche, Astore and Diamer was approved by the Cabinet of Gilgit-Baltistan in its 16th Meeting held on 14th February, 2022. The Senior Member Board of Revenue, Gilgit-Baltistan (SMBR GB) notified the policy titled “Policy for giving possession of lands developed by Economic Transformation Initiative (ETI-GB) to the beneficiary households”. This landmark policy reform will go a long way building the dynamics of economic transformation in Gilgit-Baltistan.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD ENVIRONMENT DAY
5 June 2022
The theme of this year’s World Environment Day, “Only One Earth”, is a simple statement of fact.  This planet is our only home.  It is vital we safeguard the health of its atmosphere, the richness and diversity of life on Earth, its ecosystems and its finite resources.  But we are failing to do so.  We are asking too much of our planet to maintain ways life that are unsustainable.  Earth’s natural systems cannot keep up with our demands.
This not only hurts the Earth, but us too.  A healthy environment is essential for all people and all 17 Sustainable Development Goals.  It provides food, clean water, medicines, climate regulation and protection from extreme weather events.  It is essential that we wisely manage nature and ensure equitable access to its services, especially for the most vulnerable people and communities.
More than 3 billion people are affected by degraded ecosystems.  Pollution is responsible for some 9 million premature deaths each year.  More than 1 million plant and animal species risk extinction, many within decades.
Close to half of humanity is already in the climate danger zone – 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts such as extreme heat, floods and drought.  There is a 50:50 chance that annual average global temperatures will breach the Paris Agreement limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next five years.  More than 200 million people each year could be displaced by climate disruption by 2050.
Fifty years ago, the world’s leaders came together at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and committed to protecting the planet.  But we are far from succeeding.  We can no longer ignore the alarm bells that ring louder every day.
The recent Stockholm+50 environment meeting reiterated that all 17 Sustainable Development Goals rely on a healthy planet.  We must all take responsibility to avert the catastrophe being wrought by the triple crises of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.
Governments need urgently to prioritize climate action and environmental protection through policy decisions that promote sustainable progress.  To that end, I have proposed five concrete recommendations to dramatically speed up the deployment of renewable energy everywhere, including making renewable technologies and raw materials available to all, cutting red tape, shifting subsidies and tripling investment.
Businesses need to put sustainability at the heart of their decision-making for the sake of humanity and their own bottom line.  A healthy planet is the backbone of nearly every industry on Earth.
And as voters and consumers we must make our actions count: from the policies we support, to the food we eat, to the transport we choose, to the companies we support.  We can all make environmentally friendly choices that will add up to the change we need.
Women and girls, in particular, can be forceful agents of change.  They must be empowered and included in decision-making at all levels.  Likewise, indigenous and traditional knowledge must also be respected and harnessed to help protect our fragile ecosystems.
History has shown what can be achieved when we work together and put the planet first.  In the 1980s, when scientists warned about a deadly continent-sized hole in the ozone layer, every country committed to the Montreal Protocol to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals.
In the 1990s, the Basel Convention outlawed the dumping of toxic waste in developing countries.  And, last year, a multilateral effort ended the production of leaded petrol – a move that will promote better health and prevent more than 1.2 million premature deaths each year.
This year and the next will present more opportunities for the global community to demonstrate the power of multilateralism to tackle our intertwined environmental crises, from negotiations on a new global biodiversity framework to reverse nature loss by 2030 to the establishment of a treaty to tackle plastics pollution.
The United Nations is committed to leading these cooperative global efforts, because the only way forward is to work with nature, not against it.  Together we can ensure that our planet not only survives, but thrives, because we have Only One Earth.

PRESS RELEASE
One hundred days of war in Ukraine have left 5.2 million children in need of humanitarian assistance
At least 262 children have been killed and 415 injured in attacks since 24 February
NEW YORK/GENEVA/KYIV, 1 June 2022 – Nearly 100 days of war in Ukraine have wrought devastating consequences for children at a scale and speed not seen since World War II, UNICEF said today. Three million children inside Ukraine and over 2.2 million children in refugee-hosting countries are now in need of humanitarian assistance. Almost two out of every three children have been displaced by fighting.
Based on reports verified by OHCHR, on average more than two children are killed and more than four injured each day in Ukraine – mostly in attacks using explosive weapons in populated areas. Civilian infrastructure on which children depend continues to be damaged or destroyed; this so far includes at least 256 health facilities and one in six UNICEF-supported ‘Safe Schools’ in the country’s east. Hundreds of other schools across the country have also been damaged. Conditions for children in eastern and southern Ukraine where fighting has intensified are increasingly desperate.
“June 1st is International Day for the Protection of Children in Ukraine and across the region,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Instead of celebrating the occasion, we are solemnly approaching June 3 – the 100th day of a war that has shattered the lives of millions of children. Without an urgent ceasefire and negotiated peace, children will continue to suffer – and fallout from the war will impact vulnerable children around the world.”
UNICEF is also warning that the war has caused an acute child protection crisis. Children fleeing violence are at significant risk of family separation, violence, abuse, sexual exploitation, and trafficking. Most have been exposed to deeply traumatic events. These children urgently need safety, stability, child protection services, and psychosocial support – especially those who are unaccompanied or have been separated from their families. More than anything, they need peace.
At the same time, the war and mass displacement are devastating livelihoods and economic opportunities, leaving many families without sufficient income to meet basic needs and unable to provide adequate support for their children.
UNICEF continues to call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and to protect all children from harm. This includes ending the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and attacks on civilian infrastructure. UNICEF is appealing for full humanitarian access to safely and quickly reach children in need wherever they may be.
UNICEF and its partners are on the ground in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, working to provide children and their families with humanitarian assistance, including child protection, water and sanitation, health, nutrition and education services.
In Ukraine, UNICEF and partners have distributed life-saving health and medical supplies for nearly 2.1 million people in war-affected areas; enabled access to safe water for over 2.1 million people living in areas where networks have been damaged or destroyed; reached over 610,000 children and caregivers with mental health and psychosocial support; and provided learning supplies to nearly 290,000 children. Almost 300,000 vulnerable families have registered for a UNICEF-Ministry of Social Policy humanitarian cash assistance programme.
In refugee-hosting countries, UNICEF supports national, municipal and local systems that deliver essential services and protection, particularly for the most vulnerable children. This includes anti-trafficking training for border guards; expanding learning opportunities and integrating refugee children into schools; procuring vaccines and medical supplies; and establishing play and learning hubs that provide young children with a much-needed sense of normalcy and respite. Twenty-five UNICEF-UNHCR Blue Dots – one-stop safe havens that provide support and services for families on the move, have been established along major transit routes in Moldova, Romania, Poland, Italy, Bulgaria and Slovakia. In Moldova, over 52,000 refugees, mostly in female-headed households, have been reached through a UNICEF-UNHCR multi-purpose cash assistance programme.
UNICEF has issued a US $624.2M appeal for funds to support its humanitarian response inside Ukraine and a US $324.7M appeal for its response in refugee-hosting countries.

PRESS RELEASE
Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell on school shooting in Uvalde, Texas
NEW YORK, 25 May 2022 – “Once again, children have been attacked and killed while attending school – the one place outside of their homes where they should be safest. This time it happened in Uvalde, Texas.
“Nineteen children, a teacher, and a school staff member who set out for school yesterday will never return home to their families. Many more children, teachers and school staff who witnessed the carnage will bear the emotional and psychological scars for the rest of their lives.
“Yesterday, it happened in Texas. Where will it happen next? This year, we have already seen horrific attacks on schools in Afghanistan, Ukraine, the U.S. and beyond.
“Tragedy after tragedy, shooting after shooting, young life after young life: how many more children will die before government leaders act to keep children and their schools safe? Because until they do, these horrors will continue.”

UNESCAP
PRESS RELEASE
Call for Enhanced Disaster Risk Data Governance and Data-driven Analysis to Inform Policy Decisions at the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction 2022
Governments, the UN system, and all disaster risk reduction stakeholders gathered for the seventh session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction 2022 in Bali, organized by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and hosted by the Government of Indonesia.  As part of the official GP/DRR programme, the thematic session on data challenges and solutions for disaster risk management was held on 26 May 2022. The session was moderated by Ms. Letizia Rossano, Director of the Asian and Pacific Centre for the Development of Disaster Information Management (APDIM), a subsidiary body of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
"Despite great advances in technology and data science, gathering and applying disaster-relevant data and statistics to investment decisions to reduce disaster risk is still a challenge.  We need to be able to account for the full scale of losses from disasters – small, recurring, and major extreme events. And we need to have clear, data-based overviews on disaster risks, including those induced by climate change" said APDIM Director Ms. Letizia Rossano during the session which drew over 400 participants attending in-person and over 2500 attended online.
The thematic session panellists discussed ways to improve data governance in a way that the benefits of the resultant policies, programmes, and investments enable the governments to ensure effective risk reduction measures are in place and to reach the most vulnerable in all scenarios. They also discussed the role of data community in enhancing the use of disaster risk data across development and humanitarian planning. H. E. Dr Raditya Jati, Deputy Minister for Systems and Strategy, Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB); H. E. Mr. Renato U. Solidum, Jr., Undersecretary for Scientific and Technical Services, Department of Science and Technology of the Philippines; Ms. Rhonda Robinson, Deputy Director Disaster and Community Resilience Programme, Acting Director GEM Division, Pacific Community; Dr Jakub Ryzenko, Head of Crisis Information Centre SRC, Poland; Mr. Kassem Chaalan, Director, Disaster Risk Reduction, Lebanese Red Cross; and Ms. Sithembiso Gina, Senior Programme Officer, DRR Unit, SADC Secretariat presented their views and remarks as panellist of the Session.
The discussion at the session highlighted that:
•        Effective collection, dissemination and application of relevant data and statistics about disaster risk and impact is of paramount importance at national and local level to form the evidence base for policy, planning, implementation and investment in development and humanitarian domains across different sectors and to ensure that no-one is left behind.
•        Strong data governance is required to access quality disaster and climate data by working across departmental silos and administrative levels to produce relevant analysis and products to inform disaster risk policy and investments, ideally in the context of a national disaster data policy is key.
•        Building of capacities is necessary to increase the demand for disaster risk data and information and its application towards risk assessment and climate change analysis, including by leveraging on strategic partnerships and latest technology.
The outcomes of the thematic session on data challenges and solutions for disaster risk management was reflected in the Global Platform co-Chair's summary and will contribute to the inter-governmental midterm review of the Sendai Framework scheduled for 2023

PRESS RELEASE
UN Headquarters Observes International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on 26 May
UN Secretary-General to commemorate peacekeepers who lost their life serving under the UN flag and award the Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage and Military Gender Advocate of the Year
Six peacekeepers from Pakistan to be honoured posthumously at United Nations ceremony
UN Headquarters will observe the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on Thursday, 26 May 2022. Secretary-General António Guterres will lay a wreath to honour the nearly 4,200 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948 and will preside over a ceremony at which the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal will be awarded posthumously to 117 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their life serving under the UN flag last year.
Among the peacekeepers to be honoured posthumously are six from Pakistan:  Police L/Cpl Tahir Ikram, Police L/Cpl Adil Jan, and SGT Muhammad Nil Naeem who all served with UN-AU Mission in Darfur (UNAMID); NCE Tahir Mehmood deployed with the UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO); SGT Muhammad Shafeeq from the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA); and Mr. Abrar Sayed who served in a civilian capacity with (MINURSO).
Pakistan is the 5th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys more than 4,100 military and police personnel to the UN operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, Cyprus, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Mali, South Sudan and Western Sahara
During a special ceremony, the Secretary-General will award the “Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage” posthumously to Captain Abdelrazakh Hamit Bahar of Chad, who served with the United Nations Integrated Multidimensional Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). The medal is named for a Senegalese peacekeeper who was killed in Rwanda in 1994 after saving countless civilian lives. This is the second time the medal has been awarded since the inaugural medal was presented to Captain Diagne's family in his honour in 2016.
The Secretary-General will also award the ‘2021 Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award’ to Major Winnet Zharare, a Zimbabwean military observer, who served with the UN Mission in South Sudan. Created in 2016, the Award “recognises the dedication and effort of an individual peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.”
In his message, the Secretary-General said: “Today, we honour the more than one million women and men who have served as UN peacekeepers since 1948.  We pay tribute to the nearly 4,200 heroes and heroines who sacrificed their lives in the cause of peace. And we are reminded an age-old truth: peace can never be taken for granted. Peace is the prize. We are deeply grateful to the 87,000 civilian, police and military personnel now serving under the UN flag who are helping to realize the prize of peace worldwide.”
The theme for this year’s observance is “People. Peace. Progress. The Power of Partnerships.”  According to the Secretary-General, “Around the globe, UN peacekeepers work with Member States, civil society, humanitarians, the media, the communities they serve and many others, to foster peace, protect civilians, promote human rights and the rule of law and improve the lives of millions of people.”
Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said: “Every day, UN peacekeepers work to protect vulnerable people in the world’s most fragile political and security situations. The dangers they face are greater than ever, with increasing global tensions, ever-more complex threats from terrorist attacks to organized crime and the use of Improvised Explosive Devices as well as a surge in mis and disinformation targeting our missions and the communities we serve. Despite these challenges, peacekeepers persevere alongside our many partners in the collective pursuit of peace. Today, we thank them for their tremendous contribution and remember with great sorrow our colleagues who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving the cause of peace.”

JOINT PRESS RELEASE
Embassy of Sweden in Pakistan, UNDP, WWF Pakistan, and Stockholm+50 Youth Task Force hold a National Youth Dialogue on Right to a Healthy Environment
Islamabad, May 17, 2022—A youth dialogue on the right to a clean and healthy environment was organized by the Embassy of Sweden in Pakistan, UNDP, WWF Pakistan, and Stockholm+50 Youth Task Force today. The dialogue engaged youth, multilateral organizations, civil society, and policymakers to have a focused conversation on what this right means in the local context. Senator Sherry Rehman, Federal Minister for Climate Change attended the event as Chief guest.
Sweden is hosting Stockholm+50, a crucial international environmental meeting on 2nd and 3rd June 2022. The youth dialogue aimed to create awareness amongst Pakistani youth regarding their role at a multilateral level; at the policymaking tables, such as the Stockholm+50 International Meeting, and at the climate negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (COPs).
H.E. Henrik Persson, Ambassador of Sweden to Pakistan, welcomed the participants and said, “Sweden is on the track to become world’s first fossil-free welfare state, reaching net zero emissions by 2045. Stockholm+50 is an opportunity to consider what is going well, what can be improved and what we can do to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. Voices of youth needs to be communicated to the leaders to drive action to achieve sustainable development. It is possible to create a better future if we act together. Sweden is open for collaboration.”
Speaking at the occasion, Knut Ostby, Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan said, “Pakistan is the fifth most populous and one of the youngest countries in the world. Currently, 68% of Pakistanis are below the age of 30, and 27% are aged between 15 and 29. The current moment presents an opportunity for young Pakistanis to drive transformative changes on ground and be ambassadors of climate action. Through increased cooperation and dialogue, the youth can help strengthen the ability of businesses and governments to deal with impacts of climate change. The youth now have the chance to advocate for a resilient and greener economy that will lead to prosperity, new jobs, and a healthier planet.”
Hammad Naqi Khan, Director General WWF-Pakistan, stated “As the largest conservation organization in Pakistan, WWF-Pakistan has been working to foster young people’s connection with nature. Last year alone, we engaged with over 14,000 youth through various initiatives. At WWF, we believe that youth are both advocates and catalysts of change and thus, an essential part of decision making. Therefore, we are working with partners to not only develop young people’s knowledge about sustainable development, but also connect them to experts, businesses, and government, and elevate their voices to appropriate platforms.”
Over 60 young people aged between 11-25 participated in the dialogues and shared their policy proposals towards the right to a healthy environment. The dialogue was moderated by Ms Saher Rashid Baig, a Pakistani member of the Stockholm+50 Youth Task and a Global youth advocate for climate, ocean, gender, and human rights.
The desired and concrete policy demands of the Youth Dialogue will be communicated to the Stockholm+50 Secretariat and incorporated in the policy positions of the Stockholm+50.

NEWS RELEASE
Government of Pakistan & WFP join hands for a National School Meals Initiative in the Country
ISLAMABAD, 11 May 2022:
A two-day National Consultation on School Meals kicked off in Islamabad on Tuesday. The consultation follows the signing and endorsement of the “Global School Meals Coalition” by the Government of Pakistan in 2021.
The consultation is intended to lay the foundations for the establishment of a systematic approach to the provision of school meals in Pakistan and develop a road map towards a national school meals policy. The meeting has been jointly organized by the Ministry of Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety and the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives in collaboration with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).
The event was led by Honorable Minister Ms. Shazia Marri, Ministry of Poverty Alleviation & Social Safety (PASS) and Dr. Mohammad Jehanzeb Khan, Deputy Chairman, Ministry of Planning, Development & Special Initiatives, along with representatives from the different federal and provincial departments including regional education, health, planning and development & social protection departments.
In his opening remarks Dr. Hamid Jalil, Member, Food Security & Climate Change, Ministry of Planning, Development & Special Initiatives acknowledged that school meals programmes are globally recognized as an effective tool for the promotion of children’s academic performance and the overall wellbeing of schoolchildren. Similarly, school meals serve as a targeted social safety net that help increase enrolment rates, reduce absenteeism, and provide vital nutrition for children who might otherwise not receive sufficient nutrition at home. It is well documented that well-nourished and healthy schoolchildren are better equipped to learn, fulfill their potential as adults and participate in a country’s development process as productive citizens. Governments all around the world are implementing school meals programmes in high, middle- and low-income countries, as the programmes have the potential to be catalysts for human capital development, boosting local economic growth, strengthening food systems and agricultural development.
Dr. Mohammad Jehanzeb Khan, Deputy Chairman, Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives highlighted that the challenges of education are correlated with poverty. Nutritional deficiencies resulting from poverty have a heavy impact on learning. The resultant learning and nutritional deficiencies persisting into adulthood suppress productivity of the human resources and the country’s capacity to be competitive. Therefore, a shift towards school meals through an effective and sustained process is imperative to achievement of Pakistan’s goals in fighting against poverty and providing opportunities of quality education to all children, especially girls.
In her concluding remarks Ms. Shazia Marri, the Minister of Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety reaffirmed the commitment of the Government of Pakistan to ensure that every child in the country has equal opportunities to learn and thrive. The Government of Pakistan has made investment in the early 1,000 days of a child through the ongoing stunting prevention programme “Benazir Nashonuma” which benefits children under 2 years of age and pregnant and breastfeeding women. In the same way, the Government is equally committed to extend the investment to 8,000 days of a child with improved access to education, nutrition, food and necessary services. The Government has already signed the declaration of the school meals coalition and is fully committed to ensuring that every child has access to a nutritious healthy meal at school by 2030.
Chris Kaye, Representative and Country Director of WFP Pakistan, stressed the importance of an integrated approach to secure the multiple benefits of a school feeding programme. “Pakistan’s experience in the past has been sporadic and project-based, which unfortunately has not created a sustained impact”, he said. However, it was hoped that the combined efforts of the Ministries of Education, Health Agriculture as well as Development and Planning at provincial and federal levels will enable the development of a national school meals policy that can support the context-specific school models across the country.
During the two-day national consultation, the participants will review existing school meals programmes in Pakistan as well as those that are being implemented in countries in Southeast Asia in order to identify best practices and the most applicable models.
In addition to technical experts from Federal and Provincial Government, the consultation was also attended by distinguished guests from donor countries, UN, private sector, non-governmental organizations and media.

UNICEF and WHO warn of ‘perfect storm’ of conditions for measles outbreaks, affecting children
Reported worldwide measles cases increased by 79 per cent in the first two months of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, as WHO and UNICEF warn conditions ripe for serious outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses
NEW YORK/ GENEVA, 28 April 2022 – An increase in measles cases in January and February 2022 is a worrying sign of a heightened risk for the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases and could trigger larger outbreaks, particularly of measles affecting millions of children in 2022, warn WHO and UNICEF.
Pandemic-related disruptions, increasing inequalities in access to vaccines, and the diversion of resources from routine immunization are leaving too many children without protection against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.
The risk for large outbreaks has increased as communities relax social distancing practices and other preventive measures for COVID-19 implemented during the height of the pandemic. In addition, with millions of people being displaced due to conflicts and crises including in Ukraine, Ethiopia, Somalia and Afghanistan, disruptions in routine immunization and COVID-19 vaccination services, lack of clean water and sanitation, and overcrowding increase the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks.
Almost 17,338 measles cases were reported worldwide in January and February 2022, compared to 9,665 during the first two months of 2021. As measles is very contagious, cases tend to show up quickly when vaccination levels decline. The agencies are concerned that outbreaks of measles could also forewarn outbreaks of other diseases that do not spread as rapidly.
Apart from its direct effect on the body, which can be lethal, the measles virus also weakens the immune system and makes a child more vulnerable to other infectious diseases like pneumonia and diarrhoea, including for months after the measles infection itself among those who survive.  Most cases occur in settings that have faced social and economic hardships due to COVID-19, conflict, or other crises, and have chronically weak health system infrastructure and insecurity.
“Measles is more than a dangerous and potentially deadly disease. It is also an early indication that there are gaps in our global immunization coverage, gaps vulnerable children cannot afford,” said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director. “It is encouraging that people in many communities are beginning to feel protected enough from COVID-19 to return to more social activities. But doing so in places where children are not receiving routine vaccination creates the perfect storm for the spread of a disease like measles.”
In 2020, 23 million children missed out on basic childhood vaccines through routine health services, the highest number since 2009 and 3.7 million more than in 2019.

As of April 2022, the agencies report 21 large and disruptive measles outbreaks around the world in the last 12 months. Most of the measles cases were reported in Africa and the East Mediterranean region. The figures are likely higher as the pandemic has disrupted surveillance systems globally, with potential underreporting.
Countries with the largest measles outbreaks since the past year include Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia. Insufficient measles vaccine coverage is the major reason for outbreaks, wherever they occur.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted immunization services, health systems have been overwhelmed, and we are now seeing a resurgence of deadly diseases including measles. For many other diseases, the impact of these disruptions to immunization services will be felt for decades to come,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “Now is the moment to get essential immunization back on track and launch catch-up campaigns so that everybody can have access to these life-saving vaccines.”
As of 1 April 2022, 57 vaccine-preventable disease campaigns in 43 countries that were scheduled to take place since the start of the pandemic are still postponed, impacting 203 million people, most of whom are children. Of these, 19 are measles campaigns, which put 73 million children at risk of measles due to missed vaccinations. In Ukraine, the measles catch-up campaign of 2019 was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter due to the war. Routine and catch-up campaigns are needed wherever access is possible to help make sure there are not repeated outbreaks as in 2017-2019, when there were over 115,000 cases of measles and 41 deaths in the country – this was the highest incidence in Europe.
Coverage at or above 95 per cent with two doses of the safe and effective measles vaccine can protect children against measles. However, COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions have delayed the introduction of the second dose of the measles vaccine in many countries.
As countries work to respond to outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases, and recover lost ground, UNICEF and WHO, along with partners such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the partners of the Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and others are supporting efforts to strengthen immunization systems by:
·       Restoring services and vaccination campaigns so countries can safely deliver routine immunization programmes to fill the gaps left by the backsliding;
·       Helping health workers and community leaders communicate actively with caregivers to explain the importance of vaccinations;
·       Rectifying gaps in immunization coverage, including identifying communities and people who have been missed during the pandemic;
·       Ensuring that COVID-19 vaccine delivery is independently financed and well-integrated into overall planning for immunization services so that it is not carried out at the cost of childhood and other vaccination services;
·       Implementing country plans to prevent and respond to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and strengthening immunization systems as part of COVID-19 recovery efforts.

US$4.8 billion budget needed to implement new strategy and eradicate the infectious disease
Germany announces it will co-host polio pledging moment in 2022
GENEVA, 27 April 2022 – Today, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) announced that it is seeking new commitments to fund its 2022-2026 Strategy at a virtual event to launch its investment case. The strategy, if fully funded, will see the vaccination of 370 million children annually for the next five years and the continuation of global surveillance activities for polio and other diseases in 50 countries.
During the virtual launch, the Government of Germany, which holds the G7 presidency in 2022, announced that the country will co-host the pledging moment for the GPEI Strategy during the 2022 World Health Summit in October.
“A strong and fully funded polio programme will benefit health systems around the world. That is why it is so crucial that all stakeholders now commit to ensuring that the new eradication strategy can be implemented in full,” said Niels Annen, Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany. “The polio pledging moment at the World Health Summit this October is a critical opportunity for donors and partners to reiterate their support for a polio-free world. We can only succeed if we make polio eradication our shared priority.”
Wild poliovirus cases are at a historic low and the disease is endemic in just Pakistan and Afghanistan, presenting a unique opportunity to interrupt transmission. However, recent developments, due in part to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, underscore the fragility of this progress. In February 2022, Malawi confirmed its first case of wild polio in three decades and the first on the African continent since 2016, linked to virus originating in Pakistan, and in April 2022 Pakistan recorded its first wild polio case since January 2021. Meanwhile, outbreaks of cVDPV, variants of the poliovirus that can emerge in under-immunized communities, were recently detected in Israel and Ukraine and circulate in several countries in Africa and Asia.
The investment case outlines new modelling that shows achieving eradication could save an estimated US $33.1 billion this century, compared to the price of controlling polio outbreaks. At the launch event, GPEI leaders and polio-affected countries urged renewed political and financial support to end polio and protect children and future generations from the paralysis it causes.
“Despite enormous progress, polio still paralyses far too many children around the world – and even one child is too many,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.  “We simply cannot allow another child to suffer from this devastating disease – not when we know how to prevent it. Not when we are so close. We must do whatever it takes to finish the fight – and achieve a polio-free world for every child.”
“The re-emergence of polio in Malawi after three decades was a tragic reminder that until polio is wiped off the face of the earth, it can spread globally and harm children anywhere. I urge all countries to unite behind the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and ensure it has the support and resources it needs to end polio for everyone everywhere,” said Hon. Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda MP, Minister of Health, Malawi.
The new eradication strategy centres on integrating polio activities with other essential health programs in affected countries, better reaching children in the highest risk communities who have never been vaccinated, and strengthening engagement with local leaders and influencers to build trust and vaccine acceptance.
“The children of Pakistan and Afghanistan deserve to live a life free of an incurable, paralyzing disease. With continued global support, we can make polio a disease of the past,” said Dr Shahzad Baig, National Coordinator, Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme. “The polio programme is also working to increase overall health equity in the highest-risk communities by addressing area needs holistically, including by strengthening routine immunization, improving health facilities, and organizing health camps.”
The investment case outlines how support for eradication efforts will enable essential health services in under-served communities and strengthen the world’s defences against future health threats.
Since 2020, GPEI infrastructure and staff have provided critical support to governments as they respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including by promoting COVID-safe practices, leveraging polio surveillance and lab networks to detect the virus, and assisting COVID-19 vaccination efforts through health worker trainings, community mobilization, data management and other activities.
“The global effort to consign polio to the history books will not only help to spare future generations from this devastating disease, but serve to strengthen health systems and health security,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
Additional quotes from the GPEI Investment Case:
“We have the knowledge and tools to wipe polio off the face of the earth. GPEI needs the resources to take us the last mile to eradicating this awful disease. Investing in GPEI will also help us detect and respond to other health emergencies. We can’t waver now. Let’s all take this opportunity to fully support GPEI, and create a world in which no child is paralyzed by polio ever again,” said Bill Gates, Co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
“An investment in polio eradication goes further than fighting one disease. It is the ultimate investment in both equity and sustainability – it is for everyone and forever. An important component of GPEI’s Strategy focuses on integrating the planning and coordination of polio activities and essential health services to reach zero-dose children who have never been immunized with routine vaccines, therefore contributing to the goals of the Immunization Agenda 2030.” said Seth Berkley, Chief Executive Officer, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
“Twenty million people are walking today because of polio vaccination, and we have learned, improved and innovated along the way. We are stronger and more resilient as we enter the last lap of this marathon to protect all future generations of the world’s children from polio. Please join us; with our will and our collective resources, we can seize the unprecedented opportunity to cross the finish line that lies before us,” said Mike McGovern, Chair, International PolioPlus Committee, Rotary International.

PRESS RELEASE
World Immunization Week: UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Liam Neeson headlines week-long commemoration of global vaccination efforts and calls for greater investment
Global partners pledge $1 for every like, share, or comment on social media posts mentioning ‘UNICEF’ using the hashtag #longlifeforall until May 10
NEW YORK, 25 April 2022 – UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Liam Neeson is leading UNICEF’s global immunization initiative with a global message thanking the scientists, parents, health workers and others who have been so critical in helping to immunize children over the last two decades.
In a video released ahead of World Immunization Week, Neeson talks about how the efforts of scientists such as Jonas Salk, who developed the first vaccine against polio, and dedicated workers who fill vials at factories or deliver vaccine injections, have made it possible to save two to three million child lives each year.
“Vaccines are a remarkable human success story. Over last the 75 years, billions of children have been vaccinated, thanks to scientists, to health workers, to volunteers. If you’ve ever been vaccinated, or vaccinated your children, then you are part of the arm-to-arm chain that keeps all humanity safe,” said Liam Neeson, UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. “We live our lives free of worry about catching smallpox. Once a terrifying diagnosis, polio is no longer a threat in most of the world. The conversation about vaccines in recent years has lost sight of how much good they have done for each of us. We need to celebrate this. It is perhaps one of the biggest collective achievements in human history.”
Every like, share, or comment on posts mentioning a UNICEF social media account and using the hashtag #longlifeforall from now until May 10 will unlock US $1 to UNICEF, from the United Nations Foundation’s Shot@Life campaign and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  – up to a total of US$10 million – to help ensure all children get the life-saving vaccines they need.
Despite the successes, an alarming 23 million children missed out on vaccinations in 2020. This number can only be reduced through greater commitment to and investment in immunization services.  UNICEF is the world’s leading provider of vaccines to children in over 100 countries. With Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and partners UNICEF supplies vaccines to reach 45 per cent of the world’s children under five.  UNICEF also works with Governments in over 130 countries to strengthen national health and immunization programmes.
“The last two years have taught us that a health care system that leaves some children exposed, is a health care system that leaves all children exposed,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.  “The best way for the world to recover from this pandemic – and to prepare for future health emergencies -- is to invest in stronger health systems, and immunization and essential health services for every child.”
World Immunization Week – celebrated every year in the last week of April – is spearheaded by the World Health Organization and brings together global partners to promote the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against disease. The theme for this year is #LongLifeForAll, with ‘long life’ reflecting the importance of lifespan vaccinations.
“We are in a race against time to restore the immunization services disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerate progress against all vaccine-preventable diseases,” said Gargee Ghosh, President of Global Policy and Advocacy at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “That is why we are thrilled to work with UNICEF and other partners around the world to ensure children – especially those in the world’s poorest countries – have access to the vaccines they need to live a long, healthy life.”
“UNICEF ensures that nearly half of the world’s children under five are ‘protected by love’ with lifesaving vaccines,” said Martha Rebour, Executive Director of Shot@Life, United Nations Foundation. “We are honored to support and promote their work during World Immunization Week and hope that others will join us in our advocacy for these critical global vaccine programs.”

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF MULTILATERALISM AND DIPLOMACY FOR PEACE, New York, 24 April 2022
United Nations Member States, by ratifying or accepting the UN Charter, have committed themselves to the values of multilateralism and diplomacy for peace.
But as we mark this year’s International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, this commitment is being broken. The principles at the heart of multilateral cooperation are under the greatest strain since the founding of the United Nations.
From the climate crisis to the multiplication of conflicts – including the ongoing war in Ukraine; the governance of weapons of mass destruction; health emergencies; and the global refugee protection regime – the multilateral system and the value of diplomacy are under threat from all directions.
We need to transform this moment of crisis into a moment for multilateralism.
The recommendations in my report on Our Common Agenda aim to protect and strengthen the foundations of global cooperation and create a networked, inclusive multilateralism that is fit for the future.
On the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, I call on all governments and leaders to renew their commitment to dialogue and global solutions that are the only sustainable path for peace.

UNDP, UNODC & UNWOMEN : JOINT PRESS RELEASE : Federal Steering Committee assures strong commitment for EU-supported ‘Deliver Justice Project’ implemented by UNDP, UNODC and UN Women

UNDP, UNODC & UNWOMEN
JOINT PRESS RELEASE
Federal Steering Committee assures strong commitment for EU-supported ‘Deliver Justice Project’ implemented by UNDP, UNODC and UN Women
Islamabad, 20 April 2022—The Federal Steering Committee (FSC) of the ‘Deliver Justice’ programme was held today at the Economic Affairs Division (EAD), where key federal and provincial government stakeholders and development partners came together to amplify programme oversight and to discuss challenges and opportunities.
The ‘Deliver Justice’ programme aims to support reform processes to ensure delivery of people-centred justice, enhance access to justice for all, particularly women and marginalized groups; and improve service delivery of the security sector in line with constitutional safeguards and international standards. Implemented in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Merged Areas, the programme is funded by the European Union and jointly implemented by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
Joint Secretary Economic Affair Division, Ms. Anita Turab chaired the meeting and thanked the European Union for its continued support for the rule of law and building capacity of relevant institutions. In her opening remarks, Ms. Turab emphasized that the Government of Pakistan has a strong commitment and interest in reinforcing the rule of law and justice system in Pakistan. She added, “The Government of Pakistan is pleased to partner with UNDP, UNODC and UN Women to implement the reform agenda smoothly under the EU-funded Rule of Law Programme in KP and Balochistan.”
In his welcome remarks, the Head of Cooperation of the European Union Delegation to Pakistan, Mr. Ovidiu Mic, reiterated the EU’s commitment to join forces with Pakistan to actively advance the delivery of justice, peace, and security for the people, particularly women and girls. He emphasized that “this work is also an essential part of the priorities of the EU-Pakistan Strategic Engagement Plan agreed in 2019.”
The inception phase of this programme last year provided the building blocks to support the current engagements and make a transition towards successful implementation of the programme. Enhanced partnerships at federal and provincial levels, engaging all key stakeholders in the rule of law sector including the Legal Aid and Justice Authority (LAJA) and the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) at the federal level, the Judicial Academies, the Courts, the Home Departments and relevant offices, were recognised as key achievements under the project.
On the occasion, the UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative, Mr. Knut Ostby, thanked the Government of Pakistan and the European Union for their continued support in strengthening the rule of law and access to justice in Pakistan. He said, “UNDP has been a long-standing partner of the Government of Pakistan in supporting and strengthening Rule of Law institutions for enhanced service delivery, and improving access to justice for citizens, particularly the most vulnerable and the marginalized. UNDP is privileged to be a long-standing partner in the development and implementation of Rule of Law roadmaps.”
UN Women Pakistan Representative, Ms. Sharmeela Rassool, in her remarks said, “UN Women is delighted to be part of this joint programme, and the core of our work focuses on supporting women, girls, and vulnerable segments of society access formal justice mechanisms. While in parallel we will build up the capacity of our government partners to provide justice and redressal mechanisms in an efficient, empathetic and gender sensitive manner.”
UNODC Pakistan Representative, Mr. Jeremy Milsom, assured UNODC’s commitment towards accelerating progress and catalyzing valuable reform in rule of law and criminal justice system through this project. “This first FSC meeting marks yet another milestone for this programme. As we all know, Provincial Steering Committee meetings have been successfully conducted both in Balochistan and KP in January this year. We are looking forward to the success of this meeting as well.”
During the meeting, the work plan for the current year was presented to the committee. The work plan included working alongside law enforcement agencies to strengthen rule of law, including initiation of trainings for two thousand police personnel from the Merged Areas. Refurbishment of the Prison Academy, seven district prisons in the Merged Areas and five central prisons will also take place. For Balochistan, work will commence on establishing smart police stations along with Police Facilitation centers. This workplan also includes establishment of smart classrooms in Balochistan Judicial Academy and Police Training College, Quetta. Prison Management Information System (PMIS) is also planned to be developed and implemented in the prison facilities of Balochistan.

WFP -PRESS RELEASE : WFP hands over Emergency Storage Facilities, Prefabricated Structures, and IT Equipment to PDMA Balochistan
WFP hands over Emergency Storage Facilities, Prefabricated Structures, and IT Equipment to PDMA Balochistan
QUETTA, 19 April 2022: The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) handed over newly constructed Emergency Storage Facilities, Prefabricated temperature-controlled storage units, and IT Equipment to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Balochistan and District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs) of Chaman and Chagai districts in a ceremony organized at the Serena Hotel, Quetta on Tuesday. The contribution was part of the WFP’s efforts to support and strengthen the Government of Balochistan for effective emergency preparedness and disaster risk reduction in Balochistan.
WFP has also recently deployed the Emergency Preparedness Capacity Index (EPCI) – a corporate tool that helps identify the needed capacities for effective response. The exercise was conducted by WFP for PDMA Balochistan and six selected districts, aiming to enhance the preparedness capability of DDMAs and PDMA Balochistan.
The handover ceremony was attended by Chris Kaye, Country Director WFP, Abdul Saboor Kakar, Chairman Chief Minister Inspection Team, Naseer Ahmed Nassar, Director General, PDMA Balochistan, government officials from PDMA and DDMAs, other government line departments, representatives from the UN, and academia.
The two Emergency Storage Facilities along with the two temperature-controlled storage units and IT Equipment will enhance the emergency storage, coordination, communication, and reporting capacity of the district disaster management authorities in the Chaman and Chagai districts.
Chris Kaye, Country Director, WFP Pakistan, while handing over the emergency facilities and equipment to the Director-General PDMA, Government of Balochistan, said that WFP was pleased to provide the support and the additional capacity that would help the Government of Balochistan better manage and coordinate responses to disasters in the region.  “Capacity to store and manage critical relief items at local levels can save lives as well as reduce the impact on communities caused by sudden-onset disasters,” he added.
Balochistan has witnessed an increase in natural and human-induced disasters resulting in the loss of lives, property, and livelihoods. While there have been improvements in the capacity for forecasting by the Pakistan Meteorological Department, ensuring that this information is communicated and acted on in a timely way remains a challenge, especially in the more remote areas of the country. WFP, through its Provincial office in Quetta, initiated deliberations with PDMA Baluchistan and has agreed on critical needs-based interventions together with UN and NGO partners, to ensure all efforts are made to improve preparedness and response.
Abdul Saboor Kakar, Chairman Chief Minister Inspection Team, appreciated the WFP’s support to the Government of Balochistan in Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Risk Reduction. He said that he is hopeful that the interventions WFP has jointly designed and carried out in collaboration with PDMA Balochistan would result in better emergency preparedness response and would be used to strengthen the capabilities at all levels.
Speaking on the occasion, Naseer Ahmed Nassar, Director General, PDMA Balochistan, said that the establishment of these two Emergency Storage Facilities in districts Chagai and Chaman is strategic support from the World Food Programme and would help in prepositioning of food commodities as well as other emergency food and non-food items in two bordering districts.

UNFPA Humanitarian Director concludes her visit to Pakistan
Islamabad, April 8, 2022: Ms. Shoko Arakaki, Director of UNFPA’s Humanitarian Office in Geneva visited Pakistan to renew UNFPA’s support and commitment to ensure that reproductive health, rights and protection of women and girls from gender-based violence is a key priority in preparedness and response to emergencies, to which Pakistan is prone.
During her visit, she met with representatives of UN agencies and reiterated UNFPA’s commitment to further build on strengths and expertise within the UN system through joint initiatives to best serve the women and girls affected by humanitarian crises, especially in Afghan refugee and hosting communities.
She also met with humanitarian partners including National Disaster Management Authority, Provincial Disaster Management Authorities, Sarhad and Balochistan Rural Support Programmes, Health Services Academy among others to discuss UNFPA’s existing humanitarian interventions and to look into up-scaling the support according to the emerging needs.
As part of her mission, she paid a visit to KP province to view the work on ground and visited UNFPA-supported government health facility in Peshawar and met with women and girls from Afghan refugee and hosting communities as well as midwives, psychologists and social mobilizers working in the facility. UNFPA has supported eight health facilities through equipment, medicines and health workforce to ensure that life-saving obstetric and newborn care as well as counselling and referrals for survivors of gender-based violence continue to function in remote communities.
“Pakistan is a diverse country, replete with natural resources, however prone to humanitarian crises and high on the climate risk index at the same time. Therefore, the need for solid preparedness and resilience cannot be overstated. It was heartening to see the remarkable joint work done by humanitarian partners in Pakistan. UNFPA is a partner of the Government and people in Pakistan in building a resilient country where women and girls are safe and able to access reproductive health and protection services even during humanitarian situations.”  Said Ms. Arakaki.

UNFPA Humanitarian Director Visits Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province
Peshawar, April 7, 2022: Ms. Shoko Arakaki, Director of UNFPA’s Humanitarian Office in Geneva is visiting Pakistan to view UNFPA’s humanitarian interventions, especially for Afghan refugees, around reproductive health and responses to gender-based violence (GBV).
As part of her mission, she visited the UNFPA-supported government Basic Health Unit (BHU), Phandu in district Peshawar and interacted with women and girls from Afghan refugee and hosting communities to hear from them on the quality of services provided, the challenges in accessing reproductive health and protection services and solutions they propose. She also met with midwives, psychologists and social mobilizers who are attending deliveries, providing psycho-social support and referrals to GBV survivors and at risk groups, are raising awareness among communities about the available services. Ms. Arakaki appreciated their commitment to serve the women and girls in need in the remote areas.
BHU Phandu, which functions 24/7, is one of the eight government health facilities in KP province, where UNFPA, with support of its partner Sarhad Rural Support Programme (SRSP), is providing comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (CEmONC) services and psychosocial support, multi sectoral referrals and community mobilisation services in refugee hosting communities. The BHU receives around 1,600 out patients every month and one delivery is attended every day on average. Psycologist conducts counselling sessions with 15 to 20 women every month on average.
She also met with representatives of UNFPA partner organizations including Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), Department of Health (DoH), Sarhad Rural Support Programme (SRSP) and Prime Foundation to discuss the progress on existing interventions and explore ways of scaling up the partnerships around ensuring reproductive health, rights and prevention and response to gender-based violence is integrated into preparedness and response to emergencies in the province.
“We must be accountable for women and girls who suffer most during disasters and emergencies. Rights and health of women and girls are at the heart of UNFPA’s work. We will only be able to achieve Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 if we continue to work in partnerships through innovative and multisectoral approaches. I am certain, that our partnerships in the province will grow stronger owing to our common vision of serving and meeting the health and protection needs of women and girls in refugee and hosting communities.” Said Ms. Arakaki.
UNFPA and Department of Health also signed documents to handover the four fully-equipped and prefabricated Women-Friendly Health Spaces, Labor Room and OPD unit for installation in the remote and rugged region of Tirah Valley in the newly merged districts of KP province to cater the health needs of temporarily displaced women and girls who are now returning to their homes.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL message on International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi in Rwanda ,28TH ANNIVERSARY
7 April 2022
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide
Against the Tutsi in Rwanda
28TH ANNIVERSARY
7 April 2022
Together, we pay tribute to the one million people who were murdered in just 100 days in 1994 – the overwhelming majority Tutsi, but moderate Hutu and others who opposed the genocide too.
We honour their memory.
We stand in awe of the resilience of the survivors.
And we reflect on our failures as an international community.
The genocide was neither an accident nor unavoidable.
It was deliberate, systematic – and carried out in broad daylight.
No one who followed world affairs or watched the news could deny the sickening violence taking place.
Yet too few spoke out – and fewer still tried to intervene.
Much more could have – and should have – been done.
A generation after the events, the stain of shame endures.
As we remember the bloodshed 28 years ago, we recognize that we always have a choice.
To choose humanity over hatred; compassion over cruelty; courage over complacency; and reconciliation over rage.
The principle of the Responsibility to Protect entails that we can no longer stand idle in the face of atrocity crimes.
Through my Call to Action and other initiatives, human rights stand firmly at the heart of everything we do.
My Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide is monitoring developments worldwide for risks of genocide and other atrocity crimes.
And I have placed the agenda of prevention at the centre of our work.
Today, international criminal justice – though far from perfect – has shown how perpetrators can no longer assume impunity.
The remarkable work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda – the first court in history to convict an individual of genocide – was instrumental in this effort.
And it has demonstrated how justice is indispensable for sustainable peace.
Rwanda today stands as a powerful testament of the human spirit’s ability to heal even the deepest wounds and emerge from the darkest depths to rebuild a stronger society.
After having suffered unspeakable gender-based violence, women today hold 60 percent of parliamentary seats.
And Rwanda is the fourth largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations – risking their own soldiers to spare others the pain they themselves have known.
The genocide against the Tutsi raised questions that affect all humankind – fundamental questions about the role of the Security Council, the effectiveness of peacekeeping, the need to end impunity for international crimes, the need to address the roots of violence, and the fragility of civility.
We have great tests before us.
Today, Ukraine is in flames and old and new conflicts fester in the Middle East, Africa and beyond.
The Security Council agrees mostly to disagree – contributing to an environment of perceived impunity for state and non-state actors.
Wars are raging, inequalities widening, and poverty growing – and all are breeding grounds of resentment, anxiety, and anger.
Meanwhile, we see hate speech – including dehumanizing disinformation, racist tropes, and genocide denial and distortion – proliferating both on- and offline.
Today of all days, we must recognize the dangers of intolerance, irrationality, and bigotry in every society.
As we look back with remorse – let us look ahead with resolve.
Let us commit to be ever vigilant and to never forget.
And let us pay meaningful tribute to the Rwandans who perished by building a future of dignity, tolerance, and human rights for all.
Thank you.

Content: 04 April 2022
ISLAMABAD SECURITY DIALOGUE
1-2 APRIL 2022
(To be delivered on behalf of the Secretary-General by Mr. Julien Harneis, United Nations Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Pakistan.)
I congratulate Pakistan for hosting the second Islamabad Security Dialogue. Pakistan continues to play an important role in the maintenance of global peace and security, including as one of the top contributors to UN peacekeeping operations, and as a hub between South, Central and West Asia.
I also want to express my deep sadness at the loss of eight UN peacekeepers — most of whom were from Pakistan — in this week’s helicopter crash in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo, while carrying out the critical work of supporting peace and security in that country. I send my sincere condolences to their bereaved families at this difficult time.
We are living at a time when the world’s security challenges have grown increasingly complex. In every region of the world, conflicts, crime, terrorism, climate change and cyber threats continue to upend people’s lives and undermine the security upon which the world depends.
The situation in neighboring Afghanistan poses major risks to Pakistan, including through the spillover effects of terrorism. I would like to express my gratitude to Pakistan for providing humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and shelter for refugees.
The situation in Ukraine is also of great concern. I have appealed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, to allow for progress in serious political negotiations. While allowing the delivery of essential humanitarian aid, a ceasefire will also help to address the global consequences of this war.
Throughout, we must recognize that the world’s crises are fueled by a series of non-traditional security threats — including inequality, discrimination, hate speech, the climate crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
My report on Our Common Agenda proposes a New Agenda for Peace, to gather the world around solutions that can deliver the security and development that our world needs. This includes the full implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, supporting the World Health Organization’s global vaccination strategy to end the pandemic, and urgent reforms to the global financial system to help developing countries support their people and build sustainable recovery.
Global security depends on recognizing and addressing the many interrelated root causes of violence and conflicts, and I am pleased that Pakistan’s New Security Policy emphasizes economic and human security as much as traditional security.
The United Nations is committed to working with all global partners across this important work.
In this spirit of dialogue, diplomacy and solidarity, it is my sincere hope that the Islamabad Security Dialogue will help promote the stability and solutions that the world needs at this perilous moment.
Let us be relentless in our efforts to build a more peaceful, stable and secure world for all people.

To the bereaved families, we express our solidarity, our empathy, and our compassion,” further said the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in DRC, Ms. Bintou Keita.

UNDP Pakistan launches documentary “Pakistan: Places, Faces, Voices” ahead of International Mother Language Day
Islamabad, February 19, 2022—UNDP Pakistan launched its documentary titled “Pakistan: Places, Faces, Voices” ahead of International Mother Language Day today. The launch and screening took place at the Pakistan Mother Languages Literature Festival, organised by Indus Cultural Forum and Pakistan Academy of Letters, and proudly supported by UNDP Pakistan. Nearly 200 people attended the screening at the Faiz Ahmed Faiz Auditorium at Pakistan Academy of Letters.
The documentary beautifully captures the richness, and diverse landscape and cultures of Pakistan. Starting from the splendid peaks of North till the deserts and seas of the South of Pakistan, the documentary features the smallest ethnic groups whose voices do not make it to the mainstream discourse. The documentary brings to surface the daily problems faced by these vulnerable communities, while they speak in their local languages in their own settings.
Interviewing hundreds of people from across Pakistan, the documentary captures voices of diverse ethnic communities in over 22 languages including Balti, Brushuski, Wakhi, Khowar, Yadgha, Kalasha, Gawri, Torwali, Ushojo, Seraiki, Dari, Hazaragi, Brahui, Sansi, Marwari, Gurgula, Bagri, Parkari, Kachhi, Dhatki, and Gujrati.
Present at the launch included Ms. Ghazala Saifi, MNA, Parliamentary Secretary, National Heritage and Culture Division; Mr. Knut Ostby, Resident Representative UNDP Pakistan; Ms. Moneeza Hashmi, Chairperson Lahore Arts Council; Mr. Jawad Aziz, National Officer (Culture), UNESCO Pakistan; and Mr. Jamil Akhtar, Director of the documentary Pakistan: Places, Faces, Voices.
“This film has covered the length and breadth of Pakistan, and its diversity of cultures and languages. I commend UNDP’s efforts in bringing voices of these communities forward,” said the Chief Guest Ms. Ghazala Saifi, Parliamentary Secretary, National Heritage and Cultural Division.
“To access even more people and to learn more about their needs and requirements, we reached out to different communities in the farthest parts of the country in order to bring their voices to the mainstream discourses. The insights from this film provide us a roadmap for our future development interventions, ensuring that we leave no one behind,” said Mr. Knut Ostby, Resident Representative UNDP Pakistan.
“We needed to hear voices of these people that we had not heard before. Talking to people is the only way to understand their issues,” highlights Ms. Moneeza Hashmi, Chairperson Lahore Arts Council while commending efforts of UNDP in bringing forward voices of ethnic communities.
“UNESCO is working to protect, preserve and promote Pakistan’s cultural heritage. Capturing the diversity of languages and cultures, this film provides us great insights that will inform our work further,” said Mr. Jawad Aziz, National Officer (Culture), UNESCO Pakistan.
“When you speak to rural people, you learn that their issues and thoughts are very different from the urban population. If we want sustainable development, then attention and resources need to be directed towards rural areas," said Mr. Jamil Akhtar, Director of our documentary Pakistan: Places, Faces, Voices.
The documentary “Pakistan: Places, Faces, Voices” can be viewed at UNDP Pakistan’s YouTube channel here.

In Chief Minister's meeting with UNDP Pakistan, Government of Sindh reaffirms prioritization of SDGs
Karachi, February 11, 2022—A UNDP Pakistan mission to Karachi, led by UNDP Resident Representative Mr. Knut Ostby, began with a series of discussions on existing development priorities and future collaboration between UNDP and the Government of Sindh. These discussions focused on Sustainable Development Goals and the region’s progress and needs.
Aligned with the commitment to further promote sustainable development in the province of Sindh, Mr. Ostby met with Chief Minister Sindh, Syed Murad Ali Shah, and the Convener of Sindh’s Parliamentary Task Force on SDGs, Pir Mujeeb-Ul-Haq. Mr. Ostby reiterated UNDP’s strong commitment with the Government of Sindh towards policy advocacy, support, and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the ‘Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support’ (MAPS) approach which is being implemented in Pakistan at both federal and provincial levels.
The meeting provided an opportunity for UNDP’s senior leadership and Sindh’s political leadership to exchange views on development issues critical to Sindh, including urban development challenges, disaster risk management, socio-economic uplift measures, importance of blue economy, role of the private sector towards accelerating progress on SDGs, and the crucial role of Sindh’s parliament for supportive legislation on key development and human rights issues.
Speaking on the occasion, Chief Minister Sindh, Mr. Murad Ali Shah, emphasized the Government’s key priority areas, including the Sustainable Development Goals, youth empowerment, blue economy, and HIV prevention and awareness. He also stressed on the importance of creating public private partnerships to amplify progress towards Agenda 2030.
The UNDP mission lauded the Government of Sindh’s efforts in enhancing service delivery to its population through promoting people-centric policy initiatives and programs, as well as its efforts to align its budgetary allocations with SDG priorities.
“UNDP welcomes a wider partnership with the Government of Sindh to co-finance key development activities and engaging the private sector in development. We are fully committed to working with the government to make a lasting contribution to provincial development priorities, and to take forward the principle of Leaving No One Behind”, said Mr. Ostby.
The UNDP mission also met with the Administrator of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, Barrister Murtaza Wahab. Mr. Ostby briefed KMC on recent initiatives to strengthen urban resilience and development in informal settlements in Karachi, and highlighted UNDP’s on-going technical support towards Karachi’s development master-planning exercise.

UNODC - PRESS RELEASE : Japan and UNODC Country Office Pakistan Enhance Counter-Narcotics Capacity of the Anti Narcotics Force (ANF) Pakistan by Installing Prefabricated Buildings and Body Scanners
Japan and UNODC Country Office Pakistan Enhance Counter-Narcotics Capacity of the Anti Narcotics Force (ANF) Pakistan by Installing Prefabricated Buildings and Body Scanners
Islamabad, 9 February 2022 - Today, at a joint inauguration ceremony held at the Ministry of Narcotics Control, Government of Pakistan, Dr. Syed Kaleem Imam, Federal Secretary, Ministry of Narcotics Control, in coordination with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) under the Japan-funded Border Security Project, offered his gratitude to the Government of Japan for its continuous official development assistance in Pakistan, as an old-time friend and a strategic partner in the Asia-Pacific region.
The inauguration ceremony was focused on prefabricated buildings donated to the Anti Narcotics Force (ANF) in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, as well as body scanners which were already operational at the Multan, Sialkot, and Faisalabad International Airports. These facilities and equipment have been provided to the ANF under a UNODC project funded by the Government of Japan, entitled ‘Strengthening border security against illicit drug trafficking and related transnational organized crime (April 2016 – December 2021).
The inauguration ceremony was attended by His Excellency (H.E.) Mitsuhiro Wada, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Pakistan, Dr. Syed Kaleem Imam, Federal Secretary Ministry of Narcotics Control, Dr. Jeremy Milsom, Representative of UNODC Country Office Pakistan (COPAK) and senior officials from the Ministry of Narcotics Control, ANF, the Embassy of Japan, and UNODC COPAK.
While welcoming the delegates, Dr. Milsom thanked Federal Secretary Imam and Ambassador Wada for their presence at the gracious occasion and their understanding in conducting this important event at the Ministry following strict SOPs, due to the prevailing COVID situation in the country. He also recognized ANF’s whole-hearted counter-narcotics operations efforts and reiterated his utmost respect for all the ANF personnel who had laid down their precious lives in the fight against drugs and illicit crime in various parts of the country. Dr. Milsom reiterated that “UNODC well recognizes ANF’s leading counter-narcotics role, and it will always remain our crucial partner in Pakistan. We also believe that multi-dimensional roles and cross-cutting mandates of various national stakeholders can be used as a force-multiplier, to address risks and challenges of drug trafficking in Pakistan”. Mr. Saqib Khan – Programme Officer (Border Management) of UNODC COPAK highlighted the specificity of the ANF prefabricated facilities and the three body-scanner, which have already been operationalized by the ANF.
Dr. Syed Kaleem Imam, Federal Secretary Ministry of Narcotics Control, thanked the Embassy of Japan and UNODC COPAK for successfully implementing the capacity-building activities under the 5-year project that commenced in April 2016. He also highlighted the emerging misuse of the internet for drug peddling and money-laundering, a predicate crime and a growing challenge for the rule of law and socio-economic development. “We highly appreciate the continuing capacity-building interventions by UNODC – our closest strategic partner in the UN family. The ANF continues its leading counter-narcotics efforts not only in Pakistan, but we have also facilitated drug interdiction operations together with our international partners, through sharing of timely and accurate information. Following the drastic political changes in Afghanistan and its impact on the wider region, the Government of Pakistan continues its efforts to strengthen peace and socio-economic stability in Afghanistan. While remaining cognizant of the impact of this situation in terms of drug production and trafficking from Afghanistan, the ANF has executed several drug interdiction operations to nab Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) existing in our region, that continue attempts to exploit Pakistan’s geographical location next to Afghanistan and the shortest distance it provides to the international maritime routes”, stated Dr. Kaleem Imam.
While concluding the inauguration ceremony, H.E. Mitsuhiro Wada, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Pakistan, highly appreciated the substantial efforts provided by UNODC, the Ministry of Narcotics Control, and the ANF in this project funded by Japan. “We understand that these contributions have greatly assisted the Government of Pakistan in its path to achieving a drug-free state. Ensuring stability and peace are central to realizing sustainable development in Pakistan, and we are honored to be part of this great journey. We truly appreciate the dedication demonstrated by the ANF and other border law enforcement agencies in the line of duty, to combat illicit drug trafficking and associated money laundering more effectively”, expressed Ambassador Wada.
The ANF’s concerted counter-narcotics efforts had resulted in record-high drug seizures during 2020 and have had a wider impact beyond Pakistan’s borders. These efforts have been supported through capacity-building implemented by the UNODC, with the aim of creating a safe community free from the menace of drug trafficking and related transnational organized crime. In the current geopolitical situation in Afghanistan, there remains a need for continuous capacity-building support, to address the emerging trends and challenges more effectively, such as the Afghan-origin opiates, New Psychotropic Substances (NPS), and synthetic drugs flowing into Pakistan. It could help in further stabilizing peace and socio-economic development in Pakistan and the wider region.
This activity was made possible with the financial support of the Government of Japan.

ILO - PRESS RELEASE : Crucial changes needed to protect workers’ health while teleworking
UNDP - PRESS RELEASE : 6 in 7 people worldwide plagued by feelings of insecurity, reports UN Development Programme
Occupational safety and health in teleworking
Crucial changes needed to protect workers’ health while teleworking
New analysis from the ILO and WHO sets out recommendations for safe and productive hybrid and teleworking.
GENEVA (ILO/WHO News) – The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have called for measures to be put in place to protect workers’ health while teleworking.

A new technical brief on healthy and safe teleworking , published by the two UN agencies, outlines the health benefits and risks of teleworking and the changes needed to accommodate the shift towards different forms of remote work arrangements brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic  and the digital transformation of work.

Among the benefits, the report says, are improved work-life balance, opportunities for flexible working hours and physical activity, reduced traffic and commuting time, and a decrease in air pollution – all of which can improve physical and mental health and social wellbeing. Teleworking can also lead to higher productivity and lower operational costs for many companies.
However, the report warns that without proper planning, organization and health and safety support the impact of teleworking on the physical and mental health and social wellbeing of workers can be significant. It can lead to isolation, burnout, depression, domestic violence, musculoskeletal and other injuries, eye strain, an increase in smoking and alcohol consumption, prolonged sitting and screen time and unhealthy weight gain.

The report outlines the roles that governments, employers, workers and workplace health services should play in promoting and protecting health and safety while teleworking.

“The pandemic has led to a surge of teleworking, effectively changing the nature of work practically overnight for many workers”, said Dr Maria Neira, Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health, WHO. “In the nearly two years since the start of the pandemic, it’s become very clear that teleworking can easily bring health benefits and it can also have a dire impact. Which way the pendulum swings depends entirely on whether governments, employers and workers work together and whether there are agile and inventive occupational health services to put in place policies and practices that benefit both workers and the work.”
“Teleworking and particularly hybrid working are here to stay and are likely to increase after the pandemic, as both companies and individuals have experienced its feasibility and benefits,” said Vera Paquete-Perdigão, Director of the ILO’s Governance and Tripartism Department. “As we move away from this ‘holding pattern’ to settle into a new normal, we have the opportunity to embed new supportive policies, practices and norms to ensure millions of teleworkers have healthy, happy, productive and decent work.”

Measures that should be put in place by employers include ensuring that workers receive adequate equipment to complete the tasks of the job; providing relevant information, guidelines and training to reduce the psychosocial and mental health impact of teleworking; training managers in effective risk management, distance leadership and workplace health promotion; and establishing the “right to disconnect” and sufficient rest days. Occupational health services should be enabled to provide ergonomic, mental health and psychosocial support to teleworkers using digital telehealth technologies, the report says.

The report offers practical recommendations for the organization of telework to meet the needs of both workers and organizations. These include discussing and developing individual teleworking work plans and clarifying priorities; being clear about timelines and expected results; agreeing on a common system to signal availability for work; and ensuring that managers and colleagues respect the system.

Enterprises with teleworkers should develop special programmes for teleworking, combining measures for the management of work and performance with information and communication technologies and adequate equipment, and occupational health services for general health, ergonomic and psychosocial support.

6 in 7 people worldwide plagued by feelings of insecurity, reports UN Development Programme
New UNDP report shows growing sense of insecurity among people despite years of development growth prompting calls for solidarity and refocusing development efforts
8 February, New York – Global development progress does not automatically lead to a greater sense of security, according to a new United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report on human security released today.
New data and analysis in the report, New Threats to Human Security in the Anthropocene, shows that people’s sense of safety and security is at a low in almost every country, including the richest countries, despite years of upwards development success. Those benefiting from some of the highest levels of good health, wealth, and education outcomes are reporting even greater anxiety than 10 years ago.
To tackle this disconnect between development and perceived security, the report calls for greater solidarity across borders and a new approach to development; one that allows people to live free from want, fear, anxiety and indignity.
“Despite global wealth being higher than ever before, a majority of people are feeling apprehensive about the future and these feelings have likely been exacerbated by the pandemic”, said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “In our quest for unbridled economic growth, we continue to destroy our natural world while inequalities are widening, both within and between countries. It is time to recognise the signs of societies that are under immense stress and redefine what progress actually means. We need a fit-for-purpose development model that is built around the protection and restoration our of planet with new sustainable opportunities for all.”
The imperative to act now has never been more clear, as new findings also show that global life expectancy at birth is falling for a second year because of COVID-19, and overall human development measures are also moving downward. Furthermore, climate change is likely to become a leading cause of death around the world.  Even with moderate mitigation of emissions, some 40 million people might die because of changes in temperatures before the end of the century.
The report examines a cluster of threats that have shifted to become more prominent in recent years including those from digital technologies, inequalities, conflicts, and the ability of healthcare systems to tackle new challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.
Addressing these threats, report authors argue, will require policy makers to consider protection, empowerment, and solidarity alongside one another so that human security, planetary considerations and human development all work together and not despite each other. This means that solutions for one problem shouldn’t exacerbate other problems.
“A key element for practical action highlighted in the report is building a greater sense of global solidarity based on the idea of common security. Common security recognises that a community can only be secure if adjacent communities are too. This is something we see all too clearly with the current pandemic: nations are largely powerless to prevent new mutations of this coronavirus from crossing borders,” said Asako Okai, UN Assistant Secretary-General and Director, UNDP Crisis Bureau.
The report also notes the strong association between declining levels of trust and feelings of insecurity. People with higher levels of perceived human insecurity are three times less likely to find others trustworthy.
Other new findings in the report include:
·        The more highly developed countries tend to capitalize more on the benefits from planetary pressures and suffer less of their consequences, highlighting how climate change is pushing inequalities further apart.
·        About 1.2 billion people live in conflict-affected areas, with almost half of them (560 million) in countries not usually considered to be fragile, indicating that the traditional ideas about which countries are most vulnerable to conflict need to be revisited.
·        In 2021, despite the highest global GDP in history, and despite COVID-19 vaccines becoming more readily available in some countries, global life expectancy declined for the second year in a row. Declining by about one and a half years on average compared to a pre-COVID world.
·        There are large and widening gaps in healthcare systems between countries. According to the report’s new Healthcare Universalism Index, between 1995 and 2017, the inequality in healthcare performance between countries with low and very high human development worsened.
The concept of human security, first introduced in UNDP’s milestone 1994 Human Development Report, signaled a radical departure from the idea that people’s security should be only assessed by looking at territorial security, emphasizing the importance of people’s basic needs, their dignity, and their safety to live secure lives.

Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, UNDP and UN WOMEN host first Provincial Steering Committee (PSC) meeting of the EU funded ‘Deliver Justice Project’ in Peshawar
Peshawar, 3 February 2022—The EU funded ‘Deliver Justice Project’ has been able to make remarkable achievements in the Rule of Law space in the past year, despite multiple COVID-related challenges. Programme accomplishments were acknowledged in the first Provincial Steering Committee (PSC) meeting of the joint UN programme being implemented in KP and Balochistan, held at the Planning and Development Department (P&DD) in Peshawar today.
The ‘Deliver Justice Project’ aims to support reform processes to ensure delivery of people-centered justice, enhance access to justice for all, particularly women and marginalized groups; and improve service delivery of the security sector in line with constitutional safeguards and international standards. The project, supported by the EU, is jointly implemented by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC),
Additional Chief Secretary (ACS) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mr. Shahab Ali Shah chaired the meeting and thanked the European Union for its continued support for strengthening the rule of law and build capacity of relevant institutions. At this occasion Additional Chief Secretary Mr. Shah said, “I am also thankful to the UNDP and UN Women for their efforts during the past year and look forward to another year of sustainable efforts on ground that impact the lives of the common person in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”
In his welcome remarks, the EU Head of Cooperation Mr. Ovidiu Mic underlined that strengthening the delivery of justice and security was a priority for the EU, as it created the conducive environment needed for sustainable economic and social development.  He added, “We look forward to working in partnership with the Government of KP and the UN agencies, on further advancing access to justice for the people, particularly women and girls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”.
UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative Mr. Knut Ostby thanked the EU and partners for their continued support for making the programme successful. “Under the programme, UNDP is building the capacity of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police and supporting KP Police’s automation initiatives. We are also working with the Peshawar High Court to develop linkages between criminal and justice coordination committees and the KP Prisons Directorate to identify training needs for curriculum development. Through all these initiatives, we will be able to strengthen law enforcement, judiciary, reclamations and probation and the prisons department in the future.”
UN Women Pakistan Country Representative Ms. Sharmeela Rassool stated that, “In Pakistan, women constitute of almost 50% of the entire population. Yet they are not represented proportionately in receiving or delivering of basic and critical services including effective service delivery in the justice sector. UN Women is committed to deepening our efforts to ensure inclusion of women in formal justice delivery mechanisms in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to ensure their rights are safeguarded for promotion of a fair, efficient, gender-responsive and inclusive society.”
During the meeting, it was highlighted that among other achievements in 2021, the programme successfully laid the foundation for the establishment of a Rule of Law Delivery Unit at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Home Department, assisted operationalizing the Police Training School Khyber and is helping the Directorate of Public Relations KP Police to develop a Public Relations and Communications Strategy. In addition to that, the programme trained reclamation and probation officers and held a consultative workshop to seek recommendations to revise the Dispute Resolution Council rules for enhanced justice for all.
During 2022, the programme will further work towards strengthening the rule of law by joining hands with law enforcement agencies. Particularly, trainings will be provided for two thousand police personnel from the NMDs. The programme will strengthen judicial capacity by training judicial and nonjudicial staff and prosecutors. In addition to that, a detailed gender responsive infrastructure analysis will be conducted of selected premises under the justice sector institutions which will identify gaps and needs and guide capacity building interventions in the future.
With the help of the Prison Academy, seven district prisons in the NMDs, five central prisons and Directorate of Public Relations offices at CPO Peshawar will also be refurbished.

UNDP - PRESS RELEASE : UNDP Pakistan and NCSW hold provincial consultations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to gauge the gendered impact of climate change
UNDP Pakistan and NCSW hold provincial consultations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to gauge the gendered impact of climate change
Peshawar, February 2, 2022— In the last 20 years, Pakistan has faced significant loss of life, property damage, and developmental setbacks from floods, cyclones, and earthquakes, with damage and losses exceeding $20 billion. The worsening climate crisis threatens and affects all humanity, although not uniformly. As it intersects with multiple ongoing crises, existing gender inequalities aggravate climate change impacts. To understand the effects of climate stress on women and solicit feedback, UNDP Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa SDGs Support Unit, in collaboration with the National Commission on the Status of Women, organized a provincial consultation with stakeholders on ‘Women and Climate Change: Impact, Challenges, and Solutions’.
This theme is aligned with the upcoming 66th session of the Global Commission on the Status of Women (CSW): ‘Achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the context of climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies, and programmes”. Similar consultations were previously held in Gilgit-Baltistan and Punjab on the same theme.
The consultation provided a platform to engage highly experienced gender and climate change experts, policy practitioners, representatives from the Government, private sector, civil society, academia, and media, to discuss how climate change impacts women adversely, and highlight existing mechanisms to reduce these vulnerabilities. It also provided a platform to explore potential solutions to reduce the vulnerabilities of climate stress on women and other marginalized populations.
Speaking on the occasion, Chairperson, National Commission on the Status of Women, Ms. Nilofar Bakhtiar said, “We have come to understand that climate change is as important to women as health and education. Reports have shown that women are directly and most affected by disasters. Of the 1.3 billion poor people in the world, 70% are women and, thus, any climate related shocks impact them first.”
“Pakistan has consistently ranked among the top ten most vulnerable countries in the world owing to poor resilience mechanisms and exposure of disadvantaged groups to extreme weather events. To this end, UNDP is committed to ensuring that women's priorities and needs are reflected in climate change planning and funding. We strongly believe that it is critical to ensure gender-sensitive investments in programs for adaptation, mitigation, technology transfer, and capacity building in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” said Ms. Ammara Durrani, Assistant Resident Representative and Chief of the Development Policy Unit, UNDP Pakistan.
Climate change impacts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are evident as 25 districts are categorized as vulnerable to flash flooding as a result of accelerated glacial melt. These floods disrupt food security and livelihood earning in the province, as these sectors employ 44% of the population, with 80% of the population relying on agriculture alone for income. It also hampers the economic growth of the province, as the contribution of agriculture to national GDP is 22% in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Women, who are more than 50% of the population of the province, are impacted more than others due to climate change, as they bear the responsibility of managing the water, food, and nutritional needs of the household. This substantiates the need to address and re-evaluate national and provincial policy frameworks incorporating gender-responsive planning, and to ensure gender equity in design, procedures, budgeting, and outcomes, to avoid women’s exacerbated vulnerabilities to climate change impact.
“One of our government’s main goals has been to tackle climate change. The Government is cognizant and conscious of the fact that without gender mainstreaming, no goal can be achieved. We are strengthening Provincial and National Disaster Management Authorities to better cope with any climate related disasters,” said Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, Special Assistant to the Chief Minister, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, on Information.
Other notable speakers at the consultation included Dr. Shabnum Sarfaraz, Member Social Sector & Devolution, Ministry of Planning, Development & Special Initiatives; Ms. Sumaira Shams, MPA and Chairperson, Women Parliamentary Caucus KP; Ms. Ayesha Bano, MPA, Member Task Force on the Women’s Commission KP, and also member of the Parliamentary Task Force on SDGs; Mr. Muhammad Bakhtiar Khan, Director General, Sustainable Development Unit, Planning and Development Department, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa;  Mr. Arif Anwar Baloch, Secretary, National Commission on the Status of Women; and Dr. Riffat Sardar, Chairperson, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Commission on the Status of Women.
The findings of this provincial consultation, and the feedback received from other relevant stakeholders at the country-wide dialogues will be presented at the 66th session of the Global Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in March 2022 in New York.

UNDP - PRESS RELEASE : Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, U.S. Embassy and UNDP hold groundbreaking ceremony for Agriculture Training Centers in Merged Areas
Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, U.S. Embassy and UNDP hold groundbreaking ceremony for Agriculture Training Centers in Merged Areas
Islamabad, 20 January 2022 — Planning and Development (P&D) Department Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the U.S. Embassy’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) held a groundbreaking ceremony for Agriculture Training Centers (ATCs) in the Merged Areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
With the support of the U.S. government, these four training centers will be constructed in Bajaur, Khyber, Mohmand, and TorGhar districts. Currently, there is a tendency in these districts to cultivate poppy, a crop that causes detrimental socio-economic impact and is illicitly traded, especially in the tribal areas adjoining Afghanistan.
The training centers will provide training on cultivation of alternative crops which will open new avenues of income generation leading to elimination of poppy related businesses and other drug-related crimes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The training centers will promote agriculture cultivation by developing farmers’ skills and creating relationships between farms and enterprises. Agricultural information on timely land preparation, planting, weeding, irrigation, harvesting, storage, and marketing have always been central concerns to the farmers. The use of these training centers, especially through modern technologies, can improve the way farmers in these areas receive, exchange, and harness information.
At the groundbreaking ceremony, the Director General Sustainable Development Unit (SDU) Mr. Sohail Khan thanked UNDP and INL for their continued support and extended full support of the P&D during the construction. “These districts are a top priority of the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and we appreciate INL and UNDP’s support. This initiative will lead to economic and social development of these district and will help in the curtailment of poppy and trade of other heinous drugs,” he said.
INL Director, Mr. Mark Tervakoski said that the project will play a key role in disseminating agricultural knowledge and technologies and increase economic opportunities for people in KP.  He stated “These centers will increase the farmers sources of income and expand employment opportunities, especially for women.  Once these training centers are constructed, the KP government can train hundreds of farmers annually on high-value, licit crop production practices for years to come.”
UNDP Resident Representative Mr. Knut Ostby mentioned that these centers with their modern agriculture technology trainings will strengthen the skills of farmers and give them access to information in technology that will open new avenues for them. “This project will play a key role in disseminating knowledge, technologies and agricultural information as well as linking farmers with other stakeholders in the economy. The training centers will play a crucial role in transforming transitional subsistence farming to modern commercial and agriculture farming to promote household food security, improve incomes, and reduce poverty,” he said. He further added that the construction of these training centers will serve as a reference point and example for other districts as well.
This intervention will take place under the UNDP Amn-o-Insaf Programme, that supports both supply and demand sides of the rule of law by strengthening justice institutions and citizen rights, and by deepening the ongoing efforts to secure peace and stability.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
VIDEO MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF EDUCATION
24 January 2022
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused chaos in education worldwide.
Some 1.6 billion school and college students had their studies interrupted at the peak of the pandemic -- and it’s not over yet.
Today, school closures continue to disrupt the lives of over 31 million students, exacerbating a global learning crisis.
Unless we take action, the share of children leaving school in developing countries who are unable to read could increase from 53 to 70 percent.
But the turmoil in education goes beyond questions of access and inequality.
Our world is changing at a dizzying pace, with technological innovation, unprecedented changes in the world of work, the onset of the climate emergency, and a widespread loss of trust between people and institutions.
Conventional education systems are struggling to deliver the knowledge, skills and values we need to create a greener, better and safer future for all.
Education is a preeminent public good, and an essential enabler for the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The international community cannot afford to be agnostic about its provision, quality and relevance.
That is why I am convening a Summit on Transforming Education later this year.
The time has come to reignite our collective commitment to education.
That means investing in comprehensive plans to help students recover from learning losses.
It means putting education at the heart of broader recovery efforts, aimed at transforming economies and societies and accelerating progress on sustainable development.
It means financial solidarity with developing countries.
And it means embarking on a process of reflection and analysis to identify how national education systems can evolve and transform between now and 2030.
The Summit on Transforming Education will be the first time that world leaders, young people and all education stakeholders come together to consider these fundamental questions.
On this International Day of Education, and as we prepare for the Summit later this year, I call on everyone to unite around education as a public good and a top political priority for the recovery and beyond.

The ILO’s World Employment and Social Outlook Trends 2022 report warns of a slow and uncertain recovery, as the pandemic continues to have a significant impact on global labour markets.
GENEVA (ILO News) – The International Labour Organization (ILO) has downgraded its forecast for labour market recovery in 2022, projecting a deficit in hours worked globally equivalent to 52 million full-time jobs, relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. The previous full-year estimate in May 2021 projected a deficit of 26 million full-time equivalent jobs.
While this latest projection is an improvement on the situation in 2021, it remains almost two per cent below the number of global hours worked pre-pandemic, according to the ILO World Employment and Social Outlook – Trends 2022  (WESO Trends).
Global unemployment is expected to remain above pre-COVID-19 levels until at least 2023. The 2022 level is estimated at 207 million, compared to 186 million in 2019. The ILO’s report also cautions that the overall impact on employment is significantly greater than represented in these figures because many people have left the labour force. In 2022, the global labour force participation rate is projected to remain 1.2 percentage points below that of 2019.
The downgrade in the 2022 forecast reflects, to some extent, the impact that recent variants of COVID-19 , such as Delta and Omicron, are having on the world of work, as well as significant uncertainty regarding the future course of the pandemic.
The WESO Trends report warns of the stark differences in the impact the crisis is having across groups of workers and countries. These differences are deepening inequalities within and among countries and weakening the economic, financial and social fabric of almost every nation, regardless of development status. This damage is likely to require years to repair, with potential long-term consequences for labour force participation, household incomes and social and – possibly – political cohesion.
The effects are being felt in labour markets in all regions of the world, although a great divergence in recovery patterns can be observed. The European and the North American regions are showing the most encouraging signs of recovery, while South-East Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean have the most negative outlook. At the national level, labour market recovery is strongest in high-income countries, while lower-middle-income economies are faring worst.
The disproportionate impact of the crisis on women’s employment is expected to last in the coming years, the report says. While the closing of education and training institutions “will have cascading long-term implications” for young people, particularly those without internet access.
“Two years into this crisis, the outlook remains fragile and the path to recovery is slow and uncertain,” said ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder. “We are already seeing potentially lasting damage to labour markets, along with concerning increases in poverty and inequality. Many workers are being required to shift to new types of work – for example in response to the prolonged slump in international travel and tourism.”
“There can be no real recovery from this pandemic without a broad-based labour market recovery. And to be sustainable, this recovery must be based on the principles of decent work – including health and safety, equity, social protection and social dialogue.”
The WESO Trends includes comprehensive labour market projections for 2022 and 2023. It gives assessments of how labour market recovery has unfolded worldwide, reflecting different national approaches to pandemic recovery and analysing the effects on different groups of workers and economic sectors.
The ILO report shows that, as in previous crises, temporary employment created a buffer against the shock of the pandemic for some. While many temporary jobs were terminated or not renewed, alternative ones were created, including for workers who had lost permanent jobs. On average, the incidence of temporary work did not change.
The WESO Trends also offers a summary of key policy recommendations aimed at creating a fully inclusive, human-centred recovery from the crisis at both national and international levels. These are based on the Global Call to Action for a Human-Centred Recovery from the COVID-19 Crisis that Is Inclusive, Sustainable and Resilient , that was adopted by the ILO’s 187 Member States in June 2021.

5th Steering Committee commits new frontiers in delivering justice for the citizens of Balochistan
18 January 2022, Quetta – The Steering Committee on the Rule of Law (RoL) Roadmap Balochistan convened its fifth stock take meeting on 18 January 2022 in Quetta underscoring a high-level commitment from the key stakeholders towards advancing the rule of law reforms in Balochistan.
The event marked a milestone achievement in providing a convergence platform to the development partners and rule of law institutions to deliberate on the progress and achievements of the Rule of Law Roadmap that has been a flagship project of the Government of Balochistan. Mr. Ziaullah Langau, Adviser to the Chief Minister on Home & Tribal Affairs, GoB appreciated the progress since its inception to date. The project is being implemented by UNODC and graciously supported by the British High Commission till March 2021. The commitment of the Government of Balochistan has led to the development of the PC-1 and allocation of PKR 500 million for the implementation of sustainable rule of law reforms.
Mr. Sven Ruesch, Acting Head of Cooperation, European Union Delegation to Pakistan commended the achievements of the Rule of Law Roadmap project so far that offer a strong base to implement the next generation of rule of law reforms supported by the EU-funded programme. Mr. Ruesch further conveyed the message from the EU Ambassador Mrs. Androulla Kaminara that the EU regards rule of law as a cornerstone for development, peace and security for the people of Balochistan, particularly women and girls and is looking forward to continuing its support in the coming years.
Representatives from the partner agencies of UNDP, UN Women and UNODC shared their implementation plans, identifying collaborative synergies as part of the EU-funded Rule of Law Programme. Ms. Jacqui Ketunuti, Deputy Country Representative & RoL Advisor of UN Women underscored the significance of collective efforts towards provision of enabling rule of law to realize the rights of women, girls and marginalized groups, while minimizing the forms of gender-based violence through continued reforms in the justice sector. The Resident Representative of UNDP in Pakistan Mr. Knut Ostby highlighted their strategic commitment towards supporting the ongoing reforms through transformative activities envisioned under the EU-funded Rule of Law reforms.
Ms. Jouhaida Hanano mentioned the UNODC contribution towards the baseline data and provision of an evidence-driven interface through the Database Management Information System (DBMIS). The Delivery Unit updated the forum on the progress through a demonstration of the DBMIS and website as well as sharing the process of data stock takes.
The forum was also briefed on the ongoing work led by UNODC on the juvenile justice assessment, which is a step forward towards effective implementation of juvenile justice in Balochistan.
Despite unprecedented challenges during the pandemic, the pioneering work led by the roadmap was acknowledged as a groundbreaking effort towards delivering a robust regime of rule-based governance in Balochistan.
This Project is supported by the European Union and implemented by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Country Office in Pakistan (UNODC COPAK).

یہ اجلاس اس بناء پر کلیدی اہمیت کا حامل تھا کہ یہ ترقیاتی پارٹنرز اور قانون کی حکمرانی سے متعلق اداروں کے لئے ایک مشترکہ پلیٹ فارم کا کام دیتا ہے جس کی بدولت قانون کی حکمرانی روڈمیپ کے تحت بلوچستان حکومت کے اس مرکزی پراجیکٹ  میں ہونے والی پیشرفت اور اس کی کامیابیوں کو زیربحث لانے کا موقع ملتا ہے۔ داخلہ و قبائلی امور پر وزیراعلیٰ بلوچستان کے مشیر جناب ضیاء اللہ لانگو نے پراجیکٹ کے آغاز سے اب تک ہونے والی پیشرفت کو سراہا۔ پراجیکٹ پر اقوامِ متحدہ کا دفتر برائے انسدادِ منشیات و جرائم کام کر رہا ہے اور مارچ 2021 تک اسے برٹش ہائی کمیشن کی معاونت حاصل رہی۔ حکومتِ بلوچستان کے پختہ عزم کی بدولت نہ صرف پی سی ون کی تیاری کا کام مکمل کیا گیا بلکہ قانون کی حکمرانی کی پائیدار اصلاحات کو عملی جامہ پہنانے کے لئے 50 کروڑ روپے کی خطیر رقم بھی مختص کی گئی۔
پاکستان میں یورپی یونین مندوب کے شعبہ کواپریشن کے قائمقام سربراہ جناب سوین روش نے قانون کی حکمرانی روڈ میپ پراجیکٹ کے تحت اب تک حاصل کی گئی کامیابیوں کو سراہا جو یورپی یونین کے مالی تعاون سے کام کرتے ہوئے مستقبل کے تقاضوں سے ہم آہنگ قانون کی حکمرانی اصلاحات کو عملی جامہ پہنانے کے لئے مضبوط بنیاد کا کام دیتی ہیں۔ انہوں نے اجلاس کے شرکاء کو یورپی یونین کی سفیر محترمہ اندرولا کامینارا کے اس پیغام سے بھی آگاہ کیا کہ یورپی یونین کے نزدیک قانون کی حکمرانی بلوچستان کے عوام بالخصوص خواتین اور لڑکیوں کے لئے ترقی، امن اور سلامتی یقینی بنانے کی کوششوں میں بنیادی اہمیت کی حامل ہے اور ہمیں امید ہے کہ تعاون اور معاونت کا یہ سلسلہ آئندہ بھی جاری رہے گا۔
یو این ڈی پی، یو این ویمن اور یو این او ڈی سی سمیت پارٹنر اداروں کے نمائندوں نے پراجیکٹ کو عملی جامہ پہنانے کے لئے اپنے منصوبوں کے بارے میں آگاہ کیا اور یورپی یونین کے مالی تعاون پر مبنی قانون کی حکمرانی پروگرام کے سلسلے میں مل کر کام کرنے کے مختلف مواقع کی نشاندہی کی۔ یو این ویمن کی ڈپٹی کنٹری ریپریزنٹیٹو اور قانون کی حکمرانی مشیر محترمہ جیکوئی کیٹونیوٹی نے قانون کی حکمرانی قائم کرنے کے لئے سازگار ماحول پیدا کرنے کی اجتماعی کوششوں کی اہمیت پر زور دیا جس کی بدولت ایک طرف خواتین، لڑکیوں اور محروم طبقات کو ان کے حقوق ملتے ہیں اور دوسری جانب شعبہ انصاف میں مسلسل اصلاحات سے صنفی تشدد میں بھی کمی آتی ہے۔ پاکستان میں یو این ڈی پی کے ریزیڈنٹ ریپریزنٹیٹو، کنُوٹ اوسٹبائی نے یورپی یونین کے مالی تعاون پر مبنی قانون کی حکمرانی اصلاحات پروگرام کے تحت ہونے والی سرگرمیوں میں اپنی بھرپور حمایت کے پختہ عزم کا اظہار کیا۔
محترمہ جوہیدا ہانانو نے بیس لائن ڈیٹا اور ڈیٹابیس مینجمنٹ انفارمیشن سسٹم (ڈی بی ایم آئی ایس) کی شکل میں شواہد پر مبنی انٹرفیس کی فراہمی کے حوالے سے یو این او ڈی سی کی خدمات کا ذکر کیا۔ ڈلیوری یونٹ نے اجلاس کے شرکاء کو اس سسٹم پر ہونے والی پیشرفت کے بارے میں آگاہ کیا اور ڈی بی ایم آئی ایس اور ویب سائٹ کی ڈیمانسٹریشن بھی پیش کی۔
اجلاس کے شرکاء کو کم سن بچوں کے لئے نظام انصاف کے تجزیہ کے سلسلے میں یو این او ڈی سی کی زیرقیادت جاری سرگرمیوں سے بھی آگاہ کیا گیا جو بلوچستان میں کم سن بچوں کے لئے نظام انصاف پر موثر عملدرآمد کی جانب ایک اہم قدم ہے۔
اجلاس کے شرکاء نے کرونا وائرس کی وباء کے دوران غیرمعمولی مشکلات کے باوجود بلوچستان میں قانون کی حکمرانی پر مبنی ایک مضبوط نظام قائم کرنے کے لئے روڈمیپ کے تحت پہلی بار عمل میں لائی جانے والی کوششوں کو خراج تحسین پیش کیا۔
اس پراجیکٹ کے سلسلے میں مالی تعاون یورپی یونین نے فراہم کیا ہے اور پاکستان میں اقوامِ متحدہ کا دفتر برائے انسدادِ منشیات و جرائم (یو این او ڈی سی کو پیک) اس پر عملدرآمد کر رہا ہے۔

Secretary-General’s New Year’s Message
The world welcomes 2022 with our hopes for the future being tested.
By deepening poverty and worsening inequality.
By an unequal distribution of COVID vaccines.
By climate commitments that fall short.
And by ongoing conflict, division, and misinformation.
These are not just policy tests.
These are moral and real-life tests.
And they are tests that humanity can pass — if we commit to making 2022 a year of recovery for everyone.
Recovery from the pandemic — with a bold plan to vaccinate every person, everywhere.
Recovery for our economies — with wealthier countries supporting the developing world with financing, investment and debt relief.
Recovery from mistrust and division — with a new emphasis on science, facts and reason.
Recovery from conflicts — with a renewed spirit of dialogue, compromise and reconciliation.
And recovery for our planet — with climate commitments that match the scale and urgency of the crisis.
Moments of great difficulty are also moments of great opportunity.
To come together in solidarity.
To unite behind solutions that can benefit all people.
And to move forward — together — with hope in what our human family can accomplish.
Together, let’s make recovery our resolution for 2022.
For people, planet and prosperity.
I wish you all a happy and peaceful New Year.

Japan announces new US$ 4.35 million grant to support  Polio Programme in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD, 13 December 2021 – The Government of Japan announced a US$ 4.35 million grant to procure essential oral polio vaccines as part of its continued support to Pakistan for its polio eradication efforts.
This latest grant will be utilized for the procurement of 24 million oral doses of vaccines. It will allow the programme to reach around 21 million children under five years old with focus on the high-risk districts with persistent poliovirus transmission. The vaccines will be used during vaccination drives planned in 2022.
According the National Action Plan (NEAP) 2021-2023, the Polio Porgramme’s strategic goal is to permanently interrupt all poliovirus transmission in Pakistan by the end of 2023.
The notes of the grant were signed and exchanged between the Government of Japan and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the grant agreement was signed and exchanged between Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and UNICEF.
"The Polio eradication efforts made substantive progress this year by limiting the virus circulation resulted significant decrease of Polio cases despite challenges posed by COVID-19. The programme is confident to permanently interrupt all types of polioviruses by the end of 2023," said Dr. Shahzad Baig, National Coordinator of the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme. Appreciating the support of the Government of Japan, Dr Shahzad said, "We are grateful to the people and the Government of Japan for their unwavering support for the children of Pakistan, the new funding will enable us to reach every child with the essential polio vaccine."
H.E. WADA Mitsuhiro, Ambassador of Japan, appreciated the significant progress made this year in controlling the spread of poliovirus, saying that “we are now only one step away from the goal, polio-free Pakistan.” He reiterated his support to the initiative for eradicating all types of poliovirus by the end of 2023 and noted that “Japan has provided assistance in maternal and child health, polio eradication, and routine immunization in Pakistan for decades and will continue its support that will directly benefit vulnerable people.”
"We are glad to witness collaborative effort between Polio program and Expanded Program on Immunization, represented by recently conducted Measles Rubella and Polio campaign. We are also honored that numerous Polio program experiences are utilized to fight against COVID-19, such as 1166 helpline, PCR test capacity at Polio Laboratory and vaccinators’ trainings by JICA Project. We have a strong desire to witness the all types of polio virus interruption by the end of 2023 as suggested by Government of Pakistan. We appreciate the unwavering leadership of Government of Pakistan, with the highest respect to the frontline health workers.," said Shigeki Furuta, Chief Representative, JICA.
"Pakistan has achieved tremendous success against interrupting Polio virus this year. From 84 reported polio cases in year 2020, the incidence has come down to one case in the last eleven months," said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan, highlighting the consistent efforts of the Government of Pakistan and partners. "The last mile towards eradication, however, will be tough and requires continues support from the partners like Government of Japan to achieve a polio-free status," said Aida while acknowledging the support of the people and Government of Japan.
The new funding is part of the continuous support of the Japan Government in the Polio Eradication programme since 1996. To date, the grant and loan contribution from the Government of Japan has amounted to approx. US$ 230.497 million dollars to support the Polio programme in Pakistan through UNICEF.
===============
Note to Editors:
Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus mainly affects children under the age of five. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death. While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the only effective way to protect our children from the crippling disease. Every time children under the age of five get the polio vaccine, they are more protected. Such repeated immunizations have protected millions of children from polio and made most of the countries around the world polio free.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE DAY
12 December2021
As we enter the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we must urgently strengthen our health systems to ensure they are equitable, resilient and capable of meeting everyone’s needs, including for their mental health.
COVID-19 has reached nearly every part of the world, but health coverage still has not.  The shockwaves of this health emergency are hitting hardest those countries that lack health systems capable of providing quality, affordable care for all.
If we are to reach our goal of achieving universal health coverage by 2030, we must commit to investing in and scaling up proven solutions.  This means making more and smarter investments in the foundations of health systems, with an emphasis on primary health care, essential services and marginalized populations.
The best insurance for resilient economies and communities, as well as pandemic preparedness for the future is strengthening health systems before a crisis arrives.  The unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the past year has been a global moral failure.  We must learn from this experience.  The pandemic will not end for any country until it ends for every country.
On this Universal Health Coverage Day, let us join the commitment to end the COVID-19 pandemic and build a healthier, safer future for all by investing in health systems that leave no one behind.

Attending the event, Minister Livestock and Fisheries Department Mr. Abdul Bari Pitafi said that it was vital that the Slaughter Act be reviewed, as the sector contributes immensely to the GDP. FMD is controlled through accurate and quick diagnosis, enabling legal framework, and timely involvement of stakeholders are the solution to curtail the spread of the disease. A range of legislation on animal health is under process, including animal rights and benefiting women who are the main livestock breeders.
FMD is one of the most infectious disease of cattle in Pakistan, which results in annual loss of more than $349 million, resulting in an annual loss of USD 692.884 million, according to the 2018 livestock population data. It is also the primary reason of export restriction of livestock products. GRASP is working to promote public and private stakeholders’ ownership, coordination, and involvement in the implementation of the FMD control strategy. DG Sindh Institute of Animal Health Livestock Department said that Sindh government is introducing risk-based strategic vaccination for FMD hotspot, where Karachi could be declared as FMD control zone.
Mehmood Nawaz Shah Vice President Sindh Abadgar Board elaborated how developing Sindh’s FMD Control Strategy if harmonized with National FMD Control Program can curtail spread of the disease and take measures for the enactment of animal health regulation for Sindh harmonized with the Federal Animal Health Law to resolve the issue.
GRASP is a six-year project designed to reduce poverty in Pakistan by strengthening small-scale agribusinesses. GRASP is implemented by the International Trade Centre – the joint agency of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization – with active participation from local partners.

PRESS RELEASE
UNICEF to launch UN’s largest-ever NFT collection to mark 75th anniversary
On the eve of UNICEF’s 75th anniversary, the UN children’s agency advances innovative fundraising with UN’s first line of data-driven digital tokens launched globally in support of school connectivity.
NEW YORK, 10 December 2021 – UNICEF plans to sell 1,000 data-driven non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the UN’s largest-ever NFT collection to date, the UN children’s agency said today ahead of commemorations of UNICEF’s 75th anniversary.
A portion of the NFTs will be digitally watermarked to commemorate the agency’s 75th year, while others will be connected to events in early 2022. These digital collectibles will be sold directly by UNICEF, using the Ethereum blockchain.
“For 75 years, UNICEF has been a driving force for change in children’s lives. And as we look back at our history, we must also look forward and seize every opportunity to take innovative actions to secure the future for our children,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore.  “We have to use every tool in the toolbox if we are to reach more children and invest in a better world – including through new ways of fundraising and financing – and the launch of UNICEF’s first global collection of data driven digital tokens will directly support our global efforts to close the digital divide and help give every young person access to the Internet.”
Proceeds from this auction and other NFT fundraising scheduled for late 2021 and early 2022 will go towards promising initiatives of the UNICEF Global Office of Innovation, including Giga, a UNICEF and ITU initiative to connect every school in the world to the Internet using new technologies like low-earth orbit satellites, machine learning, and blockchain. To date, Giga has connected over 3,000 schools benefitting over 700,000 children, and mapped over 1 million more to help target investment in connectivity.
In honour of its 75th anniversary, for this NFT collection, UNICEF partnered with data visualization scientist and artist Nadieh Bremer to create a visually striking collection of NFTs called Patchwork Kingdoms. Each piece has a world ‘above’ representing connected schools, and a world ‘below’ for unconnected schools. The squares in the hidden pale ‘reflection’ city represent a lack of connectivity contrasted with the ‘vibrant’ connectivity in schools in the upright city. The various colours show how many children are still in need of Internet access. The artwork is inspired by Giga’s live maps on school connectivity.
The collection of NFTs incorporates data on more than 280,000 schools from 21 countries, and each artwork represents a subset of these schools.
"My most fundamental source of inspiration was the sense of wonder we experience during our childhood,” said Bremer. “The live maps from Giga guided my artwork, using its data to create 1,000 tiny fantasy art pieces while subtly trying to convey the importance of the project; there are still many schools not connected to the Internet, and many children excluded."
Each Patchwork Kingdom is a modern time capsule, meaningfully capturing where children are currently connected and where children are still in need of life-changing access to the Internet and all that connectivity offers for their wellbeing and opportunity. Through a variety of initiatives of the UNICEF Office of Innovation, alongside many public and private partners, UNICEF seeks to capitalize on the potential of the digital revolution for every child to thrive, including a variety of high-profile priorities such as mental health and climate change. As these specific NFTs are bought, collectors will own a snapshot of Giga’s progress at this point in time. Further developments to the NFTs will include the ability to collect individual schools, connect Patchwork Kingdoms, and observe the network of cityscapes grow as Giga evolves and more schools and communities are connected.
“There are more than 1.3 billion children disconnected in an increasingly connected world. We cannot allow these children to grow up on an information island, cut off from the wealth of information and opportunities available online, and with fewer resources to learn and grow,” said Fore. “The Office of Innovation is working to close the digital divide through innovations and technology across the world.”
In addition to being the UN’s largest known NFT collection, it is believed this marks the first time the UN has created NFTs based on data. The collection is supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Snowcrash, CfC St. Moritz, and Metagood.
For 75 years, UNICEF has been working for child rights and the wellbeing of every child. From short-term relief to long-term development programmes, UNICEF works around the world to save children’s lives, protect their rights, and secure their futures.

MESSAGE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS DAY
New York, 10 December 2021
Our world is at a crossroads.
The COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis and the expansion of digital technology into all areas of our lives have created new threats to human rights.

The principles set out in this simple Declaration remain the key to realizing all human rights – civil, economic, cultural, social, and political – for all people, everywhere.
Recovery from the pandemic must be an opportunity to expand human rights and freedoms, and to rebuild trust.

Urgent investment in South Asia’s children vital to prevent devastating impacts of COVID-19 being felt for decades – UNICEF
Agency says action now can reignite opportunities for every child to contribute towards a better long-term future for the region
KATHMANDU, 9 December 2021: Governments across South Asia need to urgently expand investments in basic health, education, and protection services for the millions of children and their families whose lives have been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic and other disasters, says a new UNICEF report released on the agency’s 75th anniversary.
The report, “Reigniting Opportunities for Children in South Asia,” highlights the disproportionate impact that the pandemic has had on the most marginalized of the region’s 600 million children. The report says that unless rollbacks in critical health, immunization, nutrition, protection and education services are reversed, the worst consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic will persist for decades. The report notes that humanitarian disasters and climate-related hazards such as droughts, floods and air pollution have furthered exacerbated the situation for children.
Prior to the pandemic, South Asia was one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, with a large youth population poised to further accelerate growth and significant progress being made for children. Child mortality rates more than halved in the past quarter century, while the number of children suffering from stunting fell by more than a third since 2000. Secondary school enrolment rose steadily, and the number of girls getting married before age 18 fell. Over 90 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water.
“The remarkable achievements our region has made in advancing child rights over recent decades are now at risk,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia. “If we fail to act, the worst impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt for decades to come. But by acting now, we can reignite opportunities and ensure every child in South Asia not only survives but thrives.”
The report identifies immediate priorities, such as fully restoring basic health and immunization services and helping students catch up on the learning they have missed. But it also outlines the lessons learned and the opportunities that have been opened up by the pandemic which can now be leveraged into gains for all children.
They include public health systems that have been strengthened through infrastructure introduced to better respond to COVID-19 – such as improved cold chain and oxygen infrastructure. Other opportunities include increased public conversations around mental health which are helping to spotlight needs and drive demand for more services, and increased recognition of the region’s deep digital divide and opportunities to bridge it.
While making urgent investments to reverse rollbacks in progress for children, the region also needs to be prepared for future waves of the pandemic, UNICEF said.
“Just 30 per cent of South Asia is fully vaccinated, leaving families dangerously unprotected as new variants continue to emerge,” George Laryea-Adjei said. “Governments around the world must ensure fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. The pandemic will not be over for anyone until it is over for everyone.”
The disproportionate impact of the pandemic on children was reiterated in a youth statement entitled “Our Future, Our Rights, Our Voices,” the outcome of extensive virtual consultations involving nearly 500 young people from the 8 South Asian countries.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has made our situation much worse. Our schools have been closed, often for months at a time. Many of us may never return to school,” said the statement, which was shared with UNICEF, the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and senior government officials. “With your action, we can transform the lives of young people in South Asia.”
The report outlines the key actions needed to reverse the rollbacks in progress for children, and begin building a better future for every child in South Asia, among them:
1.    Expanding investment in child-sensitive social protection programmes, especially for the most vulnerable children and their families.
2.    Resuming in-person learning in schools while addressing learning losses, bridging the region’s digital divide and improving the quality of education for every child.
3.    Stronger integrated national health and nutrition systems that protect children from deadly but treatable diseases and reverse the region’s child nutrition crisis.
4.    Protecting children from neglect and abuse and the promotion of the mental health of all children and young people.
5.    Urgent action to protect children from climate change through increased investment in climate adaptation and resilience in key services for children.
In 2020, disruptions linked to COVID-19 led to an estimated 228,000 additional child deaths, while an estimated 5.3 million children missed out on vital vaccinations, nearly 1.9 million more than the previous year. An additional 3.85 million children are thought to have suffered from wasting in 2020.
School closures lasted longer than in almost any other region. Over 400 million children and their teachers were forced to transition to remote learning in a region with low connectivity and device affordability, leading to alarming inequities in learning opportunities. Poorer children in remote areas, girls and students with disabilities were disproportionately affected.
“Today’s crises present a unique opportunity to build strong and adaptable health, education and protection systems that meet the needs of all children,” said George Laryea-Adjei. “UNICEF will continue to work closely with governments in South Asia, as well as businesses, civil society, and children themselves, to make sure that no child is left behind.”

President of Pakistan inaugurates the National Gender Portal, a flagship initiative by NCSW and UN Women to collect data on gender statistics
Islamabad: The President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, inaugurated the landmark digital tool ‘National Gender Data Portal’ developed by UN Women and the National Commission on the Status of Women (NSCW) to collect data on gender statistics, today in the Presidency. This is the first digital platform that will serve as a one-stop-shop repository for high-quality data and evidence from across the country on more than 400 qualitative and quantitative indicators under ten themes including demographics, education, health, economic empowerment, violence against women, access to justice, elections and political participation, disabilities, poverty, and social protection and response to emergencies.
Pakistan has made significant strides towards amplifying its social safety networks and reaching marginalized groups particularly women and girls through programmes such as Ehsaas and Benazir Income Support Programme. However, this progress has not been captured in data used by global indices, and thus, Globally Pakistan seems to be performing dismally on gender related indicators. The NGDP will provide a counter-narrative to such portrayals, through reliable and comprehensive data as well as highlighting areas of excellence, that will paint a more accurate picture of the situation on the ground. Such data collection and analysis will also enable government institutions and other stakeholders to make the best possible evidence-based policy decisions that can target the areas where the need is greatest. Lastly, the NGDP will make it easier to report on Pakistan’s international commitments relating to gender, like CEDAW and SDGs. Altogether, the NDP will accelerate commitments towards gender equality initiatives, strengthen collaboration to ensure that no one is left behind, and promote a counter-narrative to improve Pakistan’s image globally.
The President of Pakistan applauded the efforts and shared hope that filling data gaps at a national level will inform stakeholders of the challenges on the ground in advancing the gender equality agenda as well as highlight success stories for Pakistan. “Data is of paramount importance as it guides on the kind of interventions that need to be done. I thank the presence of the international community and other parliamentarians at this pivotal event.”
Dating back to an idea envisioned at the 14th Inter-Provincial Ministerial Group Meeting held in October 2019, followed by two years of unrelenting efforts and productive consultations with provincial, national and international stakeholders and experts, this dynamic digital platform for collecting gender statistics and compiling a knowledge hub of global, national, and regional resources on gender equality and women’s empowerment has now been developed.
Ms. Nilofar Bakhtiar said during address mentioned the importance of having consolidated gender data on one platform. She also raised awareness on the number of initiatives that were done during 16 days of activism this year.
Mr. Julien Harneis, Resident Coordinator of the United Nations of Pakistan, shared that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a historic global compact to achieve gender equality by 2030 and that is only possible through relevant, gender-sensitive data.  “The availability of data is important to drive social change which will be trickled down to the provinces to make improvements on the ground.”
Additional Secretary (UN & ED), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nabeel Munir, added, “With so many parallel reporting international structures and overlapping obligations, it is important to develop a reporting mechanism amongst various federal and provincial stakeholders, based on data collection and correlation. NGDP would help in better coordination in this regard.”
As of November 2021, the NGDP has been finalized and beta-tested after the initial data entry from existing sources. Focal persons in the Women Development Departments of each province have been appointed and oriented to check and enter provincial data which will be collated nationally through the NGDP. A National Report on the Status of Women in Pakistan is being developed by NCSW and UN Women, based on the initial data entry in the NGDP, which will be finalized in early 2022.

PRESS RELEASE
Women now have legal protection in asserting their property rights, Ombudsperson
PESHAWAR: The Ombudsperson for Protection against harassment of women at workplace jointly with UN Women launched a stakeholder’s guide for “KP Women’s Property Rights Act, 2019”. The purpose of the Act is to build an effective and efficient redress mechanism to protect and secure women's property ownership rights. "Women's rights are human rights." Women have the right to equality in the enjoyment of all their rights, including the right to access, use, inherit, control, and own land. To achieve gender equality, KP shall fulfil their obligation to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women. Upholding the agenda of women rights, UN Women provided technical assistance in the development of the stakeholders guide to help women claim their property rights.
The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan gives due respect to the women in society and guarantee their right of ownership. However, the rights of ownership of women in inheritance are violated usually by their family members by means of coercion, fraud, fabrication, forgery and cheating etc. The event was participated by Bar Councils, lawyers, Social Welfare Department, Revenue Department, civil society, UN Agencies and officials from District Administration.
The KP Women Property Rights Act, 2019, has given, vast powers to the ombudsperson's office established under the Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2010 and also extended its jurisdiction across KP, including merged tribal districts. Under this legislation, the respective office is equipped to handle cases of women who have been deprived of their ownership rights to inherited movable and immovable properties. The Ombudsperson had also been given the authority to enforce its decisions through the state institutions including District Administration, Police and Revenue Department and all authorities are expected to obey its orders.
Ms. Rukhshanda Naz, shared that lengthy court procedures further complex the situations in accessing the property rights in the country and specifically in the province. The property right was also perceived to be an important issue in the fight to eliminate discrimination against women. “Although, the ombudsperson's office is situated at the provincial capital however, women from far-flung Areas such as Mansehra, South Waziristan, Bajaur are also accessing the Ombudsperson office for getting their property rights. Addressing this need, it is planned to introduce the same system at the regional level in the coming two years which will increase women access to property rights.”
The event was graced by Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Shah, Secretary Social Welfare, Special Education & Women Empowerment Department as the chief guest. He stated that the “The Provincial Government has put in place the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Enforcement of Women's Property Rights Act to ensure that women's rights to property ownership and possession are guarded and that such rights are not violated through harassment, persuasion, force, or fraud, among other things.”
“Women are denied of their inheritance rights and less women in the province have the possession of the owned lands. The fear of male family members, poor financial conditions, and prolonged legal procedures, delayed proceedings discourage women from approaching the court for claiming their property rights”, said Zainab Qaisar Khan, Head of Sub Office UN Women Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. She further added that Section 7 of the Women's Property Rights Act allows a woman to file a complaint with the Ombudsperson even if legal proceedings regarding ownership or possession of any property claimed to be hers are pending in the court of law. She also emphasized that women should be made aware of their ownership rights and redress mechanisms, enabling them to seek their legal rights.

PRESS RELEASE
UNICEF launches US$9.4 billion emergency funding appeal for children affected by conflict, the climate crisis and COVID-19
Funds will support essential programs for over 177 million children in need across 145 countries and territories through 2022
GENEVA/NEW YORK, 7 December 2021 – UNICEF launched today a record US$9.4 billion emergency funding appeal to reach more than 327 million people – including 177 million children – affected by humanitarian crises and the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.
The appeal is 24 per cent larger than last year’s as humanitarian needs continue to grow.
“Millions of children around the world are suffering from the impacts of conflict, extreme weather events and the climate crisis,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “As the COVID-19 pandemic approaches its third year, the plight of these children is made even worse with faltering economies, growing poverty and rising inequality. As always, it is the children already living through crises who are the hardest hit. They need urgent help.”
The appeal includes US$2 billion for UNICEF’s response in Afghanistan where 13 million children need urgent humanitarian assistance. These include 1 million children who are facing severe acute malnutrition at a time when the health system is on the verge of collapse. The Afghanistan appeal is UNICEF’s largest ever single-country appeal.
An additional US$933 million will be allocated to the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), a global effort to accelerate the development, production and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines. As the pandemic continues to set back the education, health, nutrition and wellbeing of children around the globe, providing the tools to bring it under control requires urgent support.
UNICEF will also need US$909 million for the Syria refugee crisis, another US$334 million for the crisis inside Syria, US$484 million for the response in Yemen, and over US$356 for programmes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In Ethiopia, where 15.6 million children need humanitarian aid and where brutal fighting displaced hundreds of thousands of children in the north, UNICEF will require US$351 million for its life-saving work.
This year’s funding appeal, UNICEF’s largest ever, also comes as escalating conflicts have pushed millions more children and their communities to the brink. Attacks on children living in countries in conflict, including attacks on civilian infrastructure critical for children’s survival, are continuing at an alarming rate. Close to 24,000 grave violations against children were confirmed last year, or 72 violations a day.
Climate change is worsening the scale and intensity of emergencies. The number of climate-related disasters has tripled in the last 30 years. Today, over 400 million children live in areas of high, or extremely high, water vulnerability.
As part of its Humanitarian Action for Children which sets out the agency’s 2022 appeal, UNICEF plans to reach:
· 7.2 million children with treatment for severe acute malnutrition;
· 62.1 million children with measles vaccinations;
· 53.4 million people with access to safe water for drinking and domestic needs;
· 27.9 million children and caregivers with access to mental health and psychosocial support;
· 21.3 million children and women with access to gender-based violence risk mitigation, prevention or response interventions;
· 51.9 million people with safe and accessible channels to report sexual exploitation and abuse by aid workers;
· 77.1 million children with formal or non-formal education, including early learning; and
· 23.6 million households with cash assistance.
With support from partners, key results in 2021 included:
· 2.4 million children treated for severe acute malnutrition;
· 5 million children and caregivers accessing mental health and psychosocial support;
· 34 million people provided with enough safe water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene;
· 22.4 million children and women receiving essential health care services in UNICEF-supported facilities;
· 110.7 million children accessing formal or non-formal education, including early learning;
· More than 812.2 million people reached through behavioral messages on disease prevention and access to health services;
· 3.2 million people with access to safe channels to report sexual exploitation and abuse;
· 8.6 million women, girls and boys accessing GBV risk mitigation, prevention or response interventions; and
· 14.9 million households reached with humanitarian cash transfers.
This year’s Humanitarian Action for Children Report is launched as part of CY21, a Global Forum for Children and Youth bringing together leaders, experts, change makers and influencers, along with children and youth. The forum aims to accelerate proven and new solutions, inspire commitments to create change, and mobilize knowledge and resources to advance child rights to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.

UNODC
Executive Director Message
Message of Ghada Waly, UNODC Executive Director on International Anti-Corruption Day 2021 – “Your right, your role: say no to corruption”
Every person has the right to justice and opportunity, to public services, and to a sustainable future.
Corruption undermines every one of those rights, and more.
Corruption costs the world trillions of dollars, while enabling crime, exploitation and exclusion, endangering people and planet, and compromising our recovery from the pandemic.
On International Anti-Corruption Day, let us remember that each and every one of us has a role to play in standing up for what is right.
You fight corruption when you refuse to pay or take a bribe, even when it is “business as usual”; when you report a corrupt act, even when it doesn’t affect you; and when you play fair in sport, in business, and in life.
The world’s 1.8 billion young people have the most at stake, and they have the perspective and conviction to find transformative solutions to corruption, and to hold leaders accountable.
We must create opportunities to enable youth to fulfil their role as the future guardians of integrity.
We at the UN Office on Drugs and Crime remain dedicated to our role in supporting countries to cooperate and take action through the UN Convention against Corruption.
We are also engaging with allies in the public and private sectors, as well as in civil society, to promote transparency, integrity, and the rule of law.
By preventing corruption and returning stolen assets, we are unlocking resources for growth and new jobs, building resilience to future emergencies, empowering women and young people, and laying the foundations for a fairer future.
For our inclusive recovery, for our hopes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and for the rights of everyone, let us all live up to our roles in saying No to Corruption.
Thank you.

انسدادِ کرپشن کے عالمی دن، 2021، کے موقع پر ایگزیکٹو ڈائریکٹر یو این او ڈی سی غادا ولی کا پیغام
"آپ کا حق، آپ کا کردار: کرپشن سے کریں انکار"
انصاف کا حصول، ترقی کے مواقع، عوامی خدمات اور پائیدار مستقبل ہر فرد کا حق ہے۔
کرپشن نہ صرف ان تمام حقوق بلکہ اور بھی کئی چیزوں کو نقصان پہنچاتی ہے۔
دنیا کو کرپشن کی قیمت کئی کھرب ڈالر کے نقصان کی صورت میں برداشت کرنا پڑتی ہے۔ اس کے ساتھ ساتھ یہ جرائم، استحصال اور محرومیوں کی راہ ہموار کرتی ہے، کرہ ارض اور اس پر بسنے والے لوگوں کے وجود کو خطرے سے دوچار کرتی ہے اور وباء سے بحالی کے سفر کو مشکل بنا رہی ہے۔
انسدادِ کرپشن کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر ہم سب کو یہ بات یاد رکھنا ہے کہ درست بات کی خاطر ڈٹ جانا ہر فرد کا فرض ہے اور ہر فرد کے لئے اپنا یہ کردار ادا لازم ہے۔
آپ رشوت دینے پر تیار نہیں ہوتے، چاہے یہ کسی معمول کے کام کی خاطر ہی کیوں نہ ہو، تو یہی کرپشن کے خلاف آپ کی جنگ ہے۔ کرپشن چاہے آپ کو متاثر نہ کر رہی ہو، لیکن جب آپ اس کی اطلاع دیتے ہیں تو یہی کرپشن کے خلاف آپ کی جنگ ہے۔ اور جب آپ کھیل میں، کاروبار میں، اور اپنی زندگی میں انصاف پر چلتے ہیں تو یہی کرپشن کے خلاف آپ کی جنگ ہے۔
دنیا کے ایک ارب اسی کروڑ نوجوان اس میں بہت زیادہ دلچسپی رکھتے ہیں اور ان کا اپنا ایک نقطہ نظر ہے، ایک یقین ہے، جس پر چلتے ہوئے وہ کرپشن سے نجات کی راہیں نکال رہے ہیں اور اپنے لیڈروں کا احتساب کر رہے ہیں۔
ہمیں ایسے مواقع پیدا کرنا ہوں گے جن کی بدولت نوجوان دیانتداری کے امین بن سکیں اور مستقبل کی تعمیر میں اپنا کردار بھرپور طریقے سے ادا کر سکیں۔
اقوامِ متحدہ کا دفتر برائے انسدادِ جرائم و منشیات، کرپشن کے خلاف جدوجہد میں تعاون اور اقوامِ متحدہ کنونشن کی رو سے اس کے خلاف کارروائی میں دنیا بھر کے ممالک کی مددومعاونت میں اپنا کردار بھرپور طریقے سے ادا کرنے کے لئے پرعزم ہے۔
یو این او ڈی سی نہ صرف سرکاری و نجی شعبے میں بلکہ سِوِل سوسائٹی میں بھی اپنے پارٹنرز کے ساتھ مل کر شفافیت، دیانتداری اور قانون کی حکمرانی کے فروغ کے لئے سرگرم عمل ہے۔
کرپشن کی روک تھام اور چوری شدہ عوامی اثاثوں کی واپسی کے ذریعے ہم ان وسائل کو ترقی اور روزگار کی نئی راہیں کھولنے، مستقبل کی آفات اور ہنگامی حالات کے مقابلے کی صلاحیتیں بہتر بنانے، خواتین اور نوجوانوں کو بااختیار بنانے، اور ایک بہتر اور انصاف پر مبنی مستقبل کی بنیادیں استوار کرنے کے لئے بروئے کار لا رہے ہیں۔
سب کی شمولیت پر مبنی بحالی کے عمل کے لئے، پائیدار ترقی کے عالمی مقاصد کے حصول کے لئے، اور سب کے سبھی حقوق یقینی بنانے کے لئے، آئیے ہم سب اپنی اپنی جگہ، اپنا کردار ادا کریں اور کرپشن سے انکار کریں۔
شکریہ

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
03 December 2021
Realizing the rights, agency, and leadership of persons with disabilities will advance our common future.
We need everyone, including persons with disabilities, on board to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Around the world, persons with disabilities and their representative organizations are taking action to realize the call: ‘Nothing about us, without us’.
COVID-19 has laid bare the persistent barriers and inequalities faced by the world’s 1 billion persons with disabilities, who have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic.
A disability-inclusive pandemic response and recovery should be guided by persons with disabilities themselves, forge partnerships, tackle injustice and discrimination, expand access to technology and strengthen institutions to create a more inclusive, accessible, and sustainable post-COVID-19 world.
I urge all countries to fully implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, increase accessibility, and dismantle legal, social, economic and other barriers with the active involvement of persons with disabilities and their representative organizations.
On this International Day of Persons with Disabilities, let us commit to build a sustainable, inclusive and just future for everyone, leaving no one behind.

United Nations Development Programme  and National Incubation Center Lahore at LUMS host innovators in plastic waste recycling at SolutionsFest 2.0!
Lahore, December 1, 2021—Innovation-Acceleration-Lab, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan  collaborated with National Incubation Center Lahore (NICL) at LUMS to host SolutionsFest 2.0: Reimagining our Relationship with Plastics in Pakistan. This three-day event to discuss, strategize and create solutions for plastic pollution was held from November 29 to December 1 at NICL at LUMS.
SolutionsFest2.0 brought together people at the heart of the design process and curated a community-led problem-solving engagement opportunity to address the issue of plastic waste management in Pakistan. During the event, plastic problem solvers explored materials, tested connectivity, worked with tools and mechanics, created structures, and improved on iterations by focusing on and responding to the problem of plastic waste generation and on creating a system for a circular economy.
Solutions included a mobile app to facilitate door-to-door collection of recyclable plastics; prototypes of interlocking plastic bricks to enable low-cost housing for slums; upcycled, aesthetic furniture; another solution to turn non-recyclable plastics from waste to energy; and eco-friendly, low-cost, specialized shoes made of recycled material for children born with clubfoot. All prototypes were created at NICL’s state-of-the art Makers Lab, which includes metal, CNC, PCB, wood, and 3D printing facilities for speedy, high quality hardware solutions.
Mr. Ehsan Gul, Head of Experimentation at Innovation-Acc-Lab, UNDP Pakistan stated, “We need to rapidly prototype and experiment to find solutions for fixing the rapidly increasing plastic waste management problem in Pakistan. Soutionsfest 2.0 provided an opportunity to bring sustainability enthusiasts, local recyclers, private sector partners, etc. together to catalyze ideation and invention. The National Incubation Center, Lahore at LUMS was a natural choice for us as a key partner, because of their mission to enable Pakistani problem-solvers and their all-inclusive space, which offers critical prototyping facilities and fosters an environment of innovation and  problem solving.”
In his keynote address, Mr. Hammad Naqi Khan, Director General of World Wildlife Fund (WWF)  Pakistan, appreciated the efforts of the participants and organizers: “We saw a myriad of good ideas today, quite a few ideas were both viable and scalable. In terms of plastic use, radical change is important, but so are small steps in the right direction; for sectors like healthcare plastic usage may be imperative, but for most other sectors it boils down to mere convenience and that is where we need to intervene and make a change.” He emphasized the importance of taking a collaborative approach, and involving stakeholders across the value chain, from consumers to multinational corporations to the government to create synergies and tangible impact.
The National Incubation Center at LUMS is a springboard for venture incubation and corporate innovation through an intersection of applied research, industry and talent, to solve Pakistan’s biggest problems.
SolutionsFest 2.0 is part of a larger portfolio of Innovation-Acceleration-Lab, UNDP Pakistan. UNDP Innovation-Accelerator Lab is a dedicated learning space to reimagine development solutions. We, along with the country office programmes and partners, explore and experiment new approaches, from ethnography to design, to find inclusive and human-centered approaches for meaningful change. In the last two years, the Innovation-Acc-Lab has been exploring this issue with the learning question: how we can reimagine relationship with plastics in Pakistan.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY
02 December 2021
The International Day for the Abolition of Slavery is a day of remembrance and recognition and an urgent call to action.
We must never forget the immeasurable suffering of millions of African men, women and children under the evil of the transatlantic slave trade.
We honour the resilience of those who endured and pay tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in the universal quest for freedom.
The racist legacy of slavery reverberates to this day.
And while some may believe slavery to be a thing of the past, this evil continues to blight our modern world.
Debt bondage, serfdom and forced labour, trafficking in persons for the purpose of exploitation -- including sexual exploitation, forced marriage, child labour -- and the recruitment of children in armed conflict – are contemporary manifestations of slavery.
All are crimes and egregious violations of human rights.
Modern slavery often hides in plain sight.
Of the over 40 million victims of slavery today, one in four are children; three in four are women and girls.
Some are forced to produce the clothes we wear, the food we eat, or construct the buildings we live and work in.
Poor and marginalized groups -- in particular racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples, refugees and migrants -- are at highest risk.
Women and girls from minority groups are among the most vulnerable of all.
Two decades ago, the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action recognized the connection between racism, discrimination, and human trafficking.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency for greater vigilance.  We must ensure decent work and prevent human rights violations across global supply chains.
I call on Member States, civil society and the private sector to strengthen collective action to end the heinous practice of slavery.
I urge all countries to intensify their efforts to identify and protect victims and survivors – including by contributing to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery.
Let us join forces to end the degradation and inhumanity of modern slavery once and for all.

Grants distributed to agri-based SMEs in Sindh
A matching grant distribution ceremony for the agri-based SMEs was held in Karachi on November 30, 2021, by Growth for Rural Advancement and Sustainable Progress (GRASP), a European Union-funded project designed to uplift business potential of the horticulture and livestock SMEs in Sindh and Balochistan. GRASP is implemented by the International Trade Centre (ITC), which globally contributes to uplifting SMEs through gender mainstreaming, policy shift, access to finance, networking, capacity building and product improvement programs.
GRASP provided matching grant of around Rs. 18 million under its emergency response plan to 12 SMEs from Karachi, Thatta and Khairpur. The size of grant varies from Rs. 0.4 to Rs. 3 million based on the business plans shared by the SMEs and evaluation carried out by GRASP. The selected SMEs represent an economic mix of micro, small and medium enterprises, with the amount disbursed in one or two tranches, discussed, and agreed in their wok plan.
Ms. Shabnam Baloch, Provincial Lead GRASP, highlighting significance of the GRASP matching grants, said the scheme was initiated to mitigate the impacts triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic on the livestock and horticulture SMEs. That plan comprised of training, seed delivery and cash grants distribution based on the surveys of the SMEs. KPMG and ITC, with the facilitation of People Poverty Reduction Program (PPRP), Government program being implemented by Sindh Rural Support Program (SRSO), jointly identified the most deserving businesses to distribute grants to, more than 50% of which are led by women entrepreneurs.
Syed Ahson Ali Shah, Partner KPMG-ESG, CCSR said that the matching grants would support date processing units, drip irrigation, solar tube-wells, shed construction, tunnel farming, nursery establishing, livestock rearing etc.
Shortlisting of the grantees included partnership with the UN agencies including UN-ITC, World Food Program, and FAO through leveraging upon their organizational resources to support the beneficiaries. Moreover, preference was given to progressive businesses who has shown innovative, smart, and competitive proposals. Matching grant support from GRASP will take further inputs of the other projects by Government and other development agencies.
CEO SRSO, Mr. Dittal Kalhoro said his organization has connected a huge range of agri-based men and women entrepreneurs to the financial institutions and market; this matching grant will further enhance their capacity to take those entrepreneurs to the next level of businesses in the market.
Dr. Shirin Narejo, Technical Coordinator Sindh Rural Support Program SRSO) distributed cheques among the matching grants beneficiaries of the village organizations (mostly women-led) from Thatta, Mirpur Sakro, Khairpur Mirs and Karachi. Public private partnerships such as this will focus on economic empowerment of women, by providing support around environment-friendly horticulture and livestock practices. Dr. Narejo added that handholding via matching grants in particular of the women-led organization will improve value addition, productivity and climate-resilience green technologies for the SMEs, strengthen their profiles and lead them ahead through the trade-related capacity building opportunities to increase market linkages.
GRASP has set a milestone with the completion of this activity, in line with its mandate of increasing competitiveness of the private sector SMEs through inculcating the good agriculture and manufacturing practices, innovation, climate smart technologies, value addition and marketing, being demonstrated by all the shortlisted SMEs.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR ALL VICTIMS OF CHEMICAL WARFARE
New York, 30 November 2020
More than one hundred years after the first large-scale use of chemical weapons in battle, they continue to inflict terror, suffering and death.
Recent years have seen the erosion of the taboo against chemical weapons, threatening the disarmament and non-proliferation regimes.
The use of chemical weapons anywhere, by anyone, under any circumstances, is intolerable and a serious violation of international law.
Impunity for their use is unacceptable.
There can be no justification for the use of these abhorrent weapons. We must remain united and determined in preventing their use, or the threat of their use. We cannot allow ourselves to become inured.
It is imperative that those who use, or have used, chemical weapons are identified and held accountable. That is the only way to meet our moral responsibility to the victims of chemical warfare.
The Day of Remembrance for all Victims of Chemical Warfare is an occasion to pay tribute to the victims of these inhumane weapons, to assess our progress in preventing any future use, and to renew our determination to eliminate them from our world.
Today, let us renew our unequivocal commitment to the Chemical Weapons Convention and our support to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
Let us honour the victims of chemical warfare by pledging to consign these dreadful weapons to the pages of history.

UNITED NATIONS
SECRETARY-GENERAL MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF SOLIDARITY
WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE
29 November 2021
On this International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory -- including East Jerusalem -- continues to pose a significant challenge to international peace and security.  Persistent violations of the rights of Palestinians along with the expansion of settlements risk eroding the prospect of a two-State solution.
As the international community strives to re-start Israeli – Palestinian dialogue, I am encouraged by recent engagements between senior Israeli and Palestinian officials.  However, containing the situation is not sufficient.
The overall goal remains two states living side-by-side in peace and security, fulfilling the legitimate national aspirations of both peoples, with borders based on the 1967 lines and Jerusalem as the capital of both states.
I call on the parties to avoid unilateral steps that would undermine the chances for a peaceful resolution of the conflict based on international law and relevant United Nations resolutions.  I further call on the parties to engage constructively to end the closure of Gaza and improve the living conditions of all Palestinians under occupation.
I commend the generous donors who support UNRWA and call for Member States to provide timely and predictable funding to allow the Agency to conduct its vital work.
Together, let us reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the Palestinian people in their quest to achieve their inalienable rights and build a future of peace, justice, security, and dignity for both Palestinians and Israelis.

VIDEO MESSAGE MARKING THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
24 Nov 2021
Violence against women and girls continues to be the most pervasive and pressing human rights issue in the world today.
It is both an abhorrent crime and a public health emergency, with far-reaching consequences for millions of women and girls in every corner of the globe.
The latest figures from UN Women confirm that during the COVID-19 pandemic, levels of violence against women and girls have increased.
Across 13 countries, almost half of all women reported that they or a woman they know began to experience gender-based violence during the pandemic.
Almost a quarter of women reported that household conflicts had become more frequent. A similar proportion said they felt less safe at home.
Violence in any part of society affects us all. From the scars on the next generation to the weakening of the social fabric.
We can draw a straight line between violence against women, civil oppression and violent conflict. From rape and sexual slavery used as tools of war, to the thread of misogyny that runs through violent extremism.
But violence against women is not inevitable. The right policies and programmes bring results.
That means comprehensive, long-term strategies that tackle the root causes of violence, protect the rights of women and girls, and promote strong and autonomous women’s rights movements.
This is the model that the United Nations has built through its partnership with the European Union, the Spotlight Initiative.
Last year, in partner countries, we saw a 22 percent increase in prosecution of perpetrators. Eighty-four laws and policies were passed or strengthened. And more than 650,000 women and girls were able to access gender-based violence services, despite restrictions related to the pandemic.
Change is possible.
Now is the time to redouble our efforts so that together, we can eliminate violence against women and girls by 2030.

MESSAGE ON WORLD DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR
ROAD TRAFFIC VICTIMS
21 November 2021
Every 24 seconds a life is cut short because of a road traffic collision.
The World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims is a time to reflect on the tragic deaths of millions of people.
This year’s theme highlights the importance of reducing traffic speeds to prevent death and serious injury – in particular of young women and men at the start of their adult lives, pedestrians and other vulnerable road users such as children, older persons and persons with disabilities.
I urge every country, company and citizen to support local and global efforts to make roads safer, especially in low- and middle-income countries where more than 90 per cent of the world’s road fatalities occur.  I also encourage all Member States to accede to United Nations road safety conventions and implement whole-of-society action plans – and urge all donors to scale up much-needed financial and technical contributions through the United Nations Road Safety Fund.
As we look ahead to next year’s High-level meeting of the UN General Assembly to improve road safety, let us remember that every one of us has a role to play in keeping roads safe.
Today and every day, let us commit to make roads safer for everyone, everywhere.

UNDP, INL and KP Police Inaugurate the Joint Police Training Center Phase-II
Nowshera, 19th November 2021—The newly constructed Phase-II of the Joint Police Training Center (JPTC) Nowshera was inaugurated by Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mr. Moazzam Jah Ansari, U.S. Consul General Peshawar Mr. Richard H. Riley, and UNDP Resident Representative Mr. Knut Ostby in Nowshera, yesterday.
Spread over 88 acres, Phase-II of the center has doubled the capacity of JPTC. This phase includes an academic block, barracks, a quarter guard, multipurpose hall, an assembly hall, health care centre, separate hostels, and residences for both men and women officers.
The construction of JPTC Phase-II also included an additional Academic Block for 500 students, a hostel for 60 officers, another barrack for 200 students and an additional floor of the Quick Response Force building, which were not of the initial plan.
The American Embassy’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Section (INL) Director Mr. Mark A. Tervakoski said that this facility will help in developing a more effective, professional and a transparent criminal justice system. “Since 1989, INL has provided over 292 million USD in aid and military assistance to Pakistani law enforcement agencies. United States will continue to support capacity building and training of the law enforcement sector across the country.”
“Today marks yet another step in the longstanding partnership between the United States of America and Pakistan. This facility is a result of the efforts of Unites States, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government and UNDP’s working together to achieve the same objective; increasing security and prosperity for the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Newly Merged Districts”, said U.S. Consul General Peshawar Mr. Richard H. Riley.
Speaking at the occasion, UNDP Resident Representative Mr. Knut Ostby said that the Joint Police Training Center is now a state of the art training facility of the KP Police. “UNDP will support the KP Police to provide specialized trainings to 2000 police personnel from the Newly Merged Districts in 2022 and 2024. These trainings enable them to deliver services in an effective manner. I want to especially emphasize the importance of women in police. I appreciate INL and KP Police for developing a facility that has offers an enabling environment to women police officers”.
JPTC is a remarkable addition to police force because it provides specialized training facilities to meet the challenging training needs of KP Police men and women.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD TOILET DAY
19 November 2021
Life without a toilet is dirty, dangerous and undignified.
Everyone should have access to hygienic, safe, and sustainable sanitation. Yet 3.6 billion people still live without safely managed sanitation, threatening health, harming the environment, and hindering economic development.
Every day, 700 children under five years old die from diseases linked to unsafe water and sanitation.
Toilets save lives and drive improvements in gender equality and in society as a whole.
We need urgent and massive investment and innovation along the entire ‘sanitation chain’, from toilets to the transport, collection and treatment of human waste.
Delivering on this basic human right – the right to water and sanitation – is good for people, business and our planet.
For every $1 invested in toilets and sanitation, up to $5 is returned in saved medical costs, better health, increased productivity, education and jobs.
History teaches us that rapid progress is possible. Many countries have transformed their health systems by acting on sanitation facilities and ensuring everyone has access to toilets.
On World Toilet Day, let us keep our promise to leave no one behind and take action to deliver health and sanitation for all.

PRESS RELEASE
Landmark intergenerational poll shows young people are 50% more likely than older generations to believe the world is becoming a better place – yet impatient for action on mounting crises
Amid COVID-19 pandemic, younger generation also more likely to trust scientists and embrace international cooperation, according to a UNICEF-Gallup international survey of more than 21,000 children and adults released for World Children’s Day
NEW YORK, 18 November 2021 – Children and young people are nearly 50 per cent more likely than older people to believe that the world is becoming a better place with each generation, according to a new international survey by UNICEF and Gallup released ahead of World Children’s Day.
The survey shows that young people are also more likely to believe childhood itself has improved, with overwhelming majorities believing that healthcare, education, and physical safety are better for today's children than for their parents' generation. Yet, despite their optimism, young people are far from naïve, expressing restlessness for action on climate change, skepticism about information they consume on social media, and struggling with feelings of depression and anxiety. They are far more likely than older people to see themselves as global citizens, and more likely to embrace international cooperation to tackle threats like the COVID-19 pandemic.
“There is no shortage of reasons for pessimism in the world today: Climate change, the pandemic, poverty and inequality, rising distrust, and growing nationalism. But here is a reason for optimism: Children and young people refuse to see the world through the bleak lens of adults,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Compared to older generations, the world’s young people remain hopeful, much more globally minded, and determined to make the world a better place. Today’s young people have concerns for the future but see themselves as part of the solution.”
The poll, The Changing Childhood Project, is the first of its kind to ask multiple generations for their views on the world and what it is like to be a child today. It surveyed more than 21,000 people across two age cohorts (15-24 years old and 40 years old and up) in 21 countries. Nationally representative surveys were undertaken in countries across all regions – Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America – and income levels.
Overall, the data paint a picture of young generations as products of globalization. For example, young people (39 per cent) are on average almost twice as likely as older people (22 per cent) to identify most with being part of the world, versus their own nation or locale. With each additional year of age, people are on average about one per cent less likely to identify as a global citizen.
The survey – conducted during the pandemic – also finds that children and young people are generally more trusting of national governments, scientists and international news media as sources of accurate information. And yet, the poll shows, young people today are aware of problems the world is facing:
· The majority of young people see serious risks for children online, such as seeing violent or sexually explicit content (78 per cent) or being bullied (79 per cent).
· Just 17 per cent of young people say they trust social media platforms “a lot” to provide accurate information.
· While 64 per cent of young people in low- and middle-income countries believe children in their country will be better off economically than their parents, young people in high-income countries have little faith in economic progress. There, fewer than a third of young respondents say children today will grow up to be better off economically than their parents.
· More than a third of young people report often feeling nervous or anxious, and nearly one in five say they often feel depressed or have little interest in doing things.
· On average, 59 per cent of young people say children today face more pressure to succeed than their parents did growing up.
The poll also finds young people want faster progress in the fight against discrimination, more cooperation among countries, and for decision-makers to listen to them:
· On average, nearly three-quarters of young people who are aware of climate change believe governments should take significant action to address it. The share is even higher in low- and lower-middle income countries (83 per cent) where the impact of climate change is expected to be greatest.
· In nearly every country surveyed, large majorities of young people report that their countries would be safer from threats like COVID-19 if governments worked in coordination with other countries rather than on their own.
· Young people demonstrate stronger support for LGBTQ+ rights, with young women leading the fight for equality.
· On average, 58 per cent of 15-24-year-olds believe it is very important for political leaders to listen to children.
“We cannot know what is on the minds of young people if we do not ask them. UNICEF's survey reinforces the importance of hearing from the next generation and understanding their perspectives,” said Joe Daly, Senior Partner at Gallup. “The children of today are the leaders of tomorrow; it is crucial for older generations to do their part to ensure our children inherit a better world.”
The survey finds some areas of strong alignment between young and older generations – notably around climate, the importance of education, global collaboration and children’s agency. By contrast, optimism, global mindedness and recognition of historical progress reflect some of the deepest divides.
“While this research paints a nuanced view of the generational divide, a clear picture emerges: Children and young people embody the spirit of the 21st century far more readily than their parents,” said Fore. “As UNICEF prepares to mark its 75th anniversary next month, and ahead of World Children’s Day, it is critical we listen to young people directly about their well-being and how their lives are changing.”
World Children’s Day – celebrated every year on 20th November – aims to raise awareness for the millions of children that are denied their right to adequate health care, nutrition, education and protection, and to elevate young people’s voices as critical to any discussions about their future.

‎KSRELIEF SUPPORTS LIFESAVING WFP OPERATIONS IN JORDAN AND ‎PAKISTAN ‎
ROME – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomes a timely and generous contribution ‎of US$16.8 million from Saudi Arabia’s King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief) to assist ‎Syrian refugees in Jordan and to support nutrition programmes for women and children in Pakistan.‎
The contribution, signed in Rome by WFP Executive Director David Beasley and KSrelief’s Supervisor-‎General, His Excellency Dr Abdullah Al Rabeeah, comes as WFP struggles to secure funds to continue ‎support to some 465,000 vulnerable refugees in Jordan – most of them from Syria - and to assist more ‎than 66,000 of the most vulnerable children and women in Pakistan.‎
Out of the donation, US$12.8 million, will be allocated to help meet the monthly food needs of 112,000 ‎Syrian refugees living in camps in Jordan for four months; and US$ 4 million will support WFP’s nutrition ‎programmes in 14 of the most vulnerable districts of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Azad ‎Jammu Kashmir (AJK).‎
‎“Building on our long-lasting and strong partnership with WFP, KSrelief reconfirms its commitment to join ‎hands with WFP to address food insecurity and improve the health and living conditions of vulnerable ‎communities around the world. We understand that, now more than ever, it is our primary responsibility ‎to come together and increase our efforts, to deploy more impactful and long-lasting sustainable ‎solutions to fight hunger, restore dignity and provide hope,” said His Excellency Al Rabeeah, speaking ‎from Rome where he addressed the opening session of WFP’s Executive Board meeting. ‎
‎“The COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating economic fallout have pushed the most vulnerable ‎communities in Jordan and Pakistan deeper into poverty. Many of them are struggling to survive day-to-‎day. They cannot cope without assistance,” said Beasley. “We are grateful to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ‎and its people for this contribution which will allow WFP to continue providing vital support where it is ‎needed most.”‎
In Jordan, the funds will enable WFP to continue providing monthly assistance to Syrian refugees living in ‎Zaatari, Azraq, and King Abdulla Park camps through food-restricted e-vouchers. These vouchers – ‎operated with blockchain technology – are loaded with 23 Jordanian Dinars (US$32.49) per person each ‎month enabling families to buy their choice of food at camp supermarkets and bakeries. ‎
In Pakistan, the contribution will ensure integrated and lifesaving nutrition services to more than 66,000 ‎acutely malnourished children under five and to pregnant and lactating women as part of WFP’s ‎programme for community-based management of acute malnutrition. The services will be carried ‎through the Government’s primary health care system, using 186 health facilities.‎
The contribution will ensure specialized nutritious food is provided for vulnerable women and children in ‎‎14 priority districts for a period of one year. It will also strengthen the capacity to screen and treat ‎malnutrition in community health care facilities and enhance the preparedness and safety measures for ‎targeted programmes to prevent malnutrition.‎
The strong partnership between WFP and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia goes back to 1973 and witnessed ‎a historic transformation with the establishment of KSrelief in 2015. WFP has been one of the center’s ‎strongest and most effective partners in addressing challenges caused by hunger, food insecurity and ‎the devastating effects of malnutrition. Since its inception, KSrelief has contributed USD 1.23 billion to ‎WFP for food assistance programs in 24 countries. ‎

World Prematurity Day
November 17, 2021

Preterm Birth Complications is One of the Main Causes for Under Five Child Mortality in Pakistan
UNICEF is supporting Govt of Pakistan to expand Kangaroo Mother Care facilities to save children born prematurely
Islamabad - 16 November 2021: The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) calls for accelerated efforts to save precious lives of children born prematurely as World Prematurity Day (WCD) is commemorated on November 17, 2021. The theme this year is, Zero Separation Act now! Keep parents and babies born too soon together.
In Pakistan, where preterm birth is one of the three leading causes for neonatal mortality and accounts for more than one third of all deaths in newborns, UNICEF is collaborating with the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations & Coordination and provincial health departments to established Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) units in health facilities across the country to save lives of children born too soon.
KMC is one of the best options to provide care for babies born before time in low and middle-income countries.
“Scaling up Kangaroo Mother Care in health facilities across Pakistan, is a cost-effective intervention to save preterm infants,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan.
“Introduced in Pakistan by UNICEF a few years back, KMC has become increasingly popular with health professionals caring for children born before time. The essence of KMC is to keep parents and babies born before time, together as against the past practice of separating small and sick babies from their mothers. The physical and emotional closeness of baby and parents during birth, delivery and hospitalization has long-term health benefits for the child. Additional care during pregnancy, complete antenatal care, nutritious food, mental and psychosocial support to pregnant women and birth spacing can reduce premature births,” Ms. Girma added.
In KMC, newborn is held closely to the chest by the parent, mother or father, with a blanket wrapped around both. The skin-to-skin contact provides warmth and prevents hyperthermia. It is medically beneficial for the baby and good for parent-child bonding.
So far, 30 KMC units have been established in Pakistan with support from UNICEF and other development partners for round the clock service delivery. UNICEF has provided all the necessary equipment and materials to help establish 24 units in various public health centres - 16 in Punjab, 4 in Sindh, 1 in KP, 1 in AJK and 2 in Islamabad Capital Territory. It is collaborating with the Government to scale up KMC unites across the country.
Government of Pakistan and its development partners are trying to reduce preterm births and newborn mortality due to related complications such as Birth Asphyxia, Prematurity and Sepsis. These efforts have helped reduce newborn mortality from 55 to 42 deaths per 1,000 live births during the last five years. It has also had a remarkable impact on morbidity in preterm newborns.
The most vulnerable newborns are those born in marginalized groups, rural areas, urban slum environments and humanitarian settings. UNICEF emphasises that the reduction in premature births and newborn deaths can be achieved by strengthening health policies and services with focus on maternal nutrition and improving access and care for mothers and new-borns, particularly in rural and underserved areas.
Globally, preterm birth is one of the leading causes of child deaths under age 5 as almost 15 million babies in the world are born prematurely and nearly 1 million die due to related complications. Across 184 countries, the rate of preterm birth ranges from 5% to 18% of babies born. Small and sick newborns, most of whom are born preterm, have the highest risk of death and contribute to the majority of the world’s disabled children.
Inequalities in survival rates around the world are stark. In low-income settings, half of the babies born at or below 32 weeks die due to a lack of feasible, cost-effective and basic care, e.g. warmth, breastfeeding support, basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.

UNITED NATIONS
SECRETARY-GENERAL STATEMENT
Secretary-General's statement on the conclusion of the UN Climate Change Conference COP26
Let me begin by thanking our hosts —the UK government and the people of Glasgow — for their tremendous hospitality.
I salute Alok Sharma and his team.  This was an extremely challenging conference. They have shown remarkable expertise in reaching consensus among parties.
 
I am grateful to Patricia Espinosa and all my colleagues of the United Nations Climate Change team.
And I express my gratitude to all delegates — and all those on the outside who have put pressure on this COP to deliver.
The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today.
They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions.
As I said at the opening, we must accelerate action to keep the 1.5 degree goal alive.
Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread.
We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe.
It is time to go into emergency mode — or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero.
I reaffirm my conviction that we must end fossil fuels subsidies.
Phase out coal.
Put a price on carbon.
Build resilience of vulnerable communities against the here and now impacts of climate change.
And make good on the $100 billion climate finance commitment to support developing countries.
We did not achieve these goals at this conference. But we have some building blocks for progress.
Commitments to end deforestation. To drastically reduce methane emissions. To mobilize private finance around net zero.
And the texts today reaffirm resolve towards the 1.5 degree goal. Boost climate finance for adaptation. Recognize the need to strengthen support for vulnerable countries suffering from irreparable climate damage.
And for the first time they encourage International Financial Institutions to consider climate vulnerabilities in concessional financial and other forms of support, including Special Drawing Rights.
And finally close the Paris rule book with agreement on carbon markets and transparency.
These are welcome steps, but they are not enough.
Science tells us that the absolute priority must be rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions in this decade.
Specifically — a 45% cut by 2030 compared to 2010 levels.
But the present set of Nationally Determined Contributions -- even if fully implemented -- will still increase emissions this decade on a pathway that will clearly lead us to well above 2 degrees by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels.
I welcome the agreement between US and China here in Glasgow that — like the text today — pledges to accelerate action to reduce emissions in the 2020s.
To help lower emissions in many other emerging economies, we need to build coalitions of support including developed countries, financial institutions, those with the technical know-how.
This is crucial to help each of those emerging countries speed the transition from coal and accelerate the greening of their economies.
The partnership with South Africa announced a few days ago is a model for doing just that.
I want to make a particular appeal for our future work in relation to adaptation and the issue of loss and damage.
Adaptation isn’t a technocratic issue, it is life or death.
I was once Prime Minister of my country. And I imagine myself today in the shoes of a leader from a vulnerable country.
COVID-19 vaccines are scarce. My economy is sinking. Debt is mounting.  International resources for recovery are completely insufficient.
Meanwhile, although we contributed least to the climate crisis, we suffer most. 
And when yet another hurricane devastates my country, the treasury is empty.
Protecting countries from climate disaster is not charity.  It is solidarity and enlightened self-interest.
We have another climate crisis today. A climate of mistrust is enveloping our globe.  Climate action can help rebuild trust and restore credibility.
That means finally delivering on the $100 billion climate finance commitment to developing countries.
No more IOUs.
It means measuring progress, updating climate plans every year and raising ambition. I will convene a global stock-taking summit at the heads of state level in 2023.
And it means – beyond the mechanisms already set out in the Paris Agreement –  establishing clear standards to measure and analyze net zero commitments from non-state actors.
I will create a High-Level Expert Group with that objective.
Finally, I want to close with a message of hope and resolve to young people, indigenous communities, women leaders, all those leading the climate action army.
I know many of you are disappointed.
Success or failure is not an act of nature. It’s in our hands.
The path of progress is not always a straight line. Sometimes there are detours. Sometimes there are ditches.
As the great Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson said: “Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.”
We have many more seeds to plant along the path.
We won’t reach our destination in one day or one conference.
But I know we can get there.
 
We are in the fight of our lives.
 
Never give up. Never retreat. Keep pushing forward.
I will be with you all the way.
COP 27 starts now.

PRESS RELEASE
More than 45,000 children released from detention during COVID-19 pandemic; evidence that child-friendly justice solutions are possible – UNICEF
Ahead of the World Congress on Justice with Children, a new UNICEF analysis estimates more than 261,000 children are held in detention globally; calls for juvenile justice reform to end detention of all children
Multimedia content available to download here
NEW YORK, 15 November 2021 – More than 45,000 children have been released from detention and safely returned to family or an appropriate alternative since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to new data released by UNICEF today.
Detention of children in the time of COVID reveals that governments and detaining authorities in at least 84 countries have released thousands of children since April 2020 when UNICEF drew attention to their increased risk of contracting COVID-19 in confined and overcrowded spaces, and called for their immediate release. The study is one of two analyses that illustrate the situation for hundreds of thousands of children deprived of their liberty every year. Both reports are released ahead of the World Congress on Justice with Children.
“We have long known that justice systems are ill-equipped to handle the specific needs of children – a situation further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “We commend countries which heeded our call and released children from detention. By protecting children from conditions that could have exposed them to grave illness, these countries were able to overcome public resistance and spur innovative, age-appropriate justice solutions. This has proved something we already knew – child friendly justice solutions are more than possible.”
Children in detention – including in pre- and post-trial custody, immigration detention, held in relation to armed conflict or national security, or living with parents in detention – are often held in confined and overcrowded spaces. They lack adequate access to nutrition, healthcare and hygiene services, and are vulnerable to neglect, physical and psychological abuse, and gender-based violence. Many are denied access to lawyers and family care, and unable to challenge the legality of their detention.
COVID-19 has profoundly affected justice for children, shuttering courts and restricting access to essential social and justice services. Evidence shows that many children, including children in street situations, have been detained for violating pandemic curfew orders and movement restrictions.
Worldwide, an estimated 261,000 children in conflict with the law – those who have been alleged, accused or recognized as having committed an offence – are held in detention, according to the second UNICEF analysis. Estimating the number of children deprived of their liberty in the administration of justice – the first such analysis since 2007 – warns that incomplete record-keeping and undeveloped administrative data systems in many countries mean the number is likely to be much higher.
To reimagine justice for children and safely end detention of all children, UNICEF is calling on governments and civil society to:
· Invest in legal rights awareness for children in justice and welfare systems, especially for the most marginalized children.
· Expand free legal aid, representation, and services for all children.
· Prioritise prevention and early intervention in child offending and diversion to appropriate alternatives.
· End the detention of children, including through legal reforms to raise the age of criminal responsibility.
· Ensure justice for child survivors of sexual violence, abuse or exploitation, including investing in child and gender-sensitive justice processes.
· Establish specialised child-friendly courts, and virtual and mobile courts.
“Any child detained is evidence of failed systems, but that failure is then compounded further. Justice systems meant to protect and support children often add to their suffering,” said Fore. “As policymakers, legal practitioners, academics, civil society, and children and young people convene at the World Congress this week, we must work together to end the detention of children.”

Detention of children in the time of COVID
Estimating the number of children deprived of their liberty in the administration of justice
Data for Detention of children in the time of COVID were derived from a UNICEF survey among its network of 157 country offices. These programme countries – including all 138 low- and middle-income countries plus 19 high-income countries – are home to 90 per cent of the world’s population of children.
Data for Estimating the number of children deprived of their liberty in the administration of justice were compiled from January 2017 to October 2021 through both web research and country-level solicitation. The sources of data include administrative records from government ministries mandated to oversee justice systems, such as ministries of justice, home affairs or social affairs; websites maintained or national statistical reports distributed by national statistical offices; centralized databases such as EuroStat, TransMonEE.

PAKISTAN SUPPORTING WFP AS IT RAMPS UP HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN
ISLAMABAD – The Government of Pakistan is supporting United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) operations to address critical food shortages in Afghanistan as the country faces a rapidly escalating humanitarian crisis. According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessment, some 22.8 million people in Afghanistan face acute food insecurity, including 8.7 million at emergency level (IPC phase 4). Without immediate humanitarian action, the situation will quickly become a matter of life or death.
WFP is rapidly expanding its operations to provide emergency food assistance to the most vulnerable Afghan people. With the support of the Government of Pakistan, WFP has started dispatches of wheat flour from Pakistan to Afghanistan. The wheat has been milled and fortified in Pakistan to improve the nutritional value for consumers. WFP’s first consignment of wheat flour is being transported from Multan city in Eastern Pakistan to Jalalabad via Peshawar in Northwestern Pakistan. Approximately 200 trucks carrying 10,000 MT of wheat flour will leave from Pakistan to Afghanistan in the coming days.
“WFP Pakistan has worked closely with the Ministry of Food Security and the Ministry of Commerce to procure and secure the earliest dispatch of the wheat flour to Afghanistan”, said Chris Kaye, WFP Pakistan’s Representative and Country Director. “WFP’s food assistance to the Afghan people now is a critical life-saver. It will reduce the likelihood of people having to migrate to survive.”
In addition to providing a vital source of food commodities, Pakistan provides a vital corridor for humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people from the rest of the world. WFP and other humanitarian organizations rely on the efficient clearance and movement of shipments through Karachi port and onwards through the Chaman and Torkham border crossing. The Government is also facilitating UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) operations between Islamabad-Kabul. The air-bridge serves as a vital component in supporting assistance efforts into and across Afghanistan by the humanitarian community.
“Pakistan’s support for WFP’s work in Afghanistan is vital. We are very appreciative of the assistance we have received so far,” added Kaye.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
WRITTEN MESSAGE ON WORLD TSUNAMI AWARENESS DAY
5 November 2021
On World Tsunami Awareness Day, we call on countries, international bodies, and civil society to increase understanding about the threat and share innovative approaches to reduce risks.
We can build on progress achieved – ranging from better outreach to tsunami-exposed communities around the world, to the inclusion of a Tsunami Programme in the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.
However, the risks remain immense.
Rising sea levels caused by the climate emergency will further exacerbate the destructive power of tsunamis. We must limit warming to 1.5 degrees over pre-industrial averages and invest at scale in the resilience of coastal communities.
Science and international cooperation — as well as preparedness and early action — must be at the heart of our efforts to save lives from tsunamis and other hazards.
Boosting support to developing countries and improving detection and early warning is critical.
In the face of increasing complex global crises, we need to be better prepared.
Let us work to reduce tsunami risk, deliver on the Sendai Framework, and together build resilience against all disasters.

UNESCO Calls for Protecting Freedom of Expression by Countering Threats of Violence and Crimes Against Journalists
November 2, Tuesday, Islamabad: UNESCO in collaboration with the Parliamentarians Commission for Human Rights, the European Union Delegation to Pakistan, the Embassy of Sweden, the Embassy of the Netherlands, High Commission of Canada, and British High Commission Islamabad, marked the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists (IDEI).
In the context of increasing and emerging threats to journalists, this year’s IDEI focused on the institutional gaps and response to the safety of journalists. In addition, harassment of women journalists, and misinformation were also discussed as factors impeding their safety. Media workers, journalists, civil society, and human rights activists have constantly been highlighting the need to strengthen mechanisms ensuring safety of journalists.
Being organized under UNESCO’s multi-donor program on freedom of expression and safety of journalists, the event was attended by around 60 participants. In 2013, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to commemorate IDEI every year to raise awareness on journalists’ safety. According to UNESCO, in Pakistan 81 journalists have lost their lives in the line of duty since 2004, while independent research highlights extremely low levels of convictions against the killings of these journalists. This day recognizes the far-reaching consequences of impunity, especially of crimes against journalists in limiting fundamental freedoms.
Ms. Patricia McPhillips, Country Representative and Director of UNESCO, welcomed the participants and stressed that the threats and violence against journalists not only indicate a shrinking space for democratic discourse but also highlight the weakening of important institutions such as the rule of law and the judicial system.
In his opening remarks, H.E. Mr. Wouter Plomp, Ambassador of the Netherlands to Pakistan, said journalists should be able to report without fear, adding the Netherlands continues to strive for improving the conditions in which journalists work, both at the national as well as at the international level.
During the event, Ms. Gharida Farooqi, a journalist, said the safety of media workers should be ensured to work independently. Mr. Saqib Sultan, Director National Police Bureau, stressed the need for developing and strengthening mechanisms that report and monitor crimes against journalists.  Human rights expert, Mr. Chaudhry Shafique, highlighted gaps in existing avenues for legal aid and institutional support for safety of journalists. DG Information and Broadcasting Mr. Manzoor Memon elaborated on efforts by the government to ensure safety of journalists.
UNESCO’s Multi Donor Programme on Freedom of Expression and Safety of Journalists strengthens UNESCO’s work at global, regional, and national levels by channeling funds towards emerging priorities and the most pressing needs to achieve its mandate on freedom of expression. It enables UNESCO’s Communication and Information Sector to address complex issues through the design and implementation of holistic media and long-term interventions. This mechanism enables UNESCO and its partners to achieve greater impact and sustainability, while reducing fragmentation of activities in the same field.

Digitalized records of PMIS and Prisons Staff Training Academy handed over to the Government of Sindh by UNODC and the United States Government
2nd November 2021, Hyderabad – The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the United States Mission to Pakistan jointly handed over the formal control and implementation of the Prison Management Information System (PMIS) to the Prison Department, Government of Sindh, through a special ceremony hosted in Hyderabad on 2nd November 2021.
The PMIS has been intuitively designed to replace the redundant manual file system with a Central Data Centre to drive functionality and interoperability across all prisons in Sindh. In addition, the ceremony was accompanied by the inauguration of the Prisons Staff Training Academy in Hyderabad, which is constructed with the generous support of the U.S. Government. The Training Academy would go a long way in developing a cadre of professionally trained staff for prisons.
The ceremony was graced by Syed Murad Ali Shah, the Chief Minister, Sindh, who praised the automation of prison records as a breakthrough innovation to enhance the efficiency of prison administration in Sindh. He underscored the commitment of the Government of Sindh through the allocation of 10 M PKR for the establishment of a Virtual Private Network, which will help to sustain the PMIS across prisons in Sindh. He also appreciated the support from the U.S. Government and UNODC that went beyond the provision of funds and equipment to offering hands-on training to a cadre of 173 master trainers from a cross-section of staff, including security, health, jail management, and Inspectorate General of Prisons in Sindh. This would ensure adaptability and transfer of technology for an efficient administration of the PMIS.
The ceremony was also attended by a delegation from the US Mission to Pakistan including U.S. Consul General Karachi, Mark Stroh, and Mark Tervakoski, the Director of the U.S. Embassy’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Section, who appreciated the functionality of the PMIS and the intended benefits of Prison Staff Training Academy, which will go a long way in supporting prison reforms and broader agenda of enhancing the performance of the Criminal Justice System in Sindh.
Mr. Jeremy Milsom, Representative, UNODC thanked the Chief Minister, Sindh and stakeholders for their support and ownership of this important transformation through the PMIS. He appreciated the U.S. Government for its generous support, and stressed the importance of accessible and transparent data that can help in reforming the prison system through effective decision-making.
The event was well-attended by the Inspector General, Prisons Sindh, Mr Kazi Nazeer Ahmed, along with other distinguished guests from the law enforcement and criminal justice system in Sindh. The participants acclaimed PMIS as a groundbreaking innovation to leverage technology. The setting up of Central Data Control Center at the Inspectorate General Prisons Karachi and the Prison Staff Training Academy in Hyderabad are also steps towards ensuring the sustainability of prison reforms.
This Project is supported by the U.S. Mission to Pakistan’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) Section and implemented by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Country Office in Pakistan (UNODC COPAK).

UNDP-PRESS RELEASE: A call for bolder decisions for climate justice from Asia
A call for bolder decisions for climate justice from Asia
30 October 2021 | KATHMANDU: United Nations Development Programme representatives from eight Asian countries have called on world leaders to take bold action to ensure climate justice for highly vulnerable developing states.
They were speaking at the ‘Asian Pre-COP26 Dialogue’ hosted by UNDP Nepal on Friday 29 October 2021, from Namche, that lies in the shadow of Mount Everest, nearly 3600 meters above sea level.
The event brought together heads of UNDP from Bhutan, India, Thailand, Pakistan, Laos, Maldives, and Mongolia. Over 200 development experts and climate practitioners joined the discussion to exchange country-level experiences, challenges, and innovative solutions, to tackle the climate crisis.
“We are at crossroads now. The world is on a pathway to exceed 2.7 degrees in global warming. It is time to join forces, express solidarity, and make our voices heard,” said Kanni Wignaraja, UNDP’s Assistant Secretary-General and the Director of its Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific. “Let’s say it out loud: Do not choose extinction!”
The dialogue concluded with a strong and common message: We need bolder decisions and partnerships for climate justice, particularly climate and sustainable development finance. Such financing would help poorer and vulnerable countries who have done little to contribute to the climate crisis.
The dialogue also emphasized the need for countries to make strong national climate pledges and step up their climate ambitions, as expressed through their “Nationally Determined Contributions” (NDCs), cut emissions and achieve the Paris Agreement goals.
“We are borrowing our carbon budget from our children and grandchildren. It is the youth of today that will suffer as a direct implication of our inaction and unwillingness to step up global climate action,” UNDP Nepal RR Ayshanie Medagangoda Labe. “Nepalis of yesterday did not borrow so much of today's Nepalis' carbon footprint, so today's Nepalis have the same duty to tomorrow’s Nepalis, as advocating and investing for climate harmony is everybody’s responsibility.”
“The Himalaya are one of the most beautiful parts of the world but also severely affected by the Climate Emergency.  Yet in Ladakh, India, local communities are showing how to live in a harmony with nature and practice sustainable lifestyles. We must learn from them to leave a green and healthy planet, for our future generations,” said Shoko Noda, Resident Representative, UNDP India.
“The world largest economies are still spending disproportionate amounts of resources on fossil fuel subsidies that are putting our climate at risk of the 1.5 degrees tipping point,” said Enrico Gaveglia, UNDP Resident Representative in the Maldives. “This is a death sentence for Small Island Developing States such as Maldives, who are already living in a climate crisis. It’s time to bring in fossil fuel subsidy reforms and unlock climate finance to help our planet survive, with people on it. It’s now or never.”
“Mongolia is faced with intensifying desertification and biodiversity loss. In response, the government has committed 1% of its GDP to combating climate change and deforestation, with a goal of planting one billion trees by 2030. Community engagement is essential to achieve a green, inclusive, and sustainable future,” said Elaine Conkievich, UNDP Resident Representative Mongolia. “Climate change and inequality are inextricably linked, as it is poor and vulnerable people who will mostly pay the price of inaction.  COVID-19 presents an opportunity for governments across the globe to act now to prevent the devastating consequences of climate change.”
“We often talk about climate change as something that will happen in the future, but in northern Pakistan it is already happening. Regular disasters are hitting many villages, caused by Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs),” said Knut Ostby, UNDP Resident Representative Pakistan. “UNDP is supporting the Government of Pakistan and the local community to respond to this situation. Climate change is here. And we need to take action and address this right now.”
“Though not a net contributor to climate change, Lao PDR is heavily impacted by it. To combat desertification and restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by droughts and floods; UNDP and the Global Environment Facility is supporting the government in the implementation of the SAFE-Ecosystems project, to not only help increase the forest cover, but also protect the endangered Eld’s Deer and biodiversity, together with the livelihoods of the people,” said Ricarda Rieger, UNDP Resident Representative in Lao PDR.
“Although Bhutan is carbon neutral, warming global temperatures are directly affecting all aspects of life. As a small and mountainous country, Bhutan is stepping up its climate ambition through the second NDC, but it cannot solve the climate crisis on its own,” said Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP Bhutan. “The countries with financial and technical capacity need to step up to honor the Paris Agreement. The COP26 will be a platform to make decisive commitments towards zero – carbon futures.”
“With Thailand located in the monsoon region, it is highly susceptible to extreme climate events, such as sea-level rise, flooding, cyclones and erosion.  Climate change is impacting local tourism, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture and natural resources while creating additional stress on land and water resources,” said UNDP Resident Representative Renaud Meyer. “To address climate change, it is critical to implement community-based solutions working collaboratively with the public and private sectors.”

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD CITIES DAY 2021
31 October 2021
Cities are hubs of innovation and human ingenuity — and potential centres for transformative action to implement the Sustainable Development Goals and build a zero-carbon, climate-resilient and socially just world.
The theme of this year’s World Cities Day, ‘Adapting Cities for Climate Resilience’, comes at a time when cities must be more resilient than ever before. They have been epicentres of the COVID-19 pandemic and are on the frontlines of the climate crisis.
Globally, over 1 billion people live in informal settlements, with 70 per cent highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea level rise could put more than 800 million people in coastal cities at direct risk by 2050. Yet just 9% of climate finance to cities goes to adaptation and resilience, and cities in developing countries receive far less than those in developed countries. This must change — half of all climate finance should be dedicated to adaptation.
We need a people-centred and inclusive approach to planning, building and managing cities. Resilient infrastructure, early warning systems and financial instruments to mitigate risks are crucial tools as cities seek to adapt and protect the lives and livelihoods of their residents.
Cities can lead the way in recovering better from the pandemic, reducing emissions at the scale and speed the world needs, and securing a resilient future for billions.
On World Cities Day, let us renew our resolve to confront urban challenges, mitigate risks, and forge lasting solutions. Together, we can transform our cities, and thereby transform our world.

World Cities Day
UN Habitat organized seminar on Adapting Cities for Climate Resilience and Amplifying Pakistan’s Efforts and Young Voices to Echo at COP26
UN-Habitat Pakistan collaborated with the Ministry of Climate Change, SheherSaaz and COMSATS University to celebrate World Cities Day 2021. The event titled “Urban Thinkers Campus: Amplifying Pakistan’s Efforts and Young Voices” was aimed to open space for critical exchange between urban researchers, professionals, and decision-makers who believe that urbanization is an opportunity and can lead to positive urban transformations. It was also intended as a platform to build consensus in addressing urbanization challenges and proposing solutions to urban futures. For this year, the theme of UTC is set to present, discuss and deliver climate action solutions.
The event commenced with a welcome address from Ms. Almas Shakoor (Executive Director, SheherSaaz) where she highlighted the vulnerability of Pakistan to the impacts of climate change, despite contributing the least to greenhouse gas emissions. Ms. Shakur also shed light on the demographics, stating 63% of the population in Pakistan is comprised of young people ageing between 15 and 33 years, stressing the dire need to include the young generation in the fight towards climate change.
Following, the keynote speech was delivered by Mr. Jawed Ali Khan (HPM, UN-Habitat Pakistan) where he highlighted the critical challenges due to rapid urbanization, stating it has doubled between 1998 and 2017. He elaborated on some of the challenges such as housing deficit due to the widening gap between housing supply and demand, leading to major difficulties in urban life. Additionally, he stated that if these issues go unchecked, major cities will be at a verge of deterioration within the coming decade.  He went on to reiterate the catastrophic threats from glacial melts, floods and droughts, water scarcity, urban flooding, and urban heat island phenomenon in Pakistani cities despite its miniscule contribution towards greenhouse gas emissions. Lastly, Mr. Jawed called attention to some of great initiatives taken by the Government of Pakistan to overcome the impacts of climate change namely: localization of the SDGs in the local context, 10 billion Tree Plantation Programme, manufacturing of electric vehicles as well as modernized mass transit system, metro buses and metro trains, development of Green Building Code for Pakistan and adoption of green building practices in the Prime Ministers 5 Million Housing Programme. Mr. Jawed concluded with an optimistic note stating the impacts of climate change can me minimized through adoption of science-based solutions and innovation as well as building partnerships for inclusive, resilient, and sustainable solutions.
Mr. Shahzad Malik (Dean faculty of engineering, COMSATS) gave remarks focused on the need to sensitize the public and the youth to some very critical issues in the wake of climate change such as fossil fuel consumption. He stressed that to be able to take concrete action, we must start from ourselves. Mr. Shahid then went on to appreciate the efforts of the Government of Pakistan especially initiatives targeted reduce dependance on fossil fuel. He further emphasized the significance of academia in creating awareness not just among the youth, but also the faculty to ensure people are mindful of their practices and incorporate sustainability in their day to day lives. Finally, he added the prominent contribution of academia in providing technical solutions all of which feed into the grand scheme that is accelerating climate action.
The last address was from the youth where they called for better access to modern and climate smart public resources as it is critical for sustainable cities including: quality education, transport, waste collection facilities and safe air quality among others. Due to rapid urbanization, the youth would like to see more adaptive solutions to tackle its side effects. Additionally, to be able to make cities sustainable we need renovation of public spaces such as public squares, streets, parks, and urban spaces that are a vital part of urban cities. Urban renewable keeping green solutions in mind will help resolve many of the climate change challenges faced in Pakistan. Lastly, the youth made comparisons to cities around the world that are creating milestones in terms of tackling and avoiding the exacerbation of climate change – demanding the same can be achieved in Pakistan if we pledge take concrete action at institutional and individual level starting now.
Subsequently, participants engaged in productive deliberations on how to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Virtual attendees from provincial governments explained the work being done in different provinces and their contributions towards climate action.
To conclude, Ms. Almas Shakoor highlighted the complex nature of the issues surrounding climate change that cannot be tackled overnight. However, the need of the hour is to formulate strategies urgently and engage individuals from all levels, especially the youth

Government of Gilgit Baltistan launches Equity & District profiles with UNICEF support
Government of Gilgit Baltistan and UNICEF partnered to generate data supporting targeted, inclusive programmatic responses for the most vulnerable children
GILGIT, 28 October 2021 – Today the Government of Gilgit Baltistan (GB) launched four equity and ten district profiles developed with support from UNICEF in Gilgit. The data will help identify the most vulnerable children living in the territory and better plan for evidence-based, equitable programmatic interventions.
The analysis of Equity and District profiles in GB has already revealed an overall pattern of inequality between different groups and geographical areas. In particular, it found that children who belong to the lowest wealth quintile, have the least educated mothers and live in rural areas are more vulnerable to stunting, child marriage, early childbearing and school dropout. Moreover, the profiles highlighted differences between districts; for instance, Hunza has the highest rate of birth registration (84 per cent) while Diamer has the lowest (2 per cent).
“Government of GB needs to divert resources from brick & mortar towards human development to address the inequalities highlighted in these equity and district profiles launched today," said Javed Ali Manwa, Minister for Finance, GB.
The four Equity Profiles developed for Gilgit Baltistan in partnership with the Planning and Development Department help determine whether public resources are efficiently contributing to reducing socio-economic inequalities among children and to improving their lives; whether inequalities have increased or decreased; and progress against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The 10 District Profiles provide the Government with reliable district-level indicators to better identify the most vulnerable families. This will help plan more efficient, integrated programmatic interventions that reach the most marginalized children and ensure equitable allocation of resources at district level. It will also help decision-makers evaluate the performance of each district against development indicators.
“When children do not have a fair chance in life, significant inequalities emerge between those who have the most and those who have the least. Those inequalities have significant economic, political and social consequences,” said Ms. Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. ”UNICEF commends the Government of Gilgit Baltistan for developing Equity and District profiles that go beyond statistical averages which can hide wide disparities between districts and communities. These new tools will help the Government plan smart child-centered, targeted programmatic interventions and ensure that the most vulnerable children are the first to benefit from them. UNICEF will continue to support the Government to provide every girl and boy with equitable chances of fulfilling their potential.”
Since 2017, UNICEF Pakistan has supported all provincial Bureau of Statistics and Planning and Development Departments in Pakistan to include an Equity profile analysis in the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICs). This helps ensure that resources are allocated strategically to reach the most marginalized populations first, in an equitable manner.
This is part of a 2015 initiative launched by UNICEF regional office in South Asia and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) to strengthen national statistical systems in the region. The goal is to improve reporting on the inequity and deprivations which children, women and other marginalized groups face.

At least 200 million schoolchildren live in countries that remain unprepared to deploy remote learning in future emergency school closures – UNICEF
According to a new report, among the 31 countries unprepared for remote learning, almost half kept their schools closed for at least half of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving 102 million students without any form of education.
NEW YORK, 28 October 2021 – At least 200 million schoolchildren live in 31 low- and middle-income countries that remain unprepared to deploy remote learning in future emergency school closures, according to a new UNICEF report released today. Among that group of students, 102 million live in 14 countries that have kept their schools fully or partially closed for at least half of the COVID-19 pandemic – locking many schoolchildren out of any kind of education.
The Remote Learning Readiness Index measures countries’ readiness to deliver remote learning in response to disruptions of in-person education, covering almost 90 per cent of students in low- and lower-middle-income countries. The analysis focuses on three domains: the availability of home-based assets and parents’ education levels; deployment of policies and training for teachers; and the education sector’s preparedness for emergencies.
“Even in the midst of an ongoing emergency, we know there will be another one, but we aren’t making enough progress to ensure the next time students are forced out of the classroom, they have better options,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “While disruptive, the past 19 months have given us a glimpse of what is possible during and after the pandemic. Together with partners, we have been hard at work to leverage the power of technology and to provide learning opportunities for children and young people everywhere.”
Benin, Burundi, Cote d’Ivoire, Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi, Niger and Togo are among the countries with the most significant need for improvement within the education sector.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of lack of remote learning readiness was especially felt by students living in countries where schools were fully or partially closed for at least half of the past 19 months, such as Congo and Madagascar.
The report outlines the limitations of remote learning and inequalities of access, warning that the situation is likely far worse than the available data shows. Beyond the countries assessed, anecdotal and qualitative data reveals that learners have faced challenges with remote learning globally, including in higher-middle and high-income countries.
Other key findings from the report include:
There is no replacement for in-person learning, the report says. Yet, resilient schools with robust remote learning systems, especially digital learning, can provide a degree of education during school closures in times of emergencies. Moreover, once schools reopen, these systems can support students to catch up on their lost learning.
Through the Reimagine Education initiative, UNICEF is working with public and private partners to give children and young people equal access to quality digital learning, with the goal of reaching some 3.5 billion with world-class digital learning solutions by 2030. One of the ways UNICEF is working towards these goals is through the Learning Passport, a global learning platform developed in partnership with Microsoft, supporting 1.6 million learners during school closures. In addition, Reimagine Education is also bolstered by Giga – a UNICEF and ITU global initiative to connect every school and its surrounding community to the internet. As of last week, Giga has mapped 1 million schools in 41 countries and connected over 3,000 schools across four continents, benefiting 700,000 learners.

Gilgit-Baltistan Child Labour Survey Report Launched

GB First in the Country to Publish Report of the Largest Ever Child-Focused Survey Conducted with Support from UNICEF
Gilgit: October 27, 2021 – The Gilgit-Baltistan Child Labour Survey (GBCLS) Report 2018-19 was launched here today by the Chief Minister, Mr. Khalid Khursheed Khan. The survey conducted in collaboration with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to provide authentic data about the living conditions of children, which in turn, will help the Government to address key issues pertaining to fundamental rights of children in Gilgit Baltistan (GB).
As part of the nationwide Child Labor Survey being conducted in all provinces and territories of the country, GBCLS Report is the first to be published in Pakistan. It is also the largest survey conducted in GB, with a representative sample of 7,032 households from all 10 districts representing nearly 400, 000 children between the ages of 5 to17, living across urban and rural areas of the region.
“Government of Gilgit Baltistan is sternly committed to protect basic rights of every child and to ensure access of every child to basic education, health, social & mental wellbeing and more as protected under the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan and other United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child,” said Khalid Khursheed Khan, Chief Minister GB.“ The Government of GB has already invoked, ‘Prohibition of Employment of Children Act, 2019’ and the capacity of the Department of Labour is being enhanced to ensure strict compliance of the Act.”
The CM applauded technical support of UNICEF and the efforts of P&DD GB to be the first to complete the survey despite the challenging conditions due to unique and rough geographical terrain, widespread population, harsh weather and above all in absence of Bureau of statistics in GB.
He expressed his concern about alarmingly high prevalence of the rate of child labor in GB which is 13 percent and even touches 28 percent in some districts, keeping in view the strong family value system and peculiar culture in GB.
“30 percent children of school going age are out of school. It is a gigantic task to confront this,” he added.
The CM expressed hope that the survey would be a huge leap forward towards evidence-based planning and policy making in this remote region of Pakistan.
The GBCLS Report will help decision makers to formulate well informed policies to eliminate the menace of child labour in its core form the consequences of economic exploitation of children on their educational, health, mental health and social well-being. It’s our national duty to protect the fundamental rights of a child, enshrined in the United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child, which Pakistan has ratified in 1990.
The GBCLS report shows that the child labour prevalence in the province stands at 13.1 percent, with 1 in 7 children is working. Thus, an estimated 50,000 children in GB are involved in child labour. The data reveals that many children work in hazardous conditions and are almost twice as likely to report mental health problems.
The Survey also highlights that almost 30 per cent of children aged 5-17 in GB, do not attend school. Amongst those who attend, there is gender disparity with 88 percent boys and 77 percent girls.
“Every child has the right to be protected from harm, exploitation and abuse,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “Children should be provided access to learning opportunities – as opposed to being forced to engage in exploitative economic activities - to live with dignity and reach their full potential. This target can only be achieved if no child is left behind – no matter how difficult and challenging the circumstances.”
“The commitment shown by the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan, in particular, Planning & Development Department GB, in conducting the Child Labour Survey and being the first to launch the Report, is highly commendable. UNICEF is committed to support the Government in identifying, addressing and resolving issues related to child rights,” she added.
Besides providing key data about the status of children in the province, the GBCLS also suggests policy recommendations.
The Report recommends that since child labour is a complex issue, it is imperative to adapt a coordinated policy response, focusing education, social protection, labour markets, and legal standards and regulations.
It highlights that around 14.8 percent of students are neither in school nor working. These children are particularly vulnerable to becoming engaged in child labour. The Report suggests that it is important to understand why these children do not attend school, especially as schools in public sector are providing free of cost education in GB.
The survey responses also suggest that parents of those not in school often perceive school to be inaccessible and expensive. Therefore, informing people of the value of education and facilities provided by the government may help ensure that these children get enrolled and remain in school.
UNICEF has been providing technical assistance to all provincial and territorial governments since 2016 to ensure that child labour survey is conducted using an international methodology through a fully digital platform ensuring accountability, transparency, and quality.

Inter Provincial Ministerial Group vows to enhance women’s representation and participation across party lines and strengthen the functioning of provincial commissions
Karachi – 26 October, 2021: The 18th Meeting of the Inter Provincial Ministerial Group (IPMG) was hosted by the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW), Sindh Commission on the Status of Women (SCSW) and UN Women Pakistan in Karachi today. Representatives from Federal Ministry of Human Rights (MoHR), Women Development Departments (WDDs), provincial commissions and parliamentary bodies on women development came together to strategize on collective efforts in strengthening coordination mechanisms, data collection and analysis and dispensing timely justice to survivors of gender-based violence.
The IPMG is the only inter provincial coordination forum having the potential and effectiveness for supporting the women’s empowerment and gender equality agenda through sharing of experiences, fostering peer learning, and developing strategies to fulfil the country’s national and international commitments. The group is structured to ensure representation of Ministers and Secretaries of Women Development Departments from four provinces, Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and the Chairpersons of National and Provincial Commissions on the Status of Women.
Chairperson NCSW, Ms. Nilofar Bakhtiar, said, “We need to strengthen women’s representation and participation across party lines and provincial commissions. The National Commission on the Status of Women is fully committed and determined to unite and work with the Government and women’s machinery across the country to bring about positive change in the situation of women and girls in Pakistan.”
Ms. Nuzhat Shirin, Chairperson, Sindh Commission on the Status of Women (SCSW), in her opening remarks said, “Sindh has been at the forefront of progressive laws and policies especially for women. For this purpose, it is vital that the bureaucracy and different departments working for women, unite.”
The representatives called for concerted actions towards implementing the provisions in the Constitution of Pakistan and CEDAW focusing on ensuring women’s voice, visibility and agency through efforts at the national and provincial levels.
Ms. Sharmeela Rassool, Country Representative of UN Women Pakistan highlighted the need for engaging the whole population in order to boost economic growth and sustainable development. She added, “We need accelerated and focused efforts to uplift women of Pakistan. Engaging 50% of the population to its fullest potential is no longer an option – it’s an imperative.”
Mr. Muhammed Hassan Mangi, MoHR, encouraged the women machineries at the federal and provincial levels to support the data collection for Pakistan’s international reporting commitments.
All the provincial departments and commissions shared information on the progress achieved during the year 2021 and updated the participants on future plans with a view to enhancing coordination and collaboration among the women machineries of the country.
In the closing session, the Secretary of the NCSW, Mr. Arif Baloch, said, “The strategic plan developed by the NCSW is the result of consultation with all the provincial and national stakeholders and machinery. The way-forward for all stakeholders is to focus on improving the status of women in Pakistan and use the platforms and forums such as these for coordinated efforts.”
The forum agreed to form a national level committee to combat violence against women and give a loud and clear message during the upcoming 16 days of activism campaign.

Japan provides equipment worth USD 6.59 million for Pakistan’s COVID19 response
UNICEF procured equipment to strengthen cold chain optimization for vaccine storage
Islamabad: October 20, 2021 – Cold chain optimization equipment worth USD 6.59 million funded by the Government of Japan and procured through the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for enhancing national capacity to store COVID-19 vaccines, was handed over to the Government of Pakistan, here today.
The Parliamentary Secretary on Health, Dr. Nausheen Hamid received the cold chain equipment from the Ambassador of Japan, H.E. Mr. MATSUDA Kuninori, in presence of the UNICEF Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Aida Girma, at a ceremony held in the National Emergency Operation Centre, Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI).
“We greatly value the significant contributions made by Japan during the last 70 years of its diplomatic relations with Pakistan,” said Dr. Nausheen Hamid. “Over the years, our two countries have partnered in various sectors including health, education, power and many other. I affirm our strong desire to further deepen and broaden our bilateral ties with Japan.”
“The Expanded Programme for Immunization in Pakistan has a strong cold chain system that is considered the backbone of the programme as it handles and stores massive quantities of vaccines inclusive of all kinds of COVID-19 vaccines. It is, however, important to know that the cold chain system can be risky in countries which have extreme temperatures and the power supply is unreliable. I am grateful to the Government of Japan for providing this cold chain optimization equipment for vaccine storage and ensuring quality check as it would definitely strengthen our existing system,” she added.
The equipment procured through funds from Japan, include power generators, voltage regulators and temperature monitoring devices which will enhance vaccine storage capacity of EPI, especially at provincial and district level where power outage and voltage fluctuation is frequent. The new equipment would help to ensure optimum temperature control at storage facilities thus maintaining the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Japanese funds will also be used for strengthening the capacity of health care staff to handle the cold chain equipment.
Japan has extended a total of $23.5 million grant assistance to Pakistan for its counter-COVID19 measures including provision of hygiene items, medical equipment, and training of health care staff.
Speaking at the event, Ambassador MATSUDA stressed that Japan has prioritized the health sector as part of its development cooperation policy for Pakistan for decades, including Maternal & Child Health, Polio Eradication, Routine Immunization and Counter-COVID-19 measures. He expressed his hope to open a new area of cooperation in the future partnership between Japan and Pakistan in the health sector, suggesting that tackling diabetes could be one of the candidates.
“I am looking forward to seeing a new chapter added to the friendship between Japan and Pakistan on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries next year,” the ambassador said.
As part of COVID-19 pandemic response UNICEF has been assisting the Government of Pakistan in procuring COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility. It has also procured cold chain, laboratory and personal protective equipment and handed over to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination.
“Today’s ceremony reinforces the high level and longstanding support of the Government of Japan to UNICEF in its efforts to procure vaccines and essential equipment for strengthening immunization services in Pakistan,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan.
“May it be routine immunization or the large-scale COVID-19 vaccination drive, storage of vaccines at optimum temperature is essential to maintain their efficacy and effectiveness. The cold chain support equipment being handed over to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination today, will help in making vaccines available to people across the country, especially the marginalised and those living in hard to reach areas,” Ms. Girma said.

The future of 800 million children across Asia at risk as their education has been severely affected by
the COVID-19 pandemic
At least 27 million students in the region were not able to attend any in-school education since the beginning of the pandemic.
BANGKOK/KATHMANDU, 19 October 2021 — The education of more than 800 million children – 400 million in South Asia, 260 million in East Asia and 140 million in Southeast Asia – across Asia has been disrupted due to school closures since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, and of that number, more than 27 million children have been waiting for more than a year to return to their classrooms, according to the report, ‘Situation Analysis on the Effects and Responses to COVID-19 on the Education Sector in Asia’ (hereafter ‘Report’ or ‘SitAn Report’), released today by UNICEF and UNESCO.
The Report highlights the continued impact of the pandemic on children’s education and features various regional government’s programmes and initiatives to respond to it. At a time of the year when children traditionally should have returned to school from annual holidays, the report urges governments to reopen schools as soon as it is safe to do so.
Responding to the advent and spread of the pandemic in 2020, schools in Asia were fully closed on average for 50 per cent of teaching days. In some countries, for example the Philippines schools have been closed throughout the entire pandemic to date, leaving an estimated 27 million students in pre-primary to secondary education without any in-person learning, a continuous period running from early 2020 to the present for over a year and counting. In Bangladesh, schools have been closed throughout the entire pandemic until 12 September, when they reopened again.
Even now, as the world enters the last quarter of 2021, many children are facing an unprecedented second year of school closures as new variants of the coronavirus spread across the region. The associated consequences of such continuous school closures are staggering and include learning loss; mental distress; missed school meals and routine vaccinations; heightened risk of drop out of structured education; increased, child labour; and increased child marriage. Many of these dire consequences are already affecting countless children, and many will continue to be felt in the years to come.
“We cannot overlook the impact that the disruption of education services has had on children, particularly the most vulnerable. When schools remain closed, children miss out on the biggest opportunity to learn and develop to their full potential. The future of an entire generation is at stake; therefore, we need every effort to ensure a safe reopening of schools as soon as possible. Otherwise, the learning loss will be difficult to overcome,” stated Marcoluigi Corsi, UNICEF Regional Director a.i. for East Asia and Pacific.
While countries across Asia are taking actions to provide students with distance learning, at least 28 per cent, or 220 million pre-primary to upper secondary students in the region, are not being reached. In addition to the lack of material assets and support to access technology, other significant obstacles that prevent disadvantaged children, and many girls, from accessing distance learning during these difficult times include a generally poor learning environment, an increase in pressure to take up domestic household chores and being forced to work outside the home.
This is why the report underscores the importance of delivering equitable and inclusive distance learning at scale to reach all children during full or partial school closures, while providing a package of support to ensure children’s health, nutrition and wellbeing. It also calls on governments and partners to strengthen teaching and teacher support, so as to address current low levels of learning and help narrow the learning divide, and protect and preserve education funding.
Unless mitigation measures are swiftly implemented, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates an economic loss of USD $1.25 trillion for Asia, which is equivalent to 5.4 per cent of the region’s 2020 gross domestic product (GDP). Existing evidence shows that the cost of addressing learning gaps are lower and more effective when they are tackled early on in a crisis, and that ongoing investments made in education will support economic recovery, growth and prosperity.
“Governments, partners and the private sector will need to work together, not only to get the strategies and levels of investment right, but to build more resilient, effective and inclusive systems that are able to deliver on the promise of education as a fundamental human right for all children, whether schools are open or closed,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia.
Estimates indicate that 7 million schoolchildren in Asia are at risk of dropping out of school due to the pandemic – reversing progress made in school enrolment in recent decades. According to the Report, education budgets in the region will need to increase by an average of 10 per cent to catch up with such losses if Asia is to reach the education targets of the UN 2030 Agenda’s Sustainable Development Goals in the next nine years.
“While major efforts are needed to mitigate the learning loss of those children who return to school in the post-COVID-19 recovery phase, we must also remember that 128 million children in Asia were already out of school at the onset of the pandemic; this figure represents roughly half of all out-of-school children globally. This is a learning crisis which needs to be addressed,” said Shigeru Aoyagi, Director of UNESCO Bangkok.
Since the start of the pandemic, UNICEF and UNESCO have supported national governments to maintain and improve interventions to ensure continuity of children’s learning and to safely reopen and operate schools.
UNICEF and UNESCO would like to acknowledge the generous financial contribution of the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), without which this SitAn would not have been possible.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
Message on the International Day
for the Eradication of Poverty
17 October 2021
Poverty is a moral indictment of our times.
For the first time in two decades, extreme poverty is on the rise.
Last year, around 120 million people fell into poverty as the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on economies and societies.
A lopsided recovery is further deepening inequalities between the Global North and South.  Solidarity is missing in action – just when we need it most.
For example, vaccine inequality is allowing variants to develop and run wild, condemning the world to millions more deaths, and prolonging an economic slowdown that could cost trillions of dollars.  We must end this outrage, tackle debt distress and ensure recovery investment in countries with the greatest need.
On this International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, we commit to ‘Building Forward Better’. This requires a three-pronged approach to global recovery:
First, the recovery must be transformative – because we cannot go back to the endemic structural disadvantages and inequalities that perpetuated poverty even before the pandemic. We need stronger political will and partnerships to achieve universal social protection by 2030 and invest in job re-skilling for the growing green economy. And we must invest in quality jobs in the care economy, which will promote greater equality and ensure everyone receives the dignified care they deserve.
Second, the recovery must be inclusive – because an uneven recovery is leaving much of humanity behind, increasing the vulnerability of already marginalized groups, and pushing the Sustainable Development Goals ever further out of reach.
The number of women in extreme poverty far outpaces that of men. Even before the pandemic, the 22 richest men in the world had more wealth than all the women in Africa – and that gap has only grown. We cannot recover with only half our potential. Economic investments must target women entrepreneurs, provide greater formalization of the informal sector, focus on education, social protection, universal childcare, health care and decent work, as well as bridge the digital divide including its deep gender dimension.
Third, the recovery must be sustainable – because we need to build a resilient, decarbonized and net-zero world.
Through it all, we need to listen far more to the views and guidance of people living in poverty, address indignities and dismantle barriers to inclusion in every society.
Today and every day, let us join hands to end poverty and create a world of justice, dignity and opportunity for all.

FACT SHEET: On Global Handwashing Day, UNICEF warns that 3 in 10 people do not have basic handwashing facilities at home to fight off infectious diseases
NEW YORK, 15 October 2021 – Although handwashing with soap is critical in the fight against infectious diseases, including COVID-19, globally, around 3 in 10 people – or 2.3 billion – do not have handwashing facilities with water and soap available at home. The situation is worst in the least developed countries, with over 6 in 10 people without access to basic hand hygiene, UNICEF warned on Global Handwashing Day.
“Global response efforts to the pandemic have created an unprecedented time for hand hygiene. Yet progress remains far too slow for the most vulnerable, underserved communities,” said UNICEF WASH Director Kelly Ann Naylor. “Hand hygiene cannot be viewed as a temporary provision to manage COVID-19. Further long-term investment in water, sanitation and hygiene can help prevent the next health crisis from coming. It also means fewer people falling ill with respiratory infections, fewer children dying from diarrheal diseases, and more pregnant mothers and newborns protected from preventable conditions like sepsis.”
The latest data show that some progress has been achieved since 2015. For example, the global population with access to basic hand hygiene at home has increased from 5 billion to 5.5 billion, or from 67 per cent to 71 per cent. However, if current trends persist, 1.9 billion people will still not have access to basic hand hygiene by the end of the decade.
According to the latest estimates:
·        Globally, 3 in 10 people – or 2.3 billion – do not have access to basic handwashing facilities with water and soap at home, including 670 million people without any facility at all. In the least developed countries, more than 6 in 10 people lack basic hand hygiene facilities at home.
·        2 in 5 schools worldwide do not have basic hygiene services with water and soap, affecting 818 million students, of which 462 million attend schools with no facility at all. In the least developed countries, 7 out of 10 schools have no place for children to wash their hands.
·        1 in 3 healthcare facilities worldwide does not have hand hygiene facilities at points of care where the patient, healthcare worker, and treatment involve contact with the patient.
·        The cost to provide hand hygiene in all homes in 46 of the world’s least-developed countries by 2030 is an estimated US$11 billion*. The cost to governments for hygiene promotion are estimated to be equal to 25 cents per capita per year.
Deep inequalities exist across and within countries regarding access and progress, with the most vulnerable children and families suffering the most. Moreover, in fragile, conflict-affected, and refugee settings, progress is especially slow:
·        In fragile contexts, 1 in 5 people do not have any hand hygiene facility at home.
·        In 8 out of 20 countries for which UNHCR has data, more than 30 per cent of refugee households do not have access to soap.
·        Globally, current progress rates must quadruple to reach universal hygiene by 2030. In the least developed countries, the rate of progress would need to increase ten-fold, and in fragile contexts, it would need to accelerate by a factor of 23.
UNICEF urges governments to commit to providing hand hygiene, not as a temporary response to the pandemic, but as an investment in public health and economic resilience. The latest joint UNICEF and WHO report identifies five accelerators that can enable governments to rapidly scale up access to hand hygiene, including good governance, smart public finance, capacity building, consistent data, and innovation.
#####

Notes to Editors:
* This estimate assumes that households would bear the cost of installing handwashing facilities and the cost associated with purchasing water and soap. Governments would bear the cost of hygiene promotion, both initial and ‘top-up’.

UNDP and Coca-Cola Foundation partner to #StopTheSpread
Islamabad, 15th October 2021—United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Coca-Cola Foundation (TCCF) have designed a #StopTheSpread of COVID-19 project to increase awareness about Covid vaccinations. The $20 million TCCF’s global support under #StoptheSpread initiative will work with nonprofit organizations in response to the pandemic.
Commenting on the initiative, Ms Saadia Madsbjerg, President of TCCF, said, “We are proud to use our resources to fund initiatives to help curb the spread of COVID-19 around the world, including this grant to support the important work of UNDP Pakistan”.
The signing agreement for the project was announced yesterday at UNDP’s Islamabad Head Quarters. Ms Laura Sheridan, Programme Manager, Youth Empowerment Programme at UNDP said, “We have worked together with TCCF to design the project on international best practices. We are aiming to impact thousands of people by the end of this campaign to not just get vaccinated but also actively guide others to follow the NCOC registration process till the point citizens have their vaccination certificates.”
To reduce exposure of participants, the event was live streamed with leading behavioural change scientists, digital media specialists, journalists and health experts who participated in a discussion on how to meet the pandemics fast-changing landscape.
The #StopTheSpread project will involve training of youth volunteers facilitation of local hospitals to conduct mobile vaccination drives as well as coordination with the Government for vaccination registration drives for greater vaccine coverage in Pakistan, particularly in areas with little access to medical support. Close to 3,000 young healthcare workers will be trained on effective vaccine administration and side effects management.
The project also includes distribution of personal protective equipment for health care workers and volunteers. It a will also engage at least 2 million people digitally with support from Google Ads and social media marketing for greater impact.

PRESS RELEASE
UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Omar Abdi ends trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan, urges greater action to address children’s needs
UNICEF calls for upholding the rights of every girl and boy to quality health care, nutrition, education and protection
ISLAMABAD, 10 October 2021 – At the end of a four-day visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Omar Abdi stressed the need for greater action to meet the increasing needs of children in both countries.
In Pakistan, Mr. Abdi visited a number of projects as part of the cooperation between UNICEF and the government.  Abdi, who had served as UNICEF Representative in Pakistan from 2003 to 2006, visited a school, a COVID-19 and polio call centre as well as the National Emergency Operation Center in Islamabad, alongside Laryea-Adjei and UNICEF Pakistan Representative Aida Girma.
At Islamabad Model School for Girls, he met with students and teachers who use an innovative mix of digital and traditional learning to teach children.
Currently, 80 blended learning classrooms are being established in public schools in Islamabad. The lessons and activities are provided offline, using a portable device provided to all schools. This is part of a pilot by the Government of Pakistan to assist students and teachers with additional material for learning and teaching.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on children’s learning, with girls especially at risk. Many students were left grappling with the realities of remote learning without the right tools.
“I commend the Government of Pakistan for reopening schools across the country safely and prioritizing the vaccination of teachers, 97 per cent of whom are now vaccinated,” Abdi said. “The Ministry of Education has adopted efficient measures to promote digital learning with UNICEF support, but in-person learning remains key.”
Abdi also visited a Government warehouse using ultracold chain equipment procured by UNICEF to store Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. The global COVAX facility has delivered more than 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Pakistan. More are expected in the coming weeks. So far, Pakistan has administered nearly 90 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, with 32 million people now fully vaccinated. “This is a testament to the excellent coordination system put in place by the authorities at the highest levels of government,” Abdi said.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in the world where polio remains endemic. Abdi met with partners at a COVID-19 and polio call center to promote vaccination.
“We appreciate Pakistan’s efforts to fight polio and provide safe access to polio vaccination teams across the country,” Abdi said. “We welcome the decrease in the number of polio cases. However, these gains are fragile, and we must continue vaccinating every child to end this crippling and fatal disease for good.”
Earlier, arriving in Afghanistan amid an escalating health and nutrition crisis for children, Abdi visited the Indira Gandhi Children’s hospital in Kabul alongside UNICEF Regional Director George Laryea-Adjei and UNICEF Afghanistan Representative Hervé Ludovic de Lys. In the nutrition ward, he met dozens of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening condition. Without immediate action, an estimated 1 million children in Afghanistan are projected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition in 2021 and could die. Severe outbreaks of measles and acute watery diarrhoea have further exacerbated the situation, putting more children at risk.
During his meetings with the de facto authorities in Kabul, Abdi highlighted children’s need to access basic health care, immunization, nutrition, water and sanitation, and child protection services. He called for polio, measles and COVID immunization campaigns to resume immediately to help protect children and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases.
Abdi also stressed the critical importance of ensuring all boys and girls are allowed to continue their education at all levels and participate meaningfully in building the future of their country.
“UNICEF will continue to press for the rights of every girl, boy and woman in Afghanistan. Our objective is to see an Afghanistan where every girl and every boy are in school, have quality health care, and are protected from all forms of violence,” Abdi said. “The de facto authorities, UN member states, donors and humanitarian organizations must act together immediately to prevent the humanitarian crisis from deteriorating further, in the interest of children’s survival in Afghanistan.”

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD POST DAY 2021
9 October 2021
On World Post Day, we recognize the invaluable contributions of postal workers to our societies and economies. The vast postal network – involving millions of workers moving billions of pieces of mail through hundreds of thousands of post offices – is woven into our societies, connecting communities the world over.
As we continue to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, the resilience and commitment of these essential workers are an inspiration. We owe them our gratitude.
The theme for this year’s World Post Day – “Innovate to recover” – highlights how the postal sector is adapting to new realities and redefining itself, taking on new roles founded on digitalization, e-commerce and financial services.
“Innovate to recover” invites everyone in the international postal sector to embrace creative change and leverage technology as we together look to build forward better from the pandemic.
I congratulate the Universal Postal Union and the international postal sector for your tireless efforts delivering mail, providing essential services, enabling trade, and promoting literacy. The United Nations looks forward to advancing our partnership in the service of sustainable development and a better world for all.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
message on World Mental Health Day 2021
10 October 2021
Around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is taking a terrible toll on people’s mental health.
Millions of people face grief over lost family members and friends. Many more are anxious over unemployment and fearful of the future. Older people may experience isolation and loneliness, while children and adolescents may feel alienated and distressed.
Without determined action, the mental health impact may last far longer than the pandemic itself.
We must act to redress the glaring inequalities exposed by the pandemic – including the inequality in access to mental health services.
In high-income countries, over 75 percent of people with depression report that they do not receive adequate care.
And in low- and middle-income countries, over 75 percent of people with mental health conditions receive no treatment at all.
This is the direct consequence of chronic under-investment, as governments spend an average of just over 2 percent of their health budgets on mental health.
This is unacceptable.
At long last, we are beginning to see recognition that there can be no health without mental health.
Member States have endorsed the World Health Organization’s updated Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan.
The United Nations family, together with partners across the global mental health community, are introducing new guidelines and developing new tools to improve mental health.
These are positive steps – but we have a long way to go.
On World Mental Health Day and every day, let us commit to work together with urgency and purpose to ensure quality mental health care for all people, everywhere.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE GIRL
11 October 2021
The strength, health and empowerment of the world’s girls is a matter for every single day of the year. The International Day of the Girl is an opportunity to recommit to this global imperative.
Today’s girls are part of a digital generation. It is our responsibility to join with them in all their diversity, amplify their power and solutions as digital change-makers, and address the obstacles they face in the digital space.
The path to girls’ digital equality is steep. A massive gap in internet use spanning geographies and generations has grown from 11 per cent in 2013 to 17 per cent six years later. In more than two thirds of all countries, girls make up only 15 percent of graduates in STEM subjects – science, technology, engineering and math.
Girls have equal ability and immense potential in these fields, and when we empower them, everyone benefits. I saw this long before I began my political career, when I was a teacher in Lisbon and witnessed the power of education to uplift individuals and communities. That experience has guided my vision for gender equality in education ever since.
Investments in closing the digital gender divide yield huge dividends for all. The United Nations is committed to working with girls so that this generation, whoever they are and whatever their circumstances, can fulfil their potential. The Generation Equality Action Coalition on Technology and Innovation is our new platform, where governments, civil society, the private sector and young leaders are coming together around collective initiatives and investments to support girls’ digital access, skills and creativity.
Together, let us ensure that girls play their full part in the digital generation to design and secure our common future.

Celebration of World Habitat Day 2021
Accelerating urban action for a carbon free world
UN-Habitat Pakistan organized a seminar to kick start celebration of  Urban October activities– World Habitat Day on 4th October 2021 in collaboration with the Ministry of Climate Change, Water and Sanitation Agency, National Disaster Risk Management Authority, Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources, Shehersaaz and TMA Nowshera. The event was organized to discuss and reflect on the increasing effects of climate-related disasters. Extreme climatic events are disproportionately affecting poor, rural populations who are usually the least prepared to cope with them.
The event commenced with a message from Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General and Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director UN-Habitat in which it was highlighted that cities and towns contribute to 70% of greenhouse gas emissions, a result of which are the devastating floods, droughts and violent storms. There was stress on the importance of putting climate action at the top of our agenda and to change how we generate power, mode of transport, dependence on fossil fuels and the need to work towards energy efficient infrastructure to encourage walking and cycling. Lastly, the benefits of a green transition were pointed out especially for the most vulnerable communities and the need to unite and work together to ensure all climate goals are met.
Mr. Jawed Ali Khan, UN-Habitat Programme Manager, Pakistan reiterated the need of the hour: to take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas production from ever expanding urban centers and for the natural and built environment to move in parallel in order to achieve our climate goals. He added that UN Habitat Pakistan has launched a project on Climate Change adaptation in Pakistan to enhance capacity of government and communities to deal with the impacts of floods and droughts. This project is important and is a curtain raiser for adaptation activities and will be instrumental in building climate change-related resilience in Rawalpindi and Nowshera districts.
The discussions in the seminar were centered around how cities can be made more resilient through implementation of climate targeted actions such as, planning for more compact and walkable cities, support in enhancing national building codes, sustainable building and construction practices, promoting clean energy generation in cities, improving waste management and provision of water and sanitation for a carbon free world.
Partners engaged in productive deliberations on how to mitigate the impacts of floods and droughts through innovation and new technology. There was great focus on ground water recharge instead of surface water storage which has been the primary focus previously. This would cater to water scarcity and provide longer-term benefits to the most vulnerable communities. Additionally, the technology that would enable groundwater recharge will be solar powered, making it energy efficient and helping to reduce the carbon footprint.
UN Habitat, Pakistan will also organize following events to celebrate Urban October
· Dedicated Session in Innovate 4 Cities (I4C) 2021 Conference  with the objective to demonstrate the importance of GHG emission reduction in urban areas
· Seminar on Housing Challenges in Pakistan and Lessons Learnt from Success Stories of Korea and other Countries is to bring home the rich experiences and the lessons learnt from the successful interventions in the housing construction sector from Korea and other parts of the world to reinforce the Five Million Housing Program.

PRESS RELEASE
Impact of COVID-19 on poor mental health in children and young people ‘tip of the iceberg’ – UNICEF
New analysis indicates lost contribution to economies due to mental disorders among young people estimated at nearly $390 billion a year
Multimedia content available to download here
NEW YORK, 5 October 2021 – Children and young people could feel the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health and well-being for many years to come, UNICEF warned in its flagship report today.
According to The State of the World’s Children 2021; On My Mind: promoting, protecting and caring for children’s mental health – UNICEF’s most comprehensive look at the mental health of children, adolescents and caregivers in the 21st century – even before COVID-19, children and young people carried the burden of mental health conditions without significant investment in addressing them.
According to the latest available estimates, more than 1 in 7 adolescents aged 10–19 is estimated to live with a diagnosed mental disorder globally. Almost 46,000 adolescents die from suicide each year, among the top five causes of death for their age group. Meanwhile, wide gaps persist between mental health needs and mental health funding. The report finds that about 2 per cent of government health budgets are allocated to mental health spending globally.
“It has been a long, long 18 months for all of us – especially children. With nationwide lockdowns and pandemic-related movement restrictions, children have spent indelible years of their lives away from family, friends, classrooms, play – key elements of childhood itself,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “The impact is significant, and it is just the tip of the iceberg. Even before the pandemic, far too many children were burdened under the weight of unaddressed mental health issues. Too little investment is being made by governments to address these critical needs. Not enough importance is being placed on the relationship between mental health and future life outcomes.”
Children’s mental health during COVID-19
Indeed, the pandemic has taken its toll. According to early findings from an international survey of children and adults in 21 countries conducted by UNICEF and Gallup – which is previewed in The State of the World’s Children 2021 – a median of 1 in 5 young people aged 15–24 surveyed said they often feel depressed or have little interest in doing things.
As COVID-19 heads into its third year, the impact on children and young people’s mental health and well-being continues to weigh heavily. According to the latest available data from UNICEF, globally, at least 1 in 7 children has been directly affected by lockdowns, while more than 1.6 billion children have suffered some loss of education. The disruption to routines, education, recreation, as well as concern for family income and health, is leaving many young people feeling afraid, angry, and concerned for their future. For example, an online survey in China in early 2020, cited in The State of the World’s Children, indicated that around a third of respondents reported feeling scared or anxious.
Cost to society
Diagnosed mental disorders, including ADHD, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, depression, eating disorders, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia, can significantly harm children and young people’s health, education, life outcomes, and earning capacity.
While the impact on children’s lives is incalculable, a new analysis by the London School of Economics in the report indicates that lost contribution to economies due to mental disorders that lead to disability or death among young people is estimated at nearly $390 billion a year.
Protective factors
The report notes that a mix of genetics, experience and environmental factors from the earliest days, including parenting, schooling, quality of relationships, exposure to violence or abuse, discrimination, poverty, humanitarian crises, and health emergencies such as COVID-19, all shape and effect children’s mental health throughout their lifetime.
While protective factors, such as loving caregivers, safe school environments, and positive peer relationships can help reduce the risk of mental disorders, the report warns that significant barriers, including stigma and lack of funding, are preventing too many children from experiencing positive mental health or accessing the support they need.
The State of the World’s Children 2021 calls on governments, and public and private sector partners, to commit, communicate and act to promote mental health for all children, adolescents and caregivers, protect those in need of help, and care for the most vulnerable, including:
· Urgent investment in child and adolescent mental health across sectors, not just in health, to support a whole-of-society approach to prevention, promotion and care.
· Integrating and scaling up evidence-based interventions across health, education and social protection sectors - including parenting programmes that promote responsive, nurturing caregiving and support parent and caregiver mental health; and ensuring schools support mental health through quality services and positive relationships.
· Breaking the silence surrounding mental illness, through addressing stigma and promoting better understanding of mental health and taking seriously the experiences of children and young people.
“Mental health is a part of physical health - we cannot afford to continue to view it as otherwise,” said Fore. “For far too long, in rich and poor countries alike, we have seen too little understanding and too little investment in a critical element of maximizing every child’s potential. This needs to change.”
###
Notes to Editors
Estimates on causes of death among adolescents are based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) 2019 Global Health Estimates. Estimates on prevalence of diagnosed mental disorders are based on the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation’s (IHME) 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study.
Survey findings on feelings of depression or having little interest in doing things are part of a larger study conducted jointly between UNICEF and Gallup to explore the intergenerational divide. The Changing Childhood Project interviewed approximately 20,000 people by telephone in 21 countries. All samples are probability-based and nationally representative of two distinct populations in each country: people aged 15-24 and people aged 40 and older. The coverage area is the entire country, including rural areas, and the sampling frame represents the entire civilian, non-institutionalized, population within each age cohort with access to a telephone. The full findings of the project will be released by UNICEF in November.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF NON-VIOLENCE
2 October 2021
It is no coincidence that we mark the International Day of Non-Violence on the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi.
For Gandhi, non-violence, peaceful protest, dignity and equality were more than words.  They represented a guiding light for humanity, a map to a better future.
They also provide a template to address today’s troubled times.  Conflicts and climate change. Poverty and inequalities.  Mistrust and divisions.  All under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to devastate people and economies alike.
The solution to these challenges is in our hands: solidarity.  We need to recognize, as Gandhi did, that what unites us is far greater than what divides us.  That peace provides the only pathway to a better future for all.
Addressing the challenges of our world means coming together as one human family, and embracing peace like never before.
We call on combatants around the world to lay down their arms and focus on defeating humanity’s common enemy — COVID-19 — not one another.  We urgently need to deliver lifesaving vaccines and treatment, and support countries in the long road to recovery ahead.
We need to intensify our work to reduce inequalities and end poverty.
We need a bold global plan of action to heal our planet.
Most of all, we need to renew trust in one another.  Hatred, division, conflict and mistrust have had their day.  It is time to usher in a new era of peace, trust and tolerance.
On this International Day of Non-Violence, let us heed Gandhi’s message of peace, and get down to the business of building a better and more peaceful future for all.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD HABITAT DAY 2021
4 October 2021
On this World Habitat Day, cities and towns across the globe are facing – and fighting – the dual crises of COVID-19 and climate change. Home to 4.5 billion people today, they are projected to grow by almost 50 per cent by 2050.
By mid-century, over 1.6 billion urban residents may have to survive through average summertime highs of 35 degrees Celsius.
This year’s theme – ‘Accelerating Urban Action for a Carbon-Free World’ – highlights how cities and towns are at the core of climate action to keep the 1.5 degrees goal within reach.
Three-quarters of the infrastructure that will exist in 2050 has yet to be built. Economic recovery plans offer a generational opportunity to put climate action, renewable energy, and sustainable development at the heart of cities’ strategies and policies.
City leadership in using green materials and constructing energy-efficient, resilient buildings powered by renewable energy is essential to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The benefits are enormous: less pollution and climate risk, more jobs, and better health and well-being.
As populations grow in emerging economies, demand for transport, which accounts for nearly 20 per cent of global carbon emissions, is multiplying. Cities are working to ensure that this demand is met by zero-emission vehicles and public transit. We need a global moratorium on internal combustion engines by 2040 at the latest to underpin these efforts.
On World Habitat Day, let us work together to harness the transformative potential of sustainable urban action for the benefit of our planet and all people.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF OLDER PERSONS
1 October 2021
Staying connected with loved ones. Attending a religious service. Taking a stance. All of these actions and many more are increasingly carried out online, especially as individuals and communities grapple with restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we face the challenge of navigating our world’s growing reliance on technology, perhaps no population could benefit more from support than older persons.
“Digital Equity for all Ages,” the theme of this year’s International Day of Older Persons, offers an important chance to expand opportunities across generations for the benefit of society as a whole.
Older persons have often been left more isolated during the pandemic. They are also at greater risk of suffering from the rising threat of cybercrime. While taking all possible measures to hold to account those unscrupulous criminals preying on older persons, we must also work to strengthen the digital skills of the older persons as an important defence and means to improve their well-being.
Older persons are far more than a vulnerable group; they are a source of knowledge, experience and rich contributions to our collective progress. When older persons can access, learn and use new technology, they will be better equipped to contribute to reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), our universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy health, peace and prosperity.
On this year’s International Day of Older Persons, I call for more inclusive policies, strategies and actions to achieve digital equity for people of all ages.

The climate crisis is a code red for humanity.
It is already devastating lives and livelihoods.
As usual, the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit.
The window of opportunity to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis is closing quickly. We know what needs to be done and we have the tools to do it.
Young people have been in the forefront of putting forward positive solutions, advocating for climate justice and holding leaders to account.
We need young people everywhere to keep raising your voices.
For a breakthrough in building resilience and ensuring that at least 50 per cent of climate support is for adaptation to protect lives and livelihoods.
For developed countries to finally deliver on their promise of $100 billion dollars a year in climate finance to the developing world.
For more governments, businesses and investors to reduce their emissions in line with the 1.5  degree goal of the Paris Agreement. This means that they must commit to net-zero by mid-century, with ambitious 2030 targets, and clear plans to achieve them.
For ramping up climate education, green jobs, and fair and inclusive economic growth, leaving no-one behind.
I thank the Government of Italy for providing this global stage for young people to engage directly with policy-makers.
And I thank the more than 400 young people for contributing your ideas and solutions in advance of COP26.
Your solidarity and demands for action set a powerful example.
We need national leaders to follow your example and ensure the ambition and results we need at COP26 and beyond.
Thank you.

UNHCR - PRESS RELEASE : Afghan doctor in Pakistan wins the regional Nansen Refugee Award
Afghan doctor in Pakistan wins the regional Nansen Refugee Award
Islamabad, 29 September 2021 – UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency is pleased to announce Dr. Saleema Rehman as this year’s regional winner of the Nansen Refugee Award in the Asia region. Dr. Rehman is a 29-year-old Afghan refugee doctor, serving local communities and refugees in Pakistan.
UNHCR’s Nansen Refugee Award is given to Dr. Rehman in recognition of her outstanding service and commitment to Pakistanis and refugees in the country. It also acknowledges her contributions as a refugee to Pakistan, particularly the unwavering dedication towards her patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Award further highlights the powerful example that Dr. Rehman has set for other Afghan refugee women and girls.
“Access to education is very important in our lives. Investing in the education of a woman is an investment in a whole next generation,” Rehman said at a ceremony held in her honour at the Swiss Embassy in Islamabad.
The Ambassador of Switzerland, Bénédict de Cerjat, and the Chargée d’affaires of Norway, Elin Kylvåg, in Pakistan presented the Award.
The Swiss Ambassador Bénédict de Cerjat termed her as an inspirational young Afghan woman. “She is a bright example on how valuable it is for the international community to support countries hosting refugees with inclusive policies like Pakistan. Investing in refugees also helps Afghanistan, which is in need of professionals. Women and men, like Dr. Saleema, could contribute to their own country – if it becomes safe to return home. We are committed to help ensure that the next generation of Afghan girls can also fulfil their dreams,” he said.
The Chief Commissioner for Afghan Refugees, Saleem Khan, welcomed Dr. Rehman’s win. “We feel proud of Dr. Rehman. She’s a wonderful example of her community. Pakistan can take pride in producing such a fine doctor – countless young Afghans have benefited from Pakistan’s progressive policies.’’
The UNHCR Representative in Pakistan and other dignitaries representing a range of countries and organizations participated in the ceremony.
Established in 1954, the award named for the late Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian diplomat, scientist, polar explorer and humanitarian who went on to serve as the first High Commissioner for Refugees for the League of Nations and won the 1922 Nobel Peace Prize.
The Nansen Refugee Award is given annually to one or more individuals or an organization for outstanding work on behalf of the forcibly displaced and/or stateless people.
This year, the global winner is the Jeel Albena Association for Humanitarian Development, a relief organization in Yemen. There are also five regional winners, including Dr. Rehman in Asia, as well as regional winners in the Americas, Europe, and Africa.

UN Secretary-General calls for accelerated action on jobs and social protection to avoid an uneven global recovery and prevent future crises
Deeply diverging recoveries will undermine trust and solidarity and make the world more vulnerable to future crises, including climate change
· Secretary-General to convene leaders on 28 September to mobilize action
· New Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection platform launched to create 400 million jobs and extend social protection coverage to 4 billion people currently left unprotected.
New York, 27 September—Investing in job-rich growth, social protection and a just transition to a net-zero emissions future, particularly in low -and middle-income countries, could prevent a further deepening of the inequalities between developed and developing economies that have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, said UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, in a policy brief issued today.
At least US$982 billion in fiscal stimulus measures is needed to respond to the immediate labour market shocks of the crisis and to support a just transition, as well as US$ 1.2 trillion annually for social protection floors in low- and middle-income countries. No advanced economy has achieved economic and social progress without investing in social protection systems and quality public services that provide people with the necessary support to navigate the vicissitudes of their lives.
While the wealth of billionaires increased by over US$ 3.9 trillion between March and December 2020, the impact of the pandemic on the world of work, among other factors, increased the number of extremely poor by between 119 and 224 million people—the first increase in poverty in over 21 years.
· An estimated 8.8 percent of total working hours - equivalent to the hours worked in one year by 255 million full-time workers - were lost in 2020.
· This corresponds to a loss of US$3.3 trillion in labour income before government support.
· Because of the pandemic, there are an estimated 75 million fewer jobs in 2021 than there were before the crisis, and 23 million fewer projected in 2022.
The Secretary-General’s brief calls for urgent investments in a job-rich, sustainable and socially inclusive recovery. The public and private sectors should leverage finance to significantly ramp up such investments to get the world back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and to address ever increasing risks from climate change and environmental degradation that could jeopardize  1.2 billion jobs—equivalent to 40 percent of the global labour force.
A human-centred recovery from the pandemic needs employment and social protection policies to work in tandem, not only to improve people’s living standards, but also to help them navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing world of work and the transition towards the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Accelerating job creation
To achieve a job-rich recovery and a just transition to a sustainable and inclusive economy, the Secretary-General is calling for a Global Accelerator for Jobs and Social Protection that would create at least 400 million jobs and extend social protection to 4 billion women, men and children currently without coverage.
To achieve this Goal, the Policy Brief entitled “Investing in Jobs and Social Protection for Poverty Eradication and a Sustainable Recovery” recommends several actions:
· Develop integrated national and inclusive recovery strategies for decent job creation, especially in the care and green sectors, universal social protection, and a just transition, and ensure they are aligned with macro-economic and fiscal policies and underpinned by sound data.
· Expand investment in Social Protection Floors as a percentage of GDP in national budgets.
· Design policy measures to extend social protection to workers in the informal economy, and to foster the progressive formalization of enterprises and employment, including in the care economy.
· Create active labour market policies to help workers upskill and re-skill to keep or change their job, adapt to the green and digital transitions.
· Develop a sound financial architecture to mobilize investments for decent jobs, social protection, and a just transition, including by channelling SDRs to support national recovery strategies to countries in need.
· Strengthen collaboration with the private sector to scale-up investments in strategic sectors to promote entrepreneurship, effectively reaching women and women-owned enterprises in particular, to close the skills gap
· Align strategies with the Paris Climate Accords, so that they support enterprises and workers, while also ensuring that vulnerable populations are not left behind in the transition to net-zero carbon emissions economies.
High-level Event on Jobs and Social Protection for Poverty Eradication
The UN Secretary-General will present the brief at a virtual high-level meeting at the UN on 28 September 2021, 09.00 -12.00 ET (15.00-18.00 CEST). The meeting is convened jointly with the ILO.
Leaders from countries, along with the heads of major international organizations, multilateral banks and finance institutions, civil society, private sector and academia will discuss pathways

After, a moderated discussion will take place with Heads of the International Financial Institutions, Heads of States and Government and international organizations.

Some 50 participants from civil society, youth, media professionals, academia, international organizations, and diplomatic missions attended the event.
2021 is the sixth consecutive year of UNESCO marking the “International Day for Universal Access to Information” (IDUAI). In 2015, UNESCO adopted a resolution (38 C/70) to commemorate IDUAI every year. Access to Information is considered as the touchstone for all human rights including freedom of expression and media freedom. Its special relevance to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is also significant, in which it calls upon member states to adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information.
The Ambassador of Sweden, H.E. Mr. Henrik Persson gave the welcome marks by recognizing the importance of access to information for building strong institutions. During the keynote address the honourable provincial minister of Balochistan, Mr. Zahoor Ahmed Buledi, stressed upon the need for more proactive disclosure of information by governments to strengthen citizen’s voices, accountability, and transparency.
During the event a panel of expert speakers including Ms. Amber Rahim Shamsi (veteran journalist), Mr. Mukhtar Ahmed (former information commissioner), Ms. Imaan Hazir Mazari (lawyer and human rights activist) and Mr. Zafarullah Khan (former executive director Pakistan Institute of Parliamentary Studies) expressed their opinions on the need to enhance access to information in the country.
UNESCO Officer, Mr. Hamza Khan presented UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay’s message reiterating organization’s commitment to promote access to information and freedom of expression across the globe.
The right of universal access to information empowers citizens to make informed opinions thus strengthening democratic processes and ensuring the protection of fundamental human rights.

Government of Pakistan and UNDP launches Digital Media Development Programme for youth skills development
Islamabad, 25 September 2021—Digital Media Development Programme (DMDP), a flagship initiative of the Government of Pakistan was inaugurated by Digital Media Wing (DMW), Ministry of Information & Broadcasting in partnership with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), yesterday. Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr Imran Khan was the chief guest for the ceremony and formally launched this initiative.
Pakistan’s digital media community has been growing rapidly, with over 100 million internet users, 185 million mobile subscriptions and over 50 million people active on social media. Against this backdrop, DMDP is strategically designed to leverage the digital landscape. This will empower the youth of Pakistan in enhancing their digital skills and gain employment opportunities.
The Digital Media Development Programme will bridge the gap between the students, Government of Pakistan and the digital media industry by training the youth. In the first batch, 100 capable interns will be selected placed at federal ministries and departments for three months to enhance their skills.
The Programme has partnered with the world’s leading social media organizations and digital media industry experts, including YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to give workshops to young Pakistani interns. With UNDP’s support, the students will also get monthly stipends upon successful completion of tasks.
During the internship period, the interns will also be guided to conduct digital media seminars in their respective universities to engage the youth of Pakistan. The interns will also work on a project to address issues such as fake news that Pakistan faces in this particular industry.
Speaking at the event, the Prime Minister Mr. Imran Khan said, “The Pakistani Youth should never underestimate their abilities and set a very high goal for themselves to achieve. You should never give up in the face of failures, and the hurdles are there only to make you stronger. Choose objectives that are bigger than yourself and serve a higher purpose. Further, he said that he is delighted to see this initiative that will involve the youth of Pakistan in furthering Pakistan’s narrative. He stressed the importance of truth and said that those who remain truthful in their life are respected.”
Regarding UNDP’s support to the internship programme, the UNDP Resident Representative Knut Ostby quoted, “UNDP is pleased to support the Government of Pakistan in this effort to empower youth by providing very relevant digital skills and on-the-job training to young men and women in government offices. This kind of professional exposure will be an important step to enhance youth’s future career prospects.”
UNDP, through its Youth Empowerment Programme, has already been providing digital skills trainings, entrepreneurship trainings, internships and employment opportunities to the youth in Pakistan through its various interventions since 2018.
With DMDP, a more collaborative and agile digital ecosystem will be created, where all stakeholders will be working towards a common goal of transforming Pakistan’s digital landscape for the betterment of the country.

Strengthening institutions key to women rights says President Alvi at National Seminar on Protection of Women Against Harassment
Lahore (September 24, 2021): President of Pakistan Dr Arif Alvi lauded the government’s efforts of activating institutions to protect women against harassment and to empower them by rights of ownership and possession of properties.
Addressing a national seminar on protection of women against harassment, the president said it is our religious duty to protect women against harassment and to give them property rights, but unfortunately this protection is not fully accorded in some parts of the country. He, nevertheless, expressed his satisfaction over the establishment and working of the offices of ombudspersons for protection of women and emphasized that society has a role to play for protection of women against harassment.
The mega seminar attended by parliamentarians, members of civil society, academia, youth and private sector entities was organized by UN Women Pakistan in collaboration with Office of the Ombudsperson, Punjab and Bargad Organization for Youth Development.
Governor Punjab Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar said that the government is committed to safeguard rights of women and giving them socio-economic status that they deserve. In this connection, he said that the ombudsperson offices are essential in providing speedy justice and we will continue working to further strengthen effective implementation of the passed laws.
The panelists of the seminar included Ms. Kashmala Tariq, Federal Ombudsperson; Ms. Sabira Islam, Ombudsperson Balochistan; Muhammad Kamran Khan Chief Operating Officer Punjab Safe Cities Authority; Senator Mr. Waleed Iqbal and Member Provincial Assembly Uzma Kardar,  Bushra Butt, Shawana Bashir and Aysha Iqbal amongst others.
Punjab Ombudsperson Nabila Hakim Ali Khan briefed the participants about working of her office in creating an enabling environment and protecting women in Punjab. She added that Office of the Ombudsperson is striving and making strenuous efforts for establishment of Inquiry Committees at all levels and in all types of offices/ workplaces in Punjab. She urged the citizens and stakeholders to access this progressive and legally strong office for grievances of women over harassment and property rights.
Speaking at the seminar, UN Women Country Representative, Ms. Sharmeela Rassooel said that "The Gender Equality and Women Empowerment policy developed with technical support of UN Women is one of the prominent achievements, yet we need to work together along with all our partners for its effective implementation".  Ms. Rassool further added that Gender equality cannot be achieved until women are given equal opportunities to develop and advance professionally, for which harassment-free workplaces are critical.
There were two Interactive sessions were held, first with government stakeholders and CSO, and the second with parliamentarians, to recommend ways to increase ownership of federal and provincial governments and create synergy across stakeholders for effective implementation of the existing law ombudsperson law for women empowerment. The government officials and the Ombudspersons shared their learning on practical issues around the implementation of the law. The panelists also agreed on a roadmap for effective coordination and oversight of the law for anti-harassment measures and the protection of women rights of ownership and possession of properties.

Actions required for trade growth in Pakistan agreed upon
Islamabad: The second round of hybrid consultations focusing on Plan of Action review for the development of the priority sector export strategies was concluded in Karachi.
Hundreds of public and private sector representatives participated in the review and approval process of the priorities for the next five years in each of their sector.
For Pakistan to achieve its trade growth ambition, the Ministry of Commerce (MoC) and TDAP are developing a coherent and comprehensive Strategic Trade Development Framework (STPF) focusing on 17 priority sectors. As part of the National Priority Sectors Export Strategy (NPSES), the International Trade Centre (ITC) is supporting MoC to develop 10 strategies directly stemming from the STPF priorities.
The STPF priority sectors’ strategies design process will focus on developing actionable plans to increase their export competitiveness in the global market. The STPF priority sectors covered by the NPSES include engineering goods, leather, processed food and beverages, fruits and vegetables, meat and poultry, pharmaceuticals, software development and services, business process outsourcing, logistics, and institutional coordination.
The development of the priority sector export strategies will aim to reduce barriers to international trade growth which can become a key driver for Pakistan’s economic recovery in a post-pandemic world. The sector strategies will enable potential for companies in Pakistan to diversify and improve their competitiveness and exports, better participate in global and regional value chains, and move up the quality ladder, by innovating, producing and exporting higher value products, and marketing through branding and promotion.
Each sector session invited industry stakeholders to review and validate the Action Plans, while agreeing on the responsibilities for each implementing agency. In addition to key national institutions and private sector representatives, development partners were also invited to support implementation of the sector strategies.
These consultations are conducted by MOC and TDAP and are directly aligned with the ambitions from the Government of Pakistan to develop exports. The newly formed National Export Deve­lopment Board (NEDB) will further steer the implementation of the STPF and the sector strategies through Sector Advisory Councils (SAC).
“The NPSES comes at a crucial time for Pakistan. As the hon. Prime Minister of Pakistan emphasised the need to boost Pakistani exports, the NPSES will provide a tangible and concrete roadmap for the Government and private sector to work together towards this goal, while creating jobs and new opportunities for Pakistan. The NPSES will reflect the needs of Pakistani exporters and the Ministry is committed to implement the Plans of Action that will emanate from it” said Sualeh Ahmad Faruqi, the Federal Secretary of Commerce of Pakistan.
The development of the NPSES is supported by the Revenue Mobilisation, Investment and Trade (ReMIT) Programme, implemented by the International Trade Centre (ITC), and funded by the United Kingdom Government through the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

Country-wide DRIVE updates details of 500,000 registered Afghan refugees
PESHAWAR, 21 September 2021 – Pakistan has updated details of more than 500,000 registered Afghan refugees as part of a country-wide campaign to issue renewed Proof of Registration (PoR) cards.
Some 1.4 million already registered Afghan refugees are being verified and issued with new biometric cards through 35 sites and four mobile units.
The last large-scale verification of refugees in the country was undertaken 10 years ago.
Known as the Documentation Renewal and Information Verification Exercise – DRIVE – the government-led campaign is run by Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) and Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CAR), with the support of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), and is expected to be completed within the year.
DRIVE will boost Pakistan’s efforts to enhance protection and assistance for refugees. The cards will better enable refugees to access critical services, such as health and education.
Refugees who completed their DRIVE verification interviews receive SMS notifications advising them of when and where their new PoR smartcards can be collected.
“I applaud the progress Pakistan has made with this exercise. It is a global leader in terms of developing  a high-tech refugee registration platform which enables refugee protection and solutions. I hope more countries will follow in Pakistan’s footsteps in providing documentation to refugees,” said the UNHCR Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific Indrika Ratwatte while visiting a DRIVE Centre in Peshawar today.
Pakistan’s NADRA has printed and distributed some 100,000 new smartcards to existing registered Afghan refugees.
“A lot has changed since the last large-scale exercise in Pakistan 10 years ago. The refugee smartcards are an important tool of protection, and it enables the Government and UNHCR to have current information on the refugee population, including vulnerabilities, skills and education levels to better inform the provision of services and assistance,” Ratwatte added.
The smart PoR cards, which will be valid until June 2023, are legally recognized proof of identity and include enhanced security features. These cards will also be technologically compatible with systems used in Pakistan to authenticate the identities of nationals to access services.
DRIVE is also part of a wider effort to seek solutions for Afghan refugees, particularly through the Support Platform for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees (SSAR). The exercise will help collect data on the educational and professional backgrounds of refugees.
This information will also assist in the development of skills training and enhance education opportunities for refugees, as well as match the needs for specific skill sets with opportunities in Afghanistan, which may enable voluntary return and sustainable reintegration in the future.
Measures are in place at all DRIVE sites to mitigate COVID-19 risks through enhanced hygiene, physical distancing, and the scheduling of set numbers of appointments each day.

PRESS RELEASE
UN Women puts spotlight on the role of CSR for Women’s Economic Empowerment in Pakistan
Islamabad, September 22, 2021: UN Women hosted a convention on CSR4Women – The Untapped Potential in Islamabad on September 21, 2021. The event was supported by the Government of Norway and chaired by Sima Kamil, the Deputy Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan. The convention brought together business leaders, CEOs of private companies, heads of Chambers of Commerce, development partners and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) experts to deliberate on the potential role of the CSR towards fostering inclusive economic opportunities for women.
"The nexus of corporate social responsibility and women's economic empowerment presents four wins - for the private sector, the state, women and for us as UN Women Pakistan. Through our collaborative efforts, we will achieve the vision of making Pakistan the 10th largest economy by 2047”, said Sharmeela Rassool, Country Representative of UN Women in her opening address.
The convention provided an opportunity to recognize the role of women Home-Based Workers (HBWs), while identifying possibilities for their economic advancement in the CSR space. Evidence shows that HBWs contribute 1.5% of Pakistan’s GDP, the available data does not include those who are self-employed or contributing family workers. According to the Labour Force Survey for 2017-2018, out of 5.26 million HBWs in Pakistan, 81% are women. HBWs are playing an increasingly important role in the economic growth of the country. However, their contribution is undervalued with limited recognition and legal protection.
Sima Kamil, Deputy Governor, SBP, sharing a perspective in the keynote address said, ‘the financial sector also needs to realize its role as a key player in advancing regulatory policy and strategies towards promoting women’s access to finance and digital financial inclusion.’ She highlighted the need for introducing digital channels for lending by the financial institutions and capacity building of women for effectively accessing these tools.
UN Women Pakistan has worked with the private sector companies in Pakistan since 2015 through the application of Women’s Economic Empowerment Principles (WEPs). The WEPs are a set of gender responsive principles offering guidance to businesses on how to promote gender equality and women’s economic empowerment in the workplaces and marketplaces. UN Women has mobilized a fast-growing community of WEP signatories in Pakistan, who are doing valuable and impactful work in this regard.
Fareeha Ummar, Portfolio Manager, UN Women, in her call for action, underscored that private business activity, investment and innovation through social responsibility are major drivers of inclusive economic growth and job creation. She called on the private sector to apply creativity and innovation through a partnership approach ‘towards ensuring income equality, gender equality, equity in access to health, education and social security.’
The expert panel discussion featured best practices and experiences from the CSR initiatives to identify opportunities for channeling CSR funds towards an economically secured future for women in Pakistan.
The convention concluded with some very pertinent commitments and agreed action points from the participants for nurturing a new generation of business and public leaders that will take CSR and sustainability to the next level.

Video Message for the Secretary-General: International Day of Peace September 21, 2021
UNITED NATIONS : MEDIA ADVISORY :  World leaders to gather at UN to mark SDG Moment and inspire ambition critical to ending the pandemic and ensuring a sustainable and inclusive future for all
This year’s International Day of Peace comes at a crisis point for humanity.
COVID-19 has turned our world upside-down.
Conflicts are spinning out of control.
The climate emergency is worsening.
Inequality and poverty are deepening.
And mistrust and division are driving people apart at a time when solidarity and collaboration are needed more than ever.
As a human family, we face a stark choice —
Peace or perpetual peril.
We must choose peace.
That is why I call for a 24-hour ceasefire today.
And by working in solidarity for a lasting, sustainable peace every day, we can tackle the issues facing us.
We need peace to urgently deliver lifesaving vaccines and treatment for COVID-19.
We need peace to recover from the pandemic and re-build shattered systems and shattered lives.
We need peace to level the playing field and reduce inequalities.
We need peace to renew trust in one another — and faith in facts and science.
And we need to make peace with nature — to heal our planet, build a green economy, and achieve our net-zero targets.
Peace is not a naïve dream.
It’s a light in the darkness.
Guiding us to the only pathway to a better future for humanity.
Let’s walk the pathway of peace as if our lives depended on it.
Because they do.
Thank you.

World leaders to gather at UN to mark SDG Moment and inspire ambition
critical to ending the pandemic and ensuring a sustainable and
inclusive future for all
K-pop band BTS and Global Stakeholders to join Heads of State and Government in
keeping the promise of the SDGs for people and planet

Follow on UN Web TV
What: The SDG Moment serves to place an annual spotlight on the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) and will be held at the beginning of the United Nation’s General Assembly’s High-
Level Week. It takes place as the world experiences a deeply uneven response to the COVID-19
pandemic, which risks creating a two-tier recovery with significant implications for the
advancement of the SDGs, especially in developing countries.

Convened by the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Moment will provide world
leaders with a platform to showcase the bold plans, actions and solutions that are needed to
end the COVID-19 pandemic and set the world on course towards achieving the SDGs. Held in
advance of major meetings on food systems, climate, energy, jobs and social protection, the
SDG Moment event is expected to build the momentum needed to deliver on the Decade of
Action and Keep the Promise of the SDGs.

The event will include more than 30 heads of state, a key debate with UN leaders on the
COVID-19 Response and Recovery and a musical performance by K-pop band BTS, Special
Presidential Envoy for Future Generation and Culture of the President of the Republic of Korea.
Leaders from business, civil society, local authorities, the SDG Advocates and the UN will
highlight how to take solutions to scale.

Why: To get the SDGs back on track and prevent the worst impacts of climate change, a
profound shift in economies and societies is now needed that benefits both people and planet.
2
In the last 18 months, COVID-19 has disrupted economies and livelihoods, deepened
inequalities and risks sending over 70 million people into extreme poverty.

In the same period, progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions has been too slow and
biodiversity loss has continued at an extraordinary pace. This is compounded by a deeply
uneven global response to the pandemic with the world’s poorest countries and people
suffering the most. The SDGs are the north star for the transformation required to overcome
the pandemic and usher in a sustainable and inclusive future for everyone.

Recognising this urgency, the UN will launch a new campaign, Keeping the Promise ahead of
the SDG Moment. The digital campaign will call on people around the world to make a promise
to take action for a better future for all. Users will be asked to choose from 11 promises
inspired by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals – the world’s to-do list to protect our planet
and all its people.

NRSP and IFAD Pakistan hosts webinar on “A better livelihood for Smallholders under China-Pakistan Agricultural Cooperation” in collaboration with Foreign Economic Cooperation Center (FECC), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, P.R. China
[17th September 2021, Online]: A virtual validation workshop was organised jointly by the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Pakistan in collaboration with Foreign Economic Cooperation Center (FECC), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, P.R. China. The webinar was part of a series of policy talks inviting discussion and debate under the project titled “Effective South-South Cooperation in Agriculture to Unleash Transformative Power of Agriculture Sector for Inclusive Development in Pakistan".
During the talks, Hubert Boirard, IFAD Country Director for Pakistan, welcomed the participants and panelists. He appreciated that despite COVID 19 crises, the project has so far progressed well. He gave a brief overview of the project and informed participants that the project was funded by the IFAD-China South South and Triangular Cooperation Facility, a grant dedicated to mobilizing knowledge, technologies and resources from the Global South to accelerate rural poverty alleviation, enhance rural productivity, and advance rural transformation.  He further said “Over the last three decades IFAD has supported farming communities in Pakistan, especially smallholders, to improve their socioeconomic conditions through a variety of interventions. IFAD will extend its technical support through this recent initiative as it continues to support improved livelihoods in rural areas in Pakistan and China. IFAD is also initiating new projects in Gilgit Baltistan as well as in Gawadar for the smallholders.”
Dr. Wang Geng, Director, FECC, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs, P.R.C and Prof. Yangzhijiang, Dean of International Education, Xinjiang Agricultural University gave a presentation on Effective South-South Cooperation in Agriculture to Unleash Transformative Power of Agriculture Sector for Inclusive Development in Pakistan. They highlighted the contributions of Xinjiang Agriculture University in promoting research projects in Pakistan. Dr. Wang elaborated the nature of the Technical Assistance being provided in this initiative to unleash the potential of agriculture, both in Pakistan and China. He said, “Knowledge sharing through South-South and Triangular Cooperation is a very powerful tool to facilitate the exchange of lessons learnt and best practices among countries of the global south and help them end poverty and hunger. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs China and Xinjiang Agriculture University will continue supporting this noble cause through knowledge exchange to benefit poor farming communities in Pakistan and China”
Dr. Rashid Bajwa, CEO NRSP presented Status of Agriculture Development in Pakistan and highlighted the challenges that smallholders have to endure. He appreciated this initiative which was need of the hour to fully exploit the potential of agriculture sector in Pakistan. He further emphasized that the project should establish and operate an effective knowledge generation and sharing platform to provide customized assistances in helping Pakistan to unleash the transformative power of agriculture sector for the country's inclusive development. He hoped that the project target audience, which include smallholders and farmer organizations, agribusiness and agriculture-related firms and Governmental agencies such as Irrigation Department, Agriculture Department, Commerce Department etc. will benefit from this unprecedented opportunity of knowledge sharing to add to the agriculture development in Pakistan.
Dr. Bajwa highlighted the dilapidated conditions of the smallholders due to lack of knowledge, resources and access to modern cropping practices. He emphasized on five key areas where China-Pakistan Agriculture Cooperation can support small farmers in Pakistan. These areas are land preparation, access to farming machinery, lack of information about modern cropping techniques, crop management & harvesting, and post-harvest crop losses & transportation.  He stated, “the exchange of knowledge and expertise will be instrumental for Pakistani small farmers to boost crop production and profitability in major crops including wheat, sugarcane, rice, lentils and legumes. NRSP will continue benefitting smallholders, who are the target beneficiaries of NRSP’s poverty alleviation program, by working with China-Pakistan Agriculture Cooperation to pass on the information, lessons learned and best practices to poor communities in Pakistan through a network of NRSP-fostered Community Organizations”
A panel discussion was also held on ‘Fostering a better livelihood for Smallholders in Pakistan under China-Pakistan Agricultural Cooperation’. The panelists were distinguished agriculture and development experts from public and private sector of Pakistan and China, including Mr. Gu Wenliang, Agricultural Counsellor, China Embassy in Pakistan. They highlighted the best practice and good lessons from previous China-Pakistan agricultural cooperation, the roles that private sectors can play in promoting smallholder agricultural development under CPEC and ways to ensure that the benefits of China-Pakistan Agricultural Cooperation trickle down to smallholders in Pakistan. Mr. Gu Wenliang noted that transfer of agriculture skills/technology/experience from China will be more applicable for smallholders in Pakistan and the cross-sharing knowledge and experiences will benefit agriculture sector of both China and Pakistan to meet the emerging challenges, especially in the context of Climate Change.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL MESSAGE ON INTERNATIONAL EQUAL PAY DAY, 18 September 2021
ITC - PRESS RELEASE : ITC supporting Government of Sindh to attain SPS compliance
UNICEF- PRESS RELEASE : Schoolchildren worldwide have lost 1.8 trillion hours and counting of in-person learning due to COVID-19 lockdowns, says UNICEF
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON INTERNATIONAL EQUAL PAY DAY
18 September 2021
COVID-19 pulled back the curtain on a gross injustice: the lack of compensation for the work of raising children and caring for people who cannot look after themselves, which is largely done by women.
By pushing care work out of the formal economy and into the home, the pandemic has exacerbated the gender pay gap. Many women are struggling to hold down paid jobs while raising children, dealing with online school, and caring for sick or vulnerable family members without material compensation. Investing in the care economy helps bridge the pay gap by creating new, sustainable jobs while freeing women up to participate in the paid workforce.
At the same time, most frontline health workers battling the virus are women. They often earn less than men, lack decision-making power, and suffer greater exposure to violence and harassment.
I was vividly reminded of women’s dual roles when I spoke with a health worker in Ghana, Scholastica Dery. “As frontline workers, we are the majority,” she said. “Combining this with our household duties is not easy, but we are determined to do it.”
Despite equal pay laws, women earn an average of just 80 cents for every dollar men earn for work of equal value. That figure is even less for women of colour and those with children.
Addressing the COVID-19 pandemic offers a generational opportunity to write a new social contract that upholds women’s human rights, including the right to equal pay.  This is a matter of justice and a responsibility for us all.
On International Equal Pay Day, let’s resolve to dismantle the discrimination and harmful gender stereotypes that contribute to the gender pay gap.

He emphasised on the need to have active and close coordination between public and private sector to improve the quality and effectiveness of the services at grass roots level. Complying with the SPS regulations and quality standards of slaughtering and processing of meet will enable local entrepreneurs to tap the full business potential of the sector.
Ms. Shabnam Baloch, GRASP Provincial Lead informed that over 150 master trainers from 14 districts of Sindh have been prepared through seven training sessions across the province. “This capacity building program has been designed to build the professional capacity of the staff of departments of Livestock and Fisheries, Local Government and Sindh Food Authority’’’

Schoolchildren worldwide have lost 1.8 trillion hours and counting of in-person learning due to COVID-19 lockdowns, says UNICEF
Urging governments to reopen schools as soon as possible, UNICEF unveils No Time to Lose – a clock counting hours of lost learning – as the UN General Assembly gets underway in N
NEW YORK, 17 September 2021 – Schoolchildren around the world have lost an estimated 1.8 trillion hours – and counting – of in-person learning since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. As a result, young learners have been cut off from their education and the other vital benefits schools provide.
To call attention to this education crisis, UNICEF today unveiled ‘No Time to Lose' at United Nations Headquarters in New York. The centerpiece of the installation is a clock, modelled to look like the blackboard of an empty classroom, situated at the UN Visitors’ Plaza in front of the General Assembly Building. The clock is a real-time counter, displaying the growing cumulative number of in-person learning hours every schoolchild in the world has lost and continues to lose since the pandemic's onset. The empty classroom consists of 18 desks, one for every month of the pandemic-caused education disruptions.
The installation is being created ahead of the opening of the General Debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), a period when some leaders will take the opportunity to return to United Nations headquarters in person for the first time since the onset of the pandemic.
“Next week, the United Nations will open its doors to delegations from around the world. But in many countries, the doors of schools will remain closed to children and young people,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. “We are short-changing an entire generation whose minds and futures hang in the balance. We must prioritize the reopening of schools and support those who have lost out during the pandemic. There is no time to lose.”
This year, the General Debate and associated annual meetings will take place in a hybrid format, with many events taking place virtually. The installation, open to delegations which will have elected to attend General Assembly meetings in-person, is a stark reminder that millions of schoolchildren remain locked out of their schools and a call for leaders to act urgently on this education crisis.
The installation will be up from 17 September to 27 September with the conclusion of UNGA.*
Globally, around 131 million schoolchildren in 11 countries have missed three-quarters of their in-person learning from March 2020 to September 2021. Among them, 59 per cent – or nearly 77 million – have missed almost all in-person instruction time. Around 27 per cent of countries continue to have schools fully or partially closed. Additionally, according to UNESCO’s latest data, more than 870 million students at all levels are currently facing disruptions to their education.
UNICEF urges governments, local authorities, and school administrations to reopen schools as soon as possible and take all possible steps to mitigate against transmission of the virus in schools, such as:
·        Implementing mask policies for students and staff that are in accordance with national and local guidelines;
· Providing handwashing facilities and/or hand sanitiser;
· Frequently cleaning surfaces and shared objects;
· Ensuring adequate and appropriate ventilation;
· Cohorting (keeping students and teachers in small groups that do not mix); staggering start, break, bathroom, meals and end time; and alternating physical presence;
· Establishing information sharing mechanisms with parents, students and teachers;
· While not a prerequisite to reopen schools, teachers should be prioritised to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, after frontline health workers and those most at risk, to protect them from community transmission.
Additionally, UNESCO, UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP and the World Bank previously issued the Framework for School Reopening to provide practical and flexible advice for national and local governments and aid their efforts to return students to in-person learning.
"Every hour a child spends in the classroom is precious – an opportunity to expand their horizons and maximize their potential. And with each passing moment, countless amounts of opportunity are lost,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “1.8 trillion hours – and counting – is an unfathomable amount of time. Equally unfathomable is setting priorities around mitigating the impacts of COVID that do not put our children’s future first. We can and must reopen schools as soon as possible. The clock is ticking.”

Schools still closed for nearly 77 million students 18 months into pandemic – UNICEF<
UNICEF and partners’ digital channels to close down for 18 hours to mark 18 months of school closures and send one message to the world: Reopen schools as soon as possible
NEW YORK, 16 September 2021 – Eighteen months into the COVID-19 pandemic, schools for nearly 77 million students in six countries continue to be almost completely closed, according to an updated data analysis released today by UNICEF.
According to the analysis, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Panama are among the countries that kept schools closed the longest. In total, an estimated 131 million students in 11 countries have missed more than three-quarters of their in-person learning. Around 27 per cent of countries worldwide continue to have schools fully or partially closed.
“As classes resume in many countries around the world, millions of students are heading into a third academic year without stepping foot in a classroom,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “The losses that students are incurring from not being in school may never be recovered.”
To call attention to the 18 months of lost learning, deferred potential and uncertain future, and to urge governments to reopen schools as soon as possible, UNICEF and partners will close down their digital channels today at 13.00 GMT for 18 hours.
School closures have created a shadow crisis for children. Beyond falling behind on their education, many children are missing out on school-based meals and routine vaccinations, experiencing social isolation and increased anxiety, and being exposed to abuse and violence. For some, school closures have led to drop out, child labour and child marriage. Many parents have been unable to continue with their employment while balancing their children’s care and learning needs. Some have lost their jobs entirely, pushing their families into poverty and creating a deeper economic crisis.
While remote learning has been a lifeline for millions of schoolchildren, access to the technology and the quality of the curriculum have been uneven even within communities and school districts.
Experience shows that schools are not the main drivers of transmission and that it is possible to keep them open for in-person learning. UNICEF urges governments, local authorities and school administrations to reopen schools as soon as possible and take all possible steps to mitigate against transmission of the virus in schools, such as:
1.    Implementing mask policies for students and staff in accordance with national and local guidelines;
2.    Providing handwashing facilities and/or hand sanitiser;
3.    Frequently cleaning of surfaces and shared objects;
4.    Ensuring adequate and appropriate ventilation;
5.    Cohorting (keeping students and teachers in small groups that do not mix); staggering start, break, bathroom, meals and end time; and alternating physical presence;
6.    Establishing information sharing mechanisms with parents, students and teachers;
7.    While not a prerequisite to reopen schools, teachers should be prioritised to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, after frontline health workers and those most at risk, to help protect them from community transmission.
To support these efforts, UNICEF contributed to a multi-agency Framework for School Reopening to provide practical and flexible advice for national and local governments and aid their efforts to return students to in-person learning.
“The education crisis is still here, and with each passing day that classrooms remain dark, the devastation worsens,” said Fore. “This is a crisis we will not allow the world to ignore. Our channels are silent, but our message is loud: Every community, everywhere must reopen schools as soon as possible. Schools must be the last to close and the first to reopen. We have to start putting the best interest of every child first. In all but the most extreme cases, this means getting students back into the classroom.”

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE OZONE LAYER
16 September 2021
The Montreal Protocol began life as a mechanism to protect and heal the ozone layer.  It has done its job well over the past three decades.  The ozone layer is on the road to recovery.  The cooperation we have seen under the Montreal Protocol is exactly what is needed now to take on climate change, an equally existential threat to our societies.
The Montreal Protocol is more than just an example of how multilateralism can and should work, it is an active tool to help meet our global vision for sustainable development.  Under the Kigali Amendment to the Protocol, nations have committed to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), powerful greenhouse gases used as coolants.  When fully implemented, the Kigali Amendment could prevent 0.4 degrees Celsius of global warming this century.
Furthermore, as we prepare for the Food Systems Summit this month, we are reminded that the Kigali Amendment can also help us to increase food security.  By reducing HFCs, increasing energy efficiency and creating more ozone- and climate-friendly technologies, the Kigali Amendment can bring sustainable access to vital cooling services to millions of people.
Such services would reduce food loss in developing countries, where food often spoils before it can reach markets.  Getting produce from farmers to where it is needed would help reduce hunger, poverty and the environmental impact of the agricultural sector.  Another important benefit of expanding cooling is storage of medicines and vaccines, such as are needed to end the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Montreal Protocol and the Kigali Amendment show us that by acting together, anything is possible.  So let us act now to slow climate change, feed the world’s hungry and protect the planet that we all depend on.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
Statement to the General Assembly presenting “Our Common Agenda”
10 September 2021
[, as delivered]
Mr. President of the General Assembly,
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
On almost every front, our world is under enormous stress.
We are not at ease with each other, or our planet.
Covid-19 is a wake-up call – and we are oversleeping.
The pandemic has demonstrated our collective failure to come together and make joint decisions for the common good, even in the face of an immediate, life-threatening global emergency.
This paralysis extends far beyond COVID-19.  From the climate crisis to our suicidal war on nature and the collapse of biodiversity, our global response has been too little, too late.
Unchecked inequality is undermining social cohesion, creating fragilities that affect us all. Technology is moving ahead without guard rails to protect us from its unforeseen consequences.
Global decision-making is fixed on immediate gain, ignoring the long-term consequences of decisions — or indecision.
Multilateral institutions have proven too weak and fragmented for today’s global challenges and risks.
As a result, we risk a future of serious instability and climate chaos.
Last year, in the Leaders’ Declaration marking the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, you charged me with providing recommendations to advance Our Common Agenda, to address these challenges for global governance.
Today, after an in-depth process of consultation and reflection, I am presenting my response.
Excellencies,
In preparing this report, we built on a year-long global listening exercise.  We engaged Member States, thought leaders, young people, civil society, the United Nations system and its many partners.
One message rang throughout our consultations: our world needs more, and better, multilateralism, based on deeper solidarity, to deal with the crises we face, and to reverse today’s dangerous trends.
There was broad recognition that we are at a pivotal moment.
Business as usual could result in breakdown of the global order, into a world of perpetual crisis and winner-takes-all.
Or we could decide to change course, heralding a breakthrough to a greener, better, safer future for all.
This report represents my vision, informed by your contributions, for a path towards the breakthrough scenario.
Our Common Agenda is above all an agenda of action, designed to strengthen and accelerate multilateral cooperation – particularly around the 2030 Agenda – and make a tangible difference to people’s lives.
And it is an agenda driven by solidarity – the principle of working together, recognizing that we are bound to each other and that no community or country, however powerful, can solve its challenges alone.
Excellencies,
I will set out my vision for Our Common Agenda under four broad headings: strengthening global governance; focusing on the future; renewing the social contract; and ensuring a United Nations fit for a new era.
First, the international community is manifestly failing to protect our most precious global commons: the oceans, the atmosphere, outer space, and the pristine wilderness of Antarctica. Nor is it delivering policies to support peace, global health, the viability of our planet and other pressing needs.
In other words, multilateralism is failing its most basic test.
The lack of a global response and vaccination programme to end the COVID-19 pandemic is a clear and tragic example.
The longer the virus circulates among billions of unvaccinated people, the higher the risk that it will develop into more dangerous variants that could rip through vaccinated and unvaccinated populations alike, with a far higher fatality rate.
IMF recall that investing $50 billion in vaccination now could add an estimated $9 trillion to the global economy in the next four years.
We need an immediate global vaccination plan, implemented by an emergency Task Force made up of present and potential vaccine producers, the World Health Organization, ACT-Accelerator partners, and international financial institutions, to work with pharmaceutical companies to at least double vaccine production, and ensure that vaccines reach seventy percent of the world’s population in the first half of 2022.
Likewise, the recommendations of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response must be a starting point for urgent reforms to strengthen the global health architecture.
The World Health Organization must be empowered and funded adequately, so that it can play a leading role in coordinating emergency response. Global health security and preparedness must be strengthened through sustained political commitment and leadership at the highest level. Low- and middle-income countries must be able to develop and access health technologies.
Excellencies,
More broadly, we cannot afford to ignore the alarm sounded by the pandemic and by galloping climate change. We must launch a new era of bold, transformative policies across the board.
We must take our heads out of the sand and face up to future health crises, financial shocks, and the triple planetary emergency of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.
We need a quantum leap to strengthen multilateralism and make it fit for purpose.
One of the central recommendations of my report on Our Common Agenda is that the world should come together to consider all these issues and more at a high-level Summit of the Future.
This summit will aim to forge a new global consensus on what our future should look like, and how we can secure it.
The summit should include a New Agenda for Peace, that takes a more comprehensive, holistic view of global security.
The New Agenda for Peace could include measures to reduce strategic risks from nuclear arms, cyberwarfare and lethal autonomous weapons; strengthen foresight of future risk and reshape responses to all forms of violence, including by criminal groups, and in the home; investing in prevention and peacebuilding by addressing the root causes of conflict; increase support for regional initiatives that can fill critical gaps in the global peace and security architecture; and put women and girls at the centre of security policy.
The Summit could also include tracks on sustainable development and climate action beyond 2030; a Global Digital Compact to guarantee that new technologies are a force for good; the peaceful and sustainable use of outer space, the management of future shocks and crises, and more.
It should take account of today’s more complex context for global governance, in which a range of State and non-State actors are participating in open, transparent systems that draw on the capacities of all relevant stakeholders.
Our goal should be a more inclusive and networked multilateralism, to navigate this complex landscape and deliver effective solutions.
To support our collective efforts,
I will ask an Advisory Board led by eminent former heads of state and government to identify global public goods and potentially other areas of common interest where governance improvements are most needed, and to propose options for how this could be achieved.
The work starts now, and I hope for your future engagement.
Excellencies,
The uneven recovery from the pandemic has exposed the deficiencies in our global financial system.
In the next five years, according to the International Monetary Fund, cumulative economic growth per capita in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to be around one quarter of the rate in the rest of the world.
This is intolerable.
Meanwhile, both public and private finance for climate action have been insufficient for years, if not decades.
To tackle historic weaknesses and gaps, and integrate the global financial system with other global priorities, I propose biennial Summits at the level of Heads of States and Government, between G20 members, ECOSOC members, the heads of International Financial Institutions, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
The overriding aim of these summits would be to create a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient global economy, including fairer multilateral systems to manage global trade and technological development.
Issues for immediate consideration could include innovative financing to address inequality and support sustainable development; an investment boost to finance a green and just transition from fossil fuels; and a “last mile alliance’ to reach those farthest behind, as part of efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
These biennial Summits would coordinate efforts to incentivize inclusive and sustainable policies, across all systems, that enable countries to offer basic services and social protection to their citizens.
They would tackle unfair and exploitative financial practices, and resolve longstanding weaknesses in the international debt architecture.
Governments should never again face a choice between serving their people or servicing their debt.
These biennial Summits would also harness global financial frameworks to move forward quickly and unequivocally on climate action and biodiversity loss.
The Paris target is still within reach, but we need faster, nimbler, more effective climate and environmental governance to limit global heating and support countries most affected.
COP26 will be a vital forum to accelerate climate action.
I intend to convene all stakeholders ahead of the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement in 2023 to consider further urgent steps.
Member States are already preparing a strong post-2020 biodiversity framework, the 2021 Food Systems Summit, and the Stockholm + 50 summit on the environment next year.
I will do everything in my power to ensure that these platforms will be a fundamental reset in our relationship with [nature].
Excellencies,
All these efforts and initiatives require economic analysis based on today’s realities, rather than outdated ideas of economic success.
We must correct a major blind spot in how we measure progress and prosperity.
Gross Domestic Product, GDP, fails to account for the incalculable social and environmental damage that may be caused by the pursuit of profit.
My report calls for new metrics that value the life and wellbeing of the many over short-term profit for the few.
Likewise, access to concessional finance should be based on vulnerability to risks and shocks, not the outdated metric of GDP.
Excellencies,
The second element of my report is a new focus on the world’s young people, and future generations.
These two groups will inherit the consequences of our decisions – but are barely represented at the global table of decisions.
I therefore intend to appoint a Special Envoy for Future Generations, to give weight to the interests of those who will be born over the coming century.
And a new United Nations Youth Office will upgrade engagement with young people across all our work, so that today’s young women and men can be designers of their own future.
My report proposes measures on education, skills training and lifelong learning, including a Transforming Education Summit next year, to address the learning crisis and expand opportunities and hope for the world’s 1.8 billion young people.
But we must go further, to make full use of our unprecedented capacity to predict and model the impact of policy decisions over time.
I therefore intend to create a Futures Lab that will work with governments, academia, civil society, the private sector and others, bringing together all our work around forecasting, megatrends and risks.
The Futures Lab will collect and analyse data, building on existing mechanisms including the annual IMF early warning exercise, to issue regular reports on megatrends and catastrophic risks.
To improve our preparedness for future shocks, my report recommends an Emergency Platform that would be triggered automatically in large-scale crises, bringing together leaders from Member States, the United Nations system, key country groupings, international financial institutions, regional parties, and civil society and the private sector that is required to cooperate together with research bodies and others.
I also believe we need an intergovernmental body that thinks beyond immediate geopolitical dynamics to consider the interests of our entire human family, present and future.
My report therefore proposes that Member States consider repurposing the Trusteeship Council, to make it into a deliberative platform on behalf of succeeding generations.
I hope Member States will also consider a Declaration on Future Generations to support this work.
Unless we change course, we could bequeath to our children and their children a barely habitable world.
You may have heard of the seven-generation principle, under which some indigenous communities make decisions based on the generations from their great-grandparents to their great-grandchildren. We have a lot to learn from them.
Excellencies,
Fourth and finally, the United Nations itself must adapt to support the vision of Our Common Agenda.
The United Nations is the only institution with universal convening power. Our Common Agenda must therefore include upgrading the United Nations.
We need a UN 2.0 that can offer more relevant, systemwide, multilateral and multi-stakeholder solutions to the challenges of the 21st century.
This transformation will be based on a quintet of cross-cutting issues: data; digital innovation; strategic foresight; behavioral science; and performance and results orientation.
I will seek to reestablish the Secretary-General's Scientific Advisory Board, to strengthen the role of the United Nations as a source of reliable data and evidence.
And I will broaden participation through an annual meeting with regional organizations, and a new Advisory Group on Local and Regional Governments, as well as systematic engagement with cities, civil society, parliaments and the private sector.
All United Nations entities will be asked to establish a dedicated focal point for civil society, to create greater space for civil society to contribute at the country and global levels, and within all United Nations networks and processes.
The Futures Lab, a repurposed Trusteeship Council, and my new envoy for Future Generations will together ensure that the United Nations takes far better account of the intergenerational impact of our work.
Our finances should be put on a firmer footing, and I invite Member States to consider my proposals in this regard.
As regards any decisions by Member States to adapt the intergovernmental organs to the needs and realities of today, including reforming the Security Council, revitalizing the work of the General Assembly and strengthening ECOSOC, I stand ready to provide the necessary support.
Excellencies,
Global governance may sound lofty or abstract. It is not.
These decisions have life-or-death consequences for you and your citizens, from the quality of the air we breathe to the chance to earn a living wage and the risk of catching a deadly disease.
Multilateral action led by the United Nations has achieved an enormous amount over the past 76 years, from preventing a third world war to eradicating smallpox and mending the hole in the ozone layer.
My report must be a starting point for ideas and initiatives that build on these achievements and take them further.
Some of my proposals can be taken forward by the United Nations system. Others will require broader discussion, and decisions by Member States.
I urge you all to act on your joint responsibility to ensure we achieve the breakthrough we need.
The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization. Member States will always be central to our collective ability to meet global challenges, with unique responsibilities in the multilateral system.
But solutions to today’s challenges also depend on action from civil society, the private sector and others, particularly young people, who must be accountable for their commitments and have a meaningful role in deliberations.
I look forward to hearing from you and your national leaders on these proposals, during the General Debate and thereafter.
Excellencies,
I am an engineer. I believe in the infinite capacity of the human mind to solve problems.
When we work together, there is no limit to what we can achieve.
My report on Our Common Agenda is a starting point. A starting point for our joint efforts to improve global governance together, on foundations of trust, solidarity and human rights, to fulfil the hopes and expectations of the people we serve.
Thank you.

FAO and MNFSR collaborate to bring innovative financing in agricultural research
A consultative workshop on Innovative Financing for Agricultural Research was jointly organized by Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to provide an opportunity to look at examples of financial mechanisms for research in Pakistan and around the world. Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research, Mr Syed Fakhar Imam attended the workshop as a chief guest.
Financing models of Pakistanis agricultural research institutions as well as research institutions from leading agricultural countries such as Australian Rural Research and Development Corporations, Brazilian Agriculture Research Corporation, European Union, Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, United States Department of Agriculture and Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences were looked into in order to identify possible way forward for the research in Pakistan.
The spending on research and development has reduced from 1991 to 2012 in Pakistan. The impact can been seen on the per hectare production of major crops like wheat, rice, sugarcane, cotton and maize. Resultantly, Pakistan is losing the competitiveness in the international market for these crops. Import of cotton for textile has increased and import of food items has also increased. This workshop provided an opportunity to explore more options to pool resources for research and development to improve production and competitiveness.
Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research, Mr Syed Fakhar Imam said that the workshop would provide an opportunity to national and international experts to discuss various financial mechanisms and how we can evolve a pragmatic financial mechanism for our research institutions.
FAO Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Florence Rolle, while thanking Mr. Fakhar Imam for asking FAO to undertake an assessment of PARC and PCCC, emphasized the importance of investing in agricultural research and extension in order to reduce poverty, malnutrition and hunger.
Former Executive Director, Australian Rural Research and Development Corporation, Dr. Steve Jefferies, Country Director, International Maize and Improvement Center, Pakistan Dr. Thakur Prasad Tiwari, Representative from United States Department of Agriculture, Jodi A Scheffler, Agricultural Commissioner, Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Pakistan, Dr. Gu Wenliang, Development Advisor, Agriculture and Climate Change, Delegation of the European Union to Pakistan, Roberto Aparicio Martín shared best international practices on innovative financial mechanism. Representatives from academia, federal and provincial agriculture departments also shared national experiences.

Repeated school closures due to COVID-19 leading to learning loss and widening inequities in South Asia, UNICEF research shows
Limited access to devices, low connectivity, and limited teacher contact are severely constraining remote learning in the region
KATHMANDU, 9 September 2021 – School closures have led to alarming inequities in learning opportunities for children in South Asia, despite significant efforts by governments and partners to expand remote learning, according to UNICEF research conducted in India, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
School closures in South Asia due to the COVID-19 pandemic have interrupted the learning of 434 million children. According to UNICEF’s research, a substantial proportion of students and their parents reported that students learnt significantly less compared to pre-pandemic levels. In India, 80 per cent of children aged 14-18 years reported lower levels of learning than when physically at school. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, 69 per cent of parents of primary school children reported that their children were learning “less” or “a lot less.” Girls, children from the most disadvantaged households and children with disabilities faced the biggest challenges while learning remotely.
“School closures in South Asia have forced hundreds of millions of children and their teachers to transition to remote learning in a region with low connectivity and device affordability,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia. “Even when a family has access to technology, children are not always able to access it. As a result, children have suffered enormous setbacks in their learning journey.”
Despite significant efforts from governments, low connectivity and access to digital devices have severely hampered efforts to roll out remote learning. In India, 42 per cent of children between 6-13 years reported not using any type of remote learning during school closures. In Pakistan 23 per cent of younger children didn’t have access to any device that could support remote learning. Poor and disadvantaged households have been the worst hit, with many families struggling to afford even a single device.
Even when devices are available, UNICEF’s research indicates that they are often underutilized and that children’s access to them is often limited. For example, in Pakistan, among children with access to devices, only about 24 per cent could use them when they wanted to.
The research found that student-teacher engagement, when regular and reciprocal, is a strong predictor of success in children’s learning, especially for younger students. However, the surveys found that most students had little or no contact with their teachers after schools closed. In Sri Lankan private primary schools, 52 per cent of teachers reported contacting their students five days a week, but this number dropped to only 8 per cent for teachers from public primary schools.
“The safe reopening of schools must be considered an utmost priority for all governments. Parallelly, investing in teachers will ensure that teachers and schools can adapt to all situations. The more teachers are trained, equipped and supported on distance and blended learning, the better they will be able to reach all their students,” added George Laryea-Adjei. “This is a critical investment we need to make for children as the region gears up for future waves of COVID-19. We need to build systems which can weather any storm and keep children learning, no matter the circumstances.”
To ensure that children keep learning, UNICEF is calling on:
·         Governments to prioritize the safe reopening of all schools, while also ensuring that children are able to pursue quality learning remotely if necessary
·         Teachers to assess children’s learning levels and ensure catch up is enabled through a "learning recovery" period
·         Governments to prioritize the vaccination of teachers to support the safe reopening of schools
·         Governments to train and equip teachers to better reach children and adolescents with limited or no access to technology through a combination of modalities including mobile devices, TV, radio, and printed materials
·         Governments and donors to protect and expand investments in education, including critical pre-primary and foundational literacy and numeracy
·         Private sector and civil society organizations to work with governments in improving connectivity and creating high-quality, multilingual remote learning content tailored to students’ needs

School closures in South Asia have compounded a situation which was already precarious. Even before the pandemic, almost 60 per cent of children in South Asia were unable to read and understand a simple text by the time they are 10 years old. In addition, 12.5 million children at the primary level and 16.5 million children at the lower secondary level were out of school.

Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore on unaccompanied and separated children evacuated from Afghanistan
NEW YORK, 7 September 2021 – “Since 14 August, hundreds of children have been separated from their families amidst chaotic conditions, including large-scale evacuations, in and around the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Some of these children were evacuated on flights to Germany, Qatar and other countries.  
 
“UNICEF and our partners have registered approximately 300 unaccompanied and separated children evacuated from Afghanistan. We expect this number to rise through ongoing identification efforts.  
 
“I can only imagine how frightened these children must have been to suddenly find themselves without their families as the crisis at the airport unfolded or as they were whisked away on an evacuation flight. 
 
“UNICEF is deeply concerned about the welfare of unaccompanied and separated children wherever they may be. They are among the most vulnerable children in the world. It is vital that they are quickly identified and kept safe during family tracing and reunification processes. All parties must prioritize the best interests of the child and protect children from abuse, neglect and violence.   
 
“During tracing and reunification processes, children should be provided with safe, temporary alternative care, preferably with extended family members or in a family-based setting. Placement within institutional care arrangements should be a last resort and only temporary.  

“Governments of countries where unaccompanied and separated children have family members should cooperate and facilitate reunification and safe, legal migration pathways for these children if it is in the child’s best interest. The definition of family members should be sufficiently broad to place unaccompanied children safely with relatives who will care for them.
 
“Likewise, children moving with trusted adults should remain with them if it is in their best interests to do so. Separating children from adults whom they know and from whom they receive care could cause further harm.  
 
“All children have the right to be with their families. Parties involved in evacuating and hosting people fleeing Afghanistan should make every effort to prevent the separation of families from occurring in the first place. This means ensuring proper coordination among civil and military actors, establishing basic registration of children and families, and verifying flight manifests.
“UNICEF is providing technical support to governments who have evacuated children and those who are hosting them. Right now, our teams are on the ground at the Doha air base in Qatar and the Ramstein air base in Germany, working with authorities and our partners to register unaccompanied children, provide them with appropriate care and protection, and support tracing to bring them back together with their families. 
 
“In Afghanistan, more than 550,000 people have been displaced by conflict, the majority in recent weeks, and 10 million children are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. We are very worried about the safety and wellbeing of unaccompanied and separated children inside the country. UNICEF and our partners need unimpeded humanitarian access to all parts of Afghanistan to gather an accurate picture of their number and whereabouts. This will be vital to reaching them with protection and services. 
 
“Now and in the days to come, it is imperative that all parties and the international community join us in prioritizing the wellbeing of children inside Afghanistan as well as those who have been evacuated.”

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY
OF CLEAN AIR FOR BLUE SKIES
7 September 2021
Today, as many as nine out of ten people breathe polluted air, leading to some 7 million premature deaths each year, of whom 600,000 are children.
Unless we act decisively, this number could double by 2050.
Like many societal ills, air pollution reflects global inequalities, with most deaths related to air pollution occurring in low- and middle-income countries, and in poorer neighbourhoods in wealthier nations
Poverty forces people to live close to sources of pollution, like factories and highways.
And poverty makes 3 billion people continue to burn solid fuels or kerosene for cooking, heating and lighting.
The pollution that is damaging our health is also driving the climate crisis.
But air pollution can be solved.
On the International Day of Clean Air for blue skies, I call on all countries to do more to improve air quality.
Better monitoring can identify sources of air pollution.
Evidence-based national legislation can help meet World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines.
And stronger emissions standards on vehicles, power plants, construction and industries can cut pollution.
I welcome the recent global phase-out of leaded petrol.
We must also accelerate access to clean cooking and clean heating.
We must invest in renewable energy instead of fossil fuels.
Coal use must be phased out.
And we must transition to zero emission vehicles.
If we take these steps, we can save as many as 150 million lives this century and help clean our atmosphere.
So, today and every day, let us work together to clean the air that we breathe so we may protect both people and the planet.

Digital Libas wins UNDP-Jazz SDG Bootcamp in Balochistan
Quetta, 6th Sep 2021: Digital Libas, a remote work providing social enterprise from Quetta, is the winner of the SDG Bootcamp for Social Enterprises organized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Jazz in Balochistan. The social enterprise will now participate in the national level SDG Bootcamp competition to be held later this year.
The runners up included Sustainable Design Studio, which provides green and sustainable design and architectural services to residential and commercial projects; and Rangoon Café, which seeks to establish a safe and productive space for people of different sects, cultures, and economic classes to interact and reduce discrimination in the region. Participants of the bootcamp learnt a variety of modules on how to market, scale up, and pitch their startups to potential investors.
Held online, the five-day bootcamp aimed at promoting social entrepreneurship and strengthening the startup ecosystem in the country. Ten social enterprises from Balochistan took part in the bootcamp, with nearly half of the participants being women. While majority of the participants were from Quetta, two enterprises took part from Mastung and Kalat as well. These social enterprises were trained in four modules: SDGs; Branding and Customer Engagement; Marketing and Digital Transformation; and Financial Management, Feasibility and Scaling.
Speaking during the session, Amir Goraya, Assistant Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan said, ‘Pakistan is one of the youngest countries in the world. With youth unemployment standing at 8.54%, we need to find innovative solutions to help youth find ways to earn a decent living. Entrepreneurship presents a great opportunity for young people to use their skills and talents to develop their own business; social entrepreneurship goes even further and presents youth with a chance to play a lead role in talking development challenges of the country through leadership, social innovation and entrepreneurship.’
Syed Fakhar Ahmed, Chief Regulatory and Corporate Affairs Officer, Jazz commented, “As a leader in digital technology, it is our duty to provide young people with a platform to succeed. I would like to congratulate the top three startups from Balochistan and hope they now implement the valuable lessons learnt and scale up their solution to make a positive impact on society.”
In December 2020, Jazz inked an agreement with UNDP’s Youth Empowerment Programme to conduct 20 bootcamps across Pakistan. Around 400 youth are expected to participate in the bootcamps this year, with  400 more planned for 2022. The focus will be on enterprises that relate to any of the Sustainable Development Goals, with 50% women participation. The most promising social venture ideas will be promoted at the international level and mentored by industry experts to further flourish their enterprises.
UNDP through Youth Empowerment Programme supports the Government of Pakistan in developing innovative and sustainable entry points for social engagement and economic empowerment of young Pakistanis. One of the key components of the Programme is to support youth entrepreneurship which not only empowers young people economically, but also spurs change and ensures inclusive development of the country. Through the SDG Bootcamps, UNDP and Jazz will be improving the startup ecosystem of the country and enabling youth to practically explore their innovative ideas and develop skills needed to succeed in the space.

World Social Protection Report 2020-22
More than 4 billion people still lack any social protection, ILO report finds
The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed and exacerbated the social protection gap between countries with high and low income levels.
GENEVA (ILO News) – Despite the unprecedented worldwide expansion of social protection during the COVID-19 crisis, more than 4 billion people around the world remain entirely unprotected, a new International Labour Organization (ILO) report says.

It finds that the pandemic response was uneven and insufficient, deepening the gap between countries with high and low income levels and failing to afford the much-needed social protection that all human beings deserve.

Social protection includes access to health care and income security, particularly in relation to old age, unemployment, sickness, disability, work injury, maternity or loss of a main income earner, as well as for families with children.

“Countries are at a crossroads,” said ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder. “This is a pivotal moment to harness the pandemic response to build a new generation of rights-based social protection systems. These can cushion people from future crises and give workers and businesses the security to tackle the multiple transitions ahead with confidence and with hope. We must recognize that effective and comprehensive social protection is not just essential for social justice and decent work but for creating a sustainable and resilient future too.”

The World Social Protection Report 2020-22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future  gives a global overview of recent developments in social protection systems, including social protection floors, and covers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The report identifies protection gaps and sets out key policy recommendations, including in relation to the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Currently, only 47 per cent of the global population are effectively covered by at least one social protection benefit, while 4.1 billion people (53 per cent) obtain no income security at all from their national social protection system.

There are significant regional inequalities in social protection. Europe and Central Asia have the highest rates of coverage, with 84 per cent of people being covered by at least one benefit. The Americas are also above the global average, with 64.3 per cent. Asia and the Pacific (44 per cent), the Arab States (40 per cent) and Africa (17.4 per cent) have marked coverage gaps.

Worldwide, the vast majority of children still have no effective social protection coverage – only one in four children (26.4 per cent) receives a social protection benefit. Only 45 per cent of women with newborns worldwide receive a cash maternity benefit. Only one in three persons with severe disabilities (33.5 per cent) worldwide receive a disability benefit. Coverage of unemployment benefits is even lower; only 18.6 per cent of unemployed workers worldwide are effectively covered. And while 77.5 per cent of people above retirement age receive some form of old-age pension, major disparities remain across regions, between rural and urban areas, and between women and men.

Government spending on social protection also varies significantly. On average, countries spend 12.8 per cent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on social protection (excluding health), however high-income countries spend 16.4 per cent and low-income countries only 1.1 per cent of their GDP on social protection.

The report says that the financing gap (the additional spending required to ensure at least minimum social protection for all) has increased by approximately 30 per cent since the start of the COVID-19 crisis.

To guarantee at least basic social protection coverage, low-income countries would need to invest an additional US$77.9 billion per year, lower-middle-income countries an additional US$362.9 billion per year and upper-middle-income countries a further US$750.8 billion per year. That’s equivalent to 15.9, 5.1 and 3.1 per cent of their GDP, respectively.

“There is an enormous push for countries to move to fiscal consolidation, after the massive public expenditure of their crisis response measures, but it would be seriously damaging to cut back on social protection; investment is required here and now,” said Shahra Razavi, Director, ILO Social Protection Department.

“Social protection is an important tool that can create wide-ranging social and economic benefits for countries at all levels of development. It can underpin better health and education, greater equality, more sustainable economic systems, better managed migration and the observance of core rights. Building the systems that can deliver these positive outcomes will require a mix of financing sources and greater international solidarity, particularly with support for poorer countries. But the benefits of success will reach beyond national borders to benefit us all,” she said.

Specific measures to promote universal social protection were highlighted in the Global Call to Action for a human-centred recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic . The Call to Action, which outlines a comprehensive agenda for recovery, was endorsed unanimously in June 2021 by the ILO’s Member States, representing governments, workers’ and employers’ organizations.

UNODC launches Case Management and Monitoring System (CMMS) for the Prosecution Department of Sindh
September 03, 2021 – Karachi: The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in partnership with the Prosecution Department of Sindh launched a software-based Case Management and Monitoring System (CMMS) at an inauguration ceremony in Karachi on Friday.
The CMMS which has been developed under the framework of Pakistan’s Action to Counter Terrorism (PACT) and is designed to automate the Prosecution Department’s administrative processes such as case assignment and tracking, streamlining the departments workflows, and create administrative efficiency in case management and adjudication. In particular the CMMS will help the assignment of complex cases to multiple experienced counsels, tracking of court proceedings as well as monitoring of the quality of prosecutions across Sindh province.
In order to maximize the operational efficiency of the CMMS, UNODC through the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) has also provided Prosecution Department with essential equipment including laptops and computers.
The inauguration ceremony was presided over by the Honorable Chief Justice of Sindh Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh and attended by EU’s Ambassador to Pakistan H.E. Androulla Kaminara, Country Representative of UNODC Mr. Jeremy Milsom, and key officials belonging to Sindh Police, Prosecution Department, and Judiciary.

The Honorable Chief Justice of Sindh lauded the initiative, as well as its promising impact on operational efficiency across Sindh’s criminal justice system, “This is a valuable innovation that will generate a compounding positive impact with use over time that will not be limited to prosecution department alone.”
The European Union’s Counter-Terrorism Counsellor in Pakistan Mr. François Zablot iterated EU’s resolute support in preventing and countering terrorism and added that “CMMS was a crucial need of the hour to ensure transparency, accountability and oversight when dealing with anti-terrorism cases. I hope that with effective use of this tool, we are able to enhance the capacity of the prosecution department, leading to successful adjudications.”
While making his remarks, the UNODC Country Representative Dr. Jeremy Milsom stated “I am pleased to see this initiative come to fruition, the CMMS is a prime example of use of technology to improve and enhance existing processes. CMMS enjoyed tremendous success in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and was a perfect use-case for Sindh. We hope to see it be even more successful in Sindh”
Participants of the inauguration ceremony were led through a presentation on the features of CMMS followed by a practical demonstration of case registration.
The initiative has been made possible under the framework of Pakistan’s Action to Counter Terrorism (PACT) project Sindh with the financial support of the European Union. This project was a result of a partnership between UNODC and Government of Pakistan through various federal and provincial stakeholders with the aim to enhance investigation processes and the use of forensic evidence by the Sindh Police to effectively prosecute and adjudicate terrorism cases and improve provincial and inter-provincial coordination and capacity for preventing and countering terrorism.

کراچی –3 ستمبر 2021 : اقوام متحدہ ادارہ برائے منشیات و جرائم (یو این او ڈی سی) نے محکمہ پراسیکیوشن سندھ کے اشتراک سے جمعہ کے روز کراچی میں منعقد کی گئی ایک تقریب میں "کیس مینجمنٹ اینڈ مانیٹرنگ سسٹم" (سی ایم ایم ایس) کے سافٹ ویئر کا اجراء کیا۔
یہ سافٹ ویئر 'پاکستان ایکشن ٹو کاؤنٹر ٹیررازم' (پیکٹ) کے فریم ورک کے تحت تیار کیا گیا ہے جس کا مقصد محکمہ پراسیکیوشن کی مختلف انتظامی سرگرمیوں مثلاً کیس اسائنمنٹ اور ٹریکنگ کی آٹومیشن کرنا، محکمے کی سرگرمیوں کو ایک باقاعدہ ترتیب میں لانا اور کیس مینجمنٹ اور قانونی چارہ جوئی کی سرگرمیوں میں انتظامی کارکردگی کو بہتر بنانا ہے۔ سی ایم ایم ایس کی بدولت پیچیدہ مقدمات ایک سے زائد تجربہ کار وکلاء کے سپرد کرنے، عدالتی کارروائی کی ٹریکنگ کرنے اور صوبہ سندھ میں استغاثہ کی کارروائی کے معیار کی نگرانی کرنے میں مدد ملے گی۔
سی ایم ایم ایس کی آپریشنل کارکردگی کو حتی الوسع حد تک بڑھانے کے لئے یو این او ڈی سی نے نیشنل کاؤنٹر ٹیررازم اتھارٹی (نیکٹا) کے ذریعے محکمہ پراسیکیوشن کو ضروری آلات اور سامان مثلاً  لیپ ٹاپ اور کمپیوٹر بھی فراہم کئے ہیں۔
افتتاحی تقریب کی صدارت سندھ ہائی کورٹ کے فاضل چیف جسٹس، جسٹس احمد علی ایم شیخ نے کی جس میں انسداد دہشت گردی پر یورپی یونین کے قونصلر جناب فرانسوا زابلوٹ اور یو این او ڈی سی کے کنٹری ریپریزنٹیٹو ڈاکٹر جیریمی ملسم کے علاوہ سندھ پولیس، محکمہ پراسیکیوشن اور عدلیہ سے تعلق رکھنے والے اہم افسران نے بھی شرکت کی۔
فاضل چیف جسٹس سندھ نے اس سافٹ ویئر اور اس کی بدولت سندھ کے فوجداری نظام انصاف کی آپریشنل کارکردگی پر مرتب ہونے والے شاندار ممکنہ اثرات کا خیرمقدم کیا۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ یہ ایک انتہائی مفید جدت ہے جس کے استعمال سے وقت کے ساتھ بے پناہ مثبت اثرات مرتب ہوں گے جو محض محکمہ پراسیکیوشن تک ہی محدود نہیں رہیں گے۔

Title: Media Update: United Nations Pakistan, 2 September 2021
Content: 02 September 2021
This Media Update includes:
On the day Afghanistan enters a new phase I want to express my grave concern at the deepening humanitarian and economic crisis in the country and the threat of basic services collapsing completely.
Today, almost half of the population of Afghanistan – 18 million people – need humanitarian assistance to survive. One in three Afghans do not know where their next meal will come from. More than half of all children under-five are expected to become acutely malnourished in the next year. People are losing access to basic goods and services every day. A humanitarian catastrophe looms.
Now more than ever, Afghan children, women and men need the support and solidarity of the international community. The humanitarian system’s commitment to stay and deliver will not waver. Already this year, we have delivered aid to eight million people. In the last fortnight we delivered food to 80,000 people and relief packages to thousands of displaced families.
Yesterday we airlifted 12.5 metric tons of medical supplies into the country.
Amid a severe drought and with harsh winter conditions on the horizon, extra food, shelter and health supplies must be urgently fast-tracked into the country. I call on all parties to facilitate safe and unimpeded humanitarian access for life-saving and life-sustaining supplies, as well as for all humanitarian workers – men and women.
Next week, we will release details of the most immediate humanitarian needs and funding requirements over the next four months in a Flash Appeal for Afghanistan. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths is coordinating the entire UN system in the preparation of the appeal.
I urge all Member States to dig deep for the people of Afghanistan in their darkest hour of need. I urge them to provide timely, flexible and comprehensive funding. I urge them to help ensure humanitarian workers have the funding, access, and legal safeguards they need to stay and deliver.

افغانستان کی صورتحال پر سیکرٹری جنرل اقوامِ متحدہ کا بیان
افغانستان اپنی تاریخ کے ایک نئے دور میں داخل ہو رہا ہے اور اس وقت میرے نزدیک یہ بات گہری تشویش کا باعث ہے کہ ملک میں انسانی و فلاحی اور اقتصادی بحران دن بہ دن شدت پکڑ رہا ہے اور بنیادی سہولیات و خدمات کے نظام مکمل تباہی کے خطرے سے دوچار ہیں۔

آج افغانستان کی تقریباً نصف آبادی یعنی ایک کروڑ اسی لاکھ افراد کو زندہ رہنے کے لئے انسانی فلاحی امداد کی ضرورت ہے۔ ہر تیسرا افغان شہری اس بات سے بے خبر ہے کہ اگلے وقت کا کھانا کہاں سے ملے گا۔ خدشہ ہے کہ پانچ سال سے کم عمر کے نصف سے زائد بچے آئندہ سال میں شدید غذائی کمی کا شکار ہو جائیں گے۔ روزمرہ استعمال کی بنیادی اشیاء، خدمات اور سہولیات لوگوں کی پہنچ سے باہر ہو رہی ہیں۔ ایک بڑا انسانی بحران ہمارے سروں پر منڈلا رہا ہے۔
افغان بچوں، خواتین اور مردوں کو عالمی برادری کی مدد، حمایت اور اظہار یکجہتی کی ضرورت آج پہلے سے کہیں زیادہ ہے۔ فلاحی اداروں کا پورا نظام اپنی جگہ ثابت قدم ہے اور اس کے عزم میں ہرگز کمی نہیں آئے گی۔ صرف رواں سال کے دوران اسی لاکھ افراد کو امداد فراہم کی جا چکی ہے۔ گزشتہ پندرہ روز میں اسی ہزار افراد کو کھانے پینے کی اشیاء اور نقل مکانی کرنے والے ہزاروں خاندانوں کو ریلیف پیکج دئیے گئے۔ گزشتہ روز 12.5 ٹن طبی سامان اور ادویات افغانستان پہنچائی گئیں۔
شدید خشک سالی اور سخت سردی کا موسم آنے کو ہے اور ان حالات میں اضافی خوراک، رہائشی سہولیات اور حفظانِ صحت کا سامان فی الفور افغانستان پہنچانے کی سرگرمیوں میں تیزی لانا ناگزیر ہے۔ میری تمام فریقوں سے اپیل ہے کہ وہ فلاحی سرگرمیوں کے تحت زندگی بچانے والی اور زندگی کو رواں رکھنے والی اشیاء  کے ساتھ ساتھ تمام فلاحی کارکنوں کو بھی محفوظ اور بلاروک ٹوک پہنچانے میں مدد دیں۔
افغانستان پر فوری اپیل کے تحت ہم آئندہ ہفتے ان ناگزیر امدادی اور مالی ضروریات کی تفصیلات جاری کریں گے جن کی ضرورت آئندہ چند ماہ کے دوران پڑے گی۔  انسانی فلاحی امور کے انڈر سیکرٹری جنرل اور ایمرجنسی ریلیف کوآرڈینیٹر مارٹن گرفتھس اس اپیل کی تیاری کے سلسلے میں اقوام متحدہ کے تمام اداروں کی سرگرمیوں باہمی رابطے کے فرائض انجام دے رہے ہیں۔
میری تمام رکن ریاستوں سے اپیل ہے کہ وہ انتہائی ضرورت کی اس تاریک گھڑی میں افغانستان کے عوام کا بھرپور ساتھ دیں۔ میری ان سب سے اپیل ہے کہ مالی تعاون بروقت، لچکدار اور جامع انداز میں فراہم کریں۔ میں ان سے اپیل کرتا ہوں کہ وہ فلاحی کارکنوں کو افغانستان میں رہنے اور اپنا کام بطریق احسن انجام دینے کے لئے درکار مالی وسائل، رسائی اور قانونی حفاظتی اقدامات یقینی بنانے میں مدد دیں۔

Pakistan Private Sector Energy Project
E-mobility Forum - “A Business Opportunity in Motion”
On 26th August, USAID, UNIDO and Private Financing Advisory Network (PFAN) hosted a webinar on e-mobility and the potential of electric vehicles to mitigate carbon emissions in Pakistan. The multi-stakeholder online event shed light on the business potential in the electric transition of the country.
The forum was held to discuss electric vehicles and e-infrastructure building as key priority areas within the PFAN Pakistan Private Sector Energy Project (PPSE) project, which aims to expand the portfolio of commercially-viable clean energy projects in Pakistan and provide support to enable them to access financing and reach financial close.
Launched officially in February 2021, PPSE is funded by USAID and implemented by UNIDO and PFAN, the project targets small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Pakistan working on the country’s energy transition to mitigate carbon emissions and bolster climate innovation and resilience.
The forum commenced with opening comments from Peter Storey, Acting Chief of Party for PPSE and PFAN Global Coordinator, who commented on how the PFAN methodology has been especially contextualized towards the needs and potential of the Pakistani clean energy landscape for the PPSE
“In an intensive market scoping study conducted at the beginning of PPSE project, the e-mobility sector was identified as showing significant potential for deal flow and investment,” said Storey.
Rabia Bukhari, Program Management Specialist, Energy, USAID, commented on Pakistan’s climate vulnerability and which initiatives USAID is undertaking to help the country’s climate mitigation and resilience.
Pakistan has consistently ranked among the top 10 countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
“Having an affordable EV charging infrastructure is equally important and in this regard USAID is partnering with the US Department of Energy to advise NEPRA, the regulatory authority for EVs.  We are in discussion to review electrical standards and monitoring structure to ensure charging efficiency,” said Bukhari.
Following was a presentation from Deputy Chief of Party, PFAN PPSE, Ghazil Jabbar, on PPSE’s value proposition to entrepreneurs.
Jabbar shared that PFAN has supported nearly 1,000 projects with more than 300 projects in the current pipeline, raising USD 2 billion in total investment leveraged by PFAN-supported projects.
Nagaraja Rao, Head of Investment Facilitation, PFAN speaking to the prospective and budding EV market, Rao shared that a record $12.8B in funding was raised over 193 deals in 2020 from electric vehicles alone.
A panel discussion proceeded and brought together various key players from the private, public and academic sector. The panel comprised of Ali Khar, CEO Ona Mobility; Naveed Arshad; Founder Neubolt/ Associate Professor, LUMS; Asim Ayaz, GM Policy, Engineering Development Board and Muhammad Iftikhar Javed, Head Auto Business,Bank Alfalah
Ayaz shared that entrepreneurs in the EV sector are always welcome to connect with EDB and visit their office for more information and guidance.
Khar stressed the importance of the role reducing the electricity tariff to drive EV production and consumer adoption forward. He called the latest EV policy a “launching pad” for innovation and scaling up.
Dr. Arshad noted that Pakistan is theoretically one of the countries in the world that is ripe for the electric vehicle transition due to its vast electricity reserves, however he stressed the electricity infrastructure needs to be strengthened.
“One thing about the EV value chain that needs to be solved in the country is the battery, whoever can crack this puzzle, will see a lot of success and make the value chain stronger,” added Dr. Arshad.
Speaking to the finance opportunities and challenges, Javed shared that there are some risks with secondary re-sale of EVs but banks such as Alfalah are working to de-risk buying and selling of EVs.
During the online event, several polls were launched and were answered by almost 100 participants.  57% attendees felt lack of access to financing was seen as the biggest challenge to mainstream e-mobility in Pakistan. Whereas, 41% thought that access to investment by private institutions will drive Pakistan’s EV sector forward.

سندھ پولیس کے انٹی ٹیررازم فنانسنگ یونٹ (اے ٹی ایف یو)  کو مضبوط بنانے کے اقدامات
2 ستمبر 2021: اقوام متحدہ کے دفتر برائے انسدادِ منشیات و جرائم (یو این او ڈی سی) نے یورپی یونین کے تعاون اور نیشنل کاؤنٹر ٹیررازم اتھارٹی (نیکٹا) کے اشتراک سے سندھ پولیس کے انٹی ٹیررازم فنانسنگ یونٹ (اے ٹی ایف یو) کو نئے سرے سے مضبوط بنانے کے لئے مختلف ضروری آلات اور سامان فراہم کر دیا ہے۔ اس سلسلے میں ایک تقریب کراچی میں منعقد ہوئی جس میں بین الاقوامی برادری کے معزز ارکان نے شرکت کی۔
"پاکستان ایکشن ٹو کاؤنٹر ٹیررازم" (پیکٹ) پرجیکٹ کے فریم ورک کے تحت فراہم کئے گئے ان آلات اور سامان کے علاوہ یو این او ڈی سی اور نیکٹا کی جانب سے گزشتہ ایک سال کے عرصے میں دہشت گردی کی مالی معاونت کے خاتمہ پر 10 سپیشلائزڈ ورکشاپس کا اہتمام بھی کیا جا چکا ہے جن کے ذریعے سندھ میں تفتیشی افسران اورپراسیکیوٹرز کے علم اور مہارتوں کو بہتر بنایا گیا۔ پیکٹ پراجیکٹ کے تحت تقریباً 300 افسران کو دہشت گردی کی مالی معاونت سے متعلق خطرات اور تفتیش کے طریقوں پر تربیت دی جا چکی ہے۔
نئے یونٹ کا افتتاح کرتے ہوئے یو این او ڈی سی کے کنٹری ریپریزنٹیٹو ڈاکٹر جیریمی ملسم نے اس بات پر زور دیا کہ یو این او ڈی سی نے تفتیشی افسران کو روزمرہ سرگرمیوں میں مدد دینے کے لئے سپیشلائزڈ تربیت اور عملی سرگرمیوں میں کام آنے والے آلات اور سامان فراہم کرنے کا تہیہ کر رکھا ہے۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ حکومت سندھ نے پاکستان میں صوبائی سطح پر انٹی ٹیررازم یونٹ کے قیام میں پہل کی ہے جس میں تفتیشی افسران کو قانونی مشاورت فراہم کرنے والے پراسیکیوٹرز بھی شامل ہیں۔ ڈاکٹر جیریمی ملسم نے اس بات پر خوشی کا اظہار کیا کہ یو این او ڈی سی،  پیکٹ پراجیکٹ کے تحت عمل میں لائی جانے والی اس کاوش میں شریک ہے اور ضروری آلات و سامان کی فراہمی کے ذریعے نہ صرف سازگار ماحول پیدا کرنے پر کام کر رہا ہے بلکہ اے ٹی ایف یو، کے عملے کو سپیشلائزڈ تربیت بھی فراہم کر رہا ہے جس سے دہشت گردی کی مالی معاونت کے خاتمہ کی کوششوں کو بہتر بنانے میں مدد ملی ہے۔
تقریب میں یورپی یونین کی نمائندگی جناب فرانسوا زابلوٹ نے کی۔ اس موقع پر اظہار خیال کرتے ہوئے انہوں نے صوبہ سندھ میں دہشت گردی کی مالی معاونت سے متعلق چیلنجوں پر قابو پانے کے لئے سندھ پولیس کی کوششوں کو سراہا اور کہا کہ معلومات کے باہمی تبادلے کے لئے تمام متعلقہ فریقوں کے درمیان زیادہ باہم مربوط لائحہ عمل کی ضرورت ہے اور اے ٹی ایف یو کا قیام اس سلسلے میں درست سمت میں ایک قدم ہے۔
محکمہ انسداد دہشت گردی سندھ پولیس کے ڈپٹی انسپکٹر جنرل (ڈی آئی جی) جناب عمر شاہد نے یو این او ڈی سی اور یورپی یونین کی کوششوں کو سراہا اور اے ٹی ایف یو کو فعال بنانے میں ان کے فراخدلانہ کردار پر انسپکٹر جنرل پولیس کی جانب سے دونوں اداروں کا شکریہ ادا کیا۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ پیکٹ پراجیکٹ صف اول میں کام کرنے والے تفتیشی افسران کی استعداد میں پائی جانے والی کمی کو دور کر رہا ہے اور انسداد دہشت گردی کے شعبے میں ان کی صلاحیتوں کو بہتر بنانے کے لئے سرگرم عمل ہے۔ انہوں نے اس بات پر خوشی کا اظہار کیا کہ پراجیکٹ کو صوبے کی ضروریات کے مطابق ڈھال دیا گیا ہے اور اب یہ مشترکہ مقاصد کے حصول کے لئے ہماری کوششوں کے لئے تقویت کا باعث بن رہا ہے۔
افتتاحی تقریب میں محکمہ داخلہ اور سندھ پولیس کے افسران کے علاوہ کراچی میں واقع مختلف قونصلیٹ جنرلز کے نمائندوں نے بھی شرکت کی۔

Signing of New Agreement with Government of Denmark
The Government of Denmark signed a DKK 10 Million partnership agreement with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) – UN Migration Agency in Pakistan to assist Pakistani authorities and build capacity to meet the challenges as a result of irregular migration. Under the signed partnership agreement, Denmark will provide funds to implement a comprehensive and coordinated response to combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP) and Smuggling of Migrants (SOM) in Pakistan.
The partnership agreement was signed by the H.E Lis Rosenholm, Ambassador of Denmark to Pakistan and Ms. Mio Sato, Chief of Mission, IOM Pakistan at the Danish Embassy in Islamabad. IOM, in close partnership with the Federal Investigation Agency of Pakistan will implement a range of activities relating to prevention of TIP and SOM as well as ensuring protection of victims of these organized crimes. IOM Pakistan has closely aligned all project activities with the priorities of the FIA as outlined in their National Action Plan (2021-2025) to Combat TIP and SOM in Pakistan.
Over a duration of three years, IOM will strengthen technical capacities of relevant stakeholders’ immigration and border management officials to prevent irregular migration, work closely with vulnerable populations to encourage regular migration as opposed to irregular migration and provide direct assistance to victims of TIP and SOM, enabling them to sustainably reintegrate into the society. The new partnership is initiated in pursuance of the successfully implemented project “Enhancing Capacities to Manage Migration and Borders Project” in Pakistan. This project was also funded by Denmark and focused on (i) developing a readmission case management system, (ii) capacity building and institutional strengthening and (iii) improving the evidence base to counter migrants smuggling.
The Ambassador of Denmark, H.E. Lis Rosenholm, expressed her appreciation for the close cooperation with the Federal Investigation Agency and IOM, and added “Denmark’s support is in natural extension of the Danish government’s wish to work with international partners to find ways to improve the international response to challenges with irregular migration, including human trafficking and smuggling”.
Speaking at the occasion, Ms. Mio Sato thanked the Government of Denmark for their gracious support towards this much-needed initiative. She added, “IOM looks forward to furthering cooperation with the Government of Denmark through this project that would significantly strengthen capacities of the FIA to curb irregular migration from Pakistan in a holistic manner”.

Joint statement by UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore and Special Representative of the Secretary General on Children and Armed Conflict Virginia Gamba on the 25th anniversary of Graça Machel’s seminal report on the impact of war on children
UN has verified and reported 266,000 cases of grave rights violations against children in conflict zones since 2005
Download fact sheet on the impact of conflict on children here

NEW YORK, 27 August 2021 – “Twenty-five years ago, Graça Machel released her report to the United Nations, ‘The impact of war on children’, which urged the international community to take concrete action to protect children from the scourge of war and called on the United Nations and the global community to act to protect children.
“The international community heeded the call and took action based on Machel’s recommendations, with the General Assembly establishing the Office of the SRSG on children and armed conflict, and the Security Council establishing a coordinated UN monitoring and reporting mechanism to continue to track the impact of war on children.
“Since then, The United Nations (UN) has verified 266,000 cases of grave violations against children in more than 30 conflict situations across Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America over the past 16 years. This includes more than 104,100 children killed and maimed, 93,000 children recruited and used in fighting and support roles, 25,700 children abducted, and another 14,200 child victims of sexual violence.

“In 2020, the UN verified a total of 26,425 violations against children in conflict situations. This corresponds to 72 violations occurring every single day or three violations every hour. It also marked the seventh year in a row with at least 20,000 verified violations.
“These are only the cases that can be verified through the UN-led Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism, established in 2005 to systematically document the most egregious violations against children in conflict zones. The true figures are undoubtedly much higher.

“But these are not mere statistics. Rather, they represent young lives that have been lost or otherwise devastated by horrifying trauma and suffering. Indeed, many children suffer from more than one grave violation. In 2020, the UN verified that about 10 per cent of the nearly 20,000 affected children were victims of two or more grave violations.
“Despite these continuing impacts on children, significant progress has been made since the report was released, to protect children from conflict. This includes the implementation of global measures and strategies to help keep children safe. Notable examples are the Paris Principles which aim to prevent the recruitment and use of children in armed forces and groups and the Safe School Declaration to strengthen the protection of education from attack and restrict use of schools and universities for military purposes.
“In addition, the UN continues to work directly with families and communities to reduce children’s vulnerabilities and provide them with the support they need to recover from war. Over the years, the UN and its partners have worked relentlessly to secure the release of thousands of children associated with armed forces and armed groups, including 12,643 children in 2020, and provide them with appropriate care and reintegration services.

“Across conflict situations, the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Children and Armed Conflict (SRSG CAAC) supports the engagement of the UN with all parties to conflict to enter into written timebound commitments to end and prevent violations. UNICEF, through its programmatic presence, together with the co-chairs of the country task forces on monitoring and reporting and UN child protection monitors and experts, assists in identifying entry points for engagement with commanders from armed forces and groups to negotiate concrete measures to protect children. Since 2005, 35 Action Plans and an increasing number of unilateral commitments have been signed by parties to conflict in 17 conflict situations, and have put in place measures to:
· Protect children from the impact of war
· Prevent grave violations from occurring
· Release children associated with armed forces and armed groups and reintegrate them in their communities,
· Protect children from sexual violence,
· Protect schools and hospitals and
· Hold perpetrators accountable.
“Nevertheless, grave rights violations continue, pointing to a widespread and appalling disregard for the rights and wellbeing of children by parties to conflict. At this time, just 18 of the 61 parties to conflict listed in the annexes of the 2021 Secretary-General’s annual report on children and armed conflict have a joint Action Plan or similar commitments with the UN to prevent grave rights violations against children. This is unacceptable. All parties listed should agree and adhere to an Action Plan to protect children and to put in place measures to prevent violations against children from occurring in the first place.

“As Graça Machel said 25 years ago, ‘The impact of conflict on children is everyone’s responsibility, and it must be everyone’s concern’. Parties to conflict and those with influence over them, as well as the international community, should heed this call to action and redouble efforts to end grave violations of children’s rights. All children have the right to be protected from harm and to live in peace.”

COVAX delivers first batch of 10 million doses of US-donated Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in Pakistan
This first batch of 3 million doses is the first out of a total of 10 million doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine donated by the Government of the United States and delivered by the COVAX facility as part of its dose-sharing mechanism.
ISLAMABAD, 26 August 2021 – Today three million doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine donated by the Government of the United States were delivered by the COVAX Facility to Pakistan. This is the first tranche of 10,358,010 US-donated doses which are being supplied through the global COVID-19 equity scheme’s dose-sharing mechanism.
Over the past four months, COVAX has delivered more than 17 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Pakistan. This includes 3 million doses of Pfizer and 5.5 million doses of Moderna donated by the United States under COVAX’s dose-sharing mechanism; 6.1 million doses of Sinopharm, 2.4 million doses of AstraZeneca and 100,160 doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine procured by COVAX. More doses are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.
All doses support the Government of Pakistan’s national vaccination campaign. The National Command and Operation Center has just announced that children above the age of 17 would be eligible for vaccination from September 1st, as well as anyone above 12 who is immunocompromised.
“COVID -19 vaccines are effective and safe. The arrival of additional COVAX vaccine comes at a crucial time when Pakistan is facing a surge in COVID-19 infections with approximately reporting 4,000 cases per day.  WHO appreciates the Government of the United States for their continued and generous support to Pakistan, said Dr Palitha Mahipala, WHO Representative in Pakistan. “WHO is committed to ensuring equitable vaccine allocation leaving no one behind and fully support the Government of Pakistan’s efforts to increase availability and safe administration of vaccines to cover 70 million people by end of this year. WHO urges people to maintain COVID protective measures while the national vaccination campaign continues to be rolled out and expanded.”
In the past seven months, 14 million people have been fully vaccinated, and 38 million have received a first dose of vaccine against the coronavirus COVID-19 in Pakistan. The Government-led campaign relies on vaccines procured via COVAX and through bilateral agreements.
More than one million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the country so far and more than 25,000 people have succumbed to the virus.
“UNICEF thanks the Government of United States for its generous donation of vaccines to Pakistan through the COVAX facility. We look forward to more vaccines becoming available in the country as other COVAX partners share their doses of vaccines and help secure full funding for the global initiative and more vaccines. Worldwide solidarity is the only way to ensure equitable vaccine access for every person on Earth, so they can have access to the same protection against COVID-19, no matter where they live,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “UNICEF commends the Government of Pakistan for its efficient roll-out of the vaccination campaign, which will now include children above the age of 17 and children above 12 who are immunocompromised, as announced by the National Command and Operation Center. We must also ensure that women get vaccinated, including pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, for whom COVID-19 vaccines are safe. UNICEF will continue to offer technical, logistical and communication support to the NCOC’s plan to vaccinate at least 70 million people by the end of this year.”
Strictly complying with COVID-19 safety measures remains crucial to curb the spread of the virus. These include regularly washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds or use a sanitizer; wear a mask; remain at least six feet away from other people; avoid crowded places; and stay home when having COVID-19 symptoms.
“The COVAX Facility and Gavi are proud to support this delivery of COVID vaccines and commend the Government of Pakistan for their continuing efforts to ensure that vulnerable populations in Pakistan are protected from COVID-19,” said Alexa Reynolds, Gavi Senior Country Manager for Pakistan.
The COVAX Facility aims to help address the acute phase of the global pandemic by the end of 2021 by providing rapid, fair, and equitable access to approved vaccines to all participating countries, regardless of income level. It enables the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.
COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access) is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, together with UNICEF. It is funded thanks to generous support from partner governments, foundations, and private sector corporations. So far it has delivered more than 90 million doses of different COVID-19 vaccines to 133 countries and territories around the world.

یہ تمام خوراکیں حکومت پاکستان کی  طرف سے جاری  قومی  سطح پر ویکسین لگانے کی  مہم  میں استعمال کی جائیں گی ۔ نیشنل کمانڈ اینڈ آپریشن سینٹر نے ابھی اعلان کیا ہے کہ 17سال سے زائد عمر کے بچے یکم ستمبر سے ویکسین لگوانے   کے اہل ہوں گے اور 12 سال سے  زیادہ عمر کے کسی بھی فرد کی  قوتِ معدافت  میں اضافے پر  اب  سمجھوتہ نہیں کیا جائے گا۔
پاکستان میں ڈبلیو ایچ او کی نمائندہ ڈاکٹر پلیتھا مہیپالا  نے اس موقع پر گفتگو  کرتے ہوئے کہا کہ کووڈ-19 ویکسین محفوظ  اور موثر  ہے۔ ویکسین کی اضافی مقدار ایک ایسے وقت   میں  فراہم  کی گئی ہے جب پاکستان  میں کووڈ-19  کے کیسوں میں اضافہ دیکھنے میں آرہا ہے  اور روزانہ تقریباً  4000  کیس منظرِ عام پر آرہے ہیں۔ انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ عالمی ادارۂ صحت  امریکی  حکومت کو پاکستان کی مسلسل  فیاضانہ مدد پر سراہتا  ہے ۔   ادارہ    یہ یقینی بنا رہا ہے کہ ہر ایک کو مساوات کے اصولوں کی روشنی میں  ویکسین فراہم کی جائے  تاکہ کوئی ویکسین سے محروم نہ رہ جائے۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ ادارہ  یہ بھی  یقینی بنا رہا ہے کہ اس سال کے اختتام تک  حکومتِ پاکستان کے اقدامات  سے  تعاون کرتے ہوئے  70  ملین افراد کو  محفوظ انداز میں ویکسین دینے کا عمل مکمل   ہوجائے۔ ’’جبکہ قومی ویکسینیشن مہم جاری ہے اور اس میں توسیع کی جارہی ہے،   عالمی ادارہ صحت لوگوں پر زور دیتا ہے کہ وہ حفاظتی اقدامات پر  سختی سے عمل کریں  ‘‘۔
گذشتہ  سات ماہ کے دوران ایک کروڑ 40  لاکھ افراد کو مکمل طور پر ویکسین لگائی جا چکی  ہے اور  38ملین افراد نے ابھی  پاکستان میں کورونا وائرس کووڈ-19 کے خلاف ویکسین کی پہلی خوراک  لگوائی  ہے۔  حکومت کی قیادت  میں چلنے والی  ملک گیر  مہم  کا انحصار  کویکس   اور دو طرفہ معاہدوں کے ذریعے  حاصل ہونے والی    ویکسین پرہے۔
ملک میں  اب تک    کووڈ-19 کے ملین سے زائدکیسز رپورٹ ہو چکے ہیں اور  25ہزار سے زائد افراد اس  وائرس کی وجہ سے بیماری کا  شکار ہو چکےہیں۔
یونیسف  نےکویکس  کی سہولت کے ذریعے پاکستان کو ویکسین کے فراخ دلانہ عطیات فراہم کرنے  پر امریکی حکومت کا شکریہ ادا کیا  ۔اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے  پاکستان میں یونیسف  کی  نمائندہ ایڈا گیرمانے کہا  کہ ہم ملک میں مزید ویکسین دستیاب ہونے کے منتظر ہیں ۔   کویکس  اور اس کے  دیگر  شراکت دار ویکسین کی   خوراک تقسیم  کرنے میں مصروف ہیں  اور  عالمی اقدام اور مزید و یکسین کی  کے لئے  مالی معاونت  فراہم  کرنے میں مدد کرتےہیں۔
انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ دنیا بھر میں یکجہتی کے جذبے کی مدد سے  ہی زمین پر ہر شخص کے لئے مساوی ویکسین تک رسائی   یقینی  بنائی جاسکتی ہے  تاکہ دنیا کے ہر خطے اور ہر ملک میں رہنے والے  لوگ  کووڈ-19 کے  حملے سے  یکساں  طور پر محفوظ رہ سکیں ۔  نیشنل کمانڈاینڈ آپریشن سینٹر کے اعلان کے مطابق یونیسف  نے حکومت پاکستان  کی جانب سے  جاری ویکسین لگانے کی  مہم  کو انتہائی موثر انداز میں  چلانے پر پاکستان کی تعریف کی ہے ۔  اس مہم میں    اب 17   اور 12 سال   زائد عمر کے بچے بھی  شامل ہوں گے جن کی قوت ِ مدافعت کی تعمیر پر اس وقت تک سمجھوتہ کیا جارہا  تھا ۔ انہوں نے  زور دیا کہ   ہمیں یہ بھی یقینی بنانا ہوگا کہ خواتین کو  بھی ویکسین فراہم کی جائے  اور ان  میں حاملہ اور دودھ پلانے والی ماؤں کو بھی  شامل کیا جائے  کیونکہ    کووڈ-19 ویکسین  ان خواتین کے لئے محفوظ ہے ۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ  یونیسف رواں سال کےآخر تک کم از کم 70 ملین افراد کو ویکسین  لگانے کے لئے  این سی او سی کے منصوبے کوتکنیکی،  لاجسٹک  اور ابلاغِ عامہ کے شعبوں میں معاونت فراہم کرتا رہے گا۔
وائرس کے پھیلاؤ کو روکنے کے لئے کووڈ-19 حفاظتی اقدامات کی   سختی سے تعمیل کرنا انتہائی ضروری  ہے۔ ان   اقدامات میں کم از کم 20 سیکنڈ تک باقاعدگی سے صابن سے ہاتھ دھونا یا سینیٹائزر کا استعمال کرنا؛ ماسک پہننا؛ دوسرے لوگوں سے کم از کم چھ فٹ  کا فاصلہ رکھنا ؛  پر ہجوم مقامات پر جانے  سے پرہیز کرنا  اور  کووڈ-19 علامات  ظاہر ہونے کی صورت میں گھر پر رہنا شامل ہیں۔
پاکستان کے لئے گاوی کے سینئر کنٹری منیجر الیکسا رینالڈزنے کہا کہ کویکس کی سہولت  اور گاوی کو کووڈ ویکسین کی   فراہمی کے سلسلے میں مدد کرنے  پر فخر محسوس ہورہا  ہے اور وہ حکومت پاکستان کی جانب سے کمزور طبقات کو کووڈ 19 سے محفوظ رکھنے کو یقینی بنانے کی مسلسل کوششوں کو سراہتے ہیں۔
کویکس  کا مقصد آمدنی کی سطح سے قطع نظر تمام شریک ممالک کی  منظور شدہ ویکسین تک تیز رفتار، منصفانہ اور منصفانہ رسائی فراہم کرکے 2021 کے آخر تک عالمی وبا کی  شدت کے حامل  مراحل  سے نمٹنے میں مدد کرنا ہے۔ ویکسین تقسیم کرنے کا یہ عمل   فرنٹ لائن ہیلتھ کیئر اور سماجی کارکنوں کے ساتھ ساتھ  زیادہ خطرات سے دوچار اور کمزور افراد کے گروہوں کا  عالمی وبا سے تحفظ  یقینی بنا رہا ہے ۔
کویکس  (کووڈ-19 ویکسین گلوبل ایکسس)   کی مشترکہ قیادت گاوی، اتحاد برائے وبائی تیاری و  اختراعات (سی ای پی آئی) اور ڈبلیو ایچ او، یونیسف  کے ساتھ مل کررہےہیں۔ اس  اقدام کی مالی معاونت شراکت دار حکومتیں ، فاؤنڈیشنز  اور نجی شعبے کی کارپوریشنز  کی فیاضانہ مالی امداد   سے  کی جاتی ہے۔  اس اقدام کی مدد سے  اب تک اس  نے دنیا بھر کے 133 ممالک اور علاقوں کو مختلف کووڈ-19 ویکسین کی 90 ملین سے زائد خوراکیں فراہم کی  جا چکی ہیں۔

Islamabad – August 23, 2021: The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) handed over 1000 Oxygen Concentrators and related accessories worth USD 1.4 million to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MoNH,R&C), in Islamabad today.
The Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health, Dr. Faisal Sultan received the life-saving medical devices used for treating patients suffering from coronavirus infection, birth asphyxia and complicated pneumonia, from the UNICEF Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Aida Girma.
"The Delta variant has contributed to the current wave of Covid-19 in Pakistan and with a resultant inflow of hospitalized patients,” said APM Dr. Faisal Sultan. "UNICEF's timely contribution will supplement the Ministry's continuous efforts to augment the healthcare system and provide the best possible care to all patients. We value our partnership with UNICEF, which actively participates in various aspects of Pakistan's pandemic response."
The 1000 Oxygen Concentrators which have been procured by UNICEF with funds provided by the Government of Canada’s global contributions Accelerator Supplies Financing Facility, will be distributed by the MoNH,R&C to 289 health facilities in four provinces and the federal areas of Islamabad.
“UNICEF commends the Government of Pakistan’s enduring efforts to fight the recurrent waves of coronavirus in the country and is determined to continue its support to national response, including through the procurement and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines or life-saving medical equipment, such as Oxygen Concentrators,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan.
“With the fourth wave of COVID-19 and the new Delta variant causing yet another spike of infections across the country, under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, we are campaigning hard for all men and women above 18 years of age, to get vaccinated while continuing to strictly adhere to precautionary measures, such as social distancing, wearing of facial mask, frequent hand-washing with soap to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.”
Including the latest consignment, UNICEF has so far provided a total of 3065 Oxygen Concentrators to the Government of Pakistan, during the last twelve months. Earlier, UNICEF had provided 525 Oxygen concentrators from its own funds, 220 from funds received from the Asian Development Bank and 1320 from the World Bank’s Pandemic Emergency Funding.

MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE OF
AND TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS OF TERRORISM
21 August 2021
Today, we remember and pay tribute to all victims and survivors of terrorism.  We stand in solidarity with those whose loved ones have been killed, those who still suffer from physical and psychological harm, and those communities and societies that have been permanently scarred by terrorist acts.
We support survivors by listening to and amplifying their voices, upholding their rights and providing the support, justice and dignity to which they are entitled.  This year’s observance focuses on the importance of connections, especially during the ongoing pandemic, which continues to restrict movements, limit peoples’ ability to see loved ones and, for victims and survivors, denies them the opportunity to come together to support each other.
Connection can be a powerful agent of healing, helping terrorism survivors around the world to feel heard, seen and less alone.  Connections between survivors, victims’ associations, civil society and Member States are also crucial in helping better uphold the rights and support the needs of victims now and in the future.  I look forward to seeing how we can further these efforts during the first ever United Nations Global Congress of Victims of Terrorism to be held later this year.
The United Nations is committed to a world free from terrorism.  On this International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism, and on all days, let us stand in solidarity with all victims and survivors so we may support them in healing their trauma and bring them hope.

MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY COMMEMORATING
THE VICTIMS OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE BASED ON RELIGION OR BELIEF
22 August 2021
Today we honour and remember the victims of acts of violence based on religion or belief.
Across the world, we continue to witness a rise in hate speech, intolerance, and even physical violence and attacks on individuals, groups, and sites, purely because of their religious beliefs or significance.
This violence often goes hand-in-hand with the infringement of other fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of thought or conscience. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has fueled racism, stigma, and disinformation, often targeting ethnic and religious minorities, has further exacerbated this dangerous convergence.
Despite the risks, victims continue to speak out with great courage to defend their rights. I stand in full solidarity with them — and with the determined efforts of civil society actors, community and faith leaders, to mobilize against any act of violence or discrimination.
States have the primary responsibility to prohibit and deter discrimination and violence and to protect the human rights of religious minorities and ensure that perpetrators of these crimes are held accountable. At the same time, the international community must do more to support the victims of these heinous acts, as well as those who are working to address the root causes of intolerance and hate. I have made tackling this issue a priority, including through initiatives like the Call to Action for Human Rights, the UN Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech, and the UN Plan to Safeguard Religious Sites.
Freedom of religion or belief is a human right, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today, this right is being tested.
Let us commit to turning the tide on this appalling trend, to building more inclusive and peaceful societies, where diversity is celebrated as a richness that strengthens us all.

Children in four South Asian countries at ‘extremely high risk’ of the impacts of the climate crisis - UNICEF
According to a first-ever report of its kind, children in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are extremely vulnerable to climate change risks such as heatwaves and  floods
KATHMANDU, 20 August 2021 – Young people living in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are among those most at risk of the impacts of climate change, threatening their health, education, and protection, according to a new UNICEF report launched today. In addition Nepal and Sri Lanka are among the top 65 countries most impacted globally.
‘The Climate Crisis Is a Child Rights Crisis: Introducing the Children’s Climate Risk Index’ (CCRI) is UNICEF’s first child-focused climate risk index. It ranks countries based on children’s exposure to climate and environmental shocks, such as cyclones and heatwaves, as well as their vulnerability to those shocks, based on their access to essential services.
Pakistan, Bangladesh Afghanistan and India are among four South Asian countries where children are at extremely high risk of the impacts of the climate crisis, with a ranking of 14, 15, 15 and 26 respectively. While Nepal is ranked 51, Sri Lanka is at 61st place. Bhutan is ranked 111, with children at relatively lower risk. Approximately 1 billion children live in one of the 33 countries classified as “extremely high-risk”, including the four South Asian countries.
“For the first time, we have clear evidence of the impact of climate change on millions of children in South Asia. Droughts, floods, air pollution and river erosion across the region have left millions of children homeless and hungry, and without any healthcare and water,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia. “Together, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have created an alarming crisis for South Asian children. The time to act is now - if we invest in water, healthcare and education, we can protect their futures from the impacts of a changing climate and degrading environment.”

The report found that these South Asian children are in constant danger from  riverine floods and air pollution, but also that investments in child health, nutrition, and education can make a significant difference to protect children from climate change.
South Asia is home to over 600 million children and has the highest number of young people globally. South Asian countries are among the most vulnerable globally to the impacts of climate change. Extreme climate-related events - heatwaves, storms, floods, fires and droughts - affect more than half of the region's population every year and continue to burden South Asian countries’ economies.  Rising global temperatures and changing weather patterns have put the futures of millions of children living in climate-vulnerable areas in South Asia at constant risk. Worse, before they can recover from one disaster, another one strikes, reversing any progress made.
The report also reveals a disconnect between where greenhouse gas emissions are generated, and where children are enduring the most significant climate-driven impacts. The 33 extremely high-risk countries , including four from South Asia, collectively emit just 9 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Conversely, the 10 highest emitting countries collectively account for nearly 70 per cent of global emissions.
“The frightening environmental changes we are seeing across the planet are being driven by a few but experienced by many in South Asia,” added Laryea-Adjei. “We must urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work together as a community to build greater resilience in South Asia. Children and young people are at the heart of this change, with almost half of 1.8 billion people below the age of 24 in South Asia.”
Compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes and diseases, among other factors. Without the urgent action required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally, children will continue to suffer the most.
Young people across South Asia are championing the cause. In Bangladesh, exposures to cyclones, droughts, floods and river erosion moved Tahsin, 23, to action. Through the youth organization he established, Tahsin and 400 children and young people from across the country are cleaning up public spaces, selling the plastic they collect to recycling centres and planting trees. In Pakistan, 14-year-old Zymal started producing biodegradable bags in order to clean up her country from the plastic pollution.  In India, a youth filmmaker Divy is traveling across the country and spreading awareness about global warming and Gavita developed a water budgeting app.
In  light of these findings, UNICEF is urgently calling on governments, businesses and relevant actors to:
1.    Increase investment in climate adaptation and resilience in key services for children.
2.    Reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Countries must cut their emissions by at least 45% (compared to 2010 levels) by 2030 to keep warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
3.    Provide children with climate education and greens skills, critical for their adaptation to and preparation for the effects of climate change.
4.    Include young people in all national, regional and international climate negotiations and decisions, including at COP26.
5.    Ensure the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is green, low-carbon and inclusive, so that the capacity of future generations to respond to the climate crisis is not compromised.

The CCRI was developed in collaboration with several partners including the Data for Children Collaborative. In order to make the report more accessible to global youth, UNICEF also collaborated with Climate Cardinals, an international youth led non-profit which translates climate change research and information so that they can reach as many young people and leaders as possible.
About Maldives: Maldives was not included in the report due to lack of global data. However, the Government of Maldives is committed to addressing the country’s vulnerability to climate change and its debilitating effects on children, women and other vulnerable communities.

UNDP Pakistan hosts Pakistan Inequality Debate series on its Pakistan National Human Development Report (NHDR) 2020: The Three Ps of Inequality: Power, People, and Policy
Value of the privileges of Pakistan’s vested interests added up to PKR 2,660 billion in 2017-2018: UNDP Pakistan NHDR
Islamabad, 13th August 2021—UNDP Pakistan hosted the second webinar of its Pakistan Inequality Debate series today. These webinars are being held to discuss the findings of the Pakistan National Human Development Report (NHDR) 2020: The Three Ps of Inequality: Power, People, and Policy which was launched by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Mr. Imran Khan in April this year.
The webinar began with a plenary session, entitled “Policy as a Driver of Inequality: Centering People for Inclusive Policy”, addressing the Report’s emphasis on Policy. The session included Dr. Sania Nishtar, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety as the Chief Guest; Mr. Knut Ostby, Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan; and former Federal Minister and NHDR 2020 lead author Dr. Hafiz Pasha. The panelists for the session included Dr. Shamshad Akhtar, Chairperson, Karandaaz and the Pakistan Stock Exchange; Dr. Abid Suleri, Executive Director, SDPI; and feminist researcher Dr. Saba Gul Khattak.
In her keynote address, Dr. Sania Nishtar spoke of the government’s commitment to building a ‘welfare state’ where rule of law, meritocracy and transparency is guaranteed to all citizens and a social safety net is provided to marginalized segments. “This year we will cover 1 million families under Ehsaas Kafaalat, breaking a record—this will be the highest number of families ever getting regular support from the government,” said Dr. Nishtar.
In his welcoming remarks, UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative, Mr. Knut Ostby, highlighted policy as a core strategy through which governments determine what kind of country they want to create for citizens. “Citizen power is an important part of public policy. By participating in the political process, citizens can play an important role in defining the future of the country,” said Mr. Ostby.
Dr. Hafiz Pasha, when presenting the report’s findings, spoke of policy in the context of areas that need redressal. “Pakistan has experienced high income and wealth inequality, with the richest groups co-opting the lion’s share of national income, bank advances, farm area, and property. The NHDR 2020 shows that the value of the privileges of Pakistan’s vested interests added up to PKR 2,660 billion in 2017-2018,” observed Dr. Hafiz Pasha.
Moderated by Mr. Mosharraf Zaidi, CEO and Senior Fellow at Tabadlab, the panel discussion explored the role of policy in creating inequality in the country. Speakers engaged in a wide-ranging discussion covering challenges to inclusive policymaking; how financial inclusion can lead to greater human development; and how the government has leveraged policy for inequality reduction in the wake of COVID-19.

Title: Media Update: United Nations Pakistan, 11 Aug 2021
Content: 11 August 2021
This Media Update includes:
Young people are on the frontlines of the struggle to build a better future for all.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dire need for the kind of transformational change they seek – and young people must be full partners in that effort.
This year’s International Youth Day highlights solutions developed by young innovators to address challenges to our food systems. They are tackling inequities in food security, biodiversity loss, threats to our environment and much more.
We see that same drive, creativity, and commitment in many other areas – from gender equality to education and skills development.
But young people cannot do it on their own.  They need allies to make sure they are engaged, included and understood.
Guided by the United Nations system-wide Youth Strategy, Youth2030, the UN is strengthening its work for and with young people worldwide.
I urge everyone to guarantee young people a seat at the table as we build a world based on inclusive, fair, and sustainable development for all.
Thank you.

COVAX delivers first tranche of 6 million doses of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines to Pakistan
This latest shipment will bring the total of number of doses of COVID-19 vaccines delivered to Pakistan by the COVAX Facility to 14 million.
ISLAMABAD, 11 August 2021 – Today the first tranche of 6.1 million doses of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV) procured through COVAX, the global COVID-19 vaccine equity scheme, reached Pakistan.
Early this morning 976,782 doses of the vaccine landed in Islamabad; the remaining 5.1 million doses will arrive within the next four days. All will support the Government’s national vaccination drive, which recently hit the milestone of one million doses of vaccine administered in a day.
Nearly 8 million people have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and 30 million have received one dose since the start of the vaccination campaign, which began one year after the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Pakistan. The Government has used doses of COVID-19 vaccines procured through COVAX and through bilateral purchases.
This is the first Sinopharm vaccine consignment to arrive in Pakistan through COVAX, bringing the total number of doses delivered by the Global Facility to the Government to more than 14 million over the past three months. This includes the 6.1 million doses Sinopharm, 5.5 million doses of Moderna donated by the United States under COVAX’ dose-sharing mechanism, 100,160 doses of Pfizer and 2.4 million doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
“WHO applauds the Government of Pakistan for its massive countrywide efforts to get people vaccinated. With this increased large supply, through COVAX Facility, we can boost the national COVID-19 response and keep everyone safe from the recent emergence of more transmissible variants. These vaccines supplied through the COVAX Facility will help in realizing our shared vision of vaccine equity. Accelerating vaccine equity is not only critical to saving lives but also to driving a faster and fairer recovery from the pandemic with benefits for all, said Dr Palitha Mahipala, WHO Representative in Pakistan. WHO has been and will continue working hard alongside the Government of Pakistan to attain the capacity and infrastructure needed to safely delivery the vaccines across the country.”
So far one million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Pakistan and at least 24,004 people have succumbed to the disease.
“UNICEF appreciates the concerted efforts by COVAX partners to accelerate the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to Pakistan. These latest shipments of 6.1 million doses of vaccines will contribute to the NCOC’s plan to vaccinate at least 70 million people by the end of this year, having now reached the milestone of vaccinating more than one million people per day, said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “UNICEF will continue to support the Government in ensuring an efficient roll-out of the campaign so that no one is left behind. This includes closing the gender gap as currently barely more than one-third of people vaccinated are women. COVID-19 vaccines are safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and they do not disrupt fertility. Women are as much exposed to the virus as men, they need to be vaccinated to prevent COVID-19 and stay healthy.”
Strictly complying with COVID-19 public health and social measures remains as critical as ever to stop the spread of virus. These include regularly washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds or use a sanitizer; wear a mask; remain at least six feet away from other people; avoid crowded places; and stay home when having COVID-19 symptoms.
“The COVAX Facility and Gavi are proud to support this delivery of COVID vaccines and commend the Government of Pakistan for their continuing efforts to ensure that vulnerable populations in Pakistan are protected from COVID-19,” said Alexa Reynolds, Gavi Senior Country Manager for Pakistan.
The goal of COVAX is to help address the acute phase of the global pandemic by the end of 2021 by providing rapid, fair and equitable access to safe and effective vaccines for all participating countries and territories regardless of income level.
The COVAX Facility, co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, together with UNICEF, aims to provide access to quality-assured COVID-19 vaccines, enabling the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.

عالمی ادارہ صحت  حکومت پاکستان کی جانب   سے لوگوں کو   اس وبا سے بچانے کے لئے  ویکسین کے ٹیکے لگوانے کی وسیع پیمانے پر ملک گیر کوششوں کی بھرپور حمایت اور تہہ دل سے تعریف  کرتا ہے۔ کویکس  کی سہولت  کےذریعے  ویکسین کی اس مزید فراہمی    کی مدد سے  ہم قومی کووڈ -19 کے خلاف قومی  مزاحمت اور رد، عمل  کو فروغ  دینے میں کامیاب ہونگے  اور ہر فرد کو حالیہ دنوں میں ظاہر ہونے والی وائرس کی مزید اقسام  سے بھی   محفوظ رکھ  پائیں گے ۔  کویکس  سہولت کے توسط سے  فراہم کردہ یہ خوراکیں ہمارے  ویکسین کی مساوی اور منصفانہ تقسیم  کے   مشترکہ نصب لعین   کے حصول  میں مدد  گار ثابت ہوں گی  ۔ پاکستان میں ڈبلیو ایچ او کی نمائندہ ڈاکٹر پلیتھا مہیپالا نے مزید  کہا کہویکسین کی مساوی اور منصفانہ تقسیم کے عمل  کو تیز تر  کرنا نہ صرف زندگیاں بچانے کے لئے اہم اقدام  ہے بلکہ اس سے  سب  کو یکساں  فوائد بھی حاصل ہوتے ہیں ۔  اس کے  علاوہ اس اقدام کی مدد سے  وبا کے بعد  تیز رفتار     اور منصفانہ  بحالی  کا مقصد بھی حاصل ہوسکتا ہے  ۔ عالمی ادارۂ صحت  ملک بھر میں ویکسین کی  تیز اور محفوظ  تر فراہمی  کے لئے درکار صلاحیت اور بنیادی ڈھانچے کے حصول کے لئے حکومت پاکستان کی  مدد  کرتا رہا ہے اور آئندہ بھی کرتا رہے گا  ۔ "
پاکستان میں کووڈ -19 کےاب تک کے دس لاکھ کیسز رپورٹ ہوئے ہیں اور کم از کم  24 ہزار 4 افراد اس بیماری کا شکار ہو چکے ہیں۔
پاکستان میں یونیسف  کی نمائندہ ایدا گیرمانے کہا کہ   یونیسف  کویکس  کے شراکت داروں کی جانب سے پاکستان کو کووڈ  19 ویکسین کی فراہمی  کا عمل  تیز   کرنے  کی مشترکہ کاوشوں  کو سراہتا ہے۔ ویکسین کی 61 لاکھ خوراکوں کی یہ تازہ ترین کھیپ رواں سال کے آخر تک کم از کم 70 ملین افراد کو ویکسین دینے کے این سی او سی کے  اس منصوبے  کے مقاصد کے حصول میں معاون ثابت ہوگی جو اب روزانہ دس لاکھ سے زائد افراد کو ٹیکے لگانے کا سنگ میل عبور کرچکا ہے ۔
انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ  یونیسف  اس مہم کے موثر آغاز کو  یقینی بنانے میں حکومت کی حمایت جاری رکھےگا تاکہ کوئی ایک بھی شخص ویکسین سے محروم نہ رہ جائے ۔  انہوں نے زور دیا کہ ہر شخص  کو  ویکسین کی فراہمی کے اس  عمل میں   صنفی تفریق  کو ختم کرنا بھی شامل ہے کیونکہ  ویکسن حاصل کرنے والوں میں  خواتین کی تعداد  بمشکل ایک تہائی ہے ۔  اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے انہوں  نے واضح کیا    کہ   کووڈ -19 ویکسین   کی ہر قسم حاملہ اور دودھ پلانے والی خواتین کے لیے محفوظ ہے  اور ویکسین  سے زچگی  کی صلاحیت بھی ہرگز   متاثر  نہیں ہوتی ۔ خواتین مردوں کی طرح اس وائرس کا شکار ہوتی ہیں، انہیں کووڈ -19  سے بچاؤ  اور صحت مند رہنے کے لئے ویکسین فراہم  کرنا ضروری  ہے۔ "
وائرس کے پھیلاؤ  کی روک تھام اور  کووڈ -19   سے تحفظ کے لئے  صحت عامہ کے اصولوں  اور سماجی  اقدامات پر  سختی سے عمل درآمد  ہمیشہ کی طرح  آج بھی  ضروری     ہے۔ ان    اقدامات  میں کم از کم 20 سیکنڈ تک باقاعدگی سے صابن سے ہاتھ دھونا یا سینیٹائزر یعنی ہاتھوں کو جراثیم سے پاک کرنے کا  محلول    استعمال کرنا؛ ماسک پہننا؛ دوسرے لوگوں سے کم از کم چھ فٹ  کا فاصلہ رکھنا  ،  پر ہجوم مقامات سے دور رہنا    اور   کووڈ – 19 کی علامات ظاہر ہونے پر گھر میں رہنا شامل ہیں ۔

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
ON THE IPCC WORKING GROUP I REPORT
ON THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE BASIS OF THE SIXTH ASSESSMENT
Today’s IPCC Working Group 1 Report is a code red for humanity.  The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable:  greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk. Global heating is affecting every region on Earth, with many of the changes becoming irreversible.
The internationally agreed threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius is perilously close.
We are at imminent risk of hitting 1.5 degrees in the near term. The only way to prevent exceeding this threshold is by urgently stepping up our efforts, and pursuing the most ambitious path.
We must act decisively now to keep 1.5 alive.
We are already at 1.2 degrees and rising. Warming has accelerated in recent decades. Every fraction of a degree counts.  Greenhouse gas concentrations are at record levels. Extreme weather and climate disasters are increasing in frequency and intensity. That is why this year’s United Nations climate conference in Glasgow is so important.
The viability of our societies depends on leaders from government, business        and civil society uniting behind policies, actions and investments that will limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  We owe this to the entire human family, especially the poorest and most vulnerable communities and nations that are the hardest hit despite being least responsible for today’s climate emergency.
The solutions are clear.  Inclusive and green economies, prosperity, cleaner air and better health are possible for all if we respond to this crisis with solidarity and courage.  All nations, especially the G20 and other major emitters, need to join the net zero emissions coalition and reinforce their commitments with credible, concrete and enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions and policies before COP26 in Glasgow.
We need immediate action on energy. Without deep carbon pollution cuts now, the 1.5-degree goal will fall quickly out of reach. This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet.  There must be no new coal plants built after 2021.  OECD countries must phase out existing coal by 2030, with all others following suit by 2040.  Countries should also end all new fossil fuel exploration and production, and shift fossil    fuel subsidies into renewable energy.  By 2030, solar and wind capacity should quadruple and renewable energy investments should triple to maintain a net zero trajectory by mid-century.
Climate impacts will undoubtedly worsen.  There is a clear moral and economic imperative to protect the lives and livelihoods of those on the front lines of the climate crisis.  Adaptation and resilience finance must cease being the neglected half of the climate equation.  Only 21 per cent of climate support is directed towards adaptation.  I again call on donors and the multilateral development   banks to allocate at least 50 per cent of all public climate finance to protecting people, especially women and vulnerable groups.  COVID-19 recovery spending must be aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  And the decade-old promise to mobilize $100 billion annually to support mitigation and adaptation in developing countries must be met.
The climate crisis poses enormous financial risk to investment managers, asset owners, and businesses.  These risks should be measured, disclosed and mitigated.  I am asking corporate leaders to support a minimum international carbon price and align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement.  The public and private sector must work together to ensure a just and rapid transformation to a net zero global economy.
If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe.  But, as today’s report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success.

What if your pencil was a tool against forced labour?
50 countries have now ratified the Protocol on Forced Labour, demonstrating their determination to end forced labour in all its forms. They have committed to prevent forced labour, protect victims and ensure they have access to justice and remedies-Guy Ryder, Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO)
*******************************
In a bid to raise awareness on the negative effects of forced labour as well as concerted efforts required to eliminate the scourge,  the ILO under its #50forFreedom campaign in collaboration with Human Resources without Borders (RHSF) and  Cartooning for Peace,  launched a cartoon drawing competition under the theme:  What if your pencil was a tool against forced labour.
The competition, launched on 10th March 2021 aimed to raise awareness on forced labour through striking images and visual messages that need little or no words.
More than 200 cartoonists from 65 countries took on the challenge of representing the invisible and complex realities of forced labour, submitting over 460 cartoons. Using diverse graphic styles and techniques, cartoonists delivered powerful messages that challenge us and encourage reflection. The stirring images depicted by global cartoonists are also a reminder for the public, policy makers and legislators to take action and curb the incidence of forced labour in all its forms.
The cartoons were judged by a prestigious jury made up of experts from the Alliance 8.7, activists and former victims of exploitation, as well as representatives of the International Trade Union Confederation, the International Organisation of Employers, the ILO Global Business Network on Forced Labour, the US Department of  Labor, the ILO and RHSF. Special awards were also attributed by Cartooning for Peace and the public.
Ms Hira Kazmi, a cartoonist from Pakistan participated in the global competition and highlighted the injustice of forced labour through her cartoon. Under the Honourable Mention, the competition's jury distinguished submissions, including Ms Kazmi's cartoon, for their compelling portraits of the complex and invisible issue that is forced labour.
ABOUT THE ILO-RHSF CARTOON COMPETITION ON FORCED LABOUR
There are still 25 million men, women and children in forced labour today. As a consequence of the COVID19 pandemic, vulnerable workers and populations are at a greater risk of being trapped in forced labour. We all have a role to play to prevent forced labour and put an end to it.
In 2021, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and Human Resources Without Borders (RHSF), in partnership with Cartooning for Peace, co-organised a cartoon competition to raise awareness, inspire action and emphasize the urgent need to eradicate this severe violation of human rights.
Cartoons are powerful tools: they can make complex messages understandable without using words and encourage people to reflect on sensitive topics. They can make us REFUSE, UNDERSTAND and TAKE ACTION against forced labour.

MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY 
OF THE WORLD’S INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
9 August 2021
Indigenous peoples around the world continue to face overwhelming marginalization, discrimination and exclusion.  Rooted in colonialism and patriarchy, these profound disparities are sustained by a deeply held resistance to recognizing and respecting the rights, dignity, and freedoms of indigenous peoples.
Throughout modern history, indigenous peoples have been robbed of their lands and territories, of their political and economic autonomy, and even of their own children.  Their cultures and languages have been denigrated and extinguished.
In recent months, the world has again been exposed to just some of the horror faced by indigenous communities at the hands of colonizers.  Some nations have begun to address this heinous legacy through apologies, truth and reconciliation efforts, and legislative and constitutional reforms.  But much more needs to be done.
We need a new social contract – one that restores and honours the rights, dignity and freedoms of those who have been deprived of so much for so long.  Central to this must be genuine dialogue, interaction and willingness to listen.  We already have the tools we need to this, including the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples.
There is no excuse for denying the world’s 476 million indigenous peoples self-determination and meaningful participation in all decision-making.  Free, prior and informed consent is central for indigenous peoples to exercise their own vision of development.
And while recognition of the importance of indigenous knowledge grows, in particular in solving the climate and biodiversity crises and preventing the emergence of contagious diseases, we must ensure that indigenous knowledge is owned and shared by indigenous communities themselves.
The United Nations system has a key role to play.  On this International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, let us show true solidarity by working to end the grievous  inequalities of indigenous peoples worldwide, to fully recognize the abuse they have endured, and to celebrate their knowledge and wisdom.

THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA PROVIDES NUTRITIOUS DATES FOR VULNERABLE FAMILIES IN PAKISTAN
Islamabad – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) received a contribution of 116 metric tons of dates from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to help its food and nutrition assistance for vulnerable families in Pakistan.
A healthy and nutritious snack commonly used for the breaking of the fast, the Saudi dates were initially planned to be distributed ahead of the Holy month of Ramadan in April and May. However, their arrival was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
WFP is distributing the palm dates to more than 10,000 families in close collaboration with the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Saudi dates are not only delicious but also rich in minerals and vitamins. They will provide much needed nutrition to all members of the family”, said WFP Pakistan Representative and Country Director Chris Kaye.

GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA AND WFP PROVIDE CASH ASSISTANCE TO FAMILIES OF 16,000 ADOLESCENT GIRL STUDENTS
ISLAMABAD: The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Elementary & Secondary Education Department (E&SED) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province are working together to provide cash assistance to families of adolescent girls hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since September 2020, more than 16,000 adolescent girl students between grade 6 to 10 in 232 government girls’ middle and high schools in all seven Newly Merged Districts and six sub-divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Educating every child especially girl is a key priority of the provincial government. We are pleased to implement this pilot project with the support of the World Food Programme. Together, we hope this large-scale cash stipend programme can reach every enrolled adolescent girl to help them and their families meet their food and nutrition needs during this challenging time of COVID-19,” said the Secretary Education, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Pakistan has the world’s second-highest number of out-of-school children. Socio-cultural and economic factors, along with challenges such as limited availability of schools hamper the access and retention of adolescent girls in schools. This situation has been exacerbated by additional economic hardship brought on by the pandemic.
“Secondary-level education rates of girl students in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are among the lowest in the country. WFP introduced the cash-based assistance as a safety net to not only help the families cope with the economic downturns of the pandemic, but also encourage parents to send their girls to school and make sure they stay in school. By doing so, we contribute to the health and development of adolescent girls today, and a build brighter future for them and their country tomorrow,” said Chris Kaye, WFP Pakistan Country Director.
In addition to the cash assistance, WFP has donated IT equipment, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), hand washing stations with soap, as well as nutrition and education booklets and leaflets, and awareness banners to the Education Department to help its staff, teachers and students stay safe from COVID-19.

UNICEF - PRESS RELEASE : Google.org contributes USD7.5 Million in grants and other support to COVID-19 relief efforts in Pakistan and five Asian countries
Google.org contributes USD7.5 Million in grants and other support to COVID-19 relief efforts in Pakistan and five Asian countries
Pakistan, July 30, 2021: With Pakistan and other Southeast Asian countries currently grappling with a surge in COVID-19 cases, Google today announced a total commitment of USD$7.5 million in new grant funding and other support to help alleviate the current pandemic crisis.
As part of this new commitment, Google.org, Google’s philanthropic arm, is providing a USD$1.5 million grant to UNICEF to support urgent COVID-19 response needs across five countries including Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines. With this grant, UNICEF will deploy female vaccinators in Covid Vaccination Centers to increase the number of women being vaccinated and boost vaccine communication in Pakistan. UNICEF will also continue to support governments and communities to control the spread of the virus and reduce the number of deaths including by, including by enhancing preparedness for possible future waves of COVID-19.
Announcing these new commitments, Farhan Qureshi, Country Director for Google Pakistan said, “The current surge in COVID-19 cases is causing immense pressure on our healthcare system, and this Google.org grant to UNICEF aims to deepen our support for Pakistan at this critical time.

Beyond this grant to UNICEF, Google.org is also providing an additional USD$1 million to International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to address the urgent need of oxygen supplies and medical equipment in Indonesia. In addition, Google.org will provide USD$5 million worth of Ad Grants to local government agencies and organizations across Southeast Asia, including Pakistan, to run public health information campaigns for free. Since last year, Google has provided over USD$27 million in Ad Grants to support local governments including the World Health Organization who served over 343 million public service announcements (PSAs) to reach audiences with messages on how to stay safe and facts about vaccines.
Since the start of the pandemic, Google.org has also funded vaccine distributions in Asia and across the world through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Google has also focused its efforts in ensuring that information serves everyone in Pakistan through its tools and products. For example, Google previously gave ad grants to help the Government of Pakistan provide critical information on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other measures to help local communities. Google has also surfaced the latest updates and health advice from Pakistani health authorities across Search, Maps and YouTube in Urdu and English. And during Ramadan in 2020 and 2021, the company supported a PTV live stream broadcast of Tarawih prayers on YouTube, facilitating observance of an important religious event with enhanced public health and safety measures.

World Day Against Trafficking in Persons
Statement of the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
Ghada Waly
Each and every victim of trafficking in persons has a story we should listen to. Victims’ voices are key to preventing trafficking, supporting survivors, and bringing perpetrators to justice. Traffickers choose their victims from among the vulnerable, exploiting desperation and lack of awareness. The majority of those targeted are people in economic need who are misled. Almost two-thirds of detected victims are women and girls, and the share of children has tripled in the last 15 years. But despite their real and perceived vulnerabilities, survivors of trafficking are examples of strength, courage, and resilience.‎
On this year’s World Day against Trafficking in Persons, I salute victims as they rebuild their own lives and help protect those of others. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime has launched a campaign titled Victims’ Voices Lead the Way’ to put a spotlight on victims’ untold stories, and on their roles in the fight against trafficking. Member States must engage, listen, and learn from survivors, and support victim-led organizations. The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened vulnerabilities to trafficking, making‎ victims’ contributions more critical than ever.‎
At UNODC, we continue to assist countries and all stakeholders in implementing the Trafficking in Persons Protocol, and in developing victim-centred approaches. Through the UN Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, we also provide essential support to victims, and help empower them as part of the response. I thank our partners who have contributed to the Fund and call on all Member States to support it.‎
I also call on you to join our campaign, and to share and amplify victims’ stories. Inspired and guided by the resilience of those who survived, we can build the resilience of our societies to trafficking in persons, help prevent and alleviate suffering, end impunity, and achieve justice.‎

World Day against Trafficking in Persons – Pakistan: 30 July 2021, Islamabad
Under the EU funded Global Action to Address Trafficking in Persons and the Smuggling of Migrants (GLO.ACT – Asia and the Middle East), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC),  commemorated World Day against Trafficking in Persons (TIP) in collaboration with the Federal Investigation Agency during a seminar held on Friday 30 July 2021 from 9.30- 13.45 at Serena hotel, Islamabad.
“Victim’s Voices Lead the Way” is this year’s World Day against TIP theme. It’s a theme that puts victims of human trafficking at the centre and highlights the importance of listening to and learning from survivors of human trafficking and the crucial role they play in establishing effective measures to prevent this crime, identify and rescue victims and support them on their road to rehabilitation.
During the commemoration seminar, key messages from survivors of trafficking and other relevant stakeholders were highlighted. The event also presented the National Action Plan to combat human trafficking and migrant smuggling (2021-2025) adopted by the Government which provides a comprehensive coordination framework for all stakeholders tasked with addressing Trafficking in Persons.
During his welcome remarks, Dr. Jeremy Milsom, Representative UNODC Country Office Pakistan said that, “The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is committed to advancing action to bring traffickers to justice while protecting and supporting their victims.  The rights of victims must come first – be they the victims of traffickers, smugglers, or of modern forms of slavery or exploitation”.
He further said that: “Almost every country has national human trafficking laws, yet people continue to be trafficked – most of them, women, and girls. We welcome the progress made by Pakistan, in particular the Federal Investigation Agency, in tackling human trafficking, through implementing the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act 2018 and its rules, and the National Action Plan to combat human trafficking and migrants smuggling (2021-2025)”.
Learning from victims’ experiences and turning their suggestions into concrete actions will lead to a more victim-centred and effective approach in combating human trafficking.
The Director General FIA, Sanaullah Abbasi, during his speech said that: “FIA and UNODC have been partners for more than a decade to curb human trafficking and migrants smuggling.  Through this partnership we have achieved many goals including the enactment of laws on TIP and Smuggling of Migrants in 2018. The partnership will further help FIA to build its capacity to fight the menace of human trafficking”.
The seminar was attended by the senior representatives of FIA, UNODC, the European Union, Provincial Social Welfare and Labour departments, provincial police, representatives from federal ministries including the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development and ICMPD.
The Global Action against Trafficking in Persons and the Smuggling of Migrants – Asia and the Middle East (GLO.ACT-Asia and the Middle East) is a four-year (2018-2022), €12 million joint initiative by the European Union (EU) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) being implemented in partnership with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in up to five countries: Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Afghanistan), Islamic Republic of Iran (I.R. of Iran), Republic of Iraq (Iraq), Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan). GLO.ACT-Bangladesh is a parallel initiative also financed by the EU and implemented with IOM.
The project builds on a global community of practice set in motion in GLO.ACT 2015-2019 and assists governmental authorities and civil society organizations in targeted, innovative, and demand-driven interventions: sustaining effective strategy and policy development, legislative review and harmonization, capability development, and regional and trans-regional cooperation. The project also provides direct assistance to victims of human trafficking and vulnerable migrants through the strengthening of identification, referral, and protection mechanisms.

’’متاثرین کی آواز مشعل راہ ہے‘‘
انسانی تجارت کے خلاف عالمی دن – پاکستان، 30 جولائی 2021، اسلام آباد
انسانی تجارت اور مہاجرین کی  اسمگلنگ سے نمٹنے کے لیے یوروپی یونین کے مالی تعاون سے چلائے جانے والے گلوبل ایکشن (GLO.ACT - ایشیا اور مشرق وسطی) کے تحت اقوام متحدہ کے دفتر برائے انسداد منشیات اور جرائم (یو این او ڈی سی) نے وفاقی تحقیقاتی ایجنسی کے تعاون سے انسانی تجارت کے خلاف عالمی دن منایا اور اس سلسلے میں سیرینا ہوٹل ، اسلام آباد میں جمعہ 30 جولائی 2021 ء کو 9.30تا 13.45 ایک سیمینارکا انعقاد کیا گیا۔
اس سال انسانی تجارت کے خلاف عالمی دن کا مرکزی خیال ’’متاثرین کی آواز مشعل راہ ہے‘‘ رکھا گیا  جو انسانی تجارت کے متاثرین کو مرکزِ نگاہ بناتا ہے اور اس سے بچ جانے والوں کے تجربات کو سننے اور ان سے سیکھنے کی اہمیت کو اجاگر کرتا ہے، اور اس ساتھ ہی ساتھ اس جرم کے انسداد، متاثرین کو شناخت کرنے اور انہیں بچانے اور بحالی میں انہیں سہارا فراہم کرنے کے لیے موثر اقدامات وضع کرنے کے حوالے سے  ان کے اہم کردار کو بھی واضح کرتا ہے۔
اس یادگاری سیمینار کے دوران انسانی تجارت سے بچ جانے والے افراد اور دیگر متعلقہ اسٹیک ہولڈرز کے کلیدی پیغامات کو اجاگر کیا گیا۔ مذکورہ تقریب میں انسانی تجارت اور مہاجرین کی اسمگلنگ سے نمٹنے کے لیے حکومت کا منظور کردہ  نیشنل ایکشن پلان(2025 – 2021) بھی پیش کیا گیا جو انسانی تجارت سے نمٹنے والے تمام اسٹیک ہولڈرز کے لیے ایک جامع رابطہ کاری کا فریم ورک فراہم کرے گا۔
ڈاکٹر جیریمی میلسم ، نمائندہ یو این او ڈی سی کنٹری آفس پاکستان اپنےافتتاحی  کلمات کے دوران کہا کہ "اقوام متحدہ کے انسداد منشیات اور جرائم کا دفتر ایسے متاثرین کو تحفظ اور معاونت فراہم  کرتے ہوئے انسانی تجارت کے اسمگلروں کو انصاف کے کٹہرے میں لانے کی کارروائی کرنے کے لیے پُر عزم ہے۔ متاثرین کے حقوق کو سب سے پہلے اہمیت دینی چاہیےخواہ  وہ انسانی تجارت کے اسمگلروں سے متاثر ہوں یا غلامی یا استحصال کی جدید اقسام  کے شکار ہوں۔"
انہوں نے مزیدیہ کہا کہ"تقریباً ہر ملک میں انسانی تجارت کے قومی قوانین موجود ہیں  لیکن پھر بھی لوگوں کو اسمگلنگ کیا جاتا ہے جن میں سے اکثر خواتین اور لڑکیاں شامل ہوتی ہیں۔ انسانی تجارت کی روک تھام کے ایکٹ 2018اور اس کے قواعد کے علاوہ انسانی تجارت اور مہاجرین کی  اسمگلنگ سے نمٹنے کےلیے نیشنل ایکشن پلان(2021-2025)پر عمل درآمد کے ذریعے پاکستان خصوصاً  وفاقی تحقیقات ادارہ  کی طرف سے کی جانے والی پیشرفت کا ہم خیرمقدم کرتے ہیں۔"
متاثرین کے مشاہدات سے سیکھنے اور ان کی تجاویز کو ٹھوس کارروائیوں میں ڈھالنے سے انسانی تجارت کے خلاف لڑنے کے لیے ایک ایسا لائحہ عمل میسر آئے گا جو موثر ہو گا اور جس میں متاثرین مرکز نگاہ ہوں گے۔
ایف آئی اے کے ڈائریکٹر جنرل ثنا اللہ عباسی نے اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئےکہاکہ"ایف آئی اے اور اقوام متحدہ کا آفس برائے انسداد منشیات و جرائم (یو این او ڈی سی) انسانی تجارت اور مہاجرین کی اسمگلنگ کے تدارک کے لیے تقریباً ایک دہائی سے شراکت داروں کے طور پر کام کر رہے ہیں۔ اس شراکت داری کے ذریعے ہم نے کئی اہم اہداف حاصل کیے ہیں جس میں 2018 میں انسانی تجارت اور مہاجرین کی اسمگلنگ کے حوالے سے کی جانے والی قانون سازی بھی شامل ہے۔ یہ شراکت داری ایف آئی اے کو انسانی تجارت کے عفریت سے نمٹنے کے لیے اپنی صلاحیت کو مضبوط بنانے میں مدد دے گی۔"
اس سیمینار میں ایف آئی اے، اقوام متحدہ کے دفتربرائے انسداد منشیات و جرائم (یو این او ڈی سی)، یورپی یونین، صوبائی سوشل ویلفیئر اور لیبر ڈیپارٹمنٹس، صوبائی پولیس، وفاقی وزارتوں، بشمول وزارت داخلہ، وزارت سمندر پار پاکستانیز اور انسانی وسائل کی ترقی اور آئی سی ایم پی ڈی کے نمائندگان نے بھر پورشرکت کی۔
انسانی تجارت اور مہاجرین کی اسمگلنگ –ایشیا اور مشرق وسطیٰ (جی ایل او۔ ایکٹ – ایشیا اور مشرق وسطیٰ) کے خلاف عالمی ایکشن پلان 12 ملین یورو کا یورپی یونین (ای یو) اور اقوام متحدہ کے دفتر برائے انسداد منشیات و جرائم (یو این او ڈی سی) کا چار سالہ (2022- 2018) مشترکہ منصوبہ ہےجس کا اطلاق انسانی ہجرت کی بین الاقوامی تنظیم (آئی او ایم) کی شراکت سے دنیا کے پانچ ممالک، اسلامی جمہوریہ افغانستان (افغانستان)، اسلامی جمہوریہ ایران (آئی آر ایران)، جمہوریہ عراق (عراق)، اسلامی جمہوریہ پاکستان (پاکستان)، میں کیا جا رہا ہے۔ جی ایل او۔ ایکٹ – بنگلہ دیش ایک متوازی منصوبہ ہے جسے یورپی یونین کی جانب سے مالی معاونت فراہم کی جا رہی ہے اور آئی او ایم کے تعاون سے عمل درآمدکیا جا رہا ہے۔
یہ منصوبہ مشترکہ عزائم کاحامل ایک عالمی گروپ تشکیل دیتا ہے، جیسا کہ جی ایل او۔ ایکٹ 2019-2015 میں اس کا آغاز کیا گیا ہے، اور حکومتی حکام اور سول سوسائٹی کی تنظیموں کو ایک اہدافی، نئے طریقے اور طلب کی بنیاد پر مشتمل اقدام؛ موثر منصوبہ اور پالیسی سازی کو برقرار رکھنے؛ قانون سازی کے جائزے  اور ہم آہنگی، صلاحیت بڑھانے، اور علاقائی اور بین الاقوامی تعاون میں مدد فراہم کرتا ہے۔ یہ منصوبہ انسانی تجارت کے متاثرین اورمسائل کے شکار مہاجرین  کو شناخت، ریفرل اور تحفظ کے طریقوں کے ذریعے مدد بھی فراہم کرتا ہے۔ یہ منصوبہ انسانی حقوق اور صنفی برابری کو اپنی تمام تر کارروائیوں کے مرکزی دھارے میں شامل کرنے کے لیے پوری طرح پرعزم ہے۔

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD DAY AGAINST TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS
“Victims’ Voices Lead the Way”
30 July 2021
In the midst of a global pandemic, accompanied by rising inequalities and economic devastation, the voices of human trafficking survivors and victims risk being drowned out.
But listening to their stories is more crucial than ever as the COVID-19 crisis increases fragilities and drives up desperation.
As many as 124 million more people have been pushed into extreme poverty by the pandemic, leaving many millions vulnerable to trafficking.
Children are at great and growing risk: they represent one-third of victims globally — a share that has tripled in the last 15 years. Half of victims in low-income countries are children, most of whom are trafficked for forced labour. Criminals everywhere are using technology to identify, control and exploit vulnerable people. Children are increasingly targeted through online platforms for sexual exploitation, forced marriage and other forms of abuse.
Trafficking in women and girls for the purpose of sexual exploitation continues to be one of the most widespread and abhorrent forms of human trafficking. Migrants account for more than half of those trafficked in most regions.
Governments must take urgent steps to strengthen prevention, support victims and bring perpetrators to justice. This includes implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons.
Our efforts must be guided by survivors of trafficking. Their contribution is essential to address risk factors and patterns, and to identify and protect victims and ensure their access to justice and recovery, while holding their exploiters accountable.
The United Nations is committed to listening and responding to the voices of victims and survivors of human trafficking, ensuring their rights and dignity, amplifying their stories and learning from them in our fight to prevent and put an end to this terrible crime.

Launch of Project!!
Combatting Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants in Pakistan
Funded by the Government of Canada through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).
Islamabad, Pakistan 27 July 2021 – Today, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Country Office Pakistan with the implementing partner Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) launched a project Combatting Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants in Pakistan in Islamabad. The scope of project is laid down for two years, a joint initiative by the Government of Canada and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and it reaffirms that combating human trafficking and migrant smuggling is of the highest importance for the Government of Pakistan, Government of Canada, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime as a whole. This project is financially supported by the Government of Canada through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).

This project is a coordinated response to trafficking in persons and the smuggling of migrants and aims to strengthen the capacity of the Federal Investigation for its fight against Trafficking in persons (TIP) and Smuggling of Migrants (SOM).
“The support from the government of Canada through this project which we are launching today, will strengthen the national policies regarding TIP and SOM including the national capacity to assess and measure this phenomenon in Pakistan. It will strengthen the capacity of FIA and police to combat TIP and SOM; raise awareness amongst the risk group, public and relevant Pakistani authorities, and NGOs. It will also build the capacity of the national authorities to protect and reintegrate victims of trafficking and vulnerable smuggled migrants, especially women and children”, said, Dr. Jeremy Milsom, Representative, UNODC Pakistan in his opening remarks.
In addressing the event, Her Excellency Wendy Gilmour, Canada’s High Commissioner to Pakistan stated “Canada commends Government of Pakistan’s commitment to fight human trafficking and migrant smuggling and we are pleased to work with UNODC as a partner in support of the Government of Pakistan’s efforts in these areas.  Human trafficking is a crime, representing an assault on the fundamental human rights of its victims.  Improved data gathering and analysis will assist in combatting trafficking and migrant smuggling, helping Pakistan address transnational crime and stop those who would prey on some of the world’s most vulnerable for their own gain. Canada will continue to work alongside Pakistan and other global partners in fighting trafficking and smuggling operations to support safe migration”.
The Project is launched with the roll out of two days training on data collection and management. The purpose of the training is to reinforce the importance of disaggregation of TIP and SOM data, its adequate collection, and the needs to understand the differences between TIP and SOM.
Speaking about the project, Dr. Sanaullah Abbasi, PSP, Director General FIA, said, “Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), with the support of UNODC and the Government of Canada will improve prosecution of traffickers, smugglers and protect and support victims and witnesses, while upholding the rule of law and in recognition of human rights. The project is aligned with FIA’s National Action Plan to combat TIP and SOM (2021 – 2025), which was developed by FIA with the assistance of UNODC”. Regarding the training, he also said, that, “The training helped participants understand the techniques to expand their knowledge on the type of data that should be collected, its usefulness, the need for gender-segregated data and characteristics of good data”.
The launching ceremony took place in the presence of the Senior representatives of the Federal Investigation Agency and the High Commission of Canada in Pakistan.

اسلام آباد ( 27جولائی 2021) آج اقوام متحدہ کے انسداد منشیات اور جرائم (یو این او ڈی سی ) کے کنٹری آفس اسلام آباد نے ایف آئی اے کے اشتراک سے پاکستان میں انسانی اسمگلنگ اور سودا گری سے نمٹنے کے لیے دو سالہ منصوبے کا آغاز کر دیا ۔ انسانی اسمگلنگ اور تارکین وطن افرادکی اسمگلنگ کا مل کر مقابلہ کرنا حکومت پاکستان ، کینیڈین حکومت اور اقوام متحدہ کے انسداد منشیات اور جرائم آفس کے لیے سب سے زیادہ اہمیت کا حامل ہے ۔ اس منصوبے کو حکومت کینیڈا کی مالی معاونت حاصل ہے ۔ یہ منصوبہ انسانوں کی تجارت اور اسمگلنگ کی انسداد کے لیے مربوط اقدام ہے ، اور اس کا مقصد انسانوں کی تجارت اور مہاجروں کی اسمگلنگ کے خلاف جنگ کے لیے وفاقی تحقیقاتی ادارے کی صلاحیت کو مستحکم کرنا ہے۔ منصوبے کی افتتاحی تقریب میں گفتگو کرتے ہوئے اقوام متحدہ کے پاکستان میں آفس برائے انسداد منشیات اور جرائم کے نمائندے ڈاکٹر جیرمی ملسم نے کہا کہ کینیڈین حکومت کی حمایت سے جو منصوبہ آج ہم شروع کر رہے ہیں اس سے قومی پالیسیوں کو تقویت ملے گی ، جس سے پاکستان میں اس رجحان کی تشخیص اور حوصلہ شکنی کرنے کی قومی صلاحیت میں اضافہ ہو گا ۔ رسک گروپ، عوامی اور متعلقہ پاکستانی حکام اور غیر سرکاری تنظیموں میں شعور بیدار کریں۔ اس سے قومی حکام کی انسانوں کی تجارت اور اسمگل شدہ تارکین وطن، خاص طور پر خواتین اور بچوں کی بحالی اور ان کی صلاحیت میں بھی اضافہ ہوگا۔"
پاکستان میں کینیڈا کی ہائی کمشنر محترمہ وینڈی گلمور نے "پاکستانی حکومت کے کردار کی تعریف کرتے ہوئے کہا کہ یو این او ڈی سی کے ساتھ حکومت پاکستان کی کوششوں کی حمایت میں شراکت دار کے طور پر کام کریں۔ ان علاقوں میں انسانی اسمگلنگ ایک جرم ہے، جو اس کے متاثرین کے بنیادی انسانی حقوق کے غصب کرنے کی نمائندگی کرتا ہے۔ ڈیٹا اکٹھا کرنا اور تجزیہ کرنے سے اسمگلنگ اور تارکین وطن کی اسمگلنگ کا مقابلہ کرنے میں مدد ملے گی، پاکستان کو بین الاقوامی جرائم سے نمٹنے میں مدد ملے گی اور ان لوگوں کو روکنے میں مدد ملے گی جو اپنے فائدے کے لئے دنیا کے سب سے بڑے خطرے کا شکار ہوتے ہیں۔ کینیڈا محفوظ نقل مکانی کی حمایت کے لئے پاکستان اور دیگر عالمی شراکت داروں کے ساتھ مل کر اسمگلنگ اور غیر قانونی تارکین وطن کی کارروائیوں سے لڑنے کے لئے کام جاری رکھے گا۔"
منصوبے کے آغاز سے پہلے دو دن کی تربیت کا اہتمام کیا گیا جس میں غیر قانونی تارکین وطن اور انسانی اسمگلنگ سے متعلق ڈیٹا اکٹھا کرنے اور ان سے نبرد آزما ہونے سے متعلق تربیت دی  جا رہی ہے۔ تربیت کا بنیادی مقصد انفرادی اسمگلنگ اور انسانی اسمگلنگ سے متعلق ڈیٹا اکٹھا کرنے کی اہمیت کے ساتھ ساتھ انفرادی اور انسانی اسمگلنگ کے درمیان فرق کو سمجھنے کی ضرورت پر زور دیا گیا ۔
منصوبے کے حوالے سے گفتگو کرتے ہوئے  ثناء اللہ  عباسی ڈائریکٹر جنرل ایف آئی آے نے کہا کہ ، اقوام متحدہ دفتر برائے انسداد منشیات اورجرائم حکومت کینیڈا کے تعاون سے انفرادی اسمگلروں اور انسانی اسمگلروں کے خلاف قانونی کارروائی کو بہتر بنائیں گے اور متاثرین کی حفاظت کے ساتھ ساتھ ان کی مناسب مدد کریں گے ۔ قانون کی بالادستی کو برقرار رکھنے اور انسانی حقوق کی پاسداری کے لیے اس منصوبے کو انسانوں کی تجارت اور انسانی اسمگلنگ سے نمٹنے کے لیے اسے ایف آئی اے کے نیشنل ایکشن پلان کے ساتھ منسلک کیا گیا ہے، جسے ایف آئی اے نے اقوام متحدہ کے آفس برائے انسداد منشیات اور جرائم کے تعاون سے تیار کیا ہے ۔ " تربیت کے حوالے سے بات کرتے ہوئے انہوں نے کہا کہ ''اس تربیت سے شرکاءکو اپنے اعداد و شمار میں اضافہ کرنے کے طریقوں کو سمجھنے میں مدد ملی جو ڈیٹا اکٹھا کرنے ، اس کی افادیت سمیت اہم صنفی امتیاز کے ساتھ معلومات فراہم کرنے میں معاون ثابت ہوئی ۔

PRESS RELEASE
COVAX delivers second consignment
of US-donated Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to Pakistan
A total of 8 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been delivered to Pakistan
by the COVAX Facility, the global COVID-19 vaccine equity scheme, so far.
ISLAMABAD, 26 July 2021 – The second consignment of 3 million doses of Moderna (mRNA-1273) COVID-19 vaccines donated by the Government of the United States to the COVAX Facility arrived in Pakistan during early hours of today, bringing the total doses donated by the US Government to Pakistan through COVAX to 5.5 million since 8 May.
The donation is part of the 870 million additional COVID-19 vaccine doses pledged by the G7 through the COVAX Facility dose-sharing mechanism to support global equitable access to vaccines in 2021 and 2022, with the aim to deliver at least half by the end of 2021.
COVAX, the global COVID-19 vaccine equity scheme, has delivered a total 8 million doses of vaccine to Pakistan since 8 May, including 2.5 million doses of AstraZeneca, 100,000 doses Pfizer and 5.5 million doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.
To date, close to 7 million people have been fully vaccinated and nearly 20 million partially vaccinated in Pakistan since the start of the national vaccination campaign in February 2021.
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Pakistan has now reached close to a million, while nearly 23,000 people are reported to have succumbed to the disease.
“Despite national, regional and global efforts, the pandemic is nowhere near finished. WHO will continue to work with the Government of Pakistan and donors to implement activities to control transmission and advocate for equitable vaccine access and distribution. Vaccines are key in the fight again COVID-19 and we encourage everyone to get their vaccine immediately,” says Dr Palitha Mahipala, WHO Representative in Pakistan. “We thank the US Government for expressing their solidarity with Pakistan through this donation. Nobody is safe until everyone is safe.”
The allocation of extra doses of COVID-19 vaccines by G7 countries to COVAX will not only limit the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19, it will also prevent new variants from emerging.
“UNICEF thanks the Government of the United States for its generous contribution to the COVAX dose-sharing mechanism. This is an important step in the continued fight against COVID-19. UNICEF commends the Government of Pakistan for its leadership in ensuring a smooth roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign and urges the population to get vaccinated and continue taking COVID-19 precautionary measures,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “UNICEF will continue to support the national response to COVID-19 campaign in Pakistan through procurement services of essential COVID-19 supplies; expansion of cold chain capacity to ensure safe storage of vaccines; risk communication and community engagement to increase vaccine uptake and enforce SOPs and efficient and effective management of the COVID-19 Call Centre 1166.”
Strictly complying with COVID-19 public health and social measures continues to be critical to stop the spread of virus, after getting vaccinated. These include regularly wearing face masks, washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds or use a sanitizer; remaining at least six feet away from other people; avoiding crowded places; and staying at home and seeking care when having COVID-19 symptoms.
The goal of COVAX is to help address the acute phase of the global pandemic by the end of 2021 by providing rapid, fair and equitable access to safe and effective vaccines for all participating countries and territories regardless of income level.
The COVAX Facility, co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, together with UNICEF, aims to provide access to quality-assured COVID-19 vaccines, enabling the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.

Another 1.2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine
reach Pakistan through COVAX
Five million of COVID-19 vaccines have been delivered in Islamabad
by the COVAX facility’s global COVID-19 vaccine equity scheme so far.
ISLAMABAD, 17 July 2021 – Today 1,236,000 million doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines reached Islamabad through the COVAX Facility, bringing the total number of doses delivered by the global COVID-19 vaccine equity scheme in Pakistan to five million so far.
Since May, 2.4 million doses of AstraZeneca, 100,160 doses of Pfizer and 2.5 million doses of Moderna, the latter donated by the United States under the dose-sharing mechanism, have been delivered to Pakistan via COVAX.
“WHO applauds Pakistan’s globally recognized COVID-19 vaccination campaign. It is a remarkable achievement that COVID-19 vaccines are equitably made available to people even in the remotest areas of Pakistan. The vaccine roll-out has helped prevent COVID-19 infections, with its associated risk of hospitalization and death, and has reduced pressure on healthcare system, “said Dr. Palitha Mahipala, WHO Representative in Pakistan. “WHO will continue supporting the Government of Pakistan in setting up essential systems for swift and safe administration of vaccines. On behalf of COVAX Facility, I reiterate that we will support Government of Pakistan with COVID -19 vaccines for around 20% of the population.
The vaccines will support the Government of Pakistan’s ongoing COVID-19 vaccination drive which started in February, one year after the first case was reported in the country. More than 4.5 million people have been fully vaccinated, and more than 18 million people partially vaccinated against the coronavirus COVID-19 so far. One million cases of COVID-19 have been reported and nearly 23,000 people have succumbed to the disease.
“This latest delivery comes at a critical time as the Government of Pakistan intensifies its vaccination campaign across the country. UNICEF is supporting global COVID-19 vaccination efforts through COVAX to maximize supply and access to safe, effective, and affordable vaccines,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. ”UNICEF will continue to support the Government in ensuring an efficient and effective management of all vaccination campaigns through procurement services of essential COVID-19, routine immunization and polio supplies; expansion of cold chain capacity to ensure safe storage of vaccines; and risk communication and community engagement to increase vaccine uptake and ensure adherence to COVID-19 safety measures.”
Strictly complying with COVID-19 safety measures remains crucial to curb the spread of virus. These include regularly washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds or use a sanitizer; wearing a mask; remaining at least six feet away from other people; avoiding crowded places; and staying home when having COVID-19 symptoms.
The COVAX Facility aims to help address the acute phase of the global pandemic by the end of 2021 by providing rapid, fair, and equitable access to approved vaccines to all participating countries, regardless of income level. It enables the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.
COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access) is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, together with UNICEF. It is funded thanks to generous support from partner governments, foundations, and private sector corporations. So far, it has delivered more than 90 million doses of different COVID-19 vaccines to 133 countries and territories around the world.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD YOUTH SKILLS DAY
“Reimagining youth skills post pandemic”
15 July 2021
Today, we celebrate youth resilience, drive and innovation in times of COVID-19.
Young people were already facing disproportionate levels of unemployment and under-employment before the pandemic.  More than one out of five youth were not in employment, education, or training,  the majority of them young women.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated this troubling situation.  In many cases, it has forced organizations to pause skills development training.  Distance learning posed a particular challenge for Technical Vocational Education and Training, particularly among marginalized youth.
To recover better, we must address the longstanding disparities and challenges faced by young people.  That means ramping up skills development and education, with a particular focus on climate action, sustainable development, gender equality and inclusivity.  It is crucial to boost investments in Technical Vocational Education and Training, broadband connectivity and digital skills.
Young people drive solutions and must have a seat at the table, including in policy-making processes at the local, national, and global levels.  Youth2030, the United Nations system-wide Youth Strategy, lays out the roadmap for the UN and partners to work for and with young people worldwide.  I urge everyone to make the most of this framework and together, build an inclusive, fair and sustainable development for all.
I wish you a happy and productive World Youth Skills Day.

PRESS RELEASE
COVID-19 reversals in childhood vaccinations in South Asia undo years of progress, new WHO, UNICEF data shows
Childhood vaccination rates in South Asia plummeted by 6 per cent points from 2019 to 2020, with 5.3 million children missing out on lifesaving vaccines through routine health services in South Asia in 2020, the highest number since 2014
KATHMANDU, 15 July: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major reductions in childhood vaccinations in South Asia, with coverage of basic vaccination dropping by 6 per cent points from 2019 to 2020. More than 5.3 million children in South Asia missed out on essential vaccines through routine immunization services in 2020 – nearly 1.9 million more than in 2019 - according to official data published today by WHO and UNICEF. This is the highest number of under-vaccinated children since 2014.
Between 2019 and 2020, the South Asia region experienced a sharp decline in children receiving three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine, falling from 90% to 84%. The percentage of children covered by three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine had increased steadily from 6 per cent in 1980 to a record high of 90 per cent in 2019 in South Asia.
“It is heartbreaking to see this reversal in child vaccinations due to COVID-19 in a region where tremendous progress was being made, thanks to political will and collective action,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia. “Nearly 4.4 million children are not even receiving a single dose of a vaccine that can protect them from deadly diseases, which is almost twice as many as the previous year. This is a huge setback for children in South Asia, as it puts their lives at risk, and leads to unspeakable suffering.”
The majority of countries in South Asia experienced drops in childhood vaccination rates. The rates for DTP3 reduced by 9 per cent points in Nepal; 7 per cent points in Pakistan; 6 per cent points in India; 3 per cent points in Sri Lanka and 2 per cent points in Bhutan and Afghanistan.  However, robust recovery efforts mounted in many countries towards the end of the year helped to blunt the impacts of overall declines. In India, for example, vaccination drives in remote areas are helping to reach missed children.
Globally, the data shows that just 10 countries account for 62 per cent of all under- or unvaccinated children globally. India – particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic – had the highest number of unprotected children worldwide at 3.5 million, an increase of 1.4 million. Pakistan had 1.3 million unprotected children in 2020, an increase of 0.4 million.
Concerningly, most of these children did not receive a single vaccine during the year, an indication that the most vulnerable, hard-to-reach children are paying the steepest price for pandemic-related disruptions to vaccine access. At nearly 4.4 million, in 2020 South Asia recorded the highest number of children having failed to receive any routine vaccination in the past ten years. More than 3 million of these “zero-dose children” in 2020 lived in India.
Measles remains a concern, as well as outbreaks of diseases like diphtheria and yellow fever which can spread quickly where people are unvaccinated. In South Asia, coverage for the first dose of the measles vaccine fell from 92 per cent in 2019 to 88 per cent in 2020. This is well below the 95 per cent recommended by WHO to protect against measles. South Asia has had lengthy school closures, which have had significant ramifications for several vaccines such as HPV, which is critical for the achievement of cervical cancer elimination, and which is offered to children and adolescents at school.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, childhood vaccination rates against diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, measles and polio had increased steadily for more than a decade in South Asia, as opposed to other regions in the world where coverage rates mostly stagnated. However, with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many health facilities and personnel were diverted to support the COVID-19 response. In some countries, health facilities have been closed or hours reduced, while some families may have delayed seeking healthcare because of safety fears.
As the health community attempts to recover lost ground due to COVID-19 related disruptions, UNICEF, WHO and partners are supporting government efforts to strengthen immunization systems in the region by:
·        Restoring services so countries can safely deliver routine immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic;
·        Helping health workers communicate actively with caregivers to explain the importance of vaccinations;
·        Rectifying coverage and immunity gaps, including identifying communities and people who have been missed during the pandemic.
·
Beyond disruptions to immunization, other essential healthcare services in South Asia also experienced severe disruptions in 2020. Research commissioned by UNICEF has estimated that in 2020, 228,000 children died due to disruptions to essential healthcare services in South Asia. The main killers of children in South Asia are diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhea, which are both preventable and treatable when essential health services are operational, and families feel safe to use them.
“COVID-19 related disruptions are not just affecting vaccination efforts, but also other critical maternal and child health services. Today, the biggest health threat to children in South Asia is not from COVID-19, but from the childhood diseases which continue to kill children in the region,” added Laryea-Adjei. “UNICEF calls on governments to invest in essential maternal and child health services, to ensure the most vulnerable children don't succumb to preventable diseases while COVID-19 rages on.”

UN report: Pandemic year marked by spike in world hunger
Africa posting biggest jump. World at critical juncture, must act now for 2030 turnaround.
12 July 2021, Rome – There was a dramatic worsening of world hunger in 2020, the United Nations said today – much of it likely related to the fallout of COVID-19. While the pandemic’s impact has yet to be fully mapped[1], a multi-agency report estimates that around a tenth of the global population – up to 811 million people – were undernourished last year. The number suggests it will take a tremendous effort for the world to honour its pledge to end hunger by 2030.
This year’s edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World is the first global assessment of its kind in the pandemic era. The report is jointly published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Previous editions had already put the world on notice that the food security of millions – many children among them – was at stake. “Unfortunately, the pandemic continues to expose weaknesses in our food systems, which threaten the lives and livelihoods of people around the world,” the heads of the five UN agencies[2] write in this year’s Foreword.
They go on to warn of a “critical juncture,” even as they pin fresh hopes on increased diplomatic momentum. “This year offers a unique opportunity for advancing food security and nutrition through transforming food systems with the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit, the Nutrition for Growth Summit and the COP26 on climate change.” “The outcome of these events,” the five add, “will go on to shape the […] second half of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition” – a global policy commitment yet to hit its stride.
The numbers in detail
Already in the mid-2010s, hunger had started creeping upwards, dashing hopes of irreversible decline. Disturbingly, in 2020 hunger shot up in both absolute and proportional terms, outpacing population growth: some 9.9 percent of all people are estimated to have been undernourished last year, up from 8.4 percent in 2019.
More than half of all undernourished people (418 million) live in Asia; more than a third (282 million) in Africa; and a smaller proportion (60 million) in Latin America and the Caribbean. But the sharpest rise in hunger was in Africa, where the estimated prevalence of undernourishment – at 21 percent of the population – is more than double that of any other region.
On other measurements too, the year 2020 was sombre. Overall, more than 2.3 billion people (or 30 percent of the global population) lacked year-round access to adequate food: this indicator – known as the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity – leapt in one year as much in as the preceding five combined. Gender inequality deepened: for every 10 food-insecure men, there were 11 food-insecure women in 2020 (up from 10.6 in 2019).
Malnutrition persisted in all its forms, with children paying a high price: in 2020, over 149 million under-fives are estimated to have been stunted, or too short for their age; more than 45 million – wasted, or too thin for their height; and nearly 39 million – overweight.[3] A full three-billion adults and children remained locked out of healthy diets, largely due to excessive costs. Nearly a third of women of reproductive age suffer from anaemia. Globally, despite progress in some areas – more infants, for example, are being fed exclusively on breast milk – the world is not on track to achieve targets for any nutrition indicators by 2030.
Other hunger and malnutrition drivers
In many parts of the world, the pandemic has triggered brutal recessions and jeopardized access to food. Yet even before the pandemic, hunger was spreading; progress on malnutrition lagged. This was all the more so in nations affected by conflict, climate extremes or other economic downturns, or battling high inequality – all of which the report identifies as major drivers of food insecurity, which in turn interact.[4]
On current trends, The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World estimates that Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger by 2030) will be missed by a margin of nearly 660 million people. Of these 660 million, some 30 million may be linked to the pandemic’s lasting effects.
What can (still) be done
As outlined in last year’s report, transforming food systems is essential to achieve food security, improve nutrition and put healthy diets within reach of all. This year’s edition goes further to outline six “transformation pathways”. These, the authors say, rely on a “coherent set of policy and investment portfolios” to counteract the hunger and malnutrition drivers.
Depending on the particular driver (or combination of drivers) confronting each country, the report urges policymakers to:
· Integrate humanitarian, development and peacebuilding policies in conflict areas – for example, through social protection measures to prevent families from selling meagre assets in exchange for food;
· Scale up climate resilience across food systems – for example, by offering smallholder farmers wide access to climate risk insurance and forecast-based financing;
· Strengthen the resilience of the most vulnerable to economic adversity – for example, through in-kind or cash support programmes to lessen the impact of pandemic-style shocks or food price volatility;
· Intervene along supply chains to lower the cost of nutritious foods – for example, by encouraging the planting of biofortified crops or making it easier for fruit and vegetable growers to access markets;
· Tackle poverty and structural inequalities – for example, by boosting food value chains in poor communities through technology transfers and certification programmes;
· Strengthen food environments and changing consumer behaviour – for example, by eliminating industrial trans fats and reducing the salt and sugar content in the food supply, or protecting children from the negative impact of food marketing.
The report also calls for an “enabling environment of governance mechanisms and institutions” to make transformation possible. It enjoins policymakers to consult widely; to empower women and youth; and to expand the availability of data and new technologies. Above all, the authors urge, the world must act now – or watch the drivers of hunger and malnutrition recur with growing intensity in coming years, long after the shock of the pandemic has passed.

GLOSSARY
Hunger: an uncomfortable or painful sensation caused by insufficient energy from diet. Food deprivation; not eating enough calories. Used here interchangeably with (chronic) undernourishment. Measured by the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU).
Moderate food insecurity: a state of uncertainty about the ability to get food; a risk of skipping meals or seeing food run out; being forced to compromise on the nutritional quality and/or quantity of food consumed.
Severe food insecurity: running out of food; experienced hunger; at the most extreme, having to go without food for a day or more.
Malnutrition: the condition associated with deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in the consumption of macro- and/or micronutrients. For example, undernutrition and obesity are both forms of malnutrition. Child stunting or wasting are both indicators for undernutrition.
[1] To reflect the added uncertainty induced by the pandemic, this year’s edition for the first time presents a range (720 million to 811 million) rather than a single headline number. For regional breakdowns, the number of 768 million – the mid-range estimate – is used. Whether the lower, middle or upper value of the range is considered, the annual increase over 2019’s mid-range number of 650 million is substantial. At the higher end, this increase is a massive 161 million. (The entire historical series is revised annually in line with new data.)

[3] Social distancing rules made nutrition data exceptionally hard to collect in 2020. Some numbers – especially for wasting in under-fives – may be higher than these estimates.
[4] The more drivers a country has, the worse the undernourishment and malnutrition, the greater the food insecurity, and the more prohibitive the cost of healthy diets to its citizens.

1 in 3 countries are not taking action to help students catch up on their learning post-COVID-19 school closures
A new UNESCO, UNICEF, World Bank and OECD report documents education responses to COVID-19 in 142 countries
Paris/New York/Washington D.C., 13 July 2021 – Around one in three countries where schools are or have been closed are not yet implementing remedial programmes post-COVID-19 school closures, according to a UNESCO, UNICEF, World Bank and OECD global "Survey on National Education Responses to COVID-19 School Closures". At the same time, only one-third of countries are taking steps to measure learning losses in primary and lower secondary levels – mostly among high-income countries.
"Measuring learning loss is a critical first step towards mitigating its consequences. It is vital that countries invest in assessing the magnitude of such losses to implement the appropriate remedial measures," said Silvia Montoya, Director, UNESCO Institute for Statistics.
Fewer than a third of low- and middle-income countries reported that all students had returned to in-person schooling, heightening their risk of learning loss and drop-out. However, the majority of countries reported using at least one form of outreach to encourage students' return to school, including community engagement, school-based tracking, modification to water, sanitation and hygiene services, financial incentives and review of access policies.
"Remedial instruction is vital to help those children who have missed out on school to get back on track and reduce long-term learning losses. This requires an urgent effort to measure students' learning levels today and collect good quality data to inform classroom practices, as envisioned under the UNICEF, UNESCO, and World Bank's Learning Data Compact," stressed Jaime Saavedra, Global Director for Education, World Bank.
The survey documents how countries are monitoring and mitigating learning losses, addressing the challenge of reopening schools and deploying distance learning strategies. In total, 142 countries responded to the survey that covers the period from February to May 2021 and spans pre-primary, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary.
"Remote learning has been a lifeline for many children around the world during school closures. But for the most vulnerable, even this was out of reach. It is urgent that we get every child back into the classroom now. But we cannot stop there; reopening better means implementing remedial programmes to help students get back on track, and ensuring that we prioritize girls and vulnerable children in all our efforts," said UNICEF Global Chief of Education Robert Jenkins.
Key findings from the survey include:
§  Countries have responded with a variety of measures to mitigate potential learning losses from school closures: around 40 per cent of countries extended the academic year and a similar proportion of countries prioritized certain curriculum areas. However, more than half of the countries reported that no adjustments have been or will be made.
§  Many countries improved health and safety standards at examination centres, still, 28 per cent of countries cancelled examinations in lower secondary and 18 per cent of countries did so in upper secondary education.
§  Reviewing or revising access policies was uncommon, especially for girls – a cause for concern as adolescent girls are at the highest risk of not returning to school in low- and lower-middle-income countries.
§  Low-income countries are lagging in the implementation of even the most basic measures to ensure a return to school. For instance, only less than 10 per cent reported having sufficient soap, clean water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and masks, compared to 96 per cent of high-income countries.
The survey also sheds light on the deployment and effectiveness of distance learning and related support more than one year into the pandemic. Results show that:
§  Most countries took multiple actions to provide remote learning: Radio and TV broadcasts were more popular among low-income countries, while high-income countries provided online learning platforms. However, over a third of low- and lower-middle-income countries reported that less than half of primary school students were reached.
§  Ensuring take-up and engagement requires remote learning strategies suited to the context, parental engagement, support from and to teachers, and ensuring girls and other marginalized children are not left behind. It also requires generating rigorous data on the effectiveness of remote learning. While 73 per cent of countries assessed the effectiveness of at least one distance learning strategy, there is still a need for better evidence on effectiveness in the most difficult contexts.
"There is a critical need to produce more and better evidence on remote learning effectiveness, particularly in the most difficult contexts, and to support the development of digital learning policies," said Andreas Schleicher, Director, OECD Education and Skills.
In 2020, schools worldwide were fully closed across all four education levels for 79 teaching days on average, representing roughly 40 per cent of total instructional days averaged across OECD and G20 countries. The figures ranged from 53 days in high-income countries to 115 days in lower-middle-income countries.
Demand for funds is rising, in competition with other sectors, while governments' revenues are falling. Nevertheless, 49 per cent of countries increased their education budget in 2020 relative to 2019, while 43 per cent maintained their budget constant. Funding is set to increase in 2021, as more than 60 per cent of countries plan to increase their education budget compared to 2020.
These findings reinforce the importance of reopening schools, remedial learning and more effective remote learning systems that can better withstand future crises and reach all students. Moreover, it shows that the measurement of learning losses due to COVID-19 related to school closures is a critical effort for most countries and development partners, highlighted by the recent partnership of UNESCO, UNICEF and the World Bank around the Learning Data Compact.
The survey is in line with the Mission: Recovering Education 2021 by which the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF are partnering to support countries as they take all actions possible to plan, prioritize, and ensure that all learners are back in school; that schools take all measures to reopen safely; that students receive effective remedial learning and comprehensive services to help recover learning losses and improve overall welfare; and their teachers are prepared and supported to meet their learning needs.

The survey will be launched during the Ministerial segment of the Global Education Meeting on 13 July.

UNICEF signs supply agreement for Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine
NEW YORK/COPENHAGEN, 13 July 2021 - UNICEF and Sinopharm have signed a long-term agreement for the supply of the BBIBP-CorV inactivated virus vaccine against COVID-19 on behalf of the COVAX Facility.
Through the agreement, UNICEF will have access to up to 120 million doses of the vaccine by the end of 2021 to supply participating countries and territories in the COVAX Facility’s Advance Market Commitment (AMC), as well as self-financing participants.
This is the 7th supply agreement UNICEF has signed for COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of COVAX. Previous agreements have been announced with the Serum Institute of India, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Human Vaccine, Moderna and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.
The Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine received a WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) in May. On 12 July, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance announced that it had signed an Advance Purchase Agreement with Sinopharm on behalf of the COVAX Facility for the purchase of up to 60 million doses to be made available from July through October 2021. The agreement also includes an option to purchase a further 60 million doses in Q4 2021 and 50 million more doses in the first half of 2022, if necessary. This totals a potential 170 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine available to COVAX participants.
Deliveries could start as early as August providing countries are ready to receive them. The COVAX Allocation Framework will determine the dose allocations to COVAX participants taking into consideration access, country readiness, vaccine supply through COVAX to date, operating and supply aspects, and other parameters.
The goal of the COVAX Facility is to help address the acute phase of the global pandemic by the end of 2021 by providing rapid, fair and equitable access to safe and effective vaccines for all participating countries and territories regardless of income level.
The COVAX Facility, co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, together with UNICEF, aims to provide access to quality-assured COVID-19 vaccines, enabling the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.

UNICEF - UNESCO : PRESS RELEASE : Reopening schools cannot wait
Reopening schools cannot wait
Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore and UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay
PARIS/NEW YORK, 12 July 2021 – “It’s been 18 months since the COVID-19 outbreak started and education for millions of children is still disrupted. As of today, primary and secondary schools are shuttered in 19 countries, affecting over 156 million students.
“This should not go on. Schools should be the last to close and the first to reopen.
“In their efforts to limit transmission, governments have too often shut down schools and kept them closed for prolonged periods, even when the epidemiological situation didn’t warrant it. These actions were frequently taken as a first recourse rather than a last measure. In many cases, schools were closed while bars and restaurants remained open.
“The losses that children and young people will incur from not being in school may never be recouped. From learning loss, mental distress, exposure to violence and abuse, to missed school-based meals and vaccinations or reduced development of social skills, the consequences for children will be felt in their academic achievement and societal engagement as well as physical and mental health. The most affected are often children in low-resource settings who do not have access to remote learning tools, and the youngest children who are at key developmental stages.
“The losses for parents and caretakers are equally heavy. Keeping children at home is forcing parents around the world to leave their jobs, especially in countries with no or limited family leave policies.
“That’s why reopening schools for in-person learning cannot wait.
“It cannot wait for cases to go to zero. There is clear evidence that primary and secondary schools are not among the main drivers of transmission. Meanwhile, the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools is manageable with appropriate mitigation strategies in most settings. The decision to open or close schools should be based on risk analysis and the epidemiological considerations in the communities where they are situated.
“Reopening schools cannot wait for all teachers and students to be vaccinated. With the global vaccine shortages plaguing low and middle-income countries, vaccinating frontline workers and those most at risk of severe illness and death will remain a priority. All schools should provide in-person learning as soon as possible, without barriers to access, including not mandating vaccination prior to school entry.
“Ahead of the Global Education Meeting on July 13, we urge decisionmakers and governments to prioritize the safe reopening of schools to avoid a generational catastrophe.
“Closing schools mortgages our future for unclear benefits to our present. We must prioritize better. We can reopen schools safely, and we must.”

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to upend our world, reaching one grim milestone after another. In addition to the millions of lives tragically lost, there has been a less visible toll:  a shocking rise in domestic violence as women were forced into isolation with their abusers; empty maternity wards as women postponed motherhood; and unintended pregnancies due to curtailed access to contraceptive services.
Our latest estimates indicate that COVID-19 will push 47 million women and girls into extreme poverty. Many girls who are out of school may never return.
In every corner of the world, we are seeing a reversal of hard-won gains and an erosion of women’s reproductive rights, choices and agency. With the onset of the pandemic, resources for sexual and reproductive health services were diverted.
These gaps in access to health rights are unacceptable. Women cannot be alone in this fight.
As we mark World Population Day, let us pledge to ensure the reproductive health rights of everyone, everywhere.

EU-UNICEF Sign 17.4 Million Euros (PKR 3.27 Billion) agreement to improve access to education in Balochistan
ISLAMABAD/QUETTA – July 10, 2021: The European Union (EU) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), have signed an agreement to launch the Balochistan Education Support (BES) II, a five-year education development programme for which the EU will provide 17.4 million Euros (PKR 3.27 Billion). The overall cost of this project is Euro 22.2 million and UNICEF co-financing is Euro 4.8 million (PKR 0.92 billion).
The new programme aims to contribute to supporting the Government of Balochistan to build high- quality performance and management education systems in the province. It will contribute to the overall objective of improving literacy, numeracy, skills and qualifications for the people in the province. It will do so through improving access to quality primary and middle-level education and by increasing accountability, reporting and transparency of the Secondary Education Department.
BES II is providing continuity to the Balochistan Basic Education Programme (BBEP) for which the EU and UNICEF partnered in 2016, and which has helped education authorities in the province take a major leap forward in providing quality education to all children and young people, boys and girls, in the province.
The new programme will help build on all successful reform initiatives of the BBEP such as the new performance management system, the newly established Balochistan Assessment and Examination Commission, strengthened and expanded parent-teacher school management committees, local education councils and the school development process.
The Ambassador of the European Union to Pakistan, Androulla Kaminara said, “An educated young generation is the basis for Pakistan to pursue a path of inclusive growth and development. Education is a basic human right and key to ensuring that people do not fall behind in society and in life. The EU is committed to ensuring access to quality education for all boys and girls in Balochistan, which would enable them to follow their dreams and contribute to a better future for Pakistan. The Pandemic has had a significant impact on education and our support will focus on addressing some of these challenges. The EU will continue to work closely with its partners including the Government of Balochistan and UNICEF to support and strengthen Pakistan’s education system.”
The EU’s support on primary and secondary education is a priority area under the EU-Pakistan Strategic Engagement Plan, which serves as guide for bilateral relations between the two sides and aims to further enhance engagement and work towards addressing emerging global challenges.
Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province in terms of land area, faces serious challenges in the areas of quality of education, access, low educational outcomes and poor governance.
While substantial progress was being made under the BBEP, the COVID-19 crisis adversely affected the gains made in the education sector, as schools remained closed for nearly the entire academic year.
“The setback to educational activities due to COVID19 must not deter us from trying to provide a better and brighter future for the children and young people of Balochistan,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “Led by the Education department, supported by generous funding from the EU and encouraged by the resilience and determination of the people, UNICEF will endeavor to translate children’s right to education into outcomes. The BES II will go a long way to help achieve the long-term targets set in BBEP and the new initiatives reflected in the programme.”
To make up for the academic time lost due to COVID19, additional activities have been included in BES II. These include training of teachers on Standard Operative Procedures (SoPs) for school health and safety, tailoring enrolment drives to ensure that children return to education and providing alternatives for children who drop out due to economic impact of the crises.
EU Development Cooperation
In Pakistan, the EU is committed to a stable, democratic and pluralistic country that respects human rights and benefits from its full economic potential by supporting sustainable and inclusive development for all its citizens. The EU provides Pakistan with about €100 million annually in grants for development and cooperation. Among other issues, the EU supports Pakistan in its efforts to tackle poverty, increase education, promote good governance, human rights, rule of law and ensure sustainable management of natural resources. EU-funded projects cover all of Pakistan with a special focus on Sindh and Balochistan.

PRESS RELEASE
2.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine supplied through COVAX start being rolled out in Pakistan
The US-donated vaccines were delivered by the COVAX facility, the global COVID-19 vaccine equity scheme, as part of its dose-sharing mechanism.
ISLAMABAD, 4 July 2021 – Today 2.5 million doses of Moderna (mRNA-1273) COVID-19 vaccines supplied through the COVAX Facility’s dose-sharing mechanism, and donated by the United States, started being distributed by the Government of Pakistan to vaccinate priority groups across the country, in line with the National Deployment and Vaccination Plan.
So far three million people have been fully vaccinated and 13.5 million partially vaccinated in Pakistan, using vaccines which the Government procured through COVAX or through bilateral agreements. More than 960,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the country since the start of the outbreak and at least 22,379 people have succumbed to the disease.
“WHO applauds Pakistan’s achievement of effectively scaling-up its vaccination campaign across the country. The available COVID-19 vaccines have been equitably distributed and have reached even the remotest areas of Pakistan, protecting millions. Science, solutions and solidarity have been the tools for addressing the biggest health threat of the past century. We thank the Government of United States for showing their solidarity through this donation,” said Dr Palitha Mahipala, WHO Representative in Pakistan. “WHO will continue supporting the Government of Pakistan to swiftly and safely administer the donated doses of vaccines and advocate with COVAX partners for the provision of sufficient vaccines to reach all vulnerable populations.”
The arrival of this consignment is welcome news as the latest wave of COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on children and their families in South Asia. There is an urgent need to intensify efforts and take additional steps to close gaps and strengthen essential health services to protect the most vulnerable families.
In the spirit of solidarity, well-supplied countries are allocating extra doses of COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle- income countries. This can help limit the spread of COVID-19, prevent new variants from emerging and ensure that vaccines can be allocated equitably to countries.
“UNICEF thanks the Government of United States for its generous donation of the vaccines to Pakistan through the COVAX facility and looks forward to more vaccines being available in the country as other COVAX partners share their excess doses of vaccines” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. ”Only global solidarity can help curb the pandemic. When the virus spreads anywhere, it poses a threat everywhere — especially as it mutates into deadlier or more contagious variants. UNICEF will continue to procure and supply safe, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines in low- and middle-income countries, on behalf of COVAX, and to support the Government of Pakistan in ensuring an efficient and effective roll-out of the vaccination campaign through procurement services of essential COVID-19 supplies; expansion of cold chain capacity to ensure safe storage of vaccines; and risk communication and community engagement to increase vaccine uptake and ensure adherence to COVID-19 safety measures.”
Strictly complying with COVID-19 safety measures remains crucial to curb the spread of virus. These
include regularly washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds or use a sanitizer; wear a mask; remain at least six feet away from other people; avoid crowded places; and stay home when having COVID-19 symptoms.
“At this time of constrained global supply, we are delighted to see dose-sharing pledges translated into immediate deliveries through the COVAX Facility and today’s shipment means we can now reach and protect those most at risk in Pakistan.” said Mario Jimenez, Gavi Programme Manager for Pakistan. “The only way we will beat this pandemic is as one global community acting together."
The COVAX Facility aims to help address the acute phase of the global pandemic by the end of 2021 by providing rapid, fair, and equitable access to approved vaccines to all participating countries, regardless of income level. It enables the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.
COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access) is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, together with UNICEF. It is funded thanks to generous support from partner governments, foundations, and private sector corporations. So far it has delivered more than 90 million doses of different COVID-19 vaccines to 133 countries and territories around the world.

About COVAX
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by CEPI, Gavi and WHO – working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, and others. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.
CEPI is leading on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio, investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.
Gavi leads on procurement and delivery at scale for COVAX: designing and managing the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its traditional Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. As part of this role, Gavi hosts the Office of the COVAX Facility to coordinate the operation and governance of the mechanism as a whole, holds financial and legal relationships with 193 Facility participants, and manages the COVAX Facility deals portfolio: negotiating advance purchase agreements with manufacturers of promising vaccine candidates to secure doses on behalf of all COVAX Facility participants. Gavi also coordinates design, operationalisation and fundraising for the Gavi COVAX AMC, the mechanism that provides access to donor-funded doses of vaccine to 92 lower-income economies. As part of this work, Gavi provides funding and oversight for UNICEF procurement and delivery of vaccines to all AMC participants – operationalising the advance purchase agreements between Gavi and manufacturers – as well as support for partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery. This includes tailored support to governments, UNICEF, WHO and other partners for cold chain equipment, technical assistance, syringes, vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery. Gavi also co-designed, raises funds for and supports the operationalisation of the AMC’s no-fault compensation mechanism as well as the COVAX Humanitarian Buffer.
WHO has multiple roles within COVAX: It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL)/prequalification programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states. It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. WHO leads, along with UNICEF, the support to countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines. The Country Readiness and Delivery (CRD) workstream includes Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional, and country-level to provide tools, guidance, monitoring, and on the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines. Along with COVAX partners, WHO is also developing a no-fault compensation scheme as part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments.
UNICEF is leveraging its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world and working with manufacturers and partners on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as freight, logistics and storage. UNICEF already procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunization and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund, UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19 vaccines for COVAX. In addition, UNICEF, Gavi and WHO are working with governments around the clock to ensure that countries are ready to receive the vaccines, with appropriate cold chain equipment in place and health workers trained to dispense them. UNICEF is also playing a lead role in efforts to foster trust in vaccines, delivering vaccine confidence communications and tracking and addressing misinformation around the world.

Billions of people will lack access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene in 2030 unless progress quadruples – warn WHO, UNICEF
Latest estimates reveal that 3 in 10 people worldwide could not wash their hands with soap and water at home during the COVID-19 pandemic
GENEVA/NEW YORK, 2 July 2021 – Billions of people around the world will be unable to access safely managed household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services in 2030 unless the rate of progress quadruples, according to a new report from WHO and UNICEF.
The Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) report –  Progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 2000 - 2020 – presents estimates on household access to safely managed drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services over the past five years, and assesses progress toward achieving the sixth sustainable development goal (SDG) to ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030’. For the first time, the report also presents emerging national data on menstrual health.
In 2020, around 1 in 4 people lacked safely managed drinking water in their homes and nearly half the world’s population lacked safely managed sanitation. COVID-19 has highlighted the urgent need to ensure everyone can access good hand hygiene. At the onset of the pandemic, 3 in 10 people worldwide could not wash their hands with soap and water within their homes.
“Handwashing is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, yet millions of people across the world lack access to a reliable, safe supply of water,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Investment in water, sanitation and hygiene must be a global priority if we are to end this pandemic and build more resilient health systems.”
Some progress reported, but not enough
The report notes some progress towards achieving universal access to basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services. Between 2016 and 2020, the global population with safely managed drinking water at home increased from 70 per cent to 74 per cent; safely managed sanitation services grew from 47 per cent to 54 per cent; and handwashing facilities with soap and water increased from 67 per cent to 71 per cent.
In 2020, for the first time, more people used improved on-site sanitation, such as pit latrines and septic tanks, which can effectively contain and treat waste, rather than sewer connections. There is need for governments to ensure adequate support for safely managed on-site sanitation, including faecal sludge management.
Urgent need for investment
The report makes clear that, if current trends persist, billions of children and families will be left without critical, life-saving WASH services, stating that by 2030:
· Only 81 per cent of the world’s population will have access to safe drinking water at home, leaving 1.6 billion without;
· Only 67 per cent will have safe sanitation services, leaving 2.8 billion without;
· And only 78 per cent will have basic handwashing facilities, leaving 1.9 billion without.
The report also notes vast inequalities with vulnerable children and families suffering the most. To achieve universal access to safely managed drinking water by 2030, the current rate of progress in the Least Developed Countries would need to increase ten-fold. In fragile contexts, where people were twice as likely to lack safe drinking water, it would need to accelerate by a factor of 23.
“Even before the pandemic, millions of children and families were suffering without clean water, safe sanitation, and a place to wash their hands,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Despite our impressive progress to date to scale-up these lifesaving services, the alarming and growing needs continue to outstrip our ability to respond. The time has come to dramatically accelerate our efforts to provide every child and family with the most basic needs for their health and well-being, including fighting off infectious diseases like COVID-19.”
Other key findings from the report include:
· Eight out of 10 people without basic water services lived in rural areas. Meanwhile, safely managed sanitation services reached 62 per cent of the world’s urban population, but only 44 per cent of its rural population.
· Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing the slowest rate of progress in the world. Only 54 per cent of people used safe drinking water, and only 25 per cent in fragile contexts.
· Emerging data on menstrual health show that, in many countries, a significant proportion of women and girls are unable to meet menstrual health needs, with significant disparities in particular among vulnerable groups, such as the poor and those with disabilities.
Accelerating WASH coverage will require prioritization at the highest levels of decision making by international agencies, governments, civil society and the private sector.  For this to happen, WASH must be a regular fixture on the agenda at high-level political meetings to ensure member states keep track of progress. This is important in the context of the forthcoming mid-term review of the Water Action Decade in 2023 – the first UN conference on water and sanitation in almost 50 years.

European Union launches a new Rule of Law programme in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Newly Merged Districts and in Balochistan
Islamabad, 02 July 2021—Today, the European Union and its partners launched a programme that aims to promote the rule of law and enhance the criminal justice system in Pakistan, with a specific focus on the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan. Anchored in the vision that an enhanced and reformed justice sector is the only sustainable solution for addressing critical and systematic weaknesses in justice delivery, the programme spans from 2021 till 2025, and is financed with EUR20 million.
Jointly implemented by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the programme aims to support reform processes to ensure delivery of people-centered justice, enhance access to justice for all, particularly women and less privileged/marginalized groups; and improve service delivery of the security sector in line with constitutional safeguards and international standards. The project will provide technical assistance to legal reforms and the Rule of Law roadmaps in KP and Balochistan. Special focus will be set on access to justice through free legal aid and alternative dispute resolution, as well as legal literacy for citizens. On the institutional side, the project will assist in upgrading facilities and processes to enhance citizen friendly service delivery.
The launch event was held in a socially distanced setting, with many participants and key stakeholders attending virtually. Honourable Chief Justice of Pakistan Mr. Justice Gulzar Ahmed graced the occasion as Chief Guest, along with Her Excellency Ms. Androulla Kaminara, EU Ambassador to Pakistan and Representatives of the three UN Agencies.
Honourable Chief Justice of Pakistan Mr. Justice Gulzar Ahmed thanked the EU and UN agencies for their support and expressed his confidence in the programme. “I am certain that together, we will be able to enhance access to justice for all, particularly women, less privileged and the marginalized groups and improve service delivery. The Government of Pakistan will extend all its support to the programme, enabling it to achieve its goal.”
EU Ambassador to Pakistan H.E. Ms. Androulla Kaminara thanked the UN agencies, provincial and federal government, and other important stakeholders for their support in strengthening the Rule of Law in Pakistan.  “Inclusive access to justice for all is an important prerequisite for a peaceful and just society. Today’s programme builds on the long-term commitment of the EU to improving the Rule of Law and access to justice for all in Pakistan. The new program is part of the priorities of the EU-Pakistan Strategic Engagement Plan 2019 and financed under the EU Multi-Annual Indicative Program 2014-2020. Both strategic documents support the implementation of the Vision 2025 in the focal areas: rural development, education, good governance, human rights, and Rule of Law.”
Spokesperson to Government of Balochistan, Mr. Liaquat Ali Shahwani, thanked the EU and UN agencies for their continued support towards the justice system in Pakistan. "The Rule of Law programme is indeed an important milestone in advancing the provision of an enabling environment, peace, and security for the citizens of Balochistan and we are most grateful for this support."
Finance Minister, Government of KP, Mr. Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra, expressed the KP Government’s appreciation for the programme, calling it a significant opportunity to address the various challenges faced by the province in securing citizen rights and access to justice. “The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has prioritized access to justice and strongly believes in the principle of “Leave No One Behind” in our development agenda as well.”
Speaking at the occasion, UNDP Resident Representative Mr. Knut Ostby said “I commend the European Union’s ongoing strategic support for key Rule of Law, security and Justice sector institutions for strengthened citizen’s access to justice. UNDP’s work strongly hinges upon the support that key government institutions have extended to our programmes over the years. We feel privileged and honoured by this support.  As we proudly partner with our sister UN agencies for inclusive and sustainable impact, our focus will be on taking forward the key lessons learned, on efficiently utilized resources, on inclusiveness and leaving no one behind. Being here today is a demonstration of our firm belief in rule of law, right to a fair trial, equality before law, as envisioned in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. ”
UN Women Pakistan Country Representative Ms. Sharmeela Rassool stated that, “In Pakistan, women constitute of almost 50% of the entire population. Yet they are not represented proportionately in receiving or delivering of basic and critical services including effective service delivery in the justice sector. UN Women is committed to deepening our efforts to ensure inclusion of women in formal justice delivery mechanisms in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to ensure their rights are safeguarded for promotion of a fair, efficient, gender-responsive and inclusive society.”
UNODC Pakistan Country Representative Mr. Jeremy Milsom hailed the programme as a milestone achievement and reiterated that, “UNODC is committed to working as a strategic partner to the Federal and provincial Government of Balochistan, implementing and strengthening transformative reforms across the chain of rule of law institutions towards delivery of a free and fair justice for all, including vulnerable and marginalized groups to support inclusive, just and citizen-friendly rule of law for the people.”

Global labour migration increases by five million
A new ILO report estimates that between 2017 and 2019 the number of international migrants has increased from 164 to 169 million.
GENEVA (ILO News) – The number of international migrant workers globally has risen to 169 million, a rise of three per cent since 2017, according to the latest estimates from the International Labour Organization (ILO).

The share of youth migrant workers (aged 15-24) has also increased, by almost 2 per cent, or 3.2 million, since 2017. Their number reached 16.8 million in 2019.

The new report, ILO Global Estimates on International Migrant Workers: Results and Methodology , shows that in 2019, international migrant workers constituted nearly five per cent of the global labour force, making them an integral part of the world economy.

Yet many migrant workers are often in temporary, informal or unprotected jobs, which expose them to a greater risk of insecurity, layoffs and worsening working conditions. The COVID-19 crisis has intensified these vulnerabilities, particularly for women migrant workers, as they are over-represented in low-paid and low-skilled jobs and have limited access to social protection and fewer options for support services.

“The pandemic has exposed the precariousness of their situation. Migrant workers are often first to be laid-off, they experience difficulties in accessing treatment and they are often excluded from national COVID-19 policy responses,” said Manuela Tomei, Director of the ILO Conditions of Work and Equality Department.
More than two-thirds of international migrant workers are concentrated in high-income countries. Of the 169 million international migrant workers, 63.8 million (37.7 per cent) are in Europe and Central Asia. Another 43.3 million (25.6 per cent) are in the Americas. Hence, collectively, Europe and Central Asia and the Americas host 63.3 per cent of all migrant workers.

The Arab States, and Asia and the Pacific each host about 24 million migrant workers, which, in total, correspond to 28.5 per cent of all migrant workers. In Africa there are 13.7 million migrant workers, representing 8.1 per cent of the total.

The majority of migrant workers – 99 million – are men, while 70 million are women.

Women face more socio-economic obstacles as migrant workers and are more likely to migrate as accompanying family members for reasons other than finding work. They can experience gender discrimination in employment and may lack networks, making it difficult to reconcile work and family life in a foreign country.
The share of youth among international migrant workers has increased, from 8.3 per cent in 2017 to 10.0 per cent in 2019. This increase is likely to be related to high youth unemployment rates in many developing countries. The large majority of migrant workers (86.5 per cent) remain prime-age adults (aged 25–64).
In many regions international migrant workers account for an important share of the labour force, making vital contributions to their destination countries’ societies and economies, and delivering essential jobs in critical sectors like health care, transportation, services, agriculture and food processing.

According to the report, 66.2 per cent of migrant workers are in services, 26.7 per cent in industry and 7.1 per cent in agriculture. However, substantial gender differences exist between the sectors: There is a higher representation of women migrant workers in services, which may be partly explained by a growing labour demand for care workers, including in health and domestic work. Men migrant workers are more present in industry.

“Labour migration policies will be effective only if they are based on strong statistical evidence. This report offers sound estimations, based on robust methods and reliable data integrating harmonized complementary sources,” said Rafael Diez de Medina, Chief Statistician and Director of the ILO Department of Statistics. “These policies can then help countries respond to shifts in labour supply and demand, stimulate innovation and sustainable development, and transfer and update skills.”.

Developing national priority sector export strategies for Pakistan
Islamabad: The Ministry of Commerce (MoC) and the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) are developing a coherent and comprehensive National Priority Sectors Export Strategy (NPSES) For Pakistan to achieve its trade growth ambition.
MoC and the TDAP conducted the value-chain consultations on priority sectors in the context of the Strategic Trade Policy Framework recently.
During the consultations, high-level public and private sector representatives agreed on a strategic vision for Pakistan’s trade growth – ‘Pakistan to become a dynamic and efficient domestic market and a globally-competitive export-driven economy’.
More than 180 public and private sector representatives participated in the round of consultations for charting the next export growth cycle of the country.
The strategy design process will focus on 10 of the priority sectors to develop implementable and measurable plans to increase their export competitiveness in the global market. It will chalk out detailed and quantifiable roadmaps, with set responsibilities for each implementing agency to bring about policy convergence, institutional alignment, and strategic private sector support.
The development of the NPSES is supported by the Revenue Mobilisation, Investment and Trade (ReMIT) Programme, implemented by the International Trade Centre (ITC), and funded by the United Kingdom Government through the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).
“The NPSES provides a key opportunity for the Government and private sector to work together in creating jobs and new opportunities for Pakistan. The world economy is changing fast, especially in the aftermath of the global health crisis, and we need to be strategic to participate in global value chains in line with objectives and policies of Ministry of Commerce” said Sualeh Ahmad Faruqi, the Federal Secretary of Commerce of Pakistan.
Annabel Gerry, the Director for Development for the UK in Pakistan said, “Trade and exports are a key part of Pakistan’s COVID-19 recovery and growth target for the current year. We are pleased to support the government in developing a National Priority Sectors Export Strategy enabling the private sector to improve export competitiveness, tap into new products and markets and make a positive contribution to growth and jobs.”
The following priority sectors were selected for strategic planning by MoC: 1. engineering goods, 2. leather, 3. processed food and beverages, 4. fruits and vegetables, 5. meat and poultry, 6. pharmaceuticals, 7. software development and services, 8. business process outsourcing, 9. logistics, and 10. institutional coordination.
Each sector session invited industry stakeholders to define an ambitious, yet realistic and achievable roadmap for expanding export performance. Regional public and private sector representatives as well as development partners also participated in the sessions.
These efforts will pave the way for activating Sector Advisory Councils. The Sector Advisory Councils, comprised of stakeholders from public and private sectors, will be tasked with providing continuous advisory support and industry perspective to the Government of Pakistan and the newly approved National Export Development Board, chaired by the honourable Prime Minister.

Police training and community awareness session on trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants – Held at Quetta, Balochistan – 29-30 June 2021
Under the EU funded GLO.ACT - Global Action to Address Trafficking in Persons and the Smuggling of Migrants (GLO.ACT – Asia and the Middle East), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), will conduct sessions on trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants for the Balochistan Police, Federal Investigation Agency, community elders, media, academia and civil society organisations. The sessions will be held at Quetta, the provincial Headquarters of Balochistan in Serena Hotel on 29-30 June 2021.
The purpose of conducting these sessions is to raise the awareness of relevant stakeholders to prevent and respond to trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants.
The main objective of the sessions is to deepen the understanding of the on Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants and help differentiate between Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants crimes. The sessions also aim to enhance awareness and understanding of The Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018 and The Prevention of Smuggling of Migrants Act, 2018, enacted in Pakistan and to understand the Human Rights and gender aspect of the laws on TIP and SOM.
Sessions will be delivered by Ms. Shahida Gillani, National Programme Officer from UNODC Country Officer Pakistan, Mr. Sardar Zaheer Ahmed, Director Anti-Human Smuggling, FIA and Mr. Qasim Khan Mandokhail, UNODC Expert.
The sessions will emphasize upon challenges being faced by LEAs related to combatting TIP and SOM crimes. It is a common perception that FIA is the only competent Agency to deal with the crimes of TIP and SOM, which is not the case. The Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act 2018 clearly refers that all internal trafficking cases must be dealt by Police, whereas all external trafficking cases shall be dealt by FIA.
The lack of awareness and lack of coordination among relevant law enforcement agencies and relevant stakeholders including civil society, media and academia is a key challenge. Lack of trust in law enforcement agencies was also flagged as a concern. Victims of these crimes also do not come forward to report perpetrators which, in turn, negatively impacts the cases.
The Global Action against Trafficking in Persons and the Smuggling of Migrants – Asia and the Middle East (GLO.ACT-Asia and the Middle East) is a four-year (2018-2022), €12 million joint initiative by the European Union (EU) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) being implemented in partnership with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in up to five countries: Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Afghanistan), Islamic Republic of Iran (I.R. of Iran), Republic of Iraq (Iraq), Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan). GLO.ACT-Bangladesh is a parallel initiative also financed by the EU and implemented with IOM.

#RatifyC190
Join the ILO’s global campaign for ratification of Violence and Harassment Convention
Public urged to take part in the campaign to raise awareness of violence and harassment in the workplace and to encourage their governments to ratify ILO Convention No. 190.
GENEVA (ILO News) – The International Labour Organization (ILO) is launching a global campaign to promote the ratification and implementation of Convention No. 190 on violence and harassment in the workplace.

The campaign aims to explain in simple terms what the Violence and Harassment Convention, 2019 (No. 190)  is, the issues it covers and how it seeks to address violence and harassment in the world of work.

The public can take part by downloading assets from the ILO campaign hub  and sharing them on social media.

The global campaign will also reach out to governments, employers’ and workers’ organizations, civil society and private sector companies, as well as policy makers, businesses and partners. Celebrities will also lend their voices to amplify the campaign messages.

Violence and harassment at work takes a range of forms and leads to physical, psychological, sexual and economic harm. Since the Convention was adopted the COVID-19 pandemic  has highlighted the issue further, with many forms of work-related violence and harassment being reported across countries since the outbreak began, particularly against women and vulnerable groups.

Together with Recommendation No. 206 , Convention No. 190 recognizes the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment, and provides a common framework for action. It provides the first internationally-accepted definition of violence and harassment in the world of work, including gender-based violence and harassment.

To date six countries have ratified the Convention – Argentina, Ecuador, Fiji, Namibia, Somalia and Uruguay

Inter Provincial Ministerial Group accelerates efforts for making women and girls count through the National Gender Data Portal
Islamabad: The 17th Inter Provincial Ministerial Group (IPMG) hosted by the National Commission on the Status of Women and UN Women brought together Secretaries of Women Development Departments (WDDs) and Chairpersons of Provincial Commissions on the Status of Women (CSW) to accelerate efforts for launching the National Data Gender Portal - a digital platform for collecting information and knowledge on gender issues in the country. This portal will contribute significantly for generation of an evidence base which will inform policy and programmatic interventions to improve the situation of women’s rights and address areas of concern on a priority basis.
The IPMG is the only inter provincial coordination forum having the potential and effectiveness for supporting the women’s empowerment and gender equality agenda through sharing of experiences, fostering peer learning, and developing strategies to fulfil the country’s national and international commitments. The group is structured to ensure representation of Ministers and Secretaries of Women Development Departments from four provinces, Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and the Chairpersons of National and Provincial Commissions on the Status of Women.
Member NCSW, Ms. Rubina Naz, in her opening remarks, appreciated the provincial WDDs and CSWs for their utmost efforts to protect and promote women’s rights in Pakistan. She expressed her gratitude to the participants for gathering at the very important platform of IPMG. She also thanked UN Women for its support in arranging the meeting as well as continued technical assistance offered to WDDs and CSWs.
Ms. Sharmeela Rassool, Country Representative, UN Women welcomed the participants and said, “IPMG is an innovation platform, and it gives me great pleasure to see that the entire women machinery of Pakistan is together collect today to strategize for gender equality and women’s empowerment. The idea of a Gender Data Portal was born in 2019 in a similar meeting of IPMG to address the issue of data credibility. Today we have successfully set it up. The National Gender Data Portal is designed to address this issue by collating gender related information and statistics on one platform, the first of its kind in Pakistan. All of you have an important role to play going forward to make it an effective and useful tool for understanding the situation and taking appropriate measures to improve it. Pakistan has the normative legislative framework for gender equality, however, there are immense challenges in the implementation of these laws. The portal will generate trends analysis and to help us identify these gaps. Nothing can stop us from achieving our goals if we keep this spirit of teamwork alive.”
Provincial Ministers and Secretaries shared information and updated the participants on future plans with a view to enhancing coordination and collaboration among the women machineries of the country.
Due to the prolonged COVID-19 emergency situation and other factors, resource mobilization for women empowerment and gender equality has become a challenge that was discussed by the participants. They also deliberated on strategies to mobilize resources for ensuring that women and girls are not left behind in social and economic recovery.
H.E Ms. Androulla Kaminara, European Union’s Ambassador to Pakistan, thanked the participants and said, “I’m really happy to see the effort towards formulation of credible data. Countries cannot achieve big change without credible data. We are supporting Rule of Law and Access to Justice initiatives in Pakistan and promotion of gender equality remains one of EU’s core values. We have signed a Strategic Engagement Plan with Pakistan, and the country’s GSP plus status and preferential access to EU market is linked with the implementation of its international commitments for gender equality. With the 18th Constitutional amendment, it is very important to enhance coordination and collaboration, and the IPMG is a huge step in the right direction. The country’s future depends on this group telling the policy-makers what works and where to direct their efforts.”
Ms. Humera Khan, Secretary NCSW thanked the dignitaries, and representatives of provincial government departments, secretaries, and development partners for participating at the IPMG meeting. She provided an overview of NCSW’s structure and key achievements and added, “the IPMG is a very effective forum for regular updates and information sharing and will be instrumental in ensuring the efficacy of the National Gender Data Portal. Through this initiative Pakistan will be able to generate credible data and analysis on women-related indicators. This will help NCSW in providing meaningful and relevant analysis for policymakers and legislators. Another important support for the NCSW is the formulation of the three-year strategic vision. This is an initiative the present commission can leave for the next commission as a roadmap. I hope that our way forward through the strategic vision may materialize soon.”

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY
AGAINST DRUG ABUSE AND ILLICIT TRAFFICKING
26 June 2021
Science and trust in science are the hero and lesson of the pandemic; the world needs both to win against the virus. Scientists delivered safe and effective vaccines in record time. Access to reliable and verifiable information is making the difference between life and death.
Action based on evidence is crucial for our responses to drugs, too.
The world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate pandemic impacts and hinder a healthy and inclusive recovery. The forthcoming World Drug Report 2021 from the United Office on Drugs and Crime shows that deaths attributed to disorders related to drug use have nearly doubled over the past decade.  New HIV infections among adults worldwide have declined in recent years, but not among people who inject drugs, who accounted for 10 per cent of new infections in 2019.
International cooperation has helped to limit the proliferation of new psychoactive substances, but the problem is shifting to poorer regions where control systems are weaker. Dark web drug sales continue to rise, and non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, including opioids, is expanding.
Drug trafficking and organized crime fuel and perpetuate cycles of violence and conflict. Armed groups and terrorists profit from the illicit drug trade, and the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of people even more vulnerable to drug crime and illicit crop cultivation.
Disparities in access to essential controlled medicines in low- and middle-income countries have been further heightened in the pandemic. For example, medical professionals in West and Central Africa in 2019 had four doses of pain medication every day for one million inhabitants; in North America, the number of doses was nearly 32,000.
Investing in balanced prevention as well as control of drug use and drug use disorders produces solid returns -- saved lives, healthier populations, improved workforce participation and productivity, and reduced criminal justice costs.
Many of the risk factors associated with crime and violent behaviour are also drivers of drug use, and targeted efforts focusing on these overlapping dynamics -- including childhood maltreatment and lack of social support -- can help to strengthen prevention.
Moreover, research suggests that law enforcement and policing need to go after the criminals at the upper levels of the drug trafficking chain, who reap the highest profits and wreak the greatest violence.
Public-private partnerships - with tech companies, postal and courier services, and shipping companies - represent an essential frontline response in the new fight against drug traffickers, who are increasingly exploiting the legal cargo trade and postal services to move their illicit product.
Better data is also helping to identify trends and enable real-time monitoring of rapidly shifting trafficking routes. Science-driven early warning systems are helping to predict emerging drug threats. Greater international cooperation and support are needed to help low-income countries to take advantage of these advanced capabilities.
The theme of this year’s observance of the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, “Share facts on drugs. Save lives” is a call for solidarity. I urge all Member States to listen to the science and take action, building on agreed international frameworks and drawing on United Nations support for health and justice.

Islamabad, 24 June 2021—Aimed at promoting social entrepreneurship and strengthening the startup ecosystem in the country, UNDP Pakistan and Jazz have launched SDG Bootcamp for Social Enterprises. Under the project, 20 bootcamps will be conducted across the county to train 800 young social entrepreneurs, including 50 percent women, over the course of two years. In this regard, a meeting was also held with Dr. Arif Alvi, President of Pakistan recently where Knut Ostby, Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan and Aamir Ibrahim, CEO, Jazz appraised the President about the project and its expected impact.
Aspiring social entrepreneurs across Pakistan can apply for registrations https://bit.ly/3wTQPFM. The focus will be on enterprises that are innovative, tackle at least one of the development challenges of the country and contribute to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The most promising social venture ideas will be provided seed money to start their initiatives.
UNDP has been a key partner for developing and implementing Prime Minister’s Kamyab Jawan Programme which aims to empower Pakistani youth through various projects. As part of the project, the trainees will have an opportunity to secure Kamyab Jawan loans to make their business ideas a reality.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Youth Affairs, Usman Dar said, ‘UNDP has been an important technical partner of the Prime Minister’s Kamyab Jawan programme since its inception. I am sure that this partnership between UNDP and Jazz will help in advancing the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the country and many beneficiaries of the SDG bootcamps will be able to secure Kamyab Jawan loans which would enable them to realize their business ideas.’
Speaking about the initiative, UNDP Resident Representative Knut Ostby said, ‘Social enterprises are cause-driven businesses whose primary purpose is to improve social objectives and serve the common good. It is essential to help the youth of Pakistan create businesses that not only lead to economic growth and job creation but are also beneficial to the society. UNDP’s Youth Empowerment Programme has been promoting entrepreneurship and supporting economic empowerment of youth in Pakistan through various initiatives. I am confident that this initiative with Jazz will help in further promoting social entrepreneurship as a viable career option among youth.’

Aamir Ibrahim, CEO, Jazz said, ‘The SDG Bootcamp for Social Enterprises complements the Government of Pakistan’s efforts to increase the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in driving economic growth. The project is in line with our focus on tech-led youth enablement, social innovation and women empowerment to help materialize the vision of Digital Pakistan, while offering solutions to youth unemployment and unlocking opportunities for aspiring social entrepreneurs across Pakistan.’
UNDP through its Youth Empowerment Programme supports the Government of Pakistan in developing innovative and sustainable pathways for social engagement and economic empowerment of young Pakistanis.  One of the key components of the Programme is youth entrepreneurship which not only nurtures young talent to create economic opportunities for all, but also spurs change and ensures inclusive development in the country. Through this partnership, UNDP and Jazz will contribute towards improving the startup ecosystem and enable youth to practically explore their innovative ideas and develop skills needed to succeed in the digital space.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON PUBLIC SERVICE DAY
23 June 2021
United Nations Public Service Day honors the hundreds of millions of public servants across the globe who dedicate themselves to ensuring the wellbeing of our communities.  As the world continues to face the devastation of the Covid-19 pandemic, their work is more important than ever.
This year’s observance highlights digital innovations in public services.
From telecommuting to online teaching to telemedicine, public servants have mobilized digital technologies to ensure the continuation of public services across all sectors despite the challenging and life-threatening circumstances of the pandemic.
Yet, while many governments have been able to move more and more of public services online, others have struggled.  Globally, the digital divides persist.  Not only do many people lack access to reliable broadband internet, but many others face barriers to accessing digital technology or don’t have the skills needed to access and navigate online public services effectively.
As public service delivery becomes increasingly digital, we must ensure that public servants have the necessary skills.  We must also ensure that all persons, including persons with disabilities and other groups facing exclusion, are able to access to online services. We will fully achieve the Sustainable Development Goals only when no one is left offline.
As we mark Public Service Day, let us continue to recognize, support and invest in our public servants both on- and off-line.  Let our public servants be empowered to serve.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON INTERNATIONAL WIDOWS’ DAY
New York, 23 June 2021
For many widows, losing their husband also means losing identity, land rights, property, income, and possibly their children.  Their physical safety is at greater risk, just when they may be suffering serious emotional trauma.
Human rights, including the right to inherit and own property, should not be contingent on marital status.  Inheritance laws and social safety nets should ensure that widows are protected and secure.
The COVID-19 pandemic has both increased the number of widows globally and exacerbated many of the challenges they face, including access to bank accounts and pensions. As governments provide economic and social support in response to the pandemic, they must consider the world’s 250 million widows.  Even before the pandemic hit, nearly one in ten widows lived in extreme poverty.
Social assistance, including cash transfers and pensions, can help support widows who are often left to take full responsibility for their families.  Governments should make special efforts to ensure these measures reach women with low visibility, for example, those without identity cards or bank accounts.
I urge every country, as a critical element of my Call to Action on Human Rights, to pass and implement legislation and policies that promote gender equality, and to repeal all discriminatory laws that perpetuate women’s subjugation and exclusion.  The persecution and disinheritance of widows, by law and custom, is one of the worst examples of gender discrimination.
On International Widows’ Day, let’s commit to making sure all widows occupy a respected place in our societies, with access to legal and social protection, so they can live their lives in peace and reach their full potential.

VIDEO MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN CONFLICT
19 June 2021
Sexual violence in conflict is a cruel tactic of war, torture, terror and repression.
It reverberates down generations, and threatens both human and international security.
In places affected by conflict, the turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has made it even more difficult to hold perpetrators of sexual violence to account.
At the same time, survivors face new obstacles to reporting crimes and accessing support services.
Even as we respond to the pandemic, we must investigate every case, and maintain essential services for every survivor.
We cannot allow this already underreported crime to slip further into the shadows. Perpetrators must be punished.
Investment in recovery from the pandemic must tackle the root causes of sexual and gender-based violence.
On this International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict, let’s resolve to uphold the rights and meet the needs of all survivors, as we work to prevent and end these horrific crimes.

VIDEO MESSAGE ON WORLD REFUGEE DAY
« TOGETHER WE HEAL, LEARN AND SHINE »
20 June 2021
War, violence and persecution have forced more than 80 million people around the world to flee their homes, leaving everything behind to save themselves and their families.
Refugees must begin their lives anew.
But for so many, the pandemic has wiped out their livelihoods, led to stigmatization and vilification and exposed them disproportionately to the virus.
At the same time, refugees once again demonstrated their invaluable contribution to their adoptive societies as essential and frontline workers.
We have a duty to help refugees rebuild their lives.
COVID-19 has shown us that we can only succeed if we stand together.
On World Refugee Day, I call on communities and governments to include refugees – in health care, education, and sport.
We heal together when we all get the care we need.
We learn together when we are all given the chance to study.
We shine together when we play as a team and respect everyone.
On World Refugee Day, I commend the countries that have welcomed refugees. But we need more support – from States, the private sector, communities and individuals – if we are to move together towards a more inclusive future, free of discrimination.
The refugees I have met have shown me what it means to rebuild your own life while summoning the strength to enrich the lives of others.
As High Commissioner for Refugees for 10 years, I was inspired by their courage, resilience and determination.
I thank refugees and displaced persons across the world and reiterate my personal admiration for what they have taught us all about the power of hope and healing.
This World Refugee Day and every day, we stand together with refugees.

1 million children born as refugees in three years globally
Number of people fleeing wars and violence rose to 82.4 million; forced displacement hits record high; one per cent of humanity is displaced.
ISLAMABAD, 18 June 2021: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency revealed on Friday that almost 1 million children were born as refugees between 2018 and 2020, and called for greater efforts to prevent and end conflicts. Failing to do so will result in children continuing to live as refugees for years to come.
According to a newly released Global Trends report by UNHCR, it is estimated that the number of people fleeing wars, violence, persecution and human rights violations in 2020 rose to nearly 82.4 million people – a 4 per cent increase on top of the already record-high 79.5 million at the end of 2019. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Filippo Grandi, called for greater political will to address conflicts and persecution that force people to flee.
Turkey hosts the largest refugee population worldwide with 3.7 million refugees, followed by Colombia with 1.7 million, and Pakistan with 1.4 million Afghan refugees.
According to the statistics, 1 per cent of humanity is displaced, and there are twice as many forcibly displaced people than in 2011, when the total was just under 40 million.
The 2021 World Refugee Day theme is: Together we heal, learn and shine. In Islamabad, UNHCR, together with the Government of Pakistan, organized a virtual event to express solidarity with refugees and the communities that generously hosted them.
The online event was attended by the UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Noriko Yoshida, the Commissioner for Afghan Refugees (Islamabad Headquarters), Mr. Farid Ullah Jan, other government officials, representatives from diplomatic missions, UN agencies, partners, civil society and refugees.
Speaking on the occasion, Ms. Yoshida said that the continuous rise in forced displacement worldwide is alarming. “The most worrying fact is that 42 per cent of all displaced people are children below the age of 18,” she said, adding that hundreds of thousands of children continue to be born as refugees, and that efforts should be made to prevent displacement across the globe.
“Despite its own challenges, Pakistan’s commitment to Afghan refugees has never diminished; it deserves special recognition”, Ms. Yoshida said. She appreciated the Government of Pakistan for its policies that include refugees, such as its national COVID-19 vaccination programme, and for the access to educational opportunities and health care that the country provides.
Referring to the Support Platform for Afghan Refugee Solutions created in 2019, she appreciated and welcomed the renewed interest shown by the international community in sharing the responsibility and burden with Pakistan in hosting Afghan refugees.
“In 2021, we mark World Refugee Day amid a continuing pandemic, and the pandemic has taught us that we are stronger when we stand together,” she added. Despite the challenges they face every day, she said that refugees have stepped up, working as doctors and nurses, and keeping their communities functioning. She said that given the chance, refugees will continue to contribute to a stronger, safer and more vibrant world.
Mr. Jan from the Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees, the government body responsible for managing Afghan refugee affairs in Pakistan, welcomed further international support for Pakistan’s efforts.
“The people of Pakistan opened their hearts to refugees and welcomed them when they fled conflict. For over forty years, we left no stone unturned in our support to refugees,” he said.
Afghan refugees who participated the virtual event also shared their thoughts, needs and dreams with the audience.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
PRESS STAKEOUT ON THE APPOINTMENT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO A SECOND TERM OF OFFICE
New York, 18 June 2021
Ladies and gentlemen of the media, Thank you very much for your presence.
It is an enormous pleasure to be with all of you today.
I am humbled but also energized by today’s decision of the General Assembly.
I take on the responsibility of serving a second term as Secretary-General with profound gratitude and a deep commitment to work together to advance the UN Charter at a time of great peril and promise.
We are at a crossroads, with consequential choices before us.
It can go either way: breakdown or breakthrough.
Breakdown and perpetual crisis — or breakthrough leading to a greener, safer and better future for all.
I will do everything in my power to push for breakthroughs.
I believe there are reasons to be hopeful.
The pandemic has revealed our shared vulnerability, our inter-connectedness and the absolute need for collective action.
Our biggest challenge — and at the same time our greatest opportunity — is to use this crisis as a chance to turn things around, to pivot to a world that learns its lessons, recovers fairer, greener and more sustainably, and forges ahead with much more effective global cooperation to address global concerns.
The Vision Statement I presented lays out the details for my second term.
The driving theme is prevention — prevention in all its aspects — from conflict, climate change, pandemics to poverty and inequality.
Indeed, our success in finding solutions to interlinked problems depends on our ability to anticipate, prevent and prepare for major risks to come.
That means more innovation, more inclusion and more foresight.
It means more investment in the global public goods that sustain us all.
All of this requires a reinvigorated multilateralism for the new era, based on principles of equity and solidarity.
Drilling down, I see ten inter-related imperatives for action.
It starts with mounting a massive and enduring response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences.
Our single most immediate test will be effectively overcoming COVID-19 and equipping the world to prevent and be better prepared for future pandemics and other existential threats.
Yet again, we see developing and many middle-income countries being left behind.  They require massive support.
The virus is spreading faster than vaccines.
We need an all-out effort to ensure vaccines for everyone everywhere — and we need it now.
Second, we must leave no stone unturned in the search for peace and security.
This is fundamental in an increasingly fragmented peace and security context, impacted by geopolitical divides and the constantly changing nature of conflicts.
Third, we need to make peace with nature and press for climate action.
Our world faces a triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature loss and pollution. This triple crisis is our number one existential threat. We need an urgent, all-out effort to turn things around.
Fourth, we must turbocharge the Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and a more equitable world.
The struggle against inequality is at the core of a new globalization that is fairer, more inclusive, sustainable and human-centric. We will advance our efforts to integrate work within the UN system that straddles across peace and security, sustainable development and humanitarian action, firmly underpinned by human rights.
Fifth, human rights must be central.
My Call to Action for Human Rights lays out a pathway for mainstreaming a human rights culture and prism within the UN.
Sixth, we must take gender equality to the next level.
Gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls are the most prevalent injustice across the globe. The world needs a new push for women’s leadership and equal participation.
I will build on our progress in promoting gender equality in all areas of our work.
Seventh, we must rise to the challenge of digital transformation.
Advances in technology and science have left no aspect of life untouched. We are all faced with a digital divide that is turning into a digital Grand Canyon. The aim must be an open, free and secure digital future. Our digital roadmap launched last year points the way.
Eighth, we will advance multilateralism and our common agenda.
A future of peace and problem solving requires an embrace of international cooperation and solidarity.
In September, responding to the UN75 Declaration, I will present a report on how to advance “our common agenda” to address present and future challenges.
Ninth, we will embark on a United Nations 2.0 — building on our reform efforts to date, we will strive for a more integrated, cohesive and joined up UN that also actively brings in outside networks.
Tenth, and underpinning all our efforts, is the focus on people — bettering the lives of individuals, families and communities.  Reaffirming the dignity and worth of the human person.  Rekindling a strong commitment to shared and enduring values.
The Charter lights the way.
I pledge to honour it every day to restore trust and to inspire hope.
Thank you very much.

Question:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary‑General, and congratulations on your re‑election for a second term.
You said in your speech that you were going to try to make the impossible possible. How are you planning to go and try and do that? How can that be achieved?
Secretary-General:  We are facing a number of dramatic fragilities - the pandemic but also climate change and biodiversity loss, lawlessness in cyberspace, the geopolitical divides. And it is clear that these challenges must be addressed, bringing together our capacity to work at a global level.
This is a time to strengthen multilateralism. This is a time to understand that each country alone can do nothing, that independently of the divisions that exist, countries must come together. And this was a central message that I conveyed today. To rebuild trust is the way to make the impossible possible.
If we remain divided, the impossible will remain impossible, and the fragilities of this world will translate themselves into bigger suffering for the people, especially the most vulnerable of the vulnerable.
Spokesman:  Sherwin Bryce‑Pease, South African.
Question:  Secretary‑General, congratulations.
Secretary-General:  Thank you.
Question:  Two questions for you, one probably more complicated than the other. Vaccine inequity has been broadly acknowledged here. What can the world do now to ensure that the 1 billion that was pledged by the G7 becomes the 11 billion that the World Health Organization (WHO) seeks?
And secondly, who's going to be your Deputy Secretary‑General in your second term?
Secretary-General:  Well, it's very simple. [Laughter]
First of all, in relation to the first question, we have many initiatives, but what we need is to bring those initiatives together and to scale up. So, that is the reason why I've been saying that we need - and I told it to the G7 summit just a few days ago - we need a global vaccination plan. And to have a global vaccination plan, my suggestion is to create an emergency task force at G20 level with the governments of all countries that produce vaccines or can produce vaccines, if technology is made available, supported by WHO, by Gavi, by international financial institutions, WTO (World Trade Organization), and being able to deal with the pharma, in order to make sure that this plan is designed to make vaccines available to everybody everywhere sooner rather than later, which means doubling the production capacity, having an equitable distribution, and supporting states to administer the vaccines when they get them and, third, that this plan is not only designed but is effectively implemented.
We need to align power and leadership. Unfortunately, in today's world, many times, those that have power have no leadership, and those that have leadership have no power. To vaccinate everybody everywhere, we need to make sure that the power that is essentially in the governments and the countries that have the capacity to produce vaccines and in the companies that produce them. We need to make sure that this power is aligned with effective leadership for vaccination to be everywhere.
Now, after being elected, I had the pleasure to invite the Deputy Secretary‑General to remain in my second mandate, and I hope she'll accept.
Correspondent:  Yay! [Laughter]
Deputy Secretary-General:  Absolute honour.
Secretary-General:  And by the way, the same invitation was addressed to the Chef de Cabinet. [Laughter]
Spokesman:  Elena, Portuguese News Agency.
Question:  [In Portuguese] Boa tarde, muitos parabéns pela re-eleição. Eu queria perguntar, nas suas prioridades tem, de longo prazo, pôr as pessoas no centro da actividade das Nações Unidas? Qual é a sua mensagem de esperança de curto prazo para as pessoas que caíram na pobreza durante a pandemia, aquelas que vivem no Brasil, nas favelas pobres, aquelas que ficaram desalojadas em Moçambique ou em Timor-Leste, ou até os idosos que estão esquecidos em Portugal – qual é a sua mensagem de curto prazo, de esperança, para eles?
Secretary-General:  [In Portuguese] A minha mensagem é clara – é absolutamente indispensável que, em toda a parte, os governos que estão a mobilizar enormes recursos para a reconstrução e a recuperação das economias o façam de uma maneira que é inclusiva e sustentável. Isto quer dizer que as desigualdades que dramaticamente foram aumentadas pelo COVID-19 têm que ser enfrentadas de uma vez por todas. Porque um mundo desigual é um mundo que se tona irrespirável, é um mundo em que a paz não pode ser mantida, é um mundo em que o sofrimento se espalha de uma forma verdadeiramente trágica. Este é o momento de reconhecer que o combate às desigualdades é um prioridade, e essa é a messagem que eu dirijo aos governos e com essa mensagem aos governos, uma mensagem de esperança em relação aos pobres que sao vítimas dessa desigualdade.
Question:  [In Portuguese] Os desfavorecidos, o que é que eles podem esperar nas próximas duas semanas, a curto prazo, alguma coisa vai mudar?
Secretary-General:  [In Portuguese] Bem, nas próximas duas semanas provavelmente não mudará muita coisa porque é necessário alterar as estratégias que até este momento têm vindo a ser postas em prática em relação à recuperação das economias e fazer com que essas estratégias sejam muito mais justas e que os recursos que têm existido à disposição dos países mais ricos possam ser postos também à disposição dos países mais pobres, que infelizmente nao têm a mesma capacidade no presente momento de investir nas respectivas populações e nas suas necessidades.
Spokesman:  Kristen Saloomey, Al Jazeera.
Question:  Congratulations, Secretary‑General.
Spokesman:  Your mask, please. Thank you.
Question:  Congratulations...
Secretary-General:  It's not because I can't understand what you say, because I'm deaf... [Cross talk]
Question:  No, I know. It's so difficult. This afternoon, the General Assembly is expected to pass a resolution on Myanmar, if all goes according to its sponsors’ plans. Given your emphasis on multilateralism and given the Security Council's inability to act on this issue and other issues, do you see a... what do you see as the role for the General Assembly in this new order, in this new call to come together? Thank you.
Secretary-General:  [In Portuguese] A minha posição em relação a Myanmar tem sido muito clara. [Cross talk]
Spokesman:  In English.
Secretary-General:  Sorry. In English. [Laughter] I was going on. [Laughter]
My position, in relation to Myanmar, is very clear. We absolutely must create the conditions for democracy to be reinstated, even if it was not a perfect democracy ‑‑ we all know, the military already had a strong presence in the institutions beyond the popular vote ‑‑ democracy to be reinstated, those that were be put in prison to be liberated, and for the horrible violations of human rights and the killings that have taken place to stop.
And I hope that the General Assembly will be able to send a very clear message in this direction, because we cannot live in a world where military coups become a norm. It is totally unacceptable.
Spokesman:  Thank you. We're going to squeeze one last one in, Mainichi.
Question:  Thank you very much, Secretary‑General... [Cross talk]
Spokesman:  Your mask, please. Sorry.
Question:  Oh. Thank you very much... [Cross talk]
Secretary-General:  You can take it off.
Question:  ... and congratulations.
Secretary-General:  Thank you.
Question:  I was wondering, what lesson did you learn in your first term? And what would you like do differently following that in your upcoming term? Thank you.
Secretary-General:  Well, there are many lessons that we learned, but the most important lesson is that alone we can do nothing. The most important lesson is that we need to rebuild solidarity and trust, and if there is something I need to do better in the second term, it is to make sure that I do everything I can to rebuild trust, trust among governments, trust between people in the institutions and trust in the United Nations.
Spokesman:  Thank you.
Secretary-General:  May I just say a final word. You represent the media, and I want to say that, in my second mandate as today, I can see that the freedom of press an absolutely essential basis for fair ... world order and that I'll do everything I can in order to make sure that the rights of journalists everywhere are fully respected and that we end this dramatic situation we are facing today where so many journalists are persecuted just because they speak the truth and where some have, unfortunately, even lost their lives.
So, thank you very much for your work, and please convey to your colleagues a very strong message of solidarity. Thank you.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD DAY
TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION AND DROUGHT
17 June 2021
Humanity is waging a relentless, self-destructive war on nature.
Biodiversity is declining, greenhouse gas concentrations are rising, and our pollution can be found from the remotest islands to the highest peaks.
We must make peace with nature.
The land can be our greatest ally.  But the land is suffering.
Land degradation from climate change and the expansion of agriculture, cities and infrastructure undermines the well-being of 3.2 billion people.
It harms biodiversity and enables the emergence of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.
Restoring degraded land would remove carbon from the atmosphere.
It would help vulnerable communities adapt to climate change.
And it could generate an extra $1.4 trillion dollars in agricultural production each year.
The best part is that land restoration is simple, inexpensive and accessible to all.
It is one of the most democratic and pro-poor ways of accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
This year marks the start of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.
On this International Day, let us make healthy land central to all our planning.

Domestic Workers' Day 2021
Ten years after international convention, domestic workers still fight to be recognized as workers and essential service providers, says the ILO
BANGKOK (ILO News) – Exclusion from national labour laws and high levels of informality continue to take a heavy toll on the working conditions of domestic workers in the Asia and the Pacific region, according to a new International Labour Organization (ILO) report launched today.

Making Decent Work a Reality for Domestic Workers: Progress and Prospects in Asia and the Pacific. Ten Years after the Adoption of the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011, highlights that the majority (61.5 per cent) of domestic workers in Asia and the Pacific are fully excluded from coverage under national labour laws while 84.3 per cent remain in informal employment.

“There is an urgent need to formalize domestic work in the Asia Pacific, starting with the inclusion of domestic work in labour and social security laws, to ensure that these vital workers are offered the protection and respect they deserve,” said Chihoko Asada Miyakawa, Assistant ILO Director General and Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific.

The Philippines is the only country in Asia and the Pacific to have ratified the Domestic Workers Convention ten years on from its adoption.

There are some 38.3 million domestic workers over the age of 15 employed in Asia and the Pacific of whom 78.4 per cent are women. The region is also the largest employer of male domestic workers, accounting for 46.1 per cent of male domestic workers worldwide.

Available data indicates that the vast majority of domestic workers in the region do not have any legal limits on their working time (71 per cent), nor any legal entitlement to weekly rest (64 per cent) under current labour laws. The report also finds that domestic workers typically earn some of the lowest wages in the labour market, especially when they are informal.

COVID-19 is also estimated to have had an outsized impact on domestic workers in Asia and the Pacific with the high levels of informality and lack of legal protection leading to job losses, estimated at 2-3 times higher than other workers.

UNICEF Regional Director George Laryea-Adjei concludes one-week visit to Pakistan
UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia conducts first visit in the country
to support polio eradication and continuity in essential services for children
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, 13 June 2021 - Today George Laryea-Adjei concluded his first official visit to Pakistan as UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia by stressing the importance of ensuring continuity of essential services for women and children.
“We know that COVID-19-related disruptions have had a devastating impact on the most vulnerable children and families over the past year,” George Laryea-Adjei said. “It is critical to ensure that lifesaving, essential services for children and mothers, including routine immunization, keep running even as the pandemic continues. UNICEF will continue to support the Government to respond to the pandemic and to build more resilient health and education systems that can reach every child.”
The UNICEF Regional Director began his visit by meeting Prime Minister Imran Khan with members of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Board in Islamabad. Together with Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, and representatives of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Laryea-Adjei attended the launch of the June polio campaign.
“It is inspiring to see the commitment of frontline workers and communities towards our joint vision of a polio-free Pakistan. I applaud the efforts to deepen the link between the polio eradication programme and routine immunization, which is a significant step in the right direction,” Laryea-Adjei said.
Laryea-Adjei visited Peshawar’s Shaheen Muslim Town and Karachi’s Gujro, two super high-risk districts in the north-western Khyber Paktunkhwa province and in the south-eastern Sindh province where polio is endemic.
UNICEF works with provincial authorities to run Integrated Services Delivery programmes that seek to provide a package of essential services in high-risk communities. Through the integrated approach, children are not only given polio drops but also immunized against other diseases and provided with a package which includes screening and treatment for malnutrition; birth registration; access to safe drinking water and sanitation services; advice on hygiene, child health care and early childhood development.
The Regional Director also stressed the need to overcome the devastating impact of the new surge of COVID-19.
“We may be exhausted, but the virus is not. As I speak, the virus continues to spread in South Asia, health workers are putting themselves at risk, and health systems are struggling,” Laryea-Adjei said. “Over one billion people are still waiting for their vaccine in the region. This includes over seven million frontline health workers who still are not fully vaccinated. The longer this virus continues to spread unchecked, the higher the risk of more deadly or contagious variants emerging. World leaders must step up to share excess doses and ensure health systems in South Asia are prepared for future waves of COVID-19.”
On Thursday, Laryea-Adjei visited the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) in Islamabad. A center of excellence, PIMS implements low cost, high impact interventions supported by UNICEF to save newborn lives. During his visit, the Regional Director met with mothers who are taught how to use ‘skin-to-skin’ contact to help care for their premature newborns in the Kangaroo-Mother Care unit. He discussed with front-line workers who work in the 24-hour immunization service room to make sure that no baby is discharged without receiving their first immunization dose of polio, tuberculosis, and hepatitis B vaccines.
“Despite progress, Pakistan remains one of the countries with the highest number of newborn deaths in South Asia, with one newborn dying every two minutes,” Laryea-Adjei said. “The country is headed in the right direction thanks to new policies and the dedication of front-line workers. However, more investment is needed in cost-effective, quality interventions to ensure every child survives its first days of life.”

یونیسیف کے ریجنل ڈائریکٹر جارج لاریا ایڈجے کا پاکستان کا ایک ہفتے کا دورہ اختتام کو پہنچا
اس دورے کا مقصد پاکستان میں پولیو کے خاتمے کے اقدامات کی حمایت اور بچوں کے لئے ضروری سہولیات  کی فراہمی جاری رکھنا تھا۔

اسلام آباد، پاکستان، 13 جون 2021 – آج یونیسیف کے ریجنل ڈائریکٹر برائے جنوبی ایشیا جارج لاریا ایڈجے کا پہلا سرکاری دورہ اختتام کو پہنچا۔ اپنے دورے کے اختتام پر انہوں نے ایک بار پھر پاکستان میں بچوں اور خواتین کے لئے ضروری سہولیات  کی فراہمی کا تسلسل برقرار رکھنے کی اہمیت پر زور دیا۔
اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے انہوں نے کہا:

’’ ہم جانتے ہیں کہ کووڈ 19 کی وجہ سے پیدا ہونے والی صورتِ حال نے گذشتہ برس کے دوران خطرات سے دوچار بچوں اور خاندانوں پر بد ترین اثرات مرتب کئے ہیں۔ اس صورتِ حال میں اس بات کو یقینی بنانا معمول سے زیادہ اہمیت اختیار کر گیا  ہے کہ عورتوں اور بچوں کی زندگیاں بچانے والی ضروری سہولیات جن میں قوتِ مدافعت بڑھانے کے لئے معمول کی ویکسین دینا بھی شامل ہیں کی فراہمی آفات کے دنوں میں جاری رکھی جائیں۔ انہوں نے یقین دلایا کہ یونیسیف حکومتِ پاکستان کی اس سلسلے میں مدد کرے گا کہ وہ اس عالمی وبا کا بھرپور مقابلہ کرسکے اور صحت و تعلیم کا ایسا مضبوط نظام تشکیل دے جس تک  ہر بچے کی رسائی ہو‘‘۔

یونیسیف کے ریجنل ڈائریکٹر نے اپنے اس دورے کا آغاز اسلام آباد میں عالمی سطح پر پولیو کے خاتمے کے بورڈ کے اراکین کے ساتھ وزیرِ اعظم پاکستان جناب عمران خان سے ملاقات سے کیا۔ اس ملاقات میں ان کے ساتھ عالمی ادارہ صحت کے ریجنل ڈائریکٹر برائے مشرقی بحیرہ روم ریجن ڈاکٹر احمد المنضداری اوربل اور ملینڈا گیٹس فاؤنڈیشن کے نمائندہ بھی شامل تھے جنہوں نے جون کی پولیو مہم کی افتتاحی تقریب میں بھی شرکت کی۔

اس تقریب میں بات کرتے ہوئے انہوں نے کہا کہ انہیں پولیو سے پاک پاکستان کے مشترکہ خواب کی تعبیر کے لئے سرگرمِ عمل فرنٹ لائن ورکرز اور پاکستان کے لوگوں کا عزم دیکھ کر دلی خوشی محسوس ہوتی ہے۔ انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ وہ انسدادِ پولیو کے پروگرام اور معمول کی ویکسینیشن کے عمل میں گہرے اشتراک اور تعاون کو تہہ دل سے سراہتے ہیں کیونکہ یہ درست سمت اٹھایا جانے والے ایک اہم قدم ہے۔


اپنے دورے کے دوران انہوں نے پشاور شاہین مسلم ٹاؤن اور کراچی کے گجرو ٹاؤن کا بھی دورہ کیا جائے جو شمال مغربی خیبر پختنونخواہ اور صوبہ سندھ کے پولیو کے خطرات سے دوچار علاقے ہیں جہاں پولیو وائرس موجود ہے ۔

یونیسیف صوبائی حکام کے ساتھ مل کر خدمات کی فراہمی کے مربوط پروگرام چلا رہا ہے جو زیادہ خطرات سے دوچار علاقوں میں ضروری خدمات کی فراہمی کو یقینی بنا رہے ہیں۔ اس مربوط طریقہ کار کی مدد سے بچوں کو نہ صرف پولیو ویکسین کے قطرے پلائے جاتے ہیں بلکہ ان میں دیگر بیماریوں کے خلاف لڑنے کے لئے قوت مدافعت بھی پیدا کی جاتی ہے۔ اس مقصد کے لئے انہیں خدمات کا ایک پیکج فراہم کیا جاتا ہے جس میں ناقص غذا ، پیدائش کے اندراج ، پینے کے صاف پانی تک رسائی اور صحت و صفائی کی خدمات تک، حفظانِ صحت پر مفید مشورے، بچوں کی صحت کی حفاظت اور بھرپور ابتدائی نشو و نما  یقینی بنانے  کے علاوہ  تشخیص اور علاج کی سہولیات بھی شامل ہیں۔


یونیسیف کے ریجنل ڈائریکٹر نے کووڈ 19 کی نئی تباہ کن لہر پر قابو پانے کی ضرورت پر بھی زور دیا۔

’’ ہوسکتا ہے کہ ہم وائرس سے لڑتے لڑتے تھک گئے ہوں مگر وائرس نہیں تھکا۔ جب میں یہاں بات کررہا ہوں تو وائرس جنوبی ایشیا میں پھیل رہا ہے۔ صحت کے اداروں  کا عملہ خود کو خطرات سے دوچار کررہا ہے اور صحت کا پورا نظام جدوجہد کررہا ہے۔ اس وقت اس خطے میں ایک بلین سے زیادہ لوگ ابھی تک ویکیسن کے منتظر ہیں اور ان میں  صحت کا عملہ بھی شامل ہے جس کی تعداد ستر لاکھ سے زیادہ ہے اور انہیں ابھی تک ویکسین نہیں لگائی جاسکی ۔ جب تک ہم اس وائرس پر مکمل  قابو نہیں پاتے اسے پھیلنے کا موقع ملے گا اور یہ  مزید  خطرناک ہوتا چلا جائے گا۔ اس کے پہلے سے خطرناک شکلیں   سامنے آتی رہیں گی۔   وقت کا تقاضا ہے کہ دنیا بھر کے رہنما متحد ہوکر ویکسین کی اضافی خوراک ان خطوں میں تقسیم کریں جہاں ویکسین کی کمی ہے۔ آئیں ہم اس بات کو یقینی بنائیں کہ جنوبی ایشیا میں صحت کا نظام کووڈ 19 کی آئندہ لہروں کا بھرپور مقابلہ کرنے کے لئے تیار  ہو ‘‘۔

جمعرات کے روز لاریا ایڈجے نے اسلام آباد میں پاکستان انسٹیٹیوٹ آف میڈیکل سائنسز (پمز) کا دورہ کیا۔ صحت کی سہولیات فراہم کرنے والے ایک بہترین مرکز کے طور پر پمز یونیسیف کے تعاون سے نومولود بچوں کی جان بچانے کے لئے  سستی  اور  موثر سہولیات فراہم کرتا ہے۔

اپنے اس دورے کے دوران ریجنل ڈائریکٹر نے ان ماؤں سے بھی ملاقات کی جنہیں یہ بتایا جاتا ہے کہ بچوں کی جلد سے جلد مس کرنا کانگرو مدر کیئر یونٹ میں وقت سے پہلے پیدا ہونے والے بچوں کی جان بچانے میں مدد کرتا ہے۔ اس موقع پر انہوں نے فرنٹ لائن ورکرز سے بھی بات کی جو چوبیس  گھنٹے بیماریوں کے خلاف مدافعت پیدا کرنے کی سہولیات کے یونٹ میں کام کرتے ہوئے اس بات کو یقینی بناتی ہیں کہ کوئی بچہ پولیو، تپ دق اور ہائپاٹائٹس بی  ویکسین کی پہلی خوراک لئے بغیر ہسپتال سے ڈسچارج نہ ہو ۔

’’نمایاں پیش رفت کے باوجود پاکستان جنوبی ایشیا کے ان ممالک میں شامل ہے اور جنوبی ایشیا میں  نومولود بچوں کی شرح اموات زیادہ ہے اور یہاں ہر دو منٹ میں ایک   بچہ موت کا شکار ہورہا ہے۔ یہ ملک درست سمت میں سفر کررہا ہے اور یہ سب صحت کی نئی پالیسیز اور فرنٹ لائن ورکرز کی شبانہ روز محنت سے ممکن ہوا ہے۔ تاہم اس بات کو یقینی بنانے کے لئے صحت کے لئے مزید وسائل مختص کرنے کی ضرورت ہے کہ ہر بچہ اپنی زندگی کے اولین ایام گذارنے کے لئے زندہ رہتا ہے‘‘، انہوں نے کہا۔

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL MESSAGE FOR THE 100-DAY COUNTDOWN TO INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE 2021 – “RECOVERING BETTER FOR AN EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE WORLD”
13 June 2021
Every year on 21 September, the United Nations invites people around the world to celebrate peace by observing 24 hours of ceasefire and non-violence.
As we strive to heal from the COVID-19 pandemic and reimagine a better future for people and planet, this year’s theme is “Recovering better for an equitable and sustainable world.”
Peace is the foundation of that recovery. The global vaccination effort cannot advance amidst armed conflict.
Nor can we build a sustainable, resilient, peaceful world while we are at war with nature. Recovery efforts offer an opportunity to transform our relationship with our planet and our environment.
The world cannot go back to what it was. As we count down to the International Day of Peace, I call on people everywhere to be part of a transformation for peace, by standing up against hatred and discrimination, by caring for the planet, and by showing the global solidarity that is so vital at this time.

FAO - PRESS RELEASE : Celebrating forest and landscape restoration
Celebrating forest and landscape restoration:
Success stories and lessons from Pakistan for the Asia-Pacific region
June 11, 2021, Islamabad – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations held a webinar; celebrating forest and landscape restoration; success stories and lessons from Pakistan for the Asia-Pacific region today to mark the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration - a rallying call for the protection and revival of millions of hectares of ecosystems all around the world for the benefit of people and nature as Pakistan hosted the World Environment Day 2021. Led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Decade on Restoration - which runs from 2021 to 2030 - was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in a 2019 resolution.
The webinar was attended by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change, Mr. Malik Amin Aslam, representatives from UNEP, FAO, CGIAR, academia, countries from the Asia-Pacific region and other stakeholders.
Welcoming the participants, FAO Representative a.i in Pakistan, Rebekah Bell stated that FAO is proud to be a partner of the government in the one billion tree tsunami, ten billion tree tsunami and other ecosystem restoration activities. The government’s ten billion tree tsunami initiative is being adapted by other countries as well. FAO currently has a Global Environment Facility funded program working to restore the highly degraded Chilgoza forest in the country by improving the forestry livelihoods of the local communities. We are also working  in southern Punjab to restore the rangeland based livelihoods of the communities. FAO along with IUCN, WWF are working together to provide monitoring support to the ten billion tree tsunami. FAO currently through the Global Climate Fund project is also introducing climate smart agriculture practices in the Indus basin in Sindh and Punjab, she added.
Speaking at the event, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change, Mr. Malik Aslam said that “the restoration of lands and forests is central to the idea of ecosystem restoration and in Pakistan, the ten billion tree project is a flagship project for the ecosystem restoration in the country. We have taken up new challenge of restoring one billion hectares of forest. Taking the right direction on the Decade Action on ecosystem restoration and commitments of all the countries will put us on the right path to tackle climate change”, he said.
The webinar highlighted regional strategy and action plans for forest and landscape ecosystem restoration and its relevance to Asia Pacific region through presentations and discussions from representatives of UNEP, FAO and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. The webinar concluded with question and answer sessions.

Child labour rises to 160 million – first increase in two decades
The International Labour Organization and UNICEF warn 9 million additional children at risk as a result of COVID-19 pandemic
NEW YORK/GENEVA, 10 June 2021 – The number of children in child labour has risen to 160 million worldwide – an increase of 8.4 million children in the last four years – with millions more at risk due to the impacts of COVID-19, according to a new report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF.
Child Labour: Global estimates 2020, trends and the road forward – released ahead of World Day Against Child Labour on 12th June – warns that progress to end child labour has stalled for the first time in 20 years, reversing the previous downward trend that saw child labour fall by 94 million between 2000 and 2016.
The report points to a significant rise in the number of children aged 5 to 11 years in child labour, who now account for just over half of the total global figure. The number of children aged 5 to 17 years in hazardous work – defined as work that is likely to harm their health, safety or morals – has risen by 6.5 million to 79 million since 2016.
“The new estimates are a wake-up call. We cannot stand by while a new generation of children is put at risk,” said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder. “Inclusive social protection allows families to keep their children in school even in the face of economic hardship. Increased investment in rural development and decent work in agriculture is essential. We are at a pivotal moment and much depends on how we respond. This is a time for renewed commitment and energy, to turn the corner and break the cycle of poverty and child labour.”
In sub-Saharan Africa, population growth, recurrent crises, extreme poverty, and inadequate social protection measures have led to an additional 16.6 million children in child labour over the past four years.
Even in regions where there has been some headway since 2016, such as Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean, COVID-19 is endangering that progress.
The report warns that globally, 9 million additional children are at risk of being pushed into child labour by the end of 2022 as a result of the pandemic. A simulation model shows this number could rise to 46 million if they don’t have access to critical social protection coverage.
Additional economic shocks and school closures caused by COVID-19 mean that children already in child labour may be working longer hours or under worsening conditions, while many more may be forced into the worst forms of child labour due to job and income losses among vulnerable families.
“We are losing ground in the fight against child labour, and the last year has not made that fight any easier,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Now, well into a second year of global lockdowns, school closures, economic disruptions, and shrinking national budgets, families are forced to make heart-breaking choices. We urge governments and international development banks to prioritize investments in programmes that can get children out of the workforce and back into school, and in social protection programmes that can help families avoid making this choice in the first place.”
Other key findings in the report include:
·        The agriculture sector accounts for 70 per cent of children in child labour (112 million) followed by 20 per cent in services (31.4 million) and 10 per cent in industry (16.5 million).
·        Nearly 28 per cent of children aged 5 to 11 years and 35 per cent of children aged 12 to 14 years in child labour are out of school.
·        Child labour is more prevalent among boys than girls at every age. When household chores performed for at least 21 hours per week are taken into account, the gender gap in child labour narrows.
·        The prevalence of child labour in rural areas (14 per cent) is close to three times higher than in urban areas (5 per cent).
Children in child labour are at risk of physical and mental harm. Child labour compromises children’s education, restricting their rights and limiting their future opportunities, and leads to vicious inter-generational cycles of poverty and child labour.
To reverse the upward trend in child labour, the ILO and UNICEF are calling for:
·       Adequate social protection for all, including universal child benefits.
·       Increased spending on quality education and getting all children back into school - including children who were out of school before COVID-19.
·       Promotion of decent work for adults, so families don’t have to resort to children helping to generate family income.
·       An end to harmful gender norms and discrimination that influence child labour.
·       Investment in child protection systems, agricultural development, rural public services, infrastructure and livelihoods.
As part of the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour, the global partnership Alliance 8.7, of which UNICEF and ILO are partners, is encouraging member States, business, trade unions, civil society, and regional and international organizations to redouble their efforts in the global fight against child labour by making concrete action pledges.
During a week of action from 10 – 17 June, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder and UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore will join other high-level speakers and youth advocates at a high-level event during the International Labour Conference to discuss the release of the new global estimates and the roadmap ahead.

ILO - PRESS RELEASE : SLOW JOBS RECOVERY AND INCREASED INEQUALITY RISK LONG-TERM COVID-19 SCARRING
SLOW JOBS RECOVERY AND INCREASED INEQUALITY RISK LONG-TERM COVID-19 SCARRING
ILO projections highlight the danger of a COVID-19 labour market legacy of increased geographic and demographic inequality, rising poverty and fewer decent jobs.
GENEVA (ILO News) - The labour market crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, and employment growth will be insufficient to make up for the losses suffered until at least 2023, according to a new assessment by the International Labour Organization (ILO).
The ILO’s World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2021, (WESO Trends) projects the global crisis-induced ‘jobs gap’ will reach 75 million in 2021, before falling to 23 million in 2022. The related gap in working-hours, which includes the jobs gap and those on reduced hours, amounts to the equivalent of 100 million full-time jobs in 2021 and 26 million full-time jobs in 2022. This shortfall in employment and working hours comes on top of persistently high pre-crisis levels of unemployment, labour underutilization and poor working conditions.
In consequence, global unemployment is expected to stand at 205 million people in 2022, greatly surpassing the level of 187 million in 2019. This corresponds to an unemployment rate of 5.7 per cent. Excluding the COVID-19 crisis period, such a rate was last seen in 2013.
The worst affected regions in the first half of 2021 have been Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe and Central Asia. In both, estimated working-hour losses exceeded eight per cent in the first quarter and six per cent in the second quarter, compared to global working-hour losses of 4.8 and 4.4 per cent in the first and second quarter, respectively.
Global employment recovery is projected to accelerate in the second half of 2021, provided that there is no worsening in the overall pandemic situation. However this will be uneven, due to unequal vaccine access and the limited capacity of most developing and emerging economies to support strong fiscal stimulus measures. Furthermore, the quality of newly created jobs is likely to deteriorate in those countries.
The fall in employment and hours worked has translated into a sharp drop in labour income and a corresponding rise in poverty. Compared to 2019, an additional 108 million workers worldwide are now categorized as poor or extremely poor (meaning they and their families live on the equivalent of less than US$3.20 per person per day). “Five years of progress towards the eradication of working poverty have been undone,” the report says, adding that this renders the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating poverty by 2030 even more elusive.
The COVID-19 crisis has also made pre-existing inequalities worse by hitting vulnerable workers harder, the report finds. The widespread lack of social protection – for example among the world’s two billion informal sector workers – means that pandemic-related work disruptions have had catastrophic consequences for family incomes and livelihoods.
The crisis has also hit women disproportionately. Their employment declined by 5 per cent in 2020 compared to 3.9 per cent for men. A greater proportion of women also fell out of the labour market, becoming inactive. Additional domestic responsibilities resulting from crisis lockdowns have also created the risk of a “re-traditionalization” of gender roles.
Globally, youth employment fell 8.7 per cent in 2020, compared with 3.7 percent for adults, with the most pronounced fall seen in middle-income countries. The consequences of this delay and disruption to the early labour market experience of young people could last for years.
The pandemic’s impact on young people’s labour market prospects is laid out in greater detail in an ILO brief published alongside the WESO Trends. The Update on the youth labour market impact of the COVID-19 crisis also finds that gender gaps in youth labour markets became more pronounced.
“Recovery from COVID-19 is not just a health issue. The serious damage to economies and societies needs to be overcome too. Without a deliberate effort to accelerate the creation of decent jobs, and support the most vulnerable members of society and the recovery of the hardest-hit economic sectors, the lingering effects of the pandemic could be with us for years in the form of lost human and economic potential and higher poverty and inequality,” said ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder. “We need a comprehensive and co-ordinated strategy, based on human-centred policies, and backed by action and funding. There can be no real recovery without a recovery of decent jobs.”
As well as looking at working hour and direct employment losses, and foregone job growth, the WESO outlines a recovery strategy structured around four principles: promoting broad-based economic growth and the creation of productive employment; supporting household incomes and labour market transitions; strengthening the institutional foundations needed for inclusive, sustainable and resilient economic growth and development; and using social dialogue to develop human-centred recovery strategies.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON WORLD ENVIRONMENT DAY
5 June 2021
We are rapidly reaching the point of no return for the planet.
We face a triple environmental emergency –biodiversity loss, climate disruption and escalating pollution.
For too long, humanity has cut down the Earth's forests, polluted its rivers and oceans, and ploughed its grasslands into oblivion.
We are ravaging the very ecosystems that underpin our societies.
And, in doing so, we risk depriving ourselves of the food, water and resources we need to survive.
The degradation of the natural world is already undermining the well-being of 3.2 billion people – or 40 per cent of humanity.
Luckily, the Earth is resilient.
But she needs our help.
We still have time to reverse the damage we have done.
That is why, on this World Environment Day, we are launching the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.
This global movement will bring together governments, businesses, civil society and private citizens in an unprecedented effort to heal the Earth.
By restoring ecosystems, we can drive a transformation that will contribute to the achievement of all the Sustainable Development Goals.
The task is monumental.
We need to replant and protect our forests.
We need to clean up our rivers and seas.
And we need to green our cities.
Accomplishing these things will not only safeguard the planet’s resources.
It will create millions of new jobs by 2030, generate returns of over $7 trillion dollars every year and help eliminate poverty and hunger.
The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration is a global call to action.
It will draw together political support, scientific research and financial muscle to massively scale up restoration.
Everyone can contribute.
Science tells us these next 10 years are our final chance to avert a climate catastrophe, turn back the deadly tide of pollution and end species loss.
So, let today be the start of a new decade – one in which we finally make peace with nature and secure a better future for all.

UNDP - PRESS RELEASE : Government of Pakistan and UNDP Pakistan organize “Pedal for a Green Pakistan” cycling event in Islamabad as a prequel to World Environment Day celebrations
Government of Pakistan and UNDP Pakistan organize “Pedal for a Green Pakistan” cycling event in Islamabad as a prequel to World Environment Day celebrations
Islamabad, 1 June, 2021—Government of Pakistan and UNDP Pakistan organized ‘Pedal for a Green Pakistan’ cycling event in Islamabad as a prequel to World Environment Day celebrations. The cycling event was led by Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in partnership with Ministry of Climate Change, UNDP Pakistan, and Urban Innovation.
World Environment Day is celebrated every year on 5 June—engaging governments, businesses and citizens in an effort to address pressing environmental issues. Every year the day is hosted by different countries. This year Pakistan is the global host.
The cycling event was part of the series of activities planned to celebrate World Environment Day. Led by Foreign Minister Mr. Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi, members of the diplomatic corps and UN agencies based in Islamabad, along with representatives from the Foreign Ministry, cycled from D-chowk Constitution Avenue to the Foreign Office Building. The event was held to encourage and promote the use of bicycles for the reduction of carbon footprint, noise pollution and vehicular emission.
Speaking at the event, the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi said, “The theme of this year’s Environment Day, Ecosystem Restoration, is at the heart of Prime Minister’s Green Vision, and Pakistan is committed to continue playing our due role in countering the climate crisis, protecting biological diversity and promoting ecosystem restoration.”
State Minister for Climate Change, Ms. Zartaj Gul while addressing the participants highlighted Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate related disasters, and how it’s constantly facing the brunt of climate change on its diverse natural ecosystems. She also emphasized on the important role Pakistan is playing and the future actions we can take to address this.
Special Assistant to Prime Minister, Mr. Malik Amin Aslam thanked the participants of the cycling event for coming together and highlighting that environmental conservation and climate action is a collaborative journey towards ecosystem restoration and a green economy.
“The degree of commitment demonstrated by Pakistan, by developing its green agenda, especially the reforestation efforts through the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami programme  is impressive,” said UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative, Mr. Knut Ostby, while congratulating Pakistan on hosting the World Environment Day. “UNDP remains committed in assisting the government, institutions, and the people of Pakistan to achieve its ‪Sustainable Development Goals, and to be an active contributor towards meaningful climate action.”
Multiple documentaries on Pakistan’s rich biodiversity, and on key initiatives on ecosystem restoration and climate action were also screened at the event.

World Environment Day 2021 calls for urgent ecosystem restoration

5 June 2021

Where: Global
Date: 5 June 2021
More information: https://www.worldenvironmentday.global
What:
Celebrated every year on June 5, World Environment Day is the United Nations’ biggest annual event for positive environmental action to encourage worldwide awareness of the need to protect our planet. Since the first World Environment Day in 1974, the event has grown to become a global platform for positive public outreach on the environment in over 100 countries.
The 2021 World Environment Day is hosted by Pakistan on the theme of “Ecosystem Restoration” under the campaign “Reimagine. Recreate. Restore.” This year, the Day will also serve as the formal launch of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030. The official hashtags for the Day are #GenerationRestoration and #WorldEnvironmentDay. Celebrations around the world take place with a hybrid of digital and in-person events.
Ecosystem Restoration

This year, World Environment Day calls for urgent action to revive our damaged ecosystems.
Humans are losing and destroying the foundations of our survival at an alarming rate. Over 4.7 million hectares of forests – an area larger than Denmark – are lost every year.
As a result, ecosystem loss is depriving the world of carbon sinks such as forests and peatlands. Global greenhouse gas emissions have grown for three consecutive years and the planet is on track for potentially catastrophic climate change.
By shrinking the area of natural habitat for wildlife, we have created ideal conditions for pathogens – including coronaviruses – to spread, something that has been brought into sharp focus with the emergence of COVID-19.
Events to watch out for on UNEP’s website and social media platforms:
World Environment Day 2021 will see the launch of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration: A global rallying cry for everyone – from governments to corporations and citizens – to do their part in healing our ailing planet.
Confirmed speakers include:
Pakistan will make the announcement as part of the main host-country event, taking place at the Jinnah Convention Center in Islamabad and officiated by Prime Minister Imran Khan with the participation from a host of dignitaries from around the world including, Inger Andersen, UNEP’s Executive Director, and senior officials from The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), UN-Habitat, UNDP among others as well as from the governments of Germany and Saudi Arabia. The event will also feature songs and videos on Pakistan’s Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Programme.
Her interests are predominantly around environmental justice and the disproportionate impacts of climate change and pollution on people of color, a theme more relevant than ever in 2021. While the topic is poignant, Jordan has a skill of framing it around solutions and with optimism, as you can see in her latest poem: https://youtu.be/zohtgdQtEHo. Read more about Jordan here.
For more activities, browse through this extensive list of events hosted by UNEP and supporters, featuring high level speakers, expert panels, virtual tours of products and places, Goodwill Ambassadors, Young Champions of the Earth, film screenings, music sessions and other events taking place in Pakistan, the World Environment Day host country.

●     The medical equipment will potentially save 900,000 COVID-19 patients, including in 75 health facilities in 35 districts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, as well as across Pakistan by helping provincial disaster management authorities test people for COVID-19.
●     The gender-specific personal protective equipment (PPE) will enable 100,000 male and female frontline medical staff to work safely, effectively, and comfortably.
Over the last year with the generous funding of $4 million from the Government of Japan, UNOPS procured and delivered the most critically needed medical supplies for Pakistan’s COVID-19 response, working closely with National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Health Department of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (HD-KP) province. As a result, 1,000,000 people, including 900,000 COVID-19 patients and 100,000 doctors, nurses, and medical staff, will benefit from the project.
The procured items include protective dangris, disposable masks, latex gloves, portable ultrasound machines with video printers, electrical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, pulse oximeters, BiPAP machines for non-invasive oxygen support, PCR testing machines and kits, automated extraction kits, Viral Transport Mediums (VTMs), and swabs.
Gender-responsive procurement of PPE included consideration of sizing requirements for men and women and allocation of PPE based on gender requirements of the hospitals. Therefore, both men and women can easily use the PPE when treating COVID-19 patients.
For a quick and efficient delivery of these items, UNOPS used Emergency Procurement Procedures which have been used by UNOPS to effectively support countries across the globe in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. UNOPS coordinated the timely identification and distribution of equipment and supplies with the government partners, ensuring maximum transparency in the process.
The project is part of an agreement between the Government of Japan and UNOPS to support countries in Asia, including Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan, in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak through efficient emergency procurement of medical equipment and supplies.
Ms. Marysia Zapasnik, UNOPS Country Manager for Pakistan, said:
“During these difficult times of a COVID-19 pandemic, supporting each other and working together in strong partnership is especially important. Thanks to generous and timely funding from the Government and People of Japan, UNOPS has been able to provide critical medical equipment to the NDMA and HD-KP. This enabled them to do their job to respond to and curtail the spread of COVID-19 in Pakistan.
The equipment has increased their capacity to test and act quickly when COVID-19 is detected, to effectively fight the spread of the virus, to protect the lives of female and male frontline medical workers, and ultimately, to save the lives of girls, boys, men, and women in communities across Pakistan. UNOPS remains committed to working together with our government counterparts, key players in the health sector, and the donor community, in pursuit of better health outcomes for all the people of Pakistan.”
Mr. Muhammad Idrees Mahsud, Member of Disaster Risk Reduction unit, NDMA said:
“This project will play a key role in our response to COVID-19 in Pakistan. Through the provision of VTMs and swabs, PCR testing kits, extraction kits, and the PCR machine, the project will help us enhance our diagnostic capacity and will enable us to protect our medical personnel with the medical supplies to tackle this pandemic in Pakistan. We are proud to work with UNOPS Pakistan to help the people in our country."
Mr. Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Secretary to Government of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa said:
“The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa highly appreciates UNOPS and the Government of Japan for their support through the provision of medical supplies and equipment, including electrical ICU beds, portable ultrasound and BiPAP machines, pulse oximeters, PPE and COVID-19 testing kits for the most critically ill COVID-19 patients. The support during this challenging time has contributed to the effective response to COVID-19 in our province. We look forward to continued cooperation with UNOPS to build a better future for all people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”
Dr. Amena Hasan, UNOPS Project Manager, said,
“Thanks to UNOPS's efficient and transparent Emergency Procurement Procedures, this project successfully addressed the critical needs of medical supplies and equipment in order to fight COVID-19 in Pakistan. The project has helped to protect the healthcare professionals as well as to extend life saving medical care to COVID-19 patients.
We are pleased that the project’s benefits have also reached some of the most distant and disadvantaged communities in the country. This was made possible through working in close coordination with the Government of Japan, NDMA and HD-KP to identify and provide the essential supplies and equipment. We would like to thank all our partners for their continued support in this project."

The International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers honors the more than one million women and men who have served on the frontlines of conflict and the more than 4,000 who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Their service and sacrifices will never be forgotten.
I express my deep gratitude to the 85,000 civilian, police and military personnel currently deployed in some of the world’s most challenging hotspots to protect the vulnerable and help to build peace. Despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, as well as the risk of infection, these men and women have pursued their mission while also supporting local authorities in the fight against COVID-19. I offer sincere condolences to the families of peacekeepers who have fallen victim to this terrible disease.
This year’s observance focuses on the central question of youth, peace and security. In every country where our peacekeepers work, peace can only be achieved with the active participation of young people. The world needs to do far more to address their needs, amplify their voices and ensure their presence at decision-making tables.
Our Missions play an important role in protecting and supporting young people, in particular young women and girls, to reduce violence and sustain peace. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, MONUSCO is working with youth who are vulnerable to recruitment by armed groups, to provide viable and sustainable alternatives to violence. In South Sudan, the inclusion of youth groups in peace processes has helped strengthen relations between subnational and national actors. In the Central African Republic and in Mali, MINUSCA and MINUSMA have worked closely with youth representatives to increase voter turnout in recent elections.
One of our greatest strengths is our own young peacekeepers, in particular young women peacekeepers who contribute every day to debunking deeply entrenched gendered stereotypes and inspire young women and girls to seek non-traditional paths and opportunities.
United Nations peacekeeping helps nurture peace in some of the world’s most dangerous places. Today and every day, we salute the dedication and bravery of our peacekeepers in helping societies turn away from war and towards a safer, more stable future.

The world is experiencing a growing pandemic of obesity.  It affects people of all ages in all regions.  Particularly concerning are the young people affected.  In the past four decades, the percentage of 5–19-year-olds who were overweight or obese increased more than four-fold, from 4 per cent to 18 per cent.  Globally, more than 4 million people die each year due to overweight or obesity.
Once considered a problem of high-income countries, overweight and obesity are now on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings.  The vast majority of overweight or obese children live in developing countries, where the rate of increase has been more than 30 per cent higher than that of developed countries.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted how obesity is a threat to health, as obese patients have four times the risk of developing the most severe consequences of COVID-19.  The World Health Assembly has established targets to curb obesity in children, adolescents and adults by 2025.  At current rates of progress, none of these targets is likely to be met, yet obesity and its associated health problems can be curbed.
First, we need better prevention, starting with good nutrition during pregnancy, followed by exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and continued breastfeeding for the first two years and beyond.  Second, we need policies and investments that make it easier to access healthy and nutritious food – something that should be addressed at the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit.  Third, people who are overweight or obese need better care in the primary healthcare system.
On this World Digestive Health Day, let us commit to work together to address obesity for a sustainable and healthy world.

UN Habitat Launched Waste Wise Cities Tool in Pakistan-27th May 2021
On World Environment Day 2021 Celebration event, UN-Habitat launched Waste Wise Cities Tool (WaCT) in Pakistan for restoration of urban and marine ecosystem, in collaboration with Ministry of Climate Change, UN Environment, Sindh Environment Protection Agency, Directorate of urban policy and strategic unit Sindh, Sindh Solid Waste Management Board and NED University of Engineering and Technology. The WaQT will be applied in Karachi to analyze the challenges of solid waste management in the city and will identify policy and infrastructure gaps for the improved solid waste management.
The kickoff event took place in Karachi on 27th May 2021 in hybrid mode. Barrister Murtaza Wahab Advisor to Chief Minister Sindh for law, environment, Climate change and coastal development, Sindh was the Chief Guest. Mr. Jawed Ali Khan, HPM, UN Habitat welcomed the participants. Ms. Maimunah Sharif, Executive  Director, UN Habitat gave the opening remarks virtually and extended sincere congratulations to the Government of Pakistan for  hosting this year’s observance of World Environment Day.  She highlighted that if we want to address this pandemic and the current global environmental challenges such as solid waste, they must be used to transform, to build back better. UN-Habitat is assisting cities through actions including waste data and monitoring, knowledge sharing, education and advocacy.
Ms. Jouce Msuya , Deputy Executive Director and Assistant Secretary General UNEP while giving remarks virtually said that urbanization is growing at an alarming pace s causing degradation to the environment. As the cities grow, the problem of solid waste management is worsening. If the trend continues, 12 billion tonnes of plastic waste will be part of the environment by 2050. She appreciated UN Habitat for launching Waste Wise Cities Tool in Karachi and UN Environment look forward to work to deploy sustainable solutions.
Mr. Imran Ismail, Governor Sindh while addressing virtually highlighted the commitment of the present government to solve waste and the environmental challenges. Mr. Julien Haneis, Resident Coordinator, UN appreciated UN Habitat initiative of Waste Wise Cities tool and deliberated that this will help to make Pakistani cities clean and healthy. Ms. Marysia Zapasnik, Country Manager, UNOPS and Mr. Zubair Ahmed Channa, Managing Director, Sindh Solid Waste Management Board also appreciated the UN Habitat initiative and assured full support to successfully implement the Waste Wise Cities Tool in Karachi. Dr. Sarosh Lodhi, Vice Chancellor, NED University deliberated that we must recognize that the restoration of nature is imperative to the survival of our planet and the human race.”

REMARKS BY H.E. MR. VOLKAN BOZKIR
PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
National Defence University, Islamabad, Pakistan
27 May 2021

- as prepared for delivery -
Excellencies,
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
It is a true privilege to speak to you, here today in Islamabad. I am most grateful to meet members of the diplomatic community, the civil and military personnel who are leading a life of service.
Preparing for today, I began to reflect upon the milestones of my Presidency thus far. Throughout the seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly, in the most challenging times in modern history, the membership has recommitted to multilateralism, time and time again.
Yet no one would have thought, at this time last year, as I sought election as President of the General Assembly, the United Nations headquarters had closed their doors, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Little did any of us realise, the impact the pandemic would have, on how we go about our work, and our daily lives.
This was the first domino to fall. It catalysed a series of political, economic, and social challenges , which required a multilateral response. People were suffering. Those who were in the most precarious situations prior to the pandemic, were pushed closer to the brink, at risk of being left behind permanently.
My challenge was to resuscitate the international community. As Member States came to terms with the health crises, and related crises within their own borders, it was up to me, as President of the General Assembly, to rally the membership, to commit to collective solutions, for the people we serve.
If this past year has taught us one thing, it is that nothing is certain. We need to evolve in pace, with the rapidly developing world we are operating within. Make no mistake, I repeat again that, multilateralism is the only path forward.
The people of the world, made this quite clear, when surveyed last year. They want a United Nations, that is fit for purpose, able to meet the challenge of the day. The United Nations we need, for the future we want.
However, we have a long way to go, before we meet the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, uphold universal human rights, or achieve peace worldwide.
COVID-19 has resulted in a loss of lives, and livelihoods. The impact of the pandemic, has hit the most vulnerable the hardest.
As we face the deepest global economic recession, since the Great Depression:
• Global extreme poverty numbers are expected to rise, as 115 million people are on the verge of falling into extreme poverty.
• 235 million people, will need humanitarian aid this year.
• Approximately 690 million people are at risk of malnutrition.
This has knock-on effects,
• In 22 countries, violence and conflict are the root causes of the hunger.
• Millions of people are on the move: displaced, due to conflict, persecution, hunger, and climate change.
• Women and girls have experienced gender-based violence, at an unprecedented rate.
• Children are at high risk for child labour, child marriage, and trafficking.
• Xenophobia, racism and discrimination on ethnic and religious grounds, are on the rise.
• Violence against members of religious groups and places of worship, have been increasing.
Excellencies,
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
We need to take urgent action now, to reverse these trends. The multilateral system has suffered a great trauma as a result of this pandemic. Business as usual will not put us on the road to recovery. Now is the time for the defibrillator. We need to shock the system.
That is what we are doing. The United Nations is working to meet the needs of the people we serve, when they need us most. The General Assembly is calling on all Member States, to come forth with solutions, to the most critical problems facing the people we serve.
Just last week I convened a meeting on the situation in Palestine, following a joint request from the Chair of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Chair of the Arab Group. I convened this meeting in large part to compensate for the silence and deadlock in the Security Council. The Security Council must shoulder its responsibilities and overcome yet again its paralysis on this longest-standing item on its agenda. Inaction on this issue undermines, and indeed hinders, the ability and credibility of the Council and the United Nations regarding other pressing peace and security matters. I hope that we will hear a unified voice from the Security Council on this important and urgent subject.
As for the General Assembly, we assumed our responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations and met to address the grave violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. These violations caused the loss of lives for hundreds of innocent Palestinians, the majority of whom were children and women.
The announcement of a ceasefire, as the UN General Assembly was still in meeting, was a significant development. As I emphasized in my “Appeal for Peace”, it also showed that, when the General Assembly takes the lead, and member states speak up together, we get results.
I avail of this opportunity to commend His Excellency the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan for taking the time to participate in this meeting in person, and for his strong stance in support of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.
We have a duty, to prevent any further erosion of international law. It is critical to support those who survived the attacks, since they remain dependent on a weak health care system, with inadequate equipment and constant drug shortages. The COVID-19 pandemic is a further setback to the already dire situation.
Moving forward, the institutional record of the UN clearly prescribes how to translate words into action when it comes to the Palestinian issue.
We need:
• a swift return to negotiations,
• with the goal of ending the occupation,
• addressing all final status issues, including the status of Jerusalem,
• and achieving two independent, sovereign, viable States: Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace, security and mutual recognition, within recognized borders on the basis of the pre-1967 lines, with Jerusalem as the capital of both States.
I assure you, the General Assembly will not relent, until there is peace in the Middle East.
Excellencies,
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
I am also aware of the  situation in Jammu and Kashmir.
I am aware, how an ordinary Pakistani must feel about Jammu and Kashmir, when they feel so strongly about Palestine. Jammu and Kashmir is just miles away from here.
There is little doubt in my mind that peace, stability, and prosperity in the South Asian region hinges on normalisation of relations between Pakistan and India.
This in turn is subject to the two countries, finding a resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
Throughout my term, and consistent with the UN policy, and applicable UN Security Council resolutions, I have encouraged all parties to refrain from changing the status of the disputed territory.
This dispute is as old as Palestine.
As President of the General Assembly, I call upon India and Pakistan, to pursue the path to peaceful resolution of the dispute.
Excellencies,
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
Similarly, it is critical to bring peace to Afghanistan.
Pakistan is a host to millions of Afghans. For 40 years, this country has borne the burden, when the international community’s support dwindled. I commend the people of Pakistan, for hosting this community in need.
We also know that, lives of Afghanistan and Pakistan are now inextricably intertwined.
Peace in Afghanistan, is an imperative for Pakistan, to open a trade route to land locked central Asia.
Peace in Afghanistan is critical for securing benefits from China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.
Peace in Afghanistan is central to the promotion of human rights.
Peace in Afghanistan must be Afghan led and Afghan owned.
I commend Pakistan’s leadership, and its role in supporting the efforts to forge reconciliation, security and transition in Afghanistan.
Excellencies,
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
The General Assembly has also met multiple times to discuss the situation in Syria.  A decade of death, displacement, and destruction has left the Syrian people with little hope. Aerial and artillery bombardments have reduced cities to rubble.
Starvation is used as a weapon of war.
Humanitarian needs are increasing, at a rate that existing capacities, may not be able to meet. More than half of the pre-conflict population is displaced.
I recently visited the Turkish-Syrian border, to meet with Syrian refugees in person, and my visit confirmed my conviction that, we must ensure the safe and unimpeded access of humanitarian assistance to Syrians, particularly in Northwest Syria, where the needs are most profound.
Furthermore, I remain deeply concerned about the situation in Myanmar. Just yesterday, I visited Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, where I heard the first-hand accounts of Rohingyas, who suffered unimaginable violence and persecution.
The safety and security of the Rohingya and other minorities, must be secured, in line with the order of the International Court of Justice which was issued last year.
I have called upon the global leaders and neighbors of Myanmar to continue to work resolutely, towards an end to the violence in Myanmar. I call on all leaders to act in the interest of Myanmar’s democratic reform, engage in meaningful dialogue, refrain from violence, and to fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.
Let us not forget that it is our shared responsibility,
“…to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women, and of nations large and small…”,
in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. After seventy-five years, we must continue to strive, to uphold and promote the human rights of everyone, everywhere.
Excellencies,
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
There is no easy solution to these crises. However, when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have one key to unlock our collective recovery: vaccines. I welcome the recent steps taken within the World Trade Organizations. This will enable us, to expand vaccines for all. This is critical, as at this moment, only 0.3% of all vaccines have been given to low income countries. None of us is safe, until everyone is safe.
Widespread vaccination uptake will maximise the impact of the unprecedented fiscal injection into health services and social supports the Government of Pakistan undertook last year.
The digital technologies harnessed to disperse emergency cash assistance prior to, and during, the COVID-19 pandemic to 100 million of the most vulnerable citizens and small businesses, demonstrates how developing countries can leap-frog into the digital era, to support financial inclusion.  This is essential, as we recover.
Indeed, the Decade of Action and Delivery to implement the Sustainable Development Goals has become the Decade of Recovery. This jeopardises our progress, as even prior to the pandemic, we have not been reaching global targets on time. The United Nations as an institution, cannot deliver the SDGs. It is government policies, and implementation of those policies, that will lead to progress.
I again avail of this opportunity to commend Pakistan for its commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The political will and leadership of the Pakistani government, on the establishment of Parliamentary Task Forces on SDG implementation, and its integration in Pakistan’s Vision 2025 has been critical in translating the SDGs from policy to action.
Large-scale climate change mitigation measures, such as the planting of 10 billion trees in the next three years will have an enduring impact well past this Decade of Action, to implement sustainable development. Pakistan has demonstrated consistent thought leadership in nature-based solutions to climate change, and I look forward to hearing of your plans, as we look ahead towards the COP in Glasgow.
Indeed, the upcoming meetings of the COPs of the three Rio Conventions present a historic opportunity to galvanize synergies across the climate, biodiversity and desertification, land degradation and drought agendas. I trust that Pakistan, will engage in the upcoming High-level Dialogue on Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought, which was postponed in light of the situation in Gaza but will take place in June.
Of course, planetary health is but one aspect of sustainable development where Pakistan is making gains towards the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. I recently convened the High-level Thematic Debate on Digital Cooperation and Connectivity. The debate also highlighted the Digital Cooperation Organization, of which Pakistan was a founding member.
This initiative bringing together seven countries, with $1.2 trillion in combined GDP, and a combined population base close to 480 million - 80% of whom are under 35 years of age-,is another example of Pakistan’s pivotal role in South-South cooperation, to create a future where no one is left behind.
Excellencies,
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
Pakistan is ably represented in New York by His Excellency Munir Akram, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations, who is also the President of the Economic and Social Council for its 76th session. We have continuously worked towards maintaining the ongoing cooperation between the two organs, in order to enhance coherence and synergies across their respective works for the session.
This has been most evident in sustainable development issues relating to:
• infrastructure;
• countries in special situations – least developed countries, land-locked developing countries, and small island developing states;
• desertification, land degradation and drought and;
•financing for development.
Ambassador Akram has consistently highlighted the necessity for private sector engagement on financing, and the urgent response required for  countries in significant debt-distress. Pakistan is demonstrating leadership at the highest levels of multilateralism, as one of the five heads of the principal organs of the United Nations.
I also commend His Excellency Imran Khan, for highlighting the importance of ending illicit financial flows at the General Debate earlier this year. For our best efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda will be derailed unless there is full financial transparency. It is critical that we work to end all criminal activity which jeopardize our efforts towards a safe, just, and sustainable future. I trust that, the UN General Assembly special session against corruption, which takes place next week, will accelerate multilateral efforts to end the scourge hampering our progress towards 2030.
In the same spirit, good efforts towards implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and maintaining peace will be undermined unless significant efforts are made to uphold the human rights of women and girls. If we are to create change, we need to move beyond rhetoric.
We need to end gender-based violence, for once and for all. Through stronger legislation against gender-based violence, reporting and redress mechanisms for victims, data collection, election observation, and violence monitoring, we will make progress. This will allow facilitate the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women, in society, the workforce, politics, and public life.
Women bear the brunt of conflict, and their needs must be met. Women need to be included in all elements of peacekeeping and peacebuilding. As an International Gender Champion myself, I firmly believe that the world must re-commit to the women peace and security agenda, twenty years after its creation.
Not only do women make a positive impact on peacekeeping environments, including in supporting the role of women in building peace and protecting women's rights. In all fields of peacekeeping, women peacekeepers have proven that they can perform the same roles, to the same standards, and under the same difficult conditions as their male counterparts.
Put simply: it is an operational imperative that we recruit and retain female peacekeepers. I commend the deployment of the first ever Pakistani female engagement team to South Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I thank these distinguished peacekeepers for their service to humanity.
Indeed, I thank all of you who have served under the blue flag. You are the lifeblood of the United Nations.
Excellencies,
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
It is a privilege to address you here, in the National Defense University, which has been the home of many of Pakistan’s peacekeeping personnel, over the six decades since the first deployment to the UN peacekeeping operations in Congo. I applaud the 4,732 men and women currently serving in nine UN peacekeeping operations around the world.
I commend the professionalism and dedication of the Pakistani military, police, and civilian personnel in these missions. Wearing the blue helmet, Pakistani peacekeepers are on the ground in some of the most dangerous missions in the world, putting their lives at risk to secure a better future for the most vulnerable people on this earth.
The scope and intensity of conflicts  has changed dramatically since Pakistan first contributed troops in 1960.
Today we are seeking peace in an increasingly complex environment of parallel traditional and non-traditional threats such as climate change, rapid technological developments, famine, infectious diseases, scarcity of water and sanitation.
To this end, I welcome the gains made, advancing the Action 4 Peace – ‘A4P’ – initiative.
Excellencies,
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
From the moment I took office, my main concern and responsibility has been ensuring the uninterrupted and effective functioning of the General Assembly.
Since the beginning of the 75th session, the General Assembly has held all mandated events and high-level meetings, sometimes in an innovative hybrid format to allow virtual participation. This has been critical to ensuring the full implementation of mandates, enhancing dialogue and cohesion among Member States, and guaranteeing the Membership a strong, functional General Assembly that meets the challenges facing the nations of the world, and the people we serve.
I have now spent some time, elaborating on my views of multilateralism. But if I had to sum it up in one sentence, I would have to say this: I truly believe that the future of multilateralism lies in an agile, effective and responsive General Assembly, that is underpinned by political will, to uphold the rights of everyone, everywhere.
I thank you.

Food System Summit Dialogue: Towards a Sustainable Food System in Pakistan
May 27, 2021-Islamabad – The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in collaboration with Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) held a virtual workshop addressing sustainable food systems in connection to the United Nations Food System Summit Dialogue 2021. The workshop was attended by representatives from Ministry of Food Security and Research, Pakistan Bureau Statistics, Pakistan Agriculture Research Council, private sector, academia,  UN agencies and other stakeholders.
The Food System Summit is part of the Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by 2030. The Summit will launch bold new actions to deliver progress on all 17 SDGs, each of which relies on healthier, more sustainable and equitable food systems. The Summit is bringing together key players from science, business, policy, healthcare, academia, private sector, farmers, indigenous people and youth and other key stakeholders. The Summit process aims to generate significant action and measurable progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by identifying solutions and leaders, and issuing a call for action at all levels of the food systems, including national and local governments, companies and citizens.
The workshop presented findings of studies conducted by FAO together with PIDE that addresses food production and supply chain, Pakistan food forecast, food loss and waste, drivers of food systems, food policy and regulation and nexus between food poverty and insecurity in Pakistan.
Welcoming the participants, Deputy Representative of FAO, Mr. Farrukh Toirov stated that “importance of Pakistan’s role in the Food Systems Summit 2021 cannot be underestimated. The country has a growing population of over 220mln people to feed.  Food systems of several neighboring countries depend on Pakistan’s production, research, and logistical capacity and food supply chains. FAO studies on food systems in Pakistan are providing strong analytical bases to assess the shortcomings and propose solutions. The studies will contribute to the ongoing national dialogue and presenting Pakistan’s case and national vision inclusively in the Food Systems Summit 2021”.
Speaking at the workshop, Secretary of Ministry of National Food Security and Research, Mr. Ghufran Mamon said that we have a national food security policy which also speaks about a modern and efficient food production and distribution system that contributes to food security and contribution in terms of availability, access and utilization and stability.

New UNICEF report highlights scale and impact of attacks on water and sanitation facilities on children in conflict-affected countries
NEW YORK, 25 May 2021 – Attacks on water and sanitation facilities and workers in conflicts around the world continue to put the lives of millions of children at risk and  deny children and families access to critical water and sanitation services, UNICEF warned today.
In the 9 countries* highlighted in Water Under Fire Volume 3: Attacks on water and sanitation services in armed conflict and the impacts on children – including countries across the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Europe – almost 48 million people, including children, are estimated to need safe water and sanitation services.
Protecting water and sanitation services is critical to the survival of millions of children.  In fragile countries, children under the age of five are 20 times more likely to die due to diarrheal diseases than to violence, and children in extremely fragile contexts are often more than eight times worse off across water, sanitation and hygiene indicators than children born into stable and protected environments.
“Access to water is a means of survival that must never be used as a tactic of war,” said UNICEF Director of Emergency Programmes Manuel Fontaine. “Attacks on water and sanitation infrastructure are attacks on children. When the flow of water stops, diseases like cholera and diarrhoea can spread like wildfire, often with fatal consequences. Hospitals cannot function, and rates of malnutrition and wasting increase. Children and families are often forced out in search of water, exposing them, particularly girls, to an increased risk of harm and violence.”
The report examines the immense impact on children and families when water and sanitation infrastructure are attacked, damaged or destroyed, controlled or otherwise restricted in countries besieged by armed conflict. It highlights that children’s access to water has been threatened in nearly every conflict-related emergency where UNICEF is responding.
For example, Eastern Ukraine has experienced four attacks on water infrastructure since the start of the year, with 380 attacks recorded since 2017. Around 3.2 million people need water and sanitation services.
Entering its sixth year of protracted conflict, Yemen saw 122 airstrikes on water infrastructure between March 2015 to February 2021. Around 15.4 million people urgently need safe water and sanitation as the cholera epidemic continues to make thousands of children ill every week.
Since 2019, the State of Palestine has seen 95 attacks against 142 water and sanitation infrastructures. More than 1.6 million people live without access to these basic services.
The decades-long fragility of Iraq has resulted in massive damage to the water and sanitation infrastructure, leaving 1.85 million people cut off from regular access to lifesaving drinking water and safe sanitation.
In Syria, around 12.2 million people need access to water and sanitation due to heavy infrastructure damage over the past 10 years of conflict.
To urgently protect children in conflict and guarantee access to safe and sufficient water, UNICEF is calling for:
· All parties to conflict to immediately stop attacks on water and sanitation services and personnel, and fulfil their obligations to protect children in conflict, including protecting water and sanitation infrastructure;
· States, including Security Council members, to take firmer action to hold the perpetrators of these attacks to account;
· Donors to invest in water and sanitation in conflict situations, as it is the first line of defense against communicable diseases;
· Public to join our call to action to end attacks on children in conflict and add their voice to protect water and sanitation infrastructure and water workers.
UNICEF works in conflict-affected countries to protect children and provide safe drinking water and adequate sanitation services through improving and repairing water systems, trucking water, setting up latrines and promoting awareness of hygiene practices. In 2020, UNICEF led emergency water, sanitation and hygiene responses in 120 countries, reaching 39 million people with clean water and nearly 7 million with sanitation services.

Karachi: Speaking at the fourth provincial Legal Aid Network Coordination Meeting on 25th May 2021 - organized by UNODC Country Office in collaboration with the Prison Department of Sindh in Karachi Ms. Shamim Mumtaz, Chairperson, Sindh Child Protection Authority and MPA Sindh Assembly appreciated the transformative role played by the Legal Aid Project of UNODC.
Among others, the provision of speedy justice to more than 500 Under Trial Prisoners (UTPs) through free legal aid was hailed as an exemplary initiative in prison reforms. These UTPs include a large proportion of women, children, juveniles, minorities, people with disability, elders, including poor and marginalized groups who are unable to afford representation in a court of law or access the legal system.
Implemented by UNODC in 22 districts of Sindh with support from the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs from the US Department of State, the Legal Aid Project has been providing free Legal Aid to the UTPs in Sindh prisons since 2017. The efforts are complemented through training of investigation officers and prosecutors on enhancing their cooperation in criminal cases for free and fair delivery of speedy justice.
Mr. Jeremy Milsom, Representative of UNODC - Pakistan commended the vision and cooperation by the Prison Department, Government of Sindh and contribution of the Project towards strengthening the foundational building blocks of a free and fair legal aid service for eligible and needy inmates in the prisons of Sindh.
The project has also built successful referral linkages with civil society organizations, pro-bono legal aid practitioners and services to uphold the rights of vulnerable prisoners, developing a unified roadmap on the provision of free legal aid in Sindh. This has helped to engender a community of responsible legal aid service providers.
The meeting was well-attended by eminent representatives from the criminal justice institutions and legal fraternity, including Qazi Nazeer Ahmad, IG Prisons Sindh, Mr. Abdul Razaq, Registrar Sindh High Court, Mr. Shahid Shafiqe, Senior Faculty Member Sindh Judicial Academy, Mr. Naeem Qurashi President Karachi Bar Association, Mr. Arif Dawood Vice Chairman Sind Bar Council, representatives from Sindh Prisons Department, Sindh Prosecution Department, Civil Society Organizations and Legal Aid experts in Sindh.

Government to deliver first new PoR smartcards to Afghan refugees
ISLAMABAD, 25 May 2021 – Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) issued today the first new biometric identity smartcards to Afghan refugees registered in the country.
The new Proof of Registration (PoR) cards are legally recognized proof of identity and include enhanced security features.
This card issuance is part of the government-led and UNHCR-supported Documentation Renewal and Information Verification Exercise (DRIVE).
This exercise is currently verifying the information of 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan and will issue them with new PoR smartcards based on the same technology used for Pakistani citizen identification cards.
Refugees who completed their DRIVE verification interviews will begin receiving SMS notifications advising them of when and where their new PoR smartcards can be collected.
“The DRIVE exercise is a joint effort between the Government of Pakistan/Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON) and UNHCR, with the technical assistance of NADRA,” said Saleem Khan, the Chief Commissioner for Afghan Refugees in Pakistan.
The UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Noriko Yoshida, appreciated the Government’s efforts for taking this important exercise forward, seeing it as an important opportunity to strengthen the protection of refugees and better understand existing needs in the refugee community.
“DRIVE will provide updated information on registered Afghan refugees and their immediate family members in Pakistan. This will allow us to better plan and deliver our support to the Government of Pakistan and refugees, as well as the communities hosting them.”
The designated NADRA Spokesperson said that the new PoR smartcards that are being issued as part of this exercise are multi-biometric, offering new possibilities for identity verification, including in the banking sector.
DRIVE is also part of a wider effort to assist displaced Afghans through the Support Platform for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees (SSAR). The exercise will help collect data on the educational and professional backgrounds of refugees. This information will enhance support for those who may in the future return voluntarily to Afghanistan.
The exercise is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. Measures are in place at all DRIVE sites to mitigate COVID-19 risks through enhanced hygiene, physical distancing, and the scheduling of set numbers of appointments each day.

Stakeholders dialogue on practical and improved measures for youth employment and empowerment
The ILO on behalf of the UN in Pakistan in collaboration with the Planning Commission co-hosted a National Policy Dialogue on ‘Youth Employment, Economic Participation, and Opportunities’, to define priorities and interventions for 2021-22.
ISLAMABAD (ILO News): The Government of Pakistan reaffirmed its commitment to promote productive employment and decent work for young women and men in Pakistan at multi-stakeholder consultation. A number of areas were identified to promote equitable and gender sensitive employment services for young women and men.

In March 2021, the Government of Pakistan embarked on a countrywide exercise to determine the needs of Pakistani youth, and the barriers to actualizing their potential. Multiple deliberations, consultations and groupthinks were organized, to understand why Pakistan has been unable to convert its youth bulge into economic dividend. On March 31, 2021, a high-level policy forum brought together experts, young leaders, the UN, development partners, academicians and think tanks, to highlight and identify youth priorities. Chaired by the Honourable Minister of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Mr Asad Umar, the forum featured sixty young leaders, who spoke about their challenges, and shared recommendations for Pakistan.

As a follow up to the March consultations, online a virtual national policy dialogue on ‘Youth Employment, Economic Participation, and Opportunity’ was organized jointly by the Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan and the United Nations system led by the International Labour Organization (ILO) on 28 April 2021. The objective of the policy dialogue, which fits into the Governments long-term vision of addressing the country’s youth employment challenges, was to inform youth employment interventions by the Government of Pakistan in 2021-22.

More than 100 stakeholders from Government, Ministries, UN, technical institutions, academics, civil society organizations, employers/private sector, workers’ organization, development agencies, and youth leaders called for practical actions to address the challenge of youth employment and empowerment.

In his opening remarks, Mr Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh, Federal Secretary, Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, highlighted the timely efforts to promote youth employment in the context of the COVID-19 impact on Pakistan’s economy and workers. He expressed optimism in young Pakistanis’ resilience and creativity and encouraged participants to not only share their suggestions but also join Government efforts in promoting decent jobs for young women and men.

Dr Shabnum Sarfraz, Member Social Sector of Planning Commission, welcomed all participants and informed participants of the wider national consultation being undertaken by Government of Pakistan to reach out 40,000 young thought leaders for inputs on the national youth agenda.

Ms Saima Nadeem, MNA & Parliamentary Secretary for Inter-Provincial Coordination, in her video message, highlighted major steps taken by the Government in promoting gainful employment for young women and men. She highlighted various projects initiated under Kamyab-Jawan and Ehsaas Programme and expressed commitment of Government to work on promoting decent jobs for youth.

Mr Felix Weidenkaff, ILO Employment Specialist and regional youth employment focal point for Asia-Pacific, provided an analysis of the youth employment situation and underlying labour market challenges in Pakistan prior to COVID-19 and the impact of the crisis on youth in the labour market. The analysis highlighted the need for productive employment opportunities for a growing youth population, addressing gender disparities in labour force participation, the large share of youth in informal employment and the high share of youth not in employment, education, or training (NEET). Context-specific and comprehensive youth employment measures in Pakistan needed to take into account pro-employment macro-economic policies with a focus on youth, youth employability by improving education, training, and school to work transition, youth entrepreneurship, gender equality and rights at work, while also taking into account the challenges and opportunities presented by pre-crisis future of work trends, from technological changes to environmental and climate change.

Mr Ali Qureshi, Social Protection Specialist from World Bank, presented major finding of the ‘Pakistan Jobs Diagnostic’ study – which identified three main challenges, i.e., high-informality, low female labour-force participation, and low education of Pakistani workforce. The World Bank’s recommendations included building human capital, improving job quality, and extending access to social protection to youth. He also shared case studies from Kenya and Tanzania on creating youth employment and entrepreneurship opportunities through different intervention models.

Mr Talha Chishti from the British Council highlighted key lessons learnt in promoting entrepreneurship including through the social entrepreneurship.

Youth leaders highlighted various challenges and opportunities for promoting youth employment including entrepreneurship development, business incubation centres, improving working conditions for women, establishing youth employment facilitation centres, providing internship and apprenticeship opportunities, including professional ethics in curriculum, career counselling, and inclusive policies for transgender, persons with disabilities and other excluded segments of society.

The employer representatives highlighted their expectations for young workers to be equipped with market-relevant skills and workplace ethics, and bring innovation and creativity to the world of work. They also asked the Government to support the private sector development by improving the business environment and growth-oriented policies with a focus on job creation.

During the plenary discussion, participants deliberated on measures to create jobs over the next three years, increase female labour force participation and tackle barriers preventing women from equal access to education. In addition, strategies on training and employment, support the transition from informal to formal economy, supporting youth not in employment, education or training (NEET), and support measures for the private sector to create decent jobs for youth were discussed. Participants also deliberated on the Kamyab-Jawan programme and recommended measures to improve the visibility of the programme and to facilitate the access to loans for new entrepreneurs.

The meeting concluded with vote of thanks by Dr Shabnum Sarfaraz who informed participants that all feedback would be considered in the next budget and useful projects will be initiated to promote decent jobs for young women and men.

UNHCR and EU’s support in education sector helps increase enrolment of Pakistani, refugee children
PESHAWAR, 20 May 2021: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency’s rehabilitation of five public schools in Swabi district will help increase the enrolment of students by 70 per cent, thanks to the support of the European Union. A number of schools are also being improved in other districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Thanks to investments channeled towards the largest refugee-hosting districts, Pakistani and refugee children will benefit from safer learning environments and better facilities, including newly built classrooms, water and sanitation facilities, such as latrines, and furniture sets.
In Swabi district, the Government Higher Secondary School Ismaila, the Government Primary School Ismaila, the Government High Secondary School Yaar Hussain, the Government Primary School Yaar Hussain and the Government Primary School Hemlet were rehabilitated and improved.
A ceremony to mark these efforts was held at the Government Higher Secondary School Ismaila.

The Education Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Mr. Tarakai, appreciated UNHCR and the European Union for strengthening Pakistan’s development initiatives, including in the education sector.
“Despite the difficult circumstances, our resolve remains strong; we’ll continue to host Afghan refugees. During these past 40 years, we’ve lived together peacefully with our Afghan brothers and sisters. As the impact of the pandemic is far-reaching, even eroding our hard-earned gains in the education sector, we call on the international community to continue support countries – like ours – which are committed to leaving no one behind,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Inkoom expressed his admiration of the hospitality of Pakistani people towards Afghan refugees. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, he emphasized how investments into the education sector were more crucial than ever, adding that the European Union’s generous support has been particularly valuable in this regard.
“With improved facilities in public schools, Pakistani and refugee students will have an opportunity to learn side-by-side in a safe environment,” he said. He added that it’s important to highlight internationally that Pakistan leads by example and through its good practices – sharing its vital services with Afghan refugees. “Providing such support is one way of showing solidarity with these communities that have hosted refugees for over four decades,” he emphasized.
Speaking on the occasion, the Commissioner for Afghan Refugees Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Mr. Khan, thanked the international community, including UNHCR, for continuing to meet challenges and for helping ensure that all children living in Pakistan are able to grow and learn in a safe environment.
Since 2009, through the Refugee Affected and Hosting Areas programme, UNHCR supported the implementation of 4,300 projects in the areas of education, health, infrastructure, livelihoods as well as water and sanitation across the country. A total of 12.4 million people – 85 per cent Pakistanis and 15 per cent Afghan refugees – have benefitted.

Launch of the Mazdoor Ka Ehsaas report- A social protection programme for workers in the informal economy
The Ehsaas Delivery Unit at the Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division and the ILO have jointly organised a webinar on May 1st, 2021 for the launch of MKE Report. The purpose of the webinar is to share steps taken for the actualisation of the MKE initiative and discuss its key recommendations.
ISLAMABAD (ILO News): Labour Day (May 1st, 2021) saw the launch of the Mazdoor Ka Ehsaas (MKE) report. MKE is among the 268 priority areas of Pakistan’s largest poverty alleviation programme (EHSAAS) launched by the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2019.

Mazdoor Ka Ehsaas translated as “compassion for workers” was formulated by a Tripartite Labour Welfare and Social Protection Expert Group (LWSPEG) supported technically by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and co-chaired by Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division (PASSD) and Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and HRD (MoOPHRD). The LWSPEG was established in May 2019.

For the launch of the MKE report, the Ehsaas Delivery Unit at the PASSD jointly with the ILO organised a webinar on May 1st, 2021 during which steps taken for the actualisation of the MKE initiative were shared as well as its key recommendations.

The launch featured opening addresses from Senator Dr. Sania Nishtar, Special Assistant to PM (SAPM) on Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety (PA&SS) and Mr Zulfiqar Bukhari, Special Assistant to PM on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development (SAPM-OPHRD).

Dr Sania Nishtar, SAPM (PA&SS) applauded the efforts of the contributors and the rich insights of experts that made the MKE report a possibility.

Mr Zulfiqar Bukhari, SAPM (OPHRD) shared the initiatives taken to expand social security within the formal sector and others innovative approaches through which further extension is being carried out to cover those working in the informal economy.

Ms Ingrid Christensen, Country Director, ILO said that the EHSAAS programme launched in 2019 was a promise and a commitment of the Government towards social protection for all. The Mazdoor Ka Ehsaas is an important initiative that will require collaboration of tripartite stakeholders including Government at all tiers and Workers and Employers Representative organisations. ‘

Ms Mariko Ouchi, Senior Social Security Specialist, ILO DWT, New Delhi, stressed on the need for coverage to be extended to workers in the informal and formal economy. She shared examples from other countries such as Tunisia, Ecuador and Bolivia where agricultural workers, self-employed workers and others have been brought into the ambit of social security through own contribution and cross subsidization of general insurance schemes.

Dr Aliya Khan, Labour economist and also the Chairperson of the MKE Core Group, referred to the recommendations of the MKE report on creating fiscal space. She said this could be done through a number of tools/packages including contributory schemes, creation of social insurance fund and contribution from expatriates and Pakistani diaspora.

Ms Melis U. Guven, Senior. Social Protection Economist, shared that during the pandemic, $600 million financing for the Crisis-Resilient Social Protection Program (CRISP), was approved by the World Bank.

Mr. Zahoor Awan, Chairman - Steering Committee, Pakistan Workers Federation said that a large number of workers are excluded from social security with in the formal sector owing to the nature of their contracts. Unless third party contractual workers are not brought into the remit of social security the coverage will remain low.

Mr. Fasih Karim Siddiqi, Senior Advisor, Employers Federation of Pakistan suggested that a possible way to gradually expand to universal coverage is to expand provision of benefits from most critical to a larger range; it can start with health benefits, injury benefits and pension . These Small measures can ensure welfare of workers and economic competitiveness of private sector

Concluding the event, Dr Lubna Shahnaz, representative LWSPEG, thanked the participants, and acknowledged the commitments of the PASS Division and the MoOPHRD in taking the MKE programme forward.

Joint Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore and WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes
NEW YORK/GENEVA, 21 May 2021 – “In 1981, health officials from around the world gathered at the World Health Assembly to address aggressive marketing tactics by the infant and young child feeding industry, which was promoting formula feeding over breastfeeding and causing a dramatic increase in infant morbidity and mortality. The result was the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the Code), a landmark policy framework designed to stop commercial interests from damaging breastfeeding rates and endangering the health and nutrition of the world’s youngest inhabitants.
“In the last four decades, there has been a 50 per cent increase in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding. As a result, an estimated 900 million infants globally have enjoyed the survival, growth and development benefits of exclusive breastfeeding in infancy.
“Breastfeeding is vital to a child’s lifelong nutrition, health, and wellbeing. It reduces costs for families, health facilities, and governments. Breastfeeding protects children from infections and saves lives. It supports emotional bonding between mothers and babies, along with other mental health benefits.
“Yet aggressive marketing of breastmilk substitutes continues to discourage women from breastfeeding, putting both children’s and women’s health at risk.
“The 40th anniversary of the adoption the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes is an opportunity to mark the significant progress made in protecting and promoting the incomparable benefits of breastfeeding, but also a reminder of the work still to be done.
“A majority of countries have enacted legislation to implement at least some provisions of the Code. But unfortunately, only 25 countries have implemented measures that are substantially aligned with the Code.
“The Code remains as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. Last year, some marketers of baby foods exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to promote their products by invoking unfounded fears that breastfeeding could transmit COVID-19. WHO and UNICEF guidance is clear: mothers suspected or known to have COVID-19 should continue breastfeeding.
“On the 40th anniversary of the Code, UNICEF and WHO call on governments, health workers, and the baby food industry to fully implement and abide by the Code requirements:
· Governments must enact and enforce legislation to prevent commercial interests from undermining breastfeeding, optimal infant and young child feeding, and the health of children and women, including during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
· Health workers must protect, promote and support breastfeeding; they must not accept sponsorship from companies that market foods for infants and young children for scholarships, awards, grants, meetings, or events.
· The infant and young child feeding industry must publicly commit to full compliance, globally, with the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly resolutions.
“Together, we must take the 40th anniversary milestone as an opportunity to celebrate the progress made in promoting and supporting breastfeeding and call to boldly protect breastfeeding as the best start in life, for every child.”

Peshawar: UN Women Pakistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Judicial Academy (KPJA), signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) today to take forward their partnership in advancing the agenda of gender equality & women’s empowerment (GEWE), and support platforms to ensure that the justice sector stakeholders are gender sensitized in their approach when dealing with women survivors of violence in light of national/provincial policies and international best practices.
The MOU agreement was signed by Ms. Sharmeela Rassool, Representative of UN Women Pakistan, and Mr. Zia-ud-Din Khattak, Director General of KPJA.

At the signing ceremony, Ms. Sharmeela Rassool, said, “Over the years, Pakistan has worked towards creating progressive legal frameworks to safeguard the rights of women and girls. The implementation of the law remains imperative for real change on the ground. Only a gender-sensitive, systematic and coordinated response mechanism from the state, the judiciary, legal community, and other stakeholders will be important to improve women and vulnerable communities’ access to justice.” She also appreciated the efforts of the provincial government on their progressive steps to take forward the agenda of GEWE, “UN Women Pakistan and the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa commit to this partnership – together, we are stronger in both our efforts and impact.”
Mr. Zia-ud-Din Khattak highlighted that the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan guarantees equality before the law and equal protection for every citizen, and thus, he committed support of the Judicial Academy in the effective dispensation of justice to everyone without any discrimination. He added, “This MoU will contribute towards building the capacity and commitment of all the stakeholders of the justice sector in creating an enabling environment for delivering justice to women, especially survivors of gender-based violence in light of the Rule of Law Road Map of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The focus areas of this cooperation are to enhance women’s access to justice through building the capacity of justice sector stakeholders such as judges, lawyers, prosecutors, police officers among others; supporting data gathering and research analysis efforts at the provincial level; supporting criminal justice sector coordination institutions at provincial/district level; jointly establishing mechanisms for monitoring and impact evaluation of activities under this MoU; exploring avenues to strengthen justice sector institutions by promoting gender-responsive initiatives and fostering advocacy efforts for legal and policy reforms. The MoU establishes the terms and conditions of cooperation between the KPJA and UN Women in achieving their common objectives.
This collaboration will help steer the direction of joint efforts towards enhancing rule of law by the implementation of both international norms and national legislation.

During the signing ceremony, Dr. Sumera Shams, Chairperson of WPC said, “While having the same mandate as that of women’s empowerment, the partnership between UN Women and WPC KP will further strengthen the pro-women legislation and implementation of those laws across the province as well as the deprived tribal belt."
Sharmeela Rassool acknowledged the efforts of the WPC in furthering the GEWE agenda in KP and shared that the joint efforts will be pivotal in realizing and safeguarding the rights of women and girls. “In the past, UN Women supported the WPC in finalizing KP’s Women Empowerment Policy and contributed in mainstreaming gender in two draft bills. Now, we are taking a step forward by advocating for effective implementation of laws and policies.”
Under this MoU, UN Women will support the WPC on the implementation of KP Domestic Violence Against Women Act 2021, Women Empowerment Policy 2017 and lead advocacy on Child Marriage Restraint Bill; enhance service delivery for survivors of gender-based violence through the rollout of capacity building of Dar ul Amans; undertake gender research, draft gender-sensitive laws, develop position papers, resolutions, declarations and reports.

"Together we can make a change. The development sector and Government are the two wheels that run the reformative system. The partnership with UN Women will aim to achieve a robust response in the area of gender equality and women empowerment", said Mahmood Jan, Deputy Speaker KP Provincial Assembly.

Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore on the situation in Gaza
NEW YORK, 17 MAY 2021 – “As the latest serious escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict hits one week, and as the Security Council meets today to discuss the latest development on the ground, I renew my call for an immediate end to the violence.
“Over the past week, at least 55 children in the State of Palestine and 2 children in Israel have been killed.
“Fear and destruction are mounting on both sides.
“In Gaza, schools have been destroyed, homes and offices have been flattened, and entire families have been displaced.
“In Israel, schools, homes and buildings have also been damaged.
“Violence, killing and hatred must stop. International human rights and humanitarian law must be upheld. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.
“The only solution is a diplomatic solution – for the sake of all children and their future.”

The COVAX Facility will deliver its 65 millionth vaccine dose this week. It should’ve been at least its 170 millionth. The time to donate excess doses is now.
Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore, as G7 countries gear up for June summit
NEW YORK, 17 MAY 2021 – “The COVAX Facility – the global COVID vaccine equity scheme – will deliver its 65 millionth dose in the coming days. It should have been at least its 170 millionth. By the time G7 leaders gather in the UK next month, and as a deadly second wave of COVID-19 will likely continue to sweep across India and many of its South Asian neighbours, the shortfall will near 190 million doses.

“We have issued repeated warnings of the risks of letting down our guard and leaving low- and middle-income countries without equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. We are concerned that the deadly spike in India is a precursor to what will happen if those warnings remain unheeded. While the situation in India is tragic, it is not unique. Cases are exploding and health systems are struggling in countries near – like Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives – and far, like Argentina and Brazil. The cost for children and families will be incalculable.
“The longer the virus continues to spread unchecked, the higher the risk of more deadly or contagious variants emerging.
“The clearest pathway out of this pandemic is a global, equitable distribution of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. COVAX, led by the WHO, Gavi and CEPI, with UNICEF as implementing partner, represents such a pathway. But COVAX is undersupplied.
“Among the global consequences of the situation in India, a global hub for vaccine production, is a severe reduction in vaccines available to COVAX. Soaring domestic demand has meant that 140 million doses intended for distribution to low- and middle-income countries through the end of May cannot be accessed by COVAX. Another 50 million doses are likely to be missed in June. This, added to vaccine nationalism, limited production capacity and lack of funding, is why the roll-out of COVID vaccines is so behind schedule.
“G7 leaders will be meeting next month with a potential emergency stop-gap measure readily available. New data analysis provided by Airfinity, the life sciences research facility, and commissioned by the UK National Committee for UNICEF, indicates that G7 nations and ‘Team Europe’ group of European Union Member States could donate around 153 million vaccine doses if they shared just 20 per cent of their available supply over June, July and August. Critically, they could do so while still meeting their commitments to vaccinate their own populations.
“While some G7 members have greater supply than others, and some have further advanced domestic rollouts, an immediate collective commitment to pool excess supply and share the burden of responsibility could buttress vulnerable countries against becoming the next global hotspot.
“Ultimately, the global vaccination race will be won when Member States make sustainable plans to fully fund and supply the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, while supporting the expansion of vaccine manufacturing capacity, including through proactive Intellectual Property licensing and technological transfer. These measures are critical, but they won’t change anything overnight. Sharing immediately available excess doses is a minimum, essential and emergency stop-gap measure, and it is needed right now.”

Notes to Editors

Shortfall numbers are based on delays related to shipments from the Serum Institute of India (SII) only. Other delays related to the original COVAX delivery schedule are expected to be made up by the end of June. There is currently no timetable to resolve SII-related delays.

The Airfinity analysis is produced using data forecasts of vaccine supplies allocated to G7 members based on doses set to be readily available. The supply forecasts are based on existing deals between countries and manufacturers of approved vaccine candidates unless specified as included vaccine candidates currently undergoing Phase III trials. The aggregate figure of 153 million doses represents the total of available doses if all G7 members donate 20 per cent of their available supply in June, July and August 2021, minus Novovax (due to anticipated supply limitations affecting Novovax).

More than one million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine
delivered by COVAX to support Government’s efforts to vaccinate high-risk people across Pakistan.
ISLAMABAD, 8 May 2021 – Today Pakistan received its first shipment of Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines (SII-AZ AZD1222) from the COVAX Facility.
The consignment of 1,238,400 doses of vaccines, which will be followed by another of 1,236,000 in a few days, will support the Government of Pakistan’s ongoing historic drive to bring the pandemic to an end. Further allocations from June onwards will be confirmed in due course. The goal of the COVAX Facility is to supply Pakistan with enough doses to vaccinate 20% of the population depending on availability.
Dr. Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on National Health Services, Regulations & Coordination, welcomed this first consignment together with representatives of COVAX technical and funding partners at the headquarters of the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC).
“In this unprecedented crisis, we appreciate COVAX and GAVI’s contribution to the collective effort to fight COVID-19 in Pakistan,” said Dr. Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on National Health Services, Regulations & Coordination. “Sometimes, such crises propel innovation and to this end, we were able to quickly expand the capacity of EPI’s facilities to vaccinate our eligible population against COVID. Recently, we’ve been administering almost 200,000 doses a day and we will be able to increase to 0.5 million doses a day very soon. I urge everyone above the age of 40 to register get vaccinated so we can continue our mission to immunize our fellow citizens, especially the ones who fall in the high-risk and vulnerable groups. Very soon, we will be able to expand the campaign to other age groups and demographics.”
The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines will supplement the vaccines purchased by the Government of Pakistan and help boost the drive to immunize frontline health workers, senior citizens and other priority groups identified in the National Deployment and Vaccination Plan developed under the leadership of the National Command Operation Center.
More than 3.3 million vaccine doses have been administered to healthcare workers and citizens at large.  The Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination also ramped up the cold chain capacity of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) to meet the requirements of the vaccine deployment plan. This also includes ultra-cold chain facilities in 15 large cities. Currently, citizens above the age of 40 can register and get vaccinated by following an easy process. Citizens above the age of 50 can walk into the nearest center and get vaccinated. Some districts are also providing at-home services for senior citizens. Sinopharm, Sinovac, CanSino-Bio  and Sputnik doses have been administered in Pakistan so far.
The 2.47 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine will be used to immunize about 1.24 million high-risk people against the virus.
Oxford-AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine was developed in collaboration with Oxford University and is manufactured by AstraZeneca and COVISHIELD, licensed to and manufactured by AstraZeneca-SKBioscience (AZ-SKBio) in South Korea. It has gone through rigorous processes to ensure safety and efficacy and has been given the greenlight by the World Health Organization to be rolled out globally.
“Over the past year, WHO has been standing side by side with the Government of Pakistan providing technical guidance and new tools needed to prepare for, prevent, detect and respond to the spread of this new virus. Today, we are delighted to receive the COVID-19 vaccine that will safely and effectively prevent needless suffering. This vaccine has gone through clinical trials and has been approved for use in Pakistan and around the world,” said Dr. Palitha Gunarathna Mahipala, WHO Representative in Pakistan. “Right now, WHO's focus is on supporting Pakistan to end the pandemic, including with these new vaccines and the public health measures that have been the bedrock of the response for 15 months. We thank the Government of Pakistan for their commitment to ensure these vaccines are swiftly administered all across Pakistan and our health care workers for their hard-work and dedication during the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.”
COVAX, a global partnership, is co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO); Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), along with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). It is funded thanks to generous support from partner governments, foundations and private sector corporations.
The goal of the COVAX Facility is to ensure that safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines are rapidly available to all countries around the world regardless of income level, to help end the acute phase of the pandemic as quickly as possible. It aims to provide at least 2 billion doses of approved COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021, enabling the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups in what will be the largest immunization campaign in history.
“UNICEF is proud to be leading efforts to procure and supply safe, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of the COVAX facility which aims to quickly reach people in low and middle-income countries and ensures that no one at risk is left behind. UNICEF commends the Government of Pakistan for its leadership in the national response to the pandemic, including the successful roll-out of the national vaccination programme, and thanks the COVAX partners for their generous contribution.  Solidarity is key to ending the pandemic. No one is safe until everyone is safe”, said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “I urge all those who are eligible to get vaccinated and appeal to everyone to strictly comply with COVID-19 safety measures to curb the spread of virus.”
“This delivery – the first of many – is the product of an unprecedented global partnership to ensure no country is left behind in the global race for COVID-19 vaccines," said Alexa Reynolds, Gavi Senior Country Manager for Pakistan. "These vaccines are safe, they are effective, and they will play an important role in helping the country to end this pandemic."
850,131 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Pakistan since the start of the outbreak and 18,677 people have succumbed to the disease so far.
Key preventive behaviours against the coronavirus include regularly washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds or use a sanitizer; wear a mask; remain at least six feet away from other people; avoid crowded places; and stay home when having COVID-19 symptoms.
COVAX technical and funding partners will continue to work with the Government through the pandemic to ensure that no one is left behind.
###

The following diplomatic missions and COVAX donors attended the handover ceremony:
” We welcome the opportunity to concretely show our solidarity with the Government of Pakistan and support its efforts to fight the coronavirus through this important delivery of vaccines. We are proud to play our part in the global COVAX initiative, alongside our partners, as it helps to complement efforts where vaccines are needed. For the time being SOPs still need to be followed,” said Ms. Androulla Kaminara, Ambassador of the European Union to Pakistan.
“The United States welcomes the successful arrival in Pakistan of 1.2 million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. We remain committed to working bilaterally and multilaterally to support access to vaccines for the world’s most at-risk populations,” said U.S. Embassy Chargé d'affaires Angela P. Aggeler. “This pandemic has shown the importance of partnerships, such as the longstanding partnership between the United States and Pakistan, which has enabled us to more effectively respond to this health crisis together.”
“I’m proud of the UK’s role in developing the Oxford University AstraZeneca vaccine that Pakistan is receiving today. The UK is one of the world’s biggest contributors to the COVAX facility - donating £548m to make sure countries get the vaccines they need, including Pakistan.”,” said Dr. Christian Turner, British High Commissioner to Pakistan.
“Today’s arrival of the first COVAX batch in Pakistan is an important milestone for fighting this pandemic together. It is also a strong token of multilateralism and international solidarity at its best. Germany, as second largest donor, is proud of contributing to the COVAX facility more than 1.5 billion EUR because we are convinced: An inclusive global access to vaccines is the need of the hour and nobody is safe until everyone is safe!” said Dr. Philipp Deichmann, Charge d’Affaires /DHM, Embassy of Germany in Pakistan.

ایک ملین لوگوں کے لئے اوکسفرڈ ایسٹرا زینکا کووِڈ - 19 ویکیسن کی مقدار آج پاکستان کو فراہم کردی گئی ہے۔ یہ مقدار  14.64  ملین لوگوں کے لئے دی جانے والی کل مقدار کا حصہ ہے جو حکومتِ پاکستان کی طرف ان لوگوں کو لگائی  جائے  گی جنہیں کووِڈ سے متاثر ہونے کے زیادہ خطرات  کا سامنا ہے۔
اسلام آباد، 8 مئی 2021 – آج پاکستان کو کو ویکس  سہولت سے  اوکسفرڈ-اسٹرازینکا کووِڈ -19 ویکسین (ایسآئی آئی-اے زیڈ اے زیڈ ڈی 1222) کی پہلی کھیپ موصول ہوئی۔
ویکسین کی 12 لاکھ 38 ہزار 400 افراد کے لئے ویکسین کی کھیپ ہے جس کے بعد چند دنوں میں 12 لاکھ 36 ہزار افراد کے لئے مزید ویکسین پاکستان پہنچ جائے گی جو پہلے سے جاری تاریخی مہم کی کامیابی میں ایک اہم کردار ادا کرے گی۔ جون کے بعد سے مزید مختص  شدہ ویکسین کی تصدیق مناسب وقت پر کر دی جائے گی۔ کو ویکس فیسیلیٹی کا مقصد پاکستان کی   20 فیصد آبادی کو ویکسین دینے کے لئے کافی خوراک فراہم کرنا ہے۔
نیشنل ہیلتھ سروسز، ریگولیشنز اینڈ کوآرڈینیشن پر وزیر اعظم کے معاون خصوصی ڈاکٹر فیصل سلطان نے نیشنل ایمرجنسی آپریشنز سینٹر (این ای او سی) کے ہیڈ کوارٹرز میں سی او وی اے ایکس ٹیکنیکل اور فنڈنگ پارٹنرز کے نمائندوں کے ساتھ مل کر اس پہلی کھیپ کا خیرمقدم کیا۔
نیشنل ہیلتھ سروسز، ریگولیشنز اینڈ کوآرڈینیشنپر وزیر اعظم کے معاون خصوصی ڈاکٹر فیصل سلطان نے کہا کہ اس غیر معمولی بحران میں جس کی تاریخ میں مثال نہیں ملتی ہم پاکستان میں کووِڈ 19 سے لڑنے کی اجتماعی کوششوں میں کو ویکس  اور جی اے وی آئی کے تعاون کو تہہ دل سے سراہتےہیں۔ انہوں نے  مزید کہا کہ بعض اوقات اس طرح کے بحران جدت لانے کے عمل کو آگے بڑھاتے ہیں اور اس مقصد کے لئے ہم اپنی  آبادی کو کووڈ کی ویکسین لگانے کے لئے ای پی آئی کی سہولیات کی صلاحیت میں تیزی سے اضافہ کرنے میں کامیاب ہوئے ہیں۔ حال ہی میں، ہم اپنے مراکز میں ایک دن میں تقریبا 200,000 افراد کو ویکسین کے ٹیکے لگا رہے ہیں اور ہم بہت جلد یومیہ 0.5 ملین افراد کو ویکسین دینے کے قابل ہو جائیں گے۔ میں 40 سال سے زیادہ عمر کے ہر شخص سے درخواست کرتا ہوں کہ وہ ویکسین لگوانے کے لئے اپنا اندراج کرائے تاکہ ہم اپنے ہم وطنوں خاص طور پر زیادہ خطرات سے دوچار اور کمزور افراد میں شمار ہونے والے شہریوں کو ٹیکہ لگانے کا اپنا مشن جاری رکھ سکیں۔ ہم بہت جلد  اس مہم کو دیگر عمر کے افراد اور لوگوں کے لئے بھی وسعت دے پائیں گے۔
اوکسفرڈ اسٹرازینکا ویکسین حکومت پاکستان کی جانب سے خریدی گئی ویکسین میں شامل ہوکر ویکسین کی کمی کو پورا  کرے گی اور نیشنل کمانڈ آپریشن سینٹر کی قیادت میں تیار کردہ نیشنل ڈیپلائمنٹ اینڈ ویکسینیشن پلان میں شناخت شدہ فرنٹ لائن ہیلتھ ورکرز، بزرگ شہریوں اور دیگر ترجیحی گروپوں کو ویکسین لگانے  کی مہم کو مزید تقویت دینے میں بے حد مدد گار ثابت ہو گی۔
صحت کی دیکھ بھال کرنے والے عملے اور شہریوں کو بڑے پیمانے پر 3.3  ملین سے زیادہ ویکسین کا ٹیکہ لگایا جا چکا ہے۔  وزارتِ صحت نے ویکسین کی فراہمی کے منصوبے کی ضروریات کو پورا کرنے کے لئے پاکستان میں لوگوں کو ویکسین دینے کے  حفاظتی ٹیکوں کے وسیع پروگرام  میں کولڈ چین مینجمنٹ کے نظام بھی توسیع کی ہے اور اس وقت تک 15 بڑے شہروں میں الٹرا کولڈ چین کی سہولیات کو شامل کیا گیا ہے۔
فی الحال 40 سال سے زائد عمر کے شہری آسان طریقہ کار پر عمل کرتے ہوئے اپنا اندراج کرانے کے بعد ویکسین کا ٹیکہ لگوا سکتے ہیں اور 50 سال سے زیادہ عمر کے شہری بھی قریبی مرکز صحت میں جاکر ویکسین  لگوا سکتے ہیں۔ کچھ اضلاع میں بزرگ شہریوں کے لئے گھر پر ویکیسن لگانے کی خدمات بھی فراہم کی جارہی ہیں۔ پاکستان میں اب تک سینوفارم، سینوویک، کینسینو بائیو اور اسپوٹنک ویکیسن لگائی جاچکی ہے۔
اوکسفرڈ-اسٹرازینکا کووِڈ -19 ویکسین کی 2.47 ملین خوراکوں کا استعمال تقریبا 1.24 ملین زیادہ خطرات سے دوچار افراد کو وائرس سے بچانے کے لئے استعمال میں لائی جائے گی۔
اوکسفرڈ-اسٹرازینکا کی کووِڈ -19 ویکسین اوکسفرڈ یونیورسٹی کے تعاون سے تیار کی گئی تھی اور اسے اسٹرازینکا اور کووی شیلڈ نے تیار کیا ہے، جسے اسٹرازینکا-ایس کے بائیو سائنس  (اے زیڈ-ایس کے بائیو) آئیاین جنوبی کوریا نے لائسنس جاری کیا  اور تیار کیاہے۔ ویکسین کے محفوظ ہونے  اور اس کی افادیت کو یقینی بنانے کے لئے اسے سخت تحقیقی عمل سے گزرا ہے اور عالمی ادارہ صحت کی طرف سے   اسے عالمی سطح پر لگانے  کی باقاعدہ اجازت  دی  گئی ہے۔
انہوں نے کہا کہ گزشتہ ایک سال کے دوران عالمی ادارہ صحت حکومت پاکستان کے شانہ بشانہ کھڑا رہا ہے جو اس نئے وائرس سے نبرد آزما ہونے  کی تیاری، روک تھام، وائرس کا سراغ لگانے اور اس کا جوابی لائحہ عمل تشکیل دینے کے لئے درکار تکنیکی رہنمائی اور جدید ترین آلات فراہم کر رہا ہے۔ آج ہمیں کووِڈ -19 ویکسین ملنے پر  بے حد خوشی ہے ۔ یہ ویکسین ہمیں غیر ضروری تکلیف سے  محفوظ اور اس کی موثر طریقے سے روک تھام کے قابل بنائے گی۔ پاکستان میں عالمی ادارہ صحت کی نمائندہ ڈاکٹر لیتھا گنارتھنا مہیپالانے کہا کہ یہ ویکسین کئی کلینیکل ٹرائلز سے گزرچکی ہے اور اس کے بعد ہی اسے پاکستان اور دنیا بھر میں استعمال کرنے کی منظوری دے دی گئیہے۔ انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ اس وقت ڈبلیو ایچ او کی توجہ اس وبا کے خاتمے کے لیے پاکستان کی بھرپور معاونت پر مرکوز ہے اور اس  میں ویکسین کی نئی کھیپ  اور صحت عامہ کے اقدامات بھی شامل ہیں جو 15 ماہ سے کووڈ کے جوابی ردِ عمل کے طور پر جاری ہیں۔ ہم حکومت پاکستان کا شکریہ ادا کرتے ہیں کہ اس  نے اس بات کو یقینی بنانے کے عزم کا اظہار کیا ہے کہ اس ویکسین کو پورے پاکستان میں تیزی سے استعمال میں لایا جائے گا اور ہمارے ہیلتھ کیئر ورکرز کو کووِڈ -19 وبا کے خلاف جنگ کے دوران ان کی محنت اور لگن کو دیکھتے ہوئے تیزی سے استعمال میں لائی جائے۔
کو ویکس ایک عالمی شراکت داری کا نام ہے جس کی قیادت عالمی ادارہ صحت (ڈبلیو ایچ او) کررہا ہے اور یہ سب  گاوی، ویکسین الائنس؛  اقوام متحدہ کے بچوں کے فنڈ(یونیسیف) کے ساتھ ساتھ وبائی تیاری و اختراعات (سی ای پی آئی) کی مشترکہ کاوشوں سے ممکن بنایا جارہا ہے  اور شراکت دار حکومتوں، فاؤنڈیشنز اور نجی شعبے کی کارپوریشنوںکے فیاضانہ عطیات کی مدد سے اس شراکت کی مالی معاونت کی جاتیہے۔
کو ویکس  سہولت کا مقصد یہ یقینی بنانا ہے کہ آمدنی کی سطح سے قطع نظر دنیا بھر کے تمام ممالک کو محفوظ، موثر کووِڈ -19 ویکسین کی تیز رفتار دستیابی کو یقینی بنایا جائے  تاکہ وبا کے پھیلاؤ شدید ترین مراحل کے دوران وائرس کو جلد از جلد ختم کرنے میں مدد مل سکے۔ اس کا مقصد 2021 کے آخر تک منظور شدہ کووِڈ -19 ویکسین کی کم از کم 2 ارب خوراکیں فراہم کرنا ہے جس سے فرنٹ لائن ہیلتھ کیئر اور سماجی کارکنوں کے ساتھ ساتھ دیگر ہائی رسک اور کم قوتِ مدافعت کے حامل گروہوں کا تحفظ ممکن ہو سکے گا ۔ اس طرح موجودہ مہم لوگوں کو وائرس سے محفوظ بنانے کے لئے تاریخ کی سب سے بڑی ویکسین لگانے کی  مہم ہوگی۔
"یونیسیف کو اس بات پر فخر ہے کہ وہ کو ویکس  کی مدد سے محفوظ، موثر اور سستی کووِڈ -19 ویکسین کی خریداری اور فراہمی کی کوششوں کی قیادت کر رہا ہے۔ یہ  عالمی شراکت داری ہمیں اس قابل بنائے گی کہ ہم  کم اور درمیانی آمدنی والے ممالک کے لوگوں تک تیزی سے ویکسین پہنچا سکیں اور  ہم اس بات کو یقینی بنا سکیں گے  کہ دنیا میں کسی کو کورونا وائرس کا خطرہ لاحق نہ رہے۔ ہمیں فخر ہے کہ ہم نے حکومت پاکستان کے ساتھ مل کر ملک میں اوکسفرڈ استرازینکا کووِڈ -19 ویکسین کے اس پہلے بیچ کو لانے کے لئے کام کیا ہے اور ہم مزید مقدار لانے پر کام کر رہے ہیں جو حکومت کی جانب سے خریدی جانے والی ویکسین میں اضافے کا باعث بنے گی۔ پاکستان میں یونیسیف کی نمائندہ محترمہ عائدہ گیرمانے کہا کہ ہم حکومت، ڈبلیو ایچ او، جی اے وی آئی اور دیگر شراکت داروں کے ساتھ مل کر ملک بھر میں وائرس سے شدید بیماری میں مبتلا ہونے والوں اور  زیادہ خطرے سے دوچار افراد کو ویکسین لگانے  اور قومی ویکسینیشن مہم کے رول آؤٹ پر عمل درآمد کے لئے  چوبیس گھنٹے کام کریںگے۔ ہماس وقت تک نہیں رکیں گے جب تک ہم آبادی کے تمام کمزور ترین طبقات کو ویکسین نہیں دے پاتے۔  اس کے علاوہ ، یہ انتہائی اہم ہے کہ لوگ اپنے اور اپنے اہل خانہ کے تحفظ اور وائرس کی منتقلی کو کم کرنے میں مدد کے لئے   حفاظتی اقدامات پر عمل کریں۔
پاکستان کے لئے گاوی سینئر کنٹری منیجر الیکسا رینالڈز نے کہا کہ یہ ترسیل – اس سلسلے کی اولین - مگر غیر معمولی عالمی شراکت داری کی پیداوار ہے جس کا مقصد یہ یقینی بنانا ہے  کہ کووِڈ -19 ویکسین کے حصول کے لئے عالمی دوڑ میں کوئی ملک پیچھے نہ رہ جائے۔ یہ ویکسین محفوظ ہیں، یہ موثر ہے اور یہ اس وبا کے خاتمے میں انتہائی اہم کردار ادا کرے گی۔
پاکستان میں وبا پھیلنے کے آغاز سے اب تک کووِڈ -19 کے 8لاکھ 50ہزار 131 کیسز رپورٹ ہوئے ہیں اور اب تک 18ہزار 677 افراد اس بیماری کا شکار ہو چکے ہیں۔
کورونا وائرس کے خلاف اہم احتیاطی اقدامات میں کم از کم 20 سیکنڈ تک باقاعدگی سے صابن سے ہاتھ دھونا یا سینیٹائزر کا استعمال کرنا؛ ماسک پہننا؛ دوسرے لوگوں سے کم از کم چھ فٹ کے فاصلے پر رہنا؛  پر ہجوم  مقامات پر جانے  سے پرہیز کرنا؛ اور کووِڈ -19 علامات ظاہر ہونے کی صورت میں گھر میں رہنا شامل ہیں۔
کوویکس کے  تکنیکی اور فنڈنگ شراکت دار وبا کے ذریعے حکومت کے ساتھ کام جاری رکھیں گے تاکہ یہ یقینی بنایا جاسکے کہ کوئی پیچھے نہ رہے۔

مندرجہ ذیل سفارتی مشنز اور کو ویکس کو عطیات فراہم کرنے والوں نے ویکسین کی کھیپ وصول  کرنے کی تقریب میں شرکت کی:

پاکستان میں یورپی یونین کی سفیر محترمہ اینڈرولا کامینارا   نے کہا کہ ہم حکومت پاکستان کے ساتھ ٹھوس یکجہتی کے اظہار  اور ویکسین کی اس اہم ترسیل کے ذریعے کورونا وائرس سے لڑنے کی کوششوں کی حمایت کرنے کے اس سلسلے کا خیرمقدم کرتے ہیں۔ ہمیں اپنے شراکت داروں کے ساتھ عالمی کو ویکس اقدام میں اپنا کردار ادا کرنے پر فخر ہے کیونکہ اس سے ان کوششوں کی تکمیل میں مدد ملتی ہے جہاں ویکسین کی ضرورت ہوتی ہے۔ انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ فی الحال ایس او پیز پر عمل کرنے کی بے حد ضرورتہے۔
امریکی سفارت خانے کی چارج ڈی افیئرز انجیلا پی ایگلر نے کہا کہ امریکہ اسٹرازینکا کووِڈ -19 ویکسین کی 12 لاکھ افراد کے لئے ویکسین کی پاکستان میں کامیاب آمد کا بھرپور خیرمقدم کرتا ہے۔ انہوں نے مزید  کہا کہ ہم دنیا کی سب سے زیادہ خطرے سے دوچار آبادیوں کی ویکسین تک رسائی میں مدد کے لیے دو طرفہ اور کثیر الجہتی انداز میں کام کرنے کے لیے پرعزم ہیں۔ اس وبا نے شراکت داری کی اہمیت کو ظاہر کیا ہے مثلا امریکہ اور پاکستان کے درمیان دیرینہ شراکت داری جس نے ہمیں صحت کے اس بحران کا مل کر اور زیادہ موثر انداز  میں جواب دینے کے قابل بنایا ہے۔
برطانوی ہائی کمشنر ڈاکٹر کرسچن ٹرنرنے  کہا کہ مجھے اوکسفرڈ یونیورسٹی کی طرف سے تیارکردہ  اسٹرا زینیکا ویکسین تیار کرنے میں برطانیہ کے کردار پر فخر ہے جو پاکستان آج حاصل کر رہا ہے۔ انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ برطانیہ کو ویکس کی سہولت کے سلسلے میں تعاون کرنے والے دنیا کے سب سے بڑے ملکوں میں ایک ہے۔ حکومت برطانیہ نے اس بات کو یقینی بنانے کے لئے 548 ملین پاؤنڈز کا عطیہ دیا تاکہ مختلف ممالک کو ان کی ضرورت کے مطابق ویکسین فراہم کی جا سکے اور ان میں پاکستان بھی شامل ہے۔
پاکستان میں جرمنی کے سفارت خانے کے چارج ڈی افیئرز/ڈی ایچ ایم ڈاکٹر فلپ ڈیچمین نے کہا کہ پاکستان میں پہلے کو ویکس بیچ کی آج آمد اس وبا کے خلاف اجتماعی جنگ میں اہم سنگ میل کار درجہ رکھتی ہے۔ یہ کثیر الجہتی اور بین الاقوامی یکجہتی کی ایک روشن دلیل ہے۔ جرمنی کو دوسرے سب سے بڑے عطیہ دینے والے کی حیثیت سے 1.5 بلین یورو کا حصہ ڈالنے پر فخر ہے کیونکہ ہمیں یقین ہے: ویکسین تک جامع عالمی رسائی وقت کی اہم ترین ضرورت ہے اور جب تک ہر کوئی محفوظ نہیں ہوتا کوئی بھی محفوظ نہیں ہے!''

ITC launches efforts for SMEs in Pakistan to access international markets
(Geneva/Islamabad) A new initiative that will enable small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Pakistan to effectively engage in international markets was launched today.
This UK-funded initiative will help enhance Pakistan’s trade diversification and integration into global value chains.
The International Trade Centre (ITC) will implement the Revenue mobilization, Investment and Trade Programme (REMIT) programme. The GBP 5 million project will run from 2020-2024.
These efforts are part of a larger UK-supported REMIT programme aimed at contributing to sustainable and inclusive economic development in the country.
The British High Commissioner to Pakistan, Dr Christian Turner said:
“Monthly exports for goods and services (worth $3.2 billion) are at an impressive record high  - with UK remaining one of the biggest export markets for Pakistan. The new programme will enable trade reforms and create more opportunities for Pakistani businesses, especially the small and medium enterprises, to compete in international markets. This also aligns well with my ambition to double the trade between UK and Pakistan showing the best of #UKPakDosti.”
The Executive Director of the International Trade Centre, Ms Pamela Coke-Hamilton said:
“REMIT will focus on creating a conducive environment for small and medium-sized enterprises to engage in trade.  It can help diversify the economy and capture additional export opportunities for the country post COVID-19. ITC is committed to strengthening Pakistan’s approach to trade and stimulating international trade competitiveness. This will make it easier for Pakistani businesses to trade internationally and support job creation in export-oriented sectors.”
Federal Secretary Commerce, Mr Muhammad Sualeh Ahmad Faruqui said:
“This project is a comprehensive and far-reaching project involving major public and private stakeholders in business and international trade in Pakistan. Through the project’s intervention areas spanning National Priority Sectors Export Strategy, building institutional capacity for trade policy formulation and addressing trade barriers, and finally through targeted trade facilitation oriented reforms, the project will go a long way towards contributing to increased trade and investment for the inclusive and sustainable economic development of Pakistan. I am pleased to know that ReMIT has a gender response framework which informs all project activities.”
Through development of Pakistan’s National Priority Sector,s Export Strategy and capacity building of the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Trade Development Authority (TDAP), the National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC) and business associations and groups, the programme will support formulation and reform of trade policies, including addressing some of the main barriers to trade.  These efforts will reflect public-private consensus. The project will also build business associations’ capacity for advocacy, including women entrepreneurs.
By supporting trade and related activities, this project will contribute to the government of Pakistan’s efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Note to the Editor
-          A trade facilitation toolbox will be developed, for optimal implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement.
-          The project will also contribute to increased transparency of trade rules and improve business compliance with cross-border requirements.
-          The programme will also ensure inclusivity through addressing barriers that women businesses face in integrating into export value chains.

Series of trainings conducted to support the National Centralized database on Social Protection
ISLAMABAD (ILO News): The Ministry of Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives responsible for reporting progress on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in collaboration with the ILO convened a series of meetings to strengthen the capacity of social protection agencies and report on the status of coverage of social protection.

For effective horizontal and vertical coordination, the Ministry has developed a mechanism with relevant stakeholders for data collection and reporting on SDGs indicators by developing a dedicated SDGs dashboard to monitor the progress both at national and provincial levels. This data is populated from different sources, and the process of developing linkages with other databases of ministries has been initiated.

To this end, a number of orientation sessions were organized in the last quarter of 2020, and several agencies commenced data entry every quarter. However, for Pakistan to report on its SDGs commitments and, more specifically SDG 1.3.1  (Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems), specific capacity enhancements are required. To facilitate this, trainings were held for officials from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh wherein 45 officials from 22 social protection agencies focused on familiarizing users with the database, navigating through its features and hands-on data entry. Planning Departments demonstrated a strong commitment in both provinces in coordinating and organizing these sessions

The database allows end-users to update and add schemes and provide details on multiple dimensions of their implementation, such as segregation by gender, age, geographic division.

It is envisioned that a national report on SDG 1.3.1 will be launched in June 2021 by the Ministry with the support of the ILO.

These capacity strengthening efforts are financially and technically supported under the Project, ‘Achieving SDGs and Ending Poverty through Universal Social Protection ’, supported under the UN Peace and Development Trust Fund by the Government of China and jointly implemented by UNDESA and the ILO.
Social Protection Data in Pakistan
Social Protection is one of the key priorities of the Government of Pakistan. This includes SDG indicator 1.3.1. pertaining to social protection. In Pakistan, government departments and institutions at the federal and provincial level provide different levels of social protection coverage. However, the data on social protection is scattered and needs consolidation for precise reporting. With the support of the ILO, the Ministry developed a national database anchored within the SDG dashboard to consolidate the social protection data.

The SDG 1.3.1 database is based on a simplified and harmonized reporting format designed keeping in mind the lifecycle approach and the nine branches of social security recommended by the ILO Convention on Social Security (Minimum Standards), C102. This database will be accessible to all social protection agencies to input data on coverage and other dimensions.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL VIDEO MESSAGE ON WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY 2021
“JOURNALISM AS A PUBLIC GOOD: 30 YEARS OF THE WINDHOEK DECLARATION”
New York, 3 May 2021
The global challenges we have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic underline the critical role of reliable, verified and universally accessible information in saving lives and building strong, resilient societies.
During the pandemic, and in other crises including the climate emergency, journalists and media workers help us navigate a fast-changing and often overwhelming landscape of information, while addressing dangerous inaccuracies and falsehoods.
In too many countries, they run great personal risks, including new restrictions, censorship, abuse, harassment, detention and even death, simply for doing their jobs. The situation continues to worsen.
The economic impact of the pandemic has hit many media outlets hard, threatening their very survival.
As budgets tighten, so too does access to reliable information. Rumours, falsehoods and extreme or divisive opinions surge in to fill the gap.
I urge all governments to do everything in their power to support a free, independent and diverse media.
Free and independent journalism is our greatest ally in combatting misinformation and disinformation.
The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists aims to create a safe environment for media workers across the globe – because information is a public good.
Today, we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Windhoek Declaration for the Development of a Free, Independent and Pluralistic African Press. Despite dramatic changes in the media over the past three decades, the Declaration’s urgent call for press freedom and free access to information is as relevant as ever.
Let’s reflect on its message, and renew our efforts to protect media freedom – so that information remains a lifesaving public good for all.

UNICEF - PGP : PRESS RELEASE : Vaccination Demand Observatory launched to strengthen local communication programmes to address vaccine misinformation
Vaccination Demand Observatory launched to strengthen local communication programmes to address vaccine misinformation
UNICEF, Yale Institute for Global Health, and Public Good Projects team up to create the Vaccination Demand Observatory to equip country teams with tools to counter misinformation and mistrust related to all vaccines
NEW YORK, APRIL 29 2021 – To combat vaccine hesitancy worldwide, PGP, (The Public Good Projects), UNICEF and Yale Institute for Global Health launched the Vaccination Demand Observatory today.
As countries begin rolling out COVID-19 vaccination, public health experts know that the last inch -- getting the vaccine from vial to arm -- can be the hardest. Public uncertainty in the current pandemic has been exacerbated by an “infodemic,” a confusing epidemic of information and misinformation. The Vaccination Demand Observatory (The Observatory) is developing tools, training, technical support and research to equip in-country teams to mitigate the impact of misinformation and mistrust on all vaccines. This programme is organized in three pillars: social listening analytics and insight generation,      a training and education program to tackle challenges related to all vaccines, and a communications lab.
The Vaccine Acceptance Interventions Lab (VAIL) will draw upon behavioural and social research and insights from social listening to develop engaging, relevant content to fill information gaps. VAIL also will develop “inoculation” messages to vaccinate people against vaccine misinformation. The content and programs will be rapid field tested for tone, format and behavior change impact before being implemented.
“In these times of heightened anxiety and uncertainty, people have many perfectly reasonable questions and concerns about vaccines. But their search for answers may be confounded by huge information gaps and a miasma of mis- and disinformation,” says Dr. Angus Thomson, PhD, Senior Social Scientist for UNICEF. “We can’t address people’s concerns if we don’t first understand them. Then we must speak with - not at - people, where they are, about what matters to them. The Observatory will help empower countries to do this.”
Working much like a disease surveillance system, an Observatory-supported country programme will contextualize vaccine conversations, characterizing questions, concerns, and misinformation, to provide regular updates to local health agencies and partner organizations. Unlike previous efforts, this programme is built around a “Field Infodemic Manager” rather than a dashboard. This manager will coordinate the listening, analytics, and identification and assessment of vaccine rumours and information gaps to provide real-time actionable insights and recommendations to the teams which are engaging with communities.
“Because local communication is key to the success of any vaccination program, we are focused on building local-level programs that are as powerful and sophisticated as any global system. Each country on earth has its own cultural nuances. The Observatory system will entail both quantitative and qualitative methods for tracking and characterizing local vaccine narratives. Subsequent public health programs can then be customized to each country’s context, and evaluated by potential traction and impact,” says Dr Joe Smyser, PhD, MSPH, Chief Executive Officer of PGP.
UNICEF helps reach almost half of the world’s children with life-saving vaccines and those kids’ access to education, health and protection services has been severely disrupted by the pandemic. UNICEF’s local-level footprint, through active community engagement, risk communication, social mobilization and partnership in countries around the world will be informed in real-time by this social listening programme. UNICEF works through the Vaccination Demand Hub to coordinate its support to countries with other multilaterals, global partnerships, donors, non-governmental and civil society organizations.
As a first step, the Observatory released the Vaccine Misinformation Management Field Guide in December 2020. This practical guide, available in 6 languages, aims to help organizations to address the global infodemic through the development of strategic and well-coordinated national action plans to rapidly counter vaccine misinformation and build demand for vaccination.
The Observatory’s first on-the-ground project is ongoing in multiple West African countries supporting UNICEF polio teams in the launch of a new oral polio vaccine.
“Existing global-level vaccine social listening efforts lack the granularity for community-level insights, and focus on digital channels,” says Dr Thomson. “Data equity is essential if countries are to reach every person with vaccines. The Observatory focuses on aggregating both online and offline listening sources, to ensure we also hear the voices of the digitally disenfranchised.”
As a first step to enhancing capabilities in countries, the Observatory has stood up regional listening dashboards that are being interpreted by Infodemic Managers. But it is now seeking support to rapidly take these tools, training and technical assistance to countries as they manage COVID-19 and polio vaccine introductions, and work to sustain trust in routine immunization programs.
“We should expect the same rigor from vaccine acceptance science as we do from vaccine development science,” says Professor Saad B. Omer, MBBS MPH PhD, Director of Yale Institute for Global Health. “The Observatory brings together evidence-informed approaches to inoculate against misinformation and increase vaccine acceptance and demand.”
“We applaud the mobilization of funders to support the COVAX facility providing COVID-19 vaccines to over 100 countries. However, lack of investment in misinformation management and demand generation means we risk precious doses sitting unwanted and unused,” says Dr Smyser. “Current investment in this crucial work remains only a tiny fraction of a percent of the investment in producing and distributing vaccine doses.”

World Day for Safety and Health at Work
ILO calls for resilient occupational safety and health systems for future emergencies
Better national occupational safety and health policies, institutional and regulatory frameworks, that are also integrated into crisis response, are needed, says the International Labour Organization.
GENEVA (ILO News) – Countries need to put in place sound and resilient occupational safety and health (OSH) systems that would minimize the risks for everyone in the world of work in the event of future health emergencies, says the International Labour Organization (ILO) in a report, released on World Day for Safety and Health at Work.

This will require investment in OSH infrastructure and integrating it into overall national crisis emergency preparedness and response plans, so that workers’ safety and health is protected, and the business continuity of enterprises is supported.

The report, Anticipate, prepare and respond to crises. Invest now in resilient OSH systems , examines risk prevention and management relating to the pandemic, and analyses other health and safety risks associated with the changing work arrangements arising from virus control measures.

It outlines the critical roles played during the pandemic by occupational safety and health regulatory frameworks and institutions, compliance mechanisms, health and advisory services, data, research and training.

“There could be no clearer demonstration of the importance of a strong, resilient, occupational safety and health environment. Recovery and prevention will require better national policies, institutional and regulatory frameworks, properly integrated into crisis response frameworks,” said ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic  emerged workers in specific sectors, such as emergency, health and social care, have been particularly vulnerable to the risk of infection. According to data cited in the report, 7,000 health workers have died since the outbreak of the crisis, while 136 million health and social care workers are at risk of contracting COVID-19 through work.

The pressures and risks facing health workers during the pandemic have also taken a toll on their mental health: one in five healthcare workers globally have reported depression and anxiety symptoms.

As well as the health and care sectors many other workplaces have been sources of COVID-19 outbreaks, when staff are in closed environments or spend time in close proximity with each other, including in shared accommodation or transport.

In analyzing the health concerns arising from the dramatic increase in teleworking during the pandemic, the report says that while teleworking has been essential in limiting the spread of the virus, maintaining jobs and business continuity and giving workers increased flexibility, it has also blurred the lines between work and private life. Sixty-five per cent of enterprises surveyed by the ILO and the G20 OSH Network reported that worker morale has been difficult to sustain while teleworking.

The report says small and micro-sized enterprises have often found it hard to meet official OSH requirements because many have lacked the resources to adapt to the threats posed by the pandemic.

In the informal economy, many of the 1.6 billion workers, especially in developing countries, have continued working despite lockdowns, restrictions on movement and social interaction, and other measures. This has put them at high risk of catching the virus, yet most do not have access to basic social protection, such as sick leave or sick pay.

International labour standards (ILS) offer specific guidance on how to respond to these challenges, thereby reducing the risk of virus transmission in the workplace, the report says. They provide tools to implement OSH measures and to ensure that workers, employers and governments can maintain decent work, while adjusting to the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic.

ILS also encourage social dialogue as the best way to ensure that procedures and protocols are effectively implemented and accepted.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the multiple crises it has caused, a growing number of countries are approaching and achieving malaria elimination.  Today, on World Malaria Day, we commend all countries that have reached the ambitious target of zero malaria.  Together, they are showing the world that a malaria-free future is possible.
In countries with zero malaria, all people at risk of the disease – regardless of their citizenship or ability to pay – have been reached with the services they need to prevent, detect and treat the disease.  Sustained funding, strong surveillance systems and community engagement have also been key to success.
Yet, while we celebrate these achievements, let us not forget the millions of people around the world who continue to suffer and die from this deadly illness.  Each year, malaria claims the lives of more than 400,000 people, mainly young children in Africa.  And, every year, there are more than 200 million new cases of this deadly parasitic disease.
Malaria can be defeated.  With robust political commitment, adequate investment and the right mix of strategies, we can reach our common goal of a world free of malaria.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a tragic reminder of how deeply connected we are.
There is a clear and urgent need for concrete multilateral solutions, based on common action across borders for the good of all humanity, starting with the equitable distribution of vaccines as a global public good.
This need goes far beyond the pandemic. It applies to all the transnational threats we face: the climate crisis; air and water pollution; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; the development of new technologies in the absence of agreed principles and norms.
We need a more networked multilateralism, with stronger coordination between regional and international organizations, international financial institutions and public/private alliances.
We need an inclusive multilateralism, that draws on civil society, business, local and regional authorities and others, and shares power more broadly and fairly.
And we need strong multilateral action now, to emerge from the pandemic safely, to address the climate crisis, and to build stronger, safer communities and societies.
Today, as we mark the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, let’s renew our commitment to global multilateral solutions that deliver for people and planet.

UNICEF leads global vaccination drive during World Immunization Week
Global partners pledge a $1 donation for every like, share or comment on social media posts mentioning ‘UNICEF’ using the hashtag #VaccinesWork until the end of April
NEW YORK/ISLAMABAD, 23 April 2021 – UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and founder of the 7 Fund for UNICEF, David Beckham, is fronting a global initiative to inspire confidence in vaccines and encourage parents around the world to vaccinate their children against deadly diseases.
In a powerful video released ahead of World Immunization Week, Beckham talks about the loss of everyday activities due to COVID-19, such as hugs with family, spending time with friends, and being with the people we love, and encourages parents to vaccinate themselves so that they can be safe. He also urges families to ensure that their children are receiving routine vaccinations to protect them against diseases such as diphtheria, measles and polio.
“In the last year, COVID-19 has shown us how much we take for granted but it has also reminded us about the power of vaccines,” said Beckham. “Vaccines work, saving millions of lives every year. I have learned through my work with UNICEF just how important they are for the health of our loved ones. Yet too many children around the world don’t get the routine vaccines they need to be safe from deadly diseases. That’s why this World Immunization Week, I’m so proud to be joining UNICEF and partners to encourage parents to vaccinate themselves and their children.”
In Pakistan, World Immunization Week is being celebrated under the leadership of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MNSR&C).
As a development partner, UNICEF is providing technical support to the Government to help every child have access to vaccines, including those living in hard-to-reach and marginalized communities, and improve health outcomes for all children.
Referring to the current global situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said, “After a year of lockdowns, empty classrooms, missed vaccinations, virtual birthday parties, and cancelled family dinners, people all over the world are now getting a COVID-19 vaccine or anxiously awaiting the moment when they will. And it’s an important reminder of the critical role other vaccines play in allowing us to live our everyday lives. Whereas today we all know COVID-19 vaccines are the best hope we have of resuming our normal lives, what remains ‘normal’ for far too many children all over the world is no access to vaccines for any preventable diseases whatsoever. This is not a ‘normal’ to which we should return.”
Every year, 14 million infants and children globally do not receive any vaccines against preventable diseases, with many living in remote rural locations, conflict zones or slum settings and without access to other essential health services. In the last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has made this situation even more dire, as pandemic-related lockdowns and supply disruptions threaten a devastating rise in preventable child deaths.
“Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools to help children survive and thrive. No child should miss on routine immunization shots and polio drops, even as we face the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “UNICEF and partners will continue to support the Government of Pakistan in its efforts to ensure that all children are immunized and healthy.”
World Immunization Week – celebrated every year in the last week of April – aims to promote the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against disease. Using the theme ‘Vaccines bring us closer’, World Immunization Week 2021 will urge greater engagement around immunization globally to promote the importance of vaccination in bringing people together, and improving the health and wellbeing of everyone, everywhere, throughout life.

Information and communication technologies have been invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic. They help us to stay connected, and to keep vital services and businesses going.
Yet almost half the world is still offline – and most of those who lack access to digital technology are women and girls in developing countries. Latest figures from the International Telecommunication Union show a 17 per cent gender gap in internet use globally. This is even wider in least developed countries. In some regions, this gender gap is growing, reinforcing gender inequalities by denying women and girls opportunities to access education, find better-paid jobs, and start new businesses.
Making these technologies available to all is an essential part of building back stronger communities and economies, and addressing many of the world’s most pressing challenges.
International Girls in ICT Day aims to inspire a global movement to increase the representation of girls and women in technology. Today, let’s recommit to the goal of equal access for young women and girls to opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math.

As we mark International Mother Earth Day, our planet is at a tipping point.
Humanity continues to abuse the natural world.
We heedlessly plunder the Earth’s resources, deplete its wildlife and treat air, land and seas as dumping grounds.
Crucial ecosystems and food chains are being pushed to the brink of collapse.
This is suicidal.
We must end our war on nature and nurse it back to health.
That means bold climate action to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius and adapt to the changes to come.
It means stronger steps to protect biodiversity.
And it means reducing pollution by building circular economies that drive down waste.
These steps will safeguard our only home and create millions of new jobs.
Recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is a chance to set the world on a cleaner, greener, more sustainable path.
On International Mother Earth Day, let us all commit to the hard work of restoring our planet and making peace with nature.

Over 1.4 million Afghan refugees to get new PoR smartcards
Government, UNHCR launch nationwide verification exercise
ISLAMABAD, 15 April 2021 – The Government of Pakistan, with the support of UNHCR, has launched a nationwide verification exercise for 1.4 million Afghan refugees during which new smartcards will be issued.
The Documentation Renewal and Information Verification Exercise, or DRIVE for short, was inaugurated at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Islamabad by the Federal Minister for SAFRON, His Excellency Mehboob Sultan. The UNHCR Representative, Noriko Yoshida, and the Chief Commissioner for Afghan Refugees, Saleem Khan, were also present on the occasion.
During the six-month exercise, registered Afghan refugees who currently hold Proof of Registration (PoR) cards will be provided with new smartcards.
“The DRIVE exercise is a leap forward for everyone,” Yoshida said, welcoming its launch. “This step will allow refugees to have better, faster and safer access to services, including schools, hospitals and banks.”
Yoshida added that in addition to verifying existing data, the exercise will record Afghan refugees’ skill sets, level of education, socio-economic circumstances, allowing better targeted health, education and livelihood support in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“Pakistan has been hosting Afghan refugees for four decades, and a lot has changed since the last verification exercise 10 years ago. It’s crucial that we update the data of Afghan refugees to understand their situation better,” said the Federal Minister for SAFRON.
Sultan added, “As the country hosting one of the most protracted refugee situation in the world, Pakistan has strived to play its part in assisting and protecting refugees. It’s important the international community also continue to come forward, and share the responsibility and help find solutions.”
The Federal Minister for SAFRON urged POR cardholders to participate fully in this exercise. He also requested that they take all precautionary measures and observe COVID-19 protocols.
Six hundred male and female staff – a combination of government and UNHCR – will be working at some 35 DRIVE verification sites around the country, and using mobile registration vehicles, to support refugees throughout the exercise.
Measures are in place at all DRIVE sites to mitigate COVID-19 risks through enhanced hygiene, physical distancing and the scheduling of set numbers of appointments each day.
DRIVE is part of a wider effort to assist displaced Afghans, through the Support Platform for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees (SSAR) (https://ssar-platform.org).

FAO- PRESS RELEASE : Agrisurge Innovation Challenge to digitize agriculture sector in Pakistan
Agrisurge Innovation Challenge to digitize agriculture sector in Pakistan
Islamabad, April 12, 2021. In collaboration with Ministry of IT & Telecom (MoITT) and Ignite National Technology Fund, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations had launched an Agrisurge Innovation Challenge to jointly work for the acceleration of development of Pakistan’s agriculture sector using technology. Subsequent to signing of the framework collaboration agreement between Ministry of IT and FAO , Agrisurge Innovation Challenge was launched in 2020. The winners of the challenge were announced at a joint event held in Islamabad today. The event was attended by Mr. Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui, Federal Secretary IT & Telecom, CEO and officials from Ignite, MoITT, the UN agencies, development partners and winning teams of the challenge.

Under the Agrisurge Innovation Challenge, FAO in collaboration with Ignite called for innovative solutions that can boost agriculture in Pakistan, and can increase the resilience of food systems and help with the transformation of small farmers through 4th Industrial Wave (4IW) technologies. Around 738 participants applied for the challenge and the selected teams submitted their working prototypes for evaluation. The projects were evaluated by independent judges appointed by Ignite and FAO including local and international domain experts. Smart Ecosystem for Bees ‘Silver Bees’ won the first cash prize for its solution to digitalize the ecosystem for beekeeping and honey farming, whereas Smart Poultry Farming ‘SmartFarms’ secured the 2nd cash prize for their IoT sensors-based solution to collect data using Arduino/Raspberry Pi. The 3rd cash prize was won by FarmMach Share ‘CyberVision’ for providing a comprehensive digital solution to help farmers to fully exploit the potential of existing farm machinery by making them available as a shared resource. A special cash prize was won by Humaray Khayt ‘Tech 3PO’ for developing an application which provides separate interfaces for each type of crop and operates with pictorials in Urdu.

Speaking on the occasion, Federal Secretary IT, Mr. Shoaib Ahmad Siddiqui, said that this innovation challenge was launched with a view to strengthen our agriculture sector which has a great importance in the economic development of Pakistan. Looking at the innovative solutions and the passion with which participants from all across Pakistan competed, it is evident that our tech-savvy youth is ready to address the challenges and problems faced by agriculture sector through technological interventions. He said, “I’m happy that the women led team clinched the 1st prize rather than settling for the special prize we earlier kept for any such team.”

FAO Representative ad interim in Pakistan stated that the AgriSurge innovation challenge will serve as an important step towards achieving food security and improving lives of the most vulnerable across Pakistan. People-centered intensification of digital technologies is the path to making the world’s agri-food systems capable of delivering heathy diets for all and using our planet’s finite natural resources more efficiently. The Fourth Agricultural Revolution is a marriage between data and technological innovation with farming that will further transform the industry and help us to achieve a new level of productivity, quality, diversity, efficiency and environmental sustainability, she said.

Mr. Asim Shahryar Husain, CEO Ignite, stated that “the overwhelming response to Ignite and FAO’s call for innovative solutions in the field of agriculture reflects the significance of the sensitivities of food security in the country. We will continue to explore new solutions besides strengthening the partnership with the winners of this challenge. I hope this competition will ignite the farming community and will be a founding step in solving agriculture-related problems using technology,” he said.

SDG GLOBAL FESTIVAL OF ACTION, 25-26 MARCH 2021
- A Turning Point for People and Planet –
Over 20,000 gather at the SDG Global Festival of Action,
calling for transformative change to turn things around for people and the planet

BONN, GERMANY, 25 MARCH – Calling for the beginning of a ‘new era’ following COVID-19 recovery, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed alongside United Nations Development Programme Administrator Achim Steiner, spoke today at the fifth annual SDG Global Festival of Action, bringing to attention the urgent need for economic and social change that protects our ecosystems and humanity’s well-being.
The Deputy Secretary-General stated her support for an inter-generational transition, putting youth at the forefront to allow them to shape the SDG agenda, and encouraged countries to listen to its young people to ensure we don’t return to business as usual.
Convened over two days, from 25 to 26 March, under the theme ‘A Turning Point for People and Planet’, the Festival connected government and private sector leaders with changemakers, activists, creatives and more, hosting talks, performances, interactive workshops and exhibits to inspire and mobilize action. Because of the pandemic, the dynamic in-person event moved to a virtual platform, elevating its attendance to over 20,000 remote participants from 203 countries and territories, making it the largest and most geographically diverse Festival ever.
With the world still suffering from the effects of the pandemic and many countries still in lockdown, the year 2021 was framed as a critical year to accelerate progress on the SDGs, with climate, gender equality, poverty and inequalities, and sustainable financing firmly in focus. The Festival aimed to scale up both awareness and ambition ahead of important events such as the G20 meetings, The Generation Equality Forum, The Food Systems Summit and the important COP climate conferences in Italy and Scotland towards the end of the year. Over 300 speakers from 80+ countries represented the wide range of SDG stakeholders, came together to share their knowledge and experience on how to tackle the world’s ongoing challenges, present solutions and discuss what is at stake if we fail to meet the promises of the Sustainable Development Goals.
“It’s become clear that everyone has a role in advancing this transformation,’ said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “On the one hand, we need new policies that steer our societies in the right direction. On the other, each of us is an agent for change. Our individual behaviours will add up to make the difference - powerfully so.” Marina Ponti, Director of the SDG Action Campaign who organized the Festival, echoed the sense of optimism and called to seize the opportunities that came with the unprecedented global crisis we saw last year, noting that we should use what we’ve learned to shift the way we live, consume, earn and produce. “Together, we can dream big. We can act with shared heart and conviction. And we can generate a global turning point that resets our world for good.”
Other speakers during the opening day included SDG Advocate and disability activist Eddie Ndopu who talked about how the pandemic has caused pre-existing inequities to bubble up to the surface, including a crisis of inequality, the ecological breakdown of the planet, and systemic injustices - yet shared optimism in the fact that it has also compounded humanity’s capacity for creativity, genius and resilience. David Nabarro, Special Envoy of WHO on COVID-19, echoed Eddie’s statement in his talk highlighting that only by working together and supporting each other will humanity come through this pandemic with the strength it needs to help set the world on the right path.
Chairman of Japan SDGs Action Promotion Council, Norichika Kanie, was proud to represent Japan as they became the first country to host a local edition of the Festival - the SDG Global Festival of Action from Japan, an integral component of this year’s Global Festival. Sharing local solutions and setting an example of nationwide movement for action, the spin-off was curated by 12 UN agencies based in Japan and featured Goodwill Ambassadors Misako Konno (UNDP) and MIYAVI (UNHCR), popular comedian Yuriyan Retriever, and many other multi sectoral stakeholders. Dr. Kanie urged that we work together to combine our solutions for people and planet, to light the spark for action following the vision set out by the Sustainable Development Agenda.
Representing youth climate advocates, Mitzi Jonelle Tan from the Philippines joined with an impassioned plea to recognize and empower marginalized sectors of society, especially those from the global south, who are on the frontlines of the unequal impacts of climate change, and who are not always included in the conversations on how to confront the crisis.

UNIDO Launches a Micro-Financing Scheme for Small Businesses and Micro Enterprises to Promote Renewable Energy Solutions for Productive Uses
Islamabad (25 March 2021), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) organized a virtual launch event of the Renewable energy investment support program for small businesses and micro enterprises, under GEF funded project "Sustainable Energy Initiative for Industries in Pakistan". The program is being executed in collaboration with National Rural Support Program (NRSP) and will help to increase access to finance for clean and green productive solutions.
Chief Guest Mr. Shah Jahan Mirza, CEO Alternative Energy Development Board, in his key note remarks appreciated the efforts of UNIDO and NRSP and said “this economically viable initiative by UNIDO aiming at smaller enterprises and poorer communities for sustainability through affordable renewable energy solutions will boost the rural economy of Pakistan”. He also opined ”since taking national grids to remote areas is expensive, this scheme will provide easy access to affordable and reliable energy solutions in these areas.”
Dr Rashid Bajwa, CEO NRSP, in his remarks said “In Pakistan this kind of zero interest loan scheme is being carried out for the first of time in terms of renewable energy. This blended finance based RE micro financing program will initially benefit about 400 persons whereby providing an opportunity to small businesses to make productive use of Renewable Energy technology solutions for income generation. We will reach our targets on a sound footing at a high frequency”.
Earlier in her welcome remarks, Ms. Nadia Aftab, UNIDO Country Representative, shared her thoughts “Several renewable technologies have emerged with economically viable and environmentally friendly options which if suitably adopted can meet energy needs of industry particularly for small enterprises. With the funding from the Global Environment Facility, UNIDO has setup a precedent for how renewable energy solutions can enhance MSME's for income generation and value addition, especially for women owned enterprises. When we stress on economic development and SDGs, energy must be used to promote productive uses to create jobs and more income generating opportunities for communities.  The larger impact of this project is contributing in achieving the SDGs.”
Later in the technical sessions, the technical teams from NRSP and UNIDO highlighted key components of the project. The presenters informed the audience about this unique initiative from UNIDO which intended to utilize the GEF grants to provide interest free loans to beneficiaries for procurement and installation of Renewable Energy projects along with post installation maintenance support. The program will be implemented in 48 districts across Punjab and Sindh provinces providing access to clean, reliable and affordable Renewable Energy based solutions to small businesses, farmers and women owned micro enterprises.  The program in affect would not only contribute in reducing GHG emission in rural and agro-sectors but would step forward towards providing sustainable livelihoods to rural and marginalized communities. In the session, types of RE technologies and available solutions in the market along with their application were showcased. It was attended by representatives from public sector, donors, representatives from NRSP district offices and beneficiaries including smallholding farmers and local renewable energy solution providers.
UNIDO is specialized agency of UNITED NATIONS focusing on industrial development in the developing world. UNIDO works on different projects which are directly or indirectly related to Industrial development, Climate Change, Trade Etc. In all projects where UNIDO provides technical assistance, it is ensured that that project is sustainable and adaptable for the private sector.  UNIDO under its REEE Project, is fully working on its theme of ISID (Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development) which refers to inclusive participation of the women along with men in all aspects of industrial development.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL MESSAGE ON WORLD METEOROLOGICAL DAY, 23 March 2021
FAO - PRESS RELEASE : FAO marks International Water and Forest Day 2021
The ocean and the atmosphere are two titans of the Earth system.
Carefully balanced and inextricably connected, the relationship between air and sea dictates weather and climate around the globe.
Climate change is disrupting this delicate equilibrium.
Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels has heated our ocean to record temperatures, making it more acidic and increasingly depriving it of oxygen.
These changes are harming marine ecosystems and reducing the ocean’s ability to sustain the hundreds of millions of people who depend on it.
Sea-level rise has accelerated because of melting glaciers and ice caps, threatening coastal megacities and small island nations alike.
Science is also revealing how melting could affect mighty ocean currents, further exacerbating climate disruption.
Scientific research and better ocean observations are increasing our understanding of the changes taking place.
But, as we embark on the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, big gaps remain.
That is why this year’s World Meteorological Day highlights the theme of the “Ocean, our Climate and Weather”.
Only by understanding and protecting our planet can we ensure a sustainable future for humanity.

FAO marks International Water and Forest Day 2021
ISLAMABAD 22 March 2021: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations marked World Water and Forest day in a joint event held with IUCN and Arid Agriculture University. The event was attended by experts from NGOs, INGOs , academia and Ministry of Climate Change.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change, Mr. Malik Amin Aslam speaking at the event highlighted the government’s efforts in forest restoration in the country. He stated that the government has started ten-billion trees tsunami project in twelve ecological zones of the country, which is targeting over a million hectare of forest restoration. He said that the initiatives are people centered projects, which has created half a million green jobs. The restoration of forests go hand in hand with the development and wellbeing of the people living in those areas. This vision of Pakistan of planting ten billion trees is not just about timber, it’s about the people who live in these areas and befitting from these initiatives in various ways, he added. A recent example is Mangroves in the south of Pakistan, which has increased by 300%, under this project, which is employing rural women folk along the coastlines, are getting jobs as protectors of these mangroves. He further stated that forest in Pakistan is not only necessary but they are essential for the wellbeing of the locals living there.
Speaking at the event, FAO Representative a.i Pakistan, Rebekah Bell stated that forest play important role in the environment; preventing climate change and improving local livelihoods. However, in many countries including Pakistan, the forest resource and related ecosystem are under a serious threat of degradation. The situation demands a business as usual approach is no longer an option for managing forests and related resources in the current climate change context. The paradigm shift requires the identification, scaling up best practices and knowledge sharing by all partners. Pakistan is the fifth most climate-impacted country in the world and this is negatively affecting the livelihoods of the communities especially those living in the mountain areas of the country and who rely on forest ecosystems for their livelihoods.  The density of the majority of Pakistan’s forest is under 70% and requires efforts from all to bring these forests back to their potential by applying global best practices of Natural Resource Management, she said.
She further stated that FAO Pakistan is implementing number of projects, which contribute significantly to the government of Pakistan’s efforts for forest restoration. The Chilgoza GEF funded project jointly implemented by FAO and the Ministry of Climate Change seeks to reverse forest degradation and deforestation in high conservation Chilgoza pine forest. The project have engaged the local communities in the provinces to improve forest protection, conservation and find new value addition outcomes of the forest products. An innovative approach of using the GIS based monitoring for the forestry resources through FAO collect earth tool is a significant step in introduction of advances tools and systems in forest management. For a successful natural resource management, integrated participatory approach is required to achieve sustainable results, she said.

Italy to set the stage for UN Food Systems Summit with three-day event that will deliver bold new ambitions
Wednesday 17 March, ROME - The United Nations and the Government of Italy announced today that the Pre-Summit gathering for the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit will be in Rome, Italy from July 19 to July 21, 2021.
Under the leadership of UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi, the Pre-Summit event will bring together the efforts and contributions of a global engagement process to shape ambition to transform food systems. The three-day event will bring together youth, smallholder farmers, indigenous peoples, researchers, private sector, policy leaders and ministers of agriculture, environment, health, and finance among others to deliver the latest evidence-based and scientific approach from around the world, launch a set of new commitments through coalitions of action, and mobilize new financing and partnerships. The Food Systems Summit will take place in September alongside the UN General Assembly in New York.
“The Pre-Summit in Italy will be a key moment for mobilizing the bold commitments we need to build sustainable food systems that work for people, planet, and prosperity. Through accelerated action, we can help the world recover better from COVID-19, combat rising hunger and address the climate crisis,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
As hosts of the Pre-Summit, the Italian Government will make a national food system commitment to set the tone and a high ambition ahead of the Summit.
“Italy is ready to welcome this key appointment of the Food Systems Summit in Rome. We want to address the issue of food security within our broad agenda as President of the G20. Together with the UN and its agencies based in Rome, Italy will engage with its partners to promote better agriculture, sustainable value chains and healthy lifestyles. I expect everyone to join us in a global effort to protect the environment with meaningful actions,” said Italy Prime Minister Mario Draghi.
The Pre-Summit event is expected to take place in a “hybrid” virtual format over three days, during which many people will participate in person at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome, while others from around the world will be engaged on a vast virtual platform. Global leaders are expected to step up and launch bold new actions, solutions, partnerships, and strategies to “recover better” from Covid-19 and deliver progress on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), each of which relies to some degree on nutritious, sustainable and equitable food systems.
The Pre-Summit will take place in Rome while Italy is chairing the G20 process and co-hosting the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in November. The role of food systems in achieving global goals and climate targets is expected to serve as a central priority of these other events and continue to carry forward momentum from the Food Systems Summit.

One in five children globally does not have enough water to meet their everyday needs – UNICEF
UNICEF launches new initiative, Water Security for All, to mobilize global support and resources to reach children in water vulnerable hotspots
NEW YORK, 18 March 2021 – Globally, more than 1.42 billion people, including 450 million children, live in areas of high, or extremely high, water vulnerability, according to a new analysis released by UNICEF. This means that 1 in 5 children worldwide does not have enough water to meet their everyday needs.
The analysis, part of the Water Security for All initiative, identifies areas where physical water scarcity risks overlap with poor water service levels. Communities living in these areas depend on surface water, unimproved sources, or water which can take more than 30 minutes to collect.
"The world's water crisis is not simply coming, it is here, and climate change will only make it worse," said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. "Children are the biggest victims. When wells dry-up, children are the ones missing school to fetch water. When droughts diminish food supplies, children suffer from malnutrition and stunting. When floods hit, children fall ill from waterborne illnesses. And when water resources decline, children cannot wash their hands to fight off diseases."
The data shows that children in more than 80 countries live in areas with high or extremely high water vulnerability. Eastern and Southern Africa has the highest proportion of children living in such areas, with more than half of children – 58 per cent – facing difficulty accessing sufficient water every day. It is followed by West and Central Africa (31 per cent), South Asia (25 per cent), and the Middle East (23 per cent). South Asia is home to the largest number of children living in areas of high or extremely high water vulnerability – more than 155 million children.
Children in 37 ‘hotspot’ countries face especially dire circumstances in terms of absolute numbers, the proportions of children affected, and where global resources, support and urgent action must be mobilized. This list includes Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Haiti, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Tanzania and Yemen.
Demand for water continues to increase dramatically while resources are dwindling. In addition to rapid population growth, urbanization, water misuse and mismanagement, climate change and extreme weather events reduce available quantities of safe water, exacerbating water stress. According to a UNICEF report from 2017, almost 1 in 4 children globally will live in areas of extremely high water stress by 2040.
While the impact of water scarcity can be felt by all, no one suffers more than the most vulnerable children. Children and families living in vulnerable communities face the double-edged sword of coping with high water scarcity levels while having the lowest water services, making access to sufficient water especially susceptible to climate shocks and extreme events.
In response, UNICEF is launching the Water Security for All initiative to ensure every child has access to sustainable and climate-resilient water services. The initiative aims to mobilize resources, partnerships, innovation and global response to identified hotspots where the need for safe, resilient and sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene services is the greatest and most urgent.
UNICEF is working to provide:
1.    Safe and affordable drinking water services: Access to safe and affordable water services that are sustainable, close to home, and managed professionally.
2.    Climate-resilient water, sanitation and hygiene services and communities: Water, sanitation and hygiene services that withstand climate shocks, operate using low carbon energy sources, and strengthen communities' resilience and adaptive capacities.
3.    Early action to prevent water scarcity: Resource assessments, sustainable water withdrawal, efficient use, and early warning and early preventative measures.
4.    Water cooperation for peace and stability: Support to communities and key stakeholders so that equitable management of water, sanitation and hygiene services increase social cohesion, political stability and peace; and in conflict zones to prevent attacks on water and sanitation infrastructure and personnel.
"We have to act now both to address the water crisis and to prevent it from getting any worse,” said Fore. “We can only achieve water security for every child through innovation, investment and collaboration, and by ensuring services are sustainable and resilient to climate shocks. For our children and our planet, we have to act.”
#####
Notes to editors
* Countries designated as ‘hotspots’ meet any of the following criteria: At least 60% of children live in areas of high water vulnerability; at least 40% of children live in areas of extremely high water vulnerability; at least 40% of children live in high and extremely high water vulnerability; and at least 2 million children in high and extremely high water vulnerability. These range of factors ensure that even smaller countries with high percentages of children affected also get prioritised.
Water scarcity: Water scarcity exists where the demand for water exceeds supply and where available water resources are approaching or have exceeded sustainable limits. Water scarcity can either be physical or economic.
Water stress: Water stress is an outcome of water scarcity and refers to scarcity in terms of quality and accessibility of water. Water stress may manifest in conflict over water resources, over-extraction, or poor health and disease.
Extreme water vulnerability: Extreme water vulnerability is the combination of the highest levels of physical water scarcity and lowest levels of drinking water service that affects a given population (surface water, unimproved or limited water service).
Water security: The capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of and acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability. Water insecurity occurs when any or all of these needs cannot be met.

Last year, people around the globe took to the streets to protest the vicious global pandemic of racism.
They recognized racism for what it is.
Dangerous.  Abhorrent.  Ugly.  And everywhere.
Racism is a deeply rooted global evil.
It transcends generations and contaminates societies.
It perpetuates inequality, oppression and marginalization.
We see racism in the pervasive discrimination suffered by people of African descent.
We see it in the injustices and oppression endured by indigenous peoples and other ethnic minorities.
We see it in the repugnant views of white supremacists and other extremist groups.
Wherever we see racism, we must condemn it without reservation, without hesitation, without qualification.
This year, the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination highlights the important role of youth, who have been in the forefront of the fight against racism.
Young people’s attitudes and behaviour will dictate the future shape and look of our societies.
So, I appeal to young people everywhere, as well as educators and leaders, to teach the world that all people are born equal.
Supremacy is an evil lie.
Racism kills.
On this day, and every day, let us work together to rid the world of the pernicious evil of racism so all may live in a world of peace, dignity and opportunity.

Humanity’s well-being is inextricably linked to the health of our planet.  Forests play a crucial role.
Forests filter the air we breathe and the water we drink.  They regulate our climate, absorbing one-third of the global greenhouse gases emitted each year.
Forests provide habitat to 80 per cent of all known terrestrial species, many of which are under threat.  Today, more than 1 million of the planet’s estimated 8 million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction.
Some 1.6 billion people depend directly on forests for food, shelter, energy, medicines and income.
Despite all that they provide, forest loss continues at an alarming rate.  We continue to lose 10 million hectares of forests, an area roughly the size of Iceland, every year.
Deforestation also increases the risks of infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics.
This year marks the beginning of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, which calls for action to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation of forests and other ecosystems.
If we fail to act now, we risk a point of no return.  But it is not too late to undo some of the damage we have caused.
The crises our planet faces require urgent action by all — governments, international and civil society organizations, the private sector, local authorities and individuals.
Indigenous peoples are leading the way.  They care for the Earth’s biodiversity and achieve conservation results with very few financial resources and little support.
On this International Day of Forests let us plant the seeds for a sustainable future by committing to restore and conserve our forests for the benefit of people and the planet.

UNDP Pakistan builds Gilgit Baltistan Judiciary’s capacity with Human Rights and Rule of Law trainings

Gilgit, 17 March 2021— Amid many other responsibilities, justice sector professionals are responsible for ensuring citizen’s their basic human rights. It is for this reason that UNDP Pakistan’s Amn-o-Insaf Programme organized two five-day trainings on Human Rights and Rule of Law for the District Judiciary of Gilgit Baltistan at the Judicial Academy, Gilgit. Held between 8 March to 17 March 2021 while observing strict Covid SOPs, the first round of the training was for judges from Gilgit Division while the second round will be held for judges from Skardu Division. Led by Professor Niaz. A. Shah from University of Hull and trained as a barrister at the Lincoln’s Inn, London, the target of these trainings was to strengthen the capacity of Gilgit Baltistan’s entire district judiciary.

Honourable Chief Justice GB Chief Court inaugurated the training and also the GB Judicial Academy. This will be the first training in the newly established Judicial Academy of Gilgit Baltistan. Judges from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Judiciary also delivered guest lectures via zoom/team.

The training focused on sensitising the District Judiciary on human rights and the rule of law and to enable judges to deliver human rights–based judgements protecting fundamental rights of people. The purpose was to sensitize judges on implementation of international human rights laws, independence of judiciary, the right to fair trial, children and women human rights and equality and non-discrimination in the justice system.

While highlighting the importance of Human Rights and a strong Rule of Law, Professor Niaz said countries and communities with strengthened rule of law give their citizens the stability of knowing that all rights are respected and protected. “Human Rights and Rule of Law are intertwined. There is no rule of law within societies if human rights are not protected and vice versa; human rights cannot be protected in societies without a strong rule of law. The rule of law is the implementation mechanism for human rights, turning them from a principle into a reality”.

This training on Human Rights and Rule of Law for Gilgit’s senior judiciary is a key component of UNDP Pakistan’s Amn-o-Insaf Programme that works with the government, rule of law & justice institutions and communities in promoting rule of law through provision of support to the justice and security sectors in four provinces of Pakistan, Islamabad Capital Territory, Gilgit Baltistan (GB) and AJ&K

The programme aims to promote an enabling environment, which will deepen the on-going efforts to secure peace and stabilization. Amn-o-Insaf is also assisting institutional and capacity development of rule of law institutions to ensure effective and speedy provision of justice and security services.

Disruptions in health services due to COVID-19 “may have contributed to an additional 239,000 child and maternal deaths in South Asia” - UN report

Health services must urgently be restored and strengthened to contain the pandemic’s impact on the most vulnerable families

Kathmandu/Islamabad, 17 March 2021: Drastic cuts in the availability and use of essential public health services across South Asia due to COVID-19 may have contributed to an estimated 228,000 additional child deaths in 2020, according to a new United Nations report. Around 11,000 additional maternal deaths are also expected.
Clinics and other health facilities have been closed and many vital health and nutrition programmes halted as the region battles to contain COVID-19 cases, which numbered 11 million by the end of 2020.
The report, commissioned by UNICEF and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), cites examples of the more severe service disruptions. They include an 80 per cent drop in the number of young children treated for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Nepal and Bangladesh, and a sharp drop in childhood immunizations in Pakistan and India.
“The fall-off of these critical services has had a devastating impact on the health and nutrition of the poorest families,” said UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia George Laryea-Adjei. “It is absolutely vital that these services are fully restored for children and mothers who are in desperate need of them, and that everything possible is done to ensure that people feel safe to use them.”
The report calls for making essential health services for pregnant women, adolescents and young infants a topmost priority. Strengthening supply chains for the delivery of vaccines and other essential childhood medicines is also vital.

“Maintaining essential health services is an important pillar of WHO’s COVID-19 response strategy,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director of the WHO South-East Asia Region. “Countries in the region have been focusing efforts on continuation and restoration of essential services, as disruption would only increase the risk of deaths from preventable causes.”

Some 420 million children in South Asia remain out of school due to pandemic control measures. The report warns that 4.5 million girls are likely to never return to school and are at particular risk due to deteriorating access to sexual and reproductive health and information services.

“Given the cultural and social context of South Asia, the suspension of these services is deepening inequalities and is likely to lead to an increase in the number of maternal and neonatal deaths,” said Bjorn Andersson, Asia-Pacific Regional Director of UNFPA. “There are also likely to be an additional 3.5 million unintended pregnancies in this region.”

Focusing on South Asia’s six most populous countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), the report notes that the increased levels of unemployment, poverty and food insecurity caused by the pandemic have further undermined public health.

“It is crucial that we ensure the continuity of essential services for women and children in Pakistan -- especially the most vulnerable and the hardest-to-reach,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “COVID-19-related disruptions have had a heavy impact on children’s access to essential services. UNICEF will continue to support the Government to respond to the pandemic and to build more resilient health and education systems that can reach all children.”

The report calls for cash transfer programmes for the poorest families. It welcomes the various national social safety net programmes put in place since the start of the pandemic, but notes that their full impact still needs to be evaluated.

Talking about Ehsaas ecosystem and how it deals with agriculture and food systems, she stated that the Ehsaas policy framework and strategy explicitly recognizes the work of rural women involved in agriculture. There are specific welfare initiatives to improve the livelihoods of tenant farmers. There is another policy under the Ehsaas framework that aims to build agriculture value chain that was prepared in consultation with FAO, she said.
FAO Representative a.i in Pakistan stated that communities within food systems are critical to global development and development within Pakistan. Financial equality, equality of empowerment, equality of opportunity and the equality of the right to benefit from the outputs of food systems is necessary for development impact and achievement of the SDGs.

Japan International Cooperation Agency and FAO join hands to enhance food and nutrition security of locust-affected smallholder farmers and control operations
ISLAMABAD 08 March 2021: Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has announced a contribution of USD 1.3 million to work by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to not only support pest control operations but also enhance the food and nutrition security of locust-affected smallholder farmers.
The announcement was made at a ceremony held in Islamabad. JICA Chief Representative in Pakistan, Furutu Shigeki, and ad interim Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Representative, Rebekah Bell, signed the project agreement.
To support the livelihoods of desert locust-affected farming communities and enhance the food security of smallholder farmers’ households, the project will work in Kharan district in Balochistan and Umerkot district of Sindh province. These districts were identified based on consultation with provincial agriculture departments and findings of Food Security and Livelihood Assessments.
This 13-month project will focus on enhancing food and nutrition security of vulnerable rural households with pregnant and lactating women through an integrated approach, which seeks to increase the quantity, quality and diversity of household food production, and includes an experiential nutrition education programme. About 18,370 people will directly benefit.
Meanwhile, locust surveillance and control activities will focus on building the capacity of the Department of Plant Protection to help it identify and control future locust outbreaks.
“As have East Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, Pakistan too has suffered the damage caused by desert locust swarms.  JICA recognizes the need for immediate assistance to Pakistan and implemented an emergency support to livelihoods of farmers affected by locust in October last year. In order to continue its assistance, JICA endeavors to restore livelihood support for farmers. We expect to strengthen locust control capacity and resilience in the medium to long term and the collaboration with FAO will contribute to achieving that goal,” said Furutu Shigeki.
JICA is currently promoting cooperation with development partners, and this project will further strengthen the FAO-JICA Memorandum of Cooperation, which was concluded in 2017. JICA is currently implementing agricultural and livestock technical cooperation project in Balochistan and Sindh provinces. Also, JICA has funded an agriculture and livelihood project being implemented by FAO in ex-FATA (Federally Administrated Tribal Areas) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. JICA intends to continue its work with FAO and other development partners to contribute to the development of the Pakistani agricultural sector by taking the best of its strengths.
Thanking JICA for its financial assistance and long-term partnership, FAO Representative a.i in Pakistan, Rebekah Bell said: "Through our collaboration with the governments of Balochistan and Sindh, this project will make a significant contribution to address food and nutrition insecurity of vulnerable rural households. Our research suggests that by increasing the quantity, quality and diversity of household food production that families are able to consume a healthier diet that will hopefully, in the longer term, contribute to the prevention of child stunting and wasting and improved food security. FAO has remained at the forefront of support to the Government of Pakistan in combating the desert locust invasion and strengthening the capabilities and capacities of institutions in desert locust surveillance and control operations.”

10 million additional girls at risk of child marriage due to COVID-19 – UNICEF
With 25 million child marriages averted in the last decade, UNICEF issues warning on International Women’s Day that these gains are now under serious threat
Photos and video available to download here
NEW YORK, 8 March 2021 – Ten million additional child marriages may occur before the end of the decade, threatening years of progress in reducing the practice, according to a new analysis released by UNICEF today.
COVID-19: A threat to progress against child marriage – released on International Women’s Day – warns that school closures, economic stress, service disruptions, pregnancy, and parental deaths due to the pandemic are putting the most vulnerable girls at increased risk of child marriage.
Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, 100 million girls were at risk of child marriage in the next decade, despite significant reductions in several countries in recent years. In the last ten years, the proportion of young women globally who were married as children had decreased by 15 per cent, from nearly 1 in 4 to 1 in 5, the equivalent of some 25 million marriages averted, a gain that is now under threat.
“COVID-19 has made an already difficult situation for millions of girls even worse. Shuttered schools, isolation from friends and support networks, and rising poverty have added fuel to a fire the world was already struggling to put out. But we can and we must extinguish child marriage,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “International Women’s Day is a key moment to remind ourselves of what these girls have to lose if we do not act urgently – their education, their health, and their futures.”
Girls who marry in childhood face immediate and lifelong consequences. They are more likely to experience domestic violence and less likely to remain in school. Child marriage increases the risk of early and unplanned pregnancy, in turn increasing the risk of maternal complications and mortality. The practice can also isolate girls from family and friends and exclude them from participating in their communities, taking a heavy toll on their mental health and well-being.
COVID-19 is profoundly affecting the lives of girls. Pandemic-related travel restrictions and physical distancing make it difficult for girls to access the health care, social services and community support that protect them from child marriage, unwanted pregnancy and gender-based violence. As schools remain closed, girls are more likely to drop out of education and not return. Job losses and increased economic insecurity may also force families to marry their daughters to ease financial burdens.
Worldwide, an estimated 650 million girls and women alive today were married in childhood, with about half of those occurring in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India and Nigeria. To off-set the impacts of COVID-19 and end the practice by 2030 – the target set out in the Sustainable Development Goals – progress must be significantly accelerated.
“One year into the pandemic, immediate action is needed to mitigate the toll on girls and their families,” added Fore. “By reopening schools, implementing effective laws and policies, ensuring access to health and social services – including sexual and reproductive health services – and providing comprehensive social protection measures for families, we can significantly reduce a girl’s risk of having her childhood stolen through child marriage.”

Notes to Editors
The projections presented are the result of a statistical model that is built on existing information on the rates and demographics of child marriage, as well as historical information on the effects of educational disruption, economic shocks, and programme efficacy in countries where most child marriages worldwide occur.

Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Ghada Waly:
Message for International Women’s Day
8 March 2021
KYOTO, 8 March (UN Information Service) – To achieve justice for women, we need more women in justice.
Increases in women’s representation and leadership in law enforcement and the judiciary have been linked to more investigations into crimes against women, better policing outcomes, and successful victim-centred approaches. They have also enabled systemic changes, including lower rates of violence, and greater integrity through diversity, which is key to disrupting corrupt practices.
These are major victories for public trust and effective institutions. When women lead, we all win.
But around the world, women are outnumbered by men in the justice and security sectors, accounting for as little as 6 per cent of law enforcement officers in some regions.
The COVID pandemic has shown us that entrenched inequalities make our societies more vulnerable in a crisis.
It is time for a reset. We need to empower more women to lead.
In the UN Crime Congress Kyoto Declaration, governments have pledged to remove impediments to the advancement of women within criminal justice systems.
To put this commitment into action, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime is working with women judges, prosecutors and law enforcement officers in close to 60 countries, helping build networks of women professionals and supporting their growth.
We provide targeted training and mentoring to the next generation of women leaders in criminal justice institutions.
UNODC also assists Member States in addressing challenges that are holding women and girls back, from gender-based violence and human trafficking risks, to a lack of access to drug use prevention and treatment. We promote gender-responsive approaches in tackling organized crime and corruption, preventing terrorism, and ensuring the rights and rehabilitation of people in prison.
Within our own Office, I am proud that we achieved overall gender parity last year, and are working towards parity at all staff levels, in line with my personal commitment as an International Gender Champion.
On International Women’s Day, I stand with women, and fight for women, so they can rise and lead in all areas, to build forward from the COVID crisis, for justice, and a fairer future for all.

WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME AND THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN CELEBRATE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY
Lasbela, Balochistan – To celebrate the International Women’s Day, WFP, in partnership with the Government, is organizing more than 20 events across Pakistan under this year’s theme, Women in Leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world.
In Balochistan, in collaboration with the government, partners and communities, WFP has been supporting the most vulnerable people to get through the pandemic. In districts Lasbela and Panjgur, WFP has assisted 6,987 vulnerable households, out of which 4,937 households have received Rs. 7,500 per month for six months under the unconditional cash transfer programme; and 2,050 households have received an essential food basket. The support has helped poor households, especially women and children, meet the basic food and nutritional needs.
During a visit to projects in Lasbela District, WFP Country Director Chris Kaye observed;  “Hunger and malnutrition is on the rise across the world as COVID-19 is compounding vulnerability of the most marginalized. The situation in Pakistan is no different and it is women who are disproportionately affected and are expected to carry the burden. In 2020,  WFP assisted 2 million Pakistani people suffering from hunger and malnutrition, 55% of whom were women/girls.”
Addressing the frontline female health workers at the site a newly established Nashonuma Facilitation Centre at Jam Ghulam Qadir Government Hospital Hub Lasbela in Balochistan, the WFP Country Director applauded the tireless efforts of the female doctors and nurses in the COVID-19 pandemic response. “The contributions made by frontline health workers have been instrumental in the country’s fight against the pandemic. While serving their communities, they put their own health and wellbeing at risk. This Women’s Day, let’s recognize their sacrifices and applaud their dedication and achievements” he declared.
As the implementing partner for the Government’s Ehsaas Stunting Prevention Project, WFP is supporting the establishment of Nashonuma Facilitation Centers to help combat chronic malnutrition (stunting) in women and children. By the end of February 2021, 50 facilitation centers will be operational across 10 districts in Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Punjab.  The centers will provide pregnant and lactating women training on breast feeding, hygiene practices, immunization, antenatal/postnatal care and the importance of diversified and nutritious diets. The woman will receive locally produced specialized nutritious food to boost the nutritional status for themselves and for their babies.
The WFP team also met with the local women beneficiaries in Uthal Village in district Lasbela. The women spoke about how WFP’s assistance had helped them overcome the burden caused by COVID-19 and enabled them to access the food needed to support their families.
Supporting women is essential element in the fight against hunger and poverty.  When women and girls have better access to education, information, resources, services, decision-making and economic opportunities, the result is increased food security and improved nutrition for themselves, their families, their communities and their country. WFP is committed to playing a role in promoting equal and meaningful participation of women in decision-making processes at all levels.

ITC- PRESS RELEASE: Recognizing female farmers on International Women’s Day
Recognizing female farmers on International Women’s Day
A panel discussion was held in Karachi to celebrate International Women’s Day 2021 in Karachi. Growth for Rural Advancement and Sustainable Progress (GRASP) with Sindh Research and Development Foundation organized the event. Agriculture Minister Sindh Mr. Ismail Rahoo, Minister Women Development Ms. Shehla Raza, and women’s rights activist Ms. Nazo Dharejo were some of the attendees along with rural women, and representatives from government, development sector, academia, and think tanks.
GRASP, funded by the European Union and implemented by the International Trade Centre, is working to improve the business environment of small and medium enterprises, and small holder farmers in Sindh and Balochistan.
Rural women in Sindh have been a particular focus of GRASP for its COVID-19 emergency response, with trainings aiming to furnish their skills in agriculture, horticulture and livestock, enterprise development, and e-commerce. Their linkages with local markets are being developed through trainings, connecting them to buyers for value added products of milk, dates, and tomatoes.
Female farmers presented the by-products they developed, and received cell phones from GRASP project during the event, which will be used to connect them to wholesale buyers, markets, and enable them to sell their produce online.
The three panels discussed government focus on enterprise development of women and the development of grants for them. The role of men in supporting women was highlighted, where they can be allies and create spaces for women at workplaces. Making up 67 percent of the labor force, women farmer’s skills need to be enhanced. Currently, women in agriculture are in labor only, their representation in policy making and at decisions is needed.
GRASP is working to create gender-inclusive employment and income opportunities in the rural areas through targeted support to both the public and private sectors. Gender inclusiveness in value chain development will foster economic opportunities for women in horticulture and livestock.

International Women’s Day Message from the Resident Coordinator, United Nations Pakistan
This International Women’s Day comes one year after the declaration of Corona Virus as a global pandemic. The Covid pandemic has been hard on everyone but has weighed doubly on women.  The pandemic has deepened economic and social stress, women have lost their incomes, working mothers have born the extra burden of educating children at home and caring for older family members, and restrictions in movement have exacerbated intimate partner violence.
One of the most heartening experiences during this hard year has been to witness the vital leadership role of women in Pakistan, including my United Nations colleagues, in fighting this disease. And on this eighth of March 2021, International Women’s day, it is to them I wish to pay tribute.
Across this great country I have been privileged to meet women leading and contributing in a myriad ways, Federal and Provincial ministers leading the socio economic and medical response, local administrators running districts, scientists, doctors, nurses, midwives, business women, Policewomen caring for the abused, women working in NGOs and the countless women looking after their families and trying to make ends meet in difficult times.
Over this last year the United Nations worked closely in support of the government of Pakistan in the response against the disease, in every area of our work, medical and socio economic, women were in a leading role. Women have led in bringing the COVAX vaccination initiative to Pakistan; I have seen female colleagues working on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) to keep health professionals and facilities safe, and others increasing testing services across the country through technical support in Laboratories and Diagnostics, and initiatives on disabilities and assistive technology. In the socioeconomic area female colleagues have led on social protection, and working to make schools safe to reopen and in supporting to homebased workers.
And at times I have glimpsed and heard the daily challenges that their choice to serve brings; juggling a zoom call with a toddler that needs attention right now, being on the other side of the world from their children as they start out at university, and the worries for a sick parent in another city maybe another country.
This last year has been hard for all of us, and during this time women have once again led and contributed to the response and to our society, as the women of Pakistan and my female colleagues have demonstrated. But we have to recognize that society puts many obstacles in their path, girls are not offered the same chance to go to school, many careers and profession remain dominated by men and sometimes family pressure holds women back. In the coming year we must continue to remove these obstacles, we need to see more girls in primary school, in secondary school and in tertiary education, women need to have the same access to internet and all the benefits of the information age, wherever a woman lives she must have the same access to health services, and we all need to work towards equal job and career opportunities for women.
As we work together to help our society recover from COVID19 our efforts must also aim to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

UNHCR - PRESS RELEASE : Government to issue smartcards for Afghan refugees under verification exercise
Government to issue smartcards for Afghan refugees under verification exercise
ISLAMABAD, 2 March 2021 – The Government of Pakistan announced the issuance of new smartcards for Afghan refugees who are Proof of Registration (PoR) cardholders.
The Chief Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CCAR)/Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON) and the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), with the support of UNHCR, will start the exercise, “Document Renewal and Information Verification Exercise” (DRIVE), from 1 April 2021.
During this six-month exercise, NADRA will verify and update the data of registered Afghan refugees who are in possession of a PoR card with an expiry date of 31 December 2015. The initiative takes place within the framework of the Support Platform for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees, fostering renewed partnerships and stronger strategic linkages between humanitarian and development investments.
In addition to validating existing data, the verification will record Afghan refugees’ skill sets, level of education, socio-economic circumstances and sources of income, allowing better targeted health, education and livelihood support in Pakistan and in the Priority Areas of Return and Reintegration in Afghanistan.
As many as 40 DRIVE centres are being set up across Pakistan. Upon verification of their data, these Afghan refugees will receive new PoR smartcards. The new smartcards will provide Afghan refugees with renewed proof of their identity, enhancing their protection in Pakistan, and will help facilitate identity authentication making access to services faster, safer and more effective.
“This is a long-overdue exercise. It’s been 10 years since the last such initiative. It’s crucial at this juncture to update the data of Afghan refugees. I commend the international community for supporting this important exercise,” said Mr. Saleem Khan, the Chief Commissioner for Afghan Refugees in Pakistan.
The UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Noriko Yoshida, appreciated the Government for this initiative to help improve the lives of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
The designated NADRA Spokesperson said that the multi-biometric PoR cards will be issued as part of this exercise. Specialized staff and state-of-art infrastructure will be utilized.
Pakistan hosts 1.4 million Afghan refugees who hold PoR cards.

UNDP, United States Government, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government strengthen justice sector capacity
Islamabad, 2 March 2021—Successful governance institutions have systems and processes in place that contribute greatly towards their success. For this reason, on March 2-3, 2021, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan organized a two-day consultative workshop in Islamabad on Standard Operating Procedures(SOPs) for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Prosecution Academy.
Funded by the United States Government through U.S. Embassy Pakistan’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) section, with 50-kanal land allocated by the KP Government, the KP Prosecution Academy will train prosecutors, lawyers, and staff of other rule of law institutions on various criminal laws and procedures.  Additional training topics will focus on women and juvenile protection laws and procedures, criminal trials, the right to a fair trial, anti-terrorism laws, anti-fraud laws, and cybercrimes, among others.  Simultaneously, participants will also be trained on developing a work ethic, communication, and advocacy skills integral to their roles.
The KP Prosecution Academy will have a dedicated women’s wing with a hostel and a daycare facility to create an enabling environment for women prosecutors and encourage more women’s representation in the legal profession. Established in Peshawar District at Mira Kachori, the academy will have a training facility, administration block, and a residential compound. It will be fully functional by May 2021 with training and meeting halls, monitoring and research rooms, auditorium, library and computer labs, a dedicated residential area, gymnasium, and recreational lounges.
In addition to its construction, UNDP, with INL funding, is providing support to set up a structured training system, which includes developing a training policy and implementation plan, comprehensive training curriculum for the basic and specialized training, e-learning centre, and SOPs.
The two-day consultative workshop allowed senior prosecutors to learn about the functions of the KP Prosecution Academy, personnel roles and responsibilities, various communication protocols, and the criteria and mechanisms to ensure a safe and healthy working environment.
Director- General of Prosecution Mr. Mukhtiar Ahmad, INL Pakistan Program Officer Ms. Cristian Martinez-LuSane, and UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative Knut Ostby delivered remarks on the first day of the workshop.  Mr. Ahmad thanked INL and UNDP and said this initiative would play a monumental role in strengthening the criminal justice system in the region: “I am certain that this academy will build the capacity and skills of KP prosecutors and enable them to play their part in strengthening the rule of law in Pakistan.”
UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative Knut Ostby thanked INL Pakistan for being a consistent partner and the KP Government for its continued support: “With the right infrastructural support, enhanced capacity within the rule of law sector, and more gender-inclusive institutions, the rule of law sector in Pakistan is headed in the right direction.”
Acting INL Pakistan Director Ms. Erika Zielke appreciated UNDP Pakistan’s efforts to make this project a success: “INL is proud to partner with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Prosecution Service and UNDP to strengthen the rule of law in the province. We are certain that the Prosecution Academy will play a significant role in building capacity and skills of prosecutors in the years ahead.”
Director of Administration Prosecution Directorate Mr. Atiq-ur-Rehman, a participant in the workshop said that the experience has helped him understand how institutions are made and how they operate successfully. “This understanding and knowledge will be useful throughout the course of my career as I leave it with a better understanding of my line of work.”

COVID-19: Schools for more than 168 million children globally have been completely closed for almost a full year, says UNICEF
UNICEF unveils ‘Pandemic Classroom’ at United Nations Headquarters in New York to call attention to the need for governments to prioritise the reopening of schools
NEW YORK, 3 March 2021 – Schools for more than 168 million children globally have been completely closed for almost an entire year due to COVID-19 lockdowns, according to new data released today by UNICEF. Furthermore, around 214 million children globally – or 1 in 7 – have missed more than three-quarters of their in-person learning.
The analysis of school closure report notes that 14 countries worldwide have remained largely closed since March 2020 to February 2021. Two-thirds of those countries are in Latin America and the Caribbean, affecting nearly 98 million schoolchildren. Of the 14 countries, Panama has kept schools closed for the most days, followed by El Salvador, Bangladesh, and Bolivia.
“As we approach the one-year mark of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are again reminded of the catastrophic education emergency worldwide lockdowns have created. With every day that goes by, children unable to access in-person schooling fall further and further behind, with the most marginalized paying the heaviest price,” said Henrietta Fore UNICEF Executive Director. “We cannot afford to move into year two of limited or even no in-school learning for these children. No effort should be spared to keep schools open, or prioritise them in reopening plans.”

*Note: Countries were identified based on the number of instruction days since 11 March 2020, the reference date for when schools were fully closed, to February 2021. The data reflect school closure status over the past 11 months. In cases where countries had less than 10 days of fully opened schooling and less than 12 days of partially open schooling, they were deemed as remaining closed for almost a year of instruction time. The analysis covers from the pre-primary education to the upper secondary education.
School closures have devastating consequences for children’s learning and wellbeing. The most vulnerable children and those unable to access remote learning are at an increased risk of never returning to the classroom, and even being forced into child marriage or child labor. According to latest data by UNESCO, more than 888 million children worldwide continue to face disruptions to their education due to full and partial school closures.
The majority of schoolchildren worldwide rely on their schools as a place where they can interact with their peers, seek support, access health and immunization services and a nutritious meal. The longer schools remain closed, the longer children are cut off from these critical elements of childhood.
To call attention to the education emergency and raise awareness about the need for governments to keep schools open, or prioritise them in reopening plans, UNICEF today unveiled ‘Pandemic Classroom,’ a model classroom made up of 168 empty desks, each desk representing the million children living in countries where schools have been almost entirely closed – a solemn reminder of the classrooms in every corner of the world that remain empty.
“This classroom represents the millions of centers of learning that have sat empty—many for almost the entire year. Behind each empty chair hangs an empty backpack—a placeholder for a child’s deferred potential,” said Fore. “We do not want shuttered doors and closed buildings to obscure the fact that our children’s futures are being put on indefinite pause. This installation is a message to governments: we must prioritize reopening schools, and we must prioritize reopening them better than they were before.”
As students return to their classrooms, they will need support to readjust and catch up on their learning. School reopening plans must incorporate efforts to recover children’s lost education. UNICEF urges governments to prioritise the unique needs of every student, with comprehensive services covering remedial learning, health and nutrition, and mental health and protection measures in schools to nurture children and adolescents’ development and wellbeing. UNICEF’s Framework for Reopening Schools, issued jointly with UNESCO, UNHCR, WFP and the World Bank, offers practical advice for national and local authorities.

COVAX PUBLISHES FIRST ROUND OF ALLOCATIONS
Geneva/Oslo/New York, 3 March 2021 – The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO), as co-leads of the COVAX initiative for equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines, alongside key delivery partner UNICEF, are pleased to publish COVAX’s first round of allocations.
Following from the publication of an interim distribution forecast, and based on current knowledge of supply availability, this first round of allocations provides information on provision of doses of the AstraZeneca(AZ)/Oxford vaccine to COVAX Facility participants, through May 2021.
This first round of allocation outlines delivery of doses of the AZ/Oxford vaccine – manufactured by AstraZeneca (AZ) and COVISHIELD, licensed to and manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII/AZ) – to 142 Facility participants. Participants not listed have either exercised their rights to opt-out of this vaccine, wish to transfer allocated doses to AMC participants, are AMC-eligible but have not joined the AMC, have voluntarily delayed receipt of doses and communicated this intent ahead of allocation, or have not met financial requirements.
This list will be updated by the end of the week to provide indicative timelines for the supply of these doses, split into Feb-March and April-May. These timelines are dependent on a variety of factors including national regulatory requirements, availability of supply, and fulfilment of other criteria such as validated national deployment and vaccination plans (NDVPs) from AMC participants, indemnification & liability agreements, and export and import authorisations.
Deliveries for this round of allocations has already begun, with India, Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire receiving doses of the SII/AZ vaccine. Both Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire began vaccination campaigns utilising these doses on Monday. Further deliveries are underway for this week, and as readiness criteria are fulfilled and doses become available, will continue on a rolling basis over the coming months.
In addition to this first round of allocations, an exceptional distribution of 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, anticipated for delivery in Q1 2021, was announced in early February.
Further allocation rounds for vaccines in the COVAX portfolio will be announced in due course.
The list of first round allocations is available here.
Notes to editors
About COVAX
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.
CEPI is focused on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio: investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.
Gavi is focused on procurement and delivery for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. The COVAX Facility is the global pooled procurement mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines through which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all 190 participating economies, using an allocation framework formulated by WHO. The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies and providing volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates. The Gavi COVAX AMC is the financing mechanism that will support the participation of 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Facility, enabling access to donor-funded doses of safe and effective vaccines. Gavi is coordinating and fundraising for the COVAX AMC and its no-fault compensation mechanism, and funding UNICEF procurement of vaccines as well as partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery, including support cold chain equipment, technical assistance, syringes, vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery. UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) will be acting as procurement coordinators for the COVAX Facility, helping deliver vaccines to COVAX AMC participants and others.
WHO has multiple roles within COVAX: It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL) / prequalification programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states. It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. WHO leads, together with UNICEF, the Country Readiness and Delivery workstream, which provides support to countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines. Along with Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional, and country-level, the CRD workstream provides tools, guidance, monitoring, and on the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines. Along with COVAX partners, WHO has developed a no-fault compensation scheme as part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments.
UNICEF is leveraging its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world and working with manufacturers and partners on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as freight, logistics and storage. UNICEF already procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunization and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund, UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19 vaccines for COVAX. In addition, UNICEF, Gavi and WHO are working with governments around the clock to ensure that countries are ready to receive the vaccines, with appropriate cold chain equipment in place and health workers trained to dispense them. UNICEF is also playing a lead role in efforts to foster trust in vaccines, delivering vaccine confidence communications and tracking and addressing misinformation around the world.
About CEPI
CEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017, to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI has moved with great urgency and in coordination with WHO in response to the emergence of COVID-19. CEPI has initiated ten partnerships to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus. The programmes are leveraging rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI as well as new partnerships.
Before the emergence of COVID-19, CEPI’s priority diseases included Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya virus. CEPI also invested in platform technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (Disease X).

FAO and Forest Department Improving Livelihoods through Restoration of Chilgoza Pine Forest in Balochistan
Quetta – Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  Representative in Pakistan a.i. Ms. Rebekah Bell and Secretary Forest and Wildlife Mr. Mohammad Siddique Mandokhel inaugurated plantation campaign by planting chilgoza pine saplings under the project “Reversing Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Chilgoza Pine Forest in Pakistan” in District Sherani, Balochistan. The project is funded by the Global Environment Facility and implemented under the oversight of the Ministry of Climate Change. Furthermore, the project is additionally contributing 23 million trees to the Ten Billion Trees Programme of MoCC.
The Chilgoza project in Balochistan is working to restore and protect a unique and threatened ecosystem – chilgoza pine forests –situated in district Sherani along Takht e Suleman range at elevations of 6000 to 7000 feet above sea level. These forests, which include a mix of chilgoza pine trees as well as other species of coniferous trees hold tremendous importance from both ecological and economic perspectives.
FAO Representative a.i in Pakistan, Rebekah Bell said that the FAO under GEF funded Chilgoza project, with the support of forest department is working to support sustainable management of the pine nut ecosystem through number of initiatives to conserve pine nut forest in Pakistan. She said that the Chilgoza project is working with local communities to enable them to capture a greater share of the revenue from post-harvest processing of the chilgoza nuts. Provision of Chilgoza processing unit, harvesting toolkits and development of local processing and value-added capacity will provide further incentives to sustainably manage the chilgoza ecosystem in Balochistan.
Speaking on the occasion, Secretary Forest and Wildlife Mr. Mohammad Siddique Mandokhel said that for centuries, our ancestors have protected the natural ecosystems by sustainably using and managing natural resources, but it is unfortunate that we are losing our precious natural resources due to our negligence. He further stated that the Forest Department is working on conservation and development of natural resources and sustainable usage through stakeholders participation to ensure healthy environment, this includes management of existing forests, management of watershed to conserve soil and water, management of rangelands to boost production of forage and livestock, and education of public and other departments for tree plantation and provision of technical & advisory services.
Assistant FAO Representative Program, Aamir Irshad said that the project will continue to contribute by improving the environment, enhance resilience and creating livelihoods opportunities in Balochistan. He also urged the local community to plant maximum saplings to make the country green and said that it is a responsibility of everyone to restore the sustainable action needed to protect our natural resources and make the tree plantation campaign successful.
Natural Resource Management Advisor of FAO, Faizul Bari said that FAO with the support of Forest Department is conserving pine nut forests in Balochistan. He said that the Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) sites are being conserved with the help of local communities by signing terms of partnerships with them. Together with the Forest Department, FAO has employed care takers for ANR sites. These care takers ‘Nighebans” are taking appropriate actions to guard their assigned ANR sites from grazing and controlling illicit cutting of trees.
The GEF funded project contributes to the restoration, protection and sustainable management of Chilgoza pine forests to provide global environmental benefits as well as enhanced resilience and livelihoods to local stakeholders. The project focuses on the improved and sustainable management of Chilgoza forests while strengthening the National and Provincial Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) Policies and Legal Framework.

UNAIDS - PRESS RELEASE : UNAIDS welcomes the United Nations General Assembly ‎decision to hold a high-level meeting on HIV and AIDS in 2021‎
UNICEF - PRESS RELEASE :  UNICEF signs COVID-19 vaccine supply agreement with AstraZeneca
UNAIDS welcomes the United Nations General Assembly ‎decision to hold a high-level meeting on HIV and AIDS in 2021‎
GENEVA, 25 February 2021—UNAIDS welcomes the United ‎Nations General Assembly decision for a high-level meeting on HIV ‎and AIDS to take place between 8 and 10 June 2021. The high-‎level meeting will review the progress made in reducing the impact ‎of HIV since the last United Nations General Assembly high-level ‎meeting on HIV and AIDS in 2016 and the General Assembly ‎expects to adopt a new political declaration to guide the future ‎direction of the response. The high-level meeting will take place as ‎the world marks 40 years since the first case of AIDS was reported ‎and 25 years of UNAIDS.‎
‎“World leaders must seize the opportunity offered by this new ‎United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting on HIV and ‎AIDS to maintain their focus and commitment on ending AIDS as a ‎public health threat as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable ‎Development,” said Winnie Byanyima, UNAIDS Executive Director. ‎‎“The AIDS epidemic is unfinished business and must be ended for ‎everyone everywhere, including for young women and adolescent ‎girls and for other groups of people disproportionately affected by ‎HIV. The right to health belongs to all of us.”‎
Progress towards ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health ‎threat by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals has ‎been highly uneven and the global goals for 2020 adopted in the ‎‎2016 United Nations Political Declaration on Ending AIDS were not ‎met. Stigma and discrimination, the marginalization and ‎criminalization of entire communities and a lack of access to health, ‎education and other essential services continue to fuel the ‎epidemic. Women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa and key ‎populations (gay men and other men who have sex with men, sex ‎workers, transgender people, people who inject drugs and people in ‎prison) and their partners globally continue to be disproportionately ‎affected by the HIV epidemic.
UNAIDS is currently developing a new global AIDS strategy for ‎‎2021–2026 through a process that is inclusive of all stakeholders in ‎the AIDS response. The final draft strategy will be considered for ‎adoption by the UNAIDS Programme Coordinating Board in March ‎‎2021. The new global AIDS strategy will include new targets to ‎ensure that no one is left behind in ending AIDS, wherever they live ‎and whoever they are. By achieving these targets, the number of ‎people newly infected with HIV would fall to 370 000 by 2025, and ‎the number of people dying from AIDS-related illnesses would be ‎reduced to 250 000 in 2025.‎
Even the gains already made against HIV are threatened by the ‎disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The high-level ‎meeting creates an opportunity to ensure that the world bolsters the ‎resiliency of the HIV response to date, commits to rapid recovery ‎post-COVID-19 and applies the lessons learned from the colliding ‎epidemics of HIV and COVID-19 to create more resilient societies ‎and health systems that are ready to meet future health challenges.‎
‎“The AIDS response has taught us that global solidarity is critical to ‎making sustained progress against the impact of health threats like ‎COVID-19,” said Ms Byanyima. “There must be concerted ‎international efforts to reduce inequalities between countries and ‎within them to strengthen the world’s capacity to absorb and defeat ‎future global health challenges that put lives and livelihoods at risk ‎everywhere.”‎

UNICEF signs COVID-19 vaccine supply agreement with AstraZeneca
COPENHAGEN/NEW YORK, 26 February 2021 – UNICEF and AstraZeneca this week signed a long-term agreement for the supply of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca on behalf of the COVAX Facility.
Through the supply agreement, UNICEF, along with procurement partners including the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), will have access to up to 170 million doses of vaccines for around 85 countries. This is the third such agreement for COVID-19 vaccines, following previously announced agreements with Pfizer and the Serum Institute of India.
The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine received WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) on 15 February.
Deliveries of the vaccine  are planned to begin in the first quarter of 2021, in line with the COVAX Allocation Framework that take into consideration several factors including country readiness, national regulatory authorizations and completed contractual provisions, as well as operating and supply considerations.
The goal of the COVAX Facility is to ensure that safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines are rapidly available and affordable to all countries around the world, regardless of income level.
The supply agreement will enable access to 170 million doses secured under the COVAX Facility’s Advance Purchase Agreement (APA) with AstraZeneca, which will be available throughout 2021.
On 11 February, UNICEF announced the signing of an agreement with Pfizer for the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine through 2021, following on from an agreement with the Serum Institute of India to access two vaccines through technology transfer from AstraZeneca which has been granted WHO EUL  and Novavax, which is subject to the approval of the vaccine by WHO.
The COVAX Facility, co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, together with UNICEF, aims to provide at least 2 billion doses of approved COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021, enabling the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
REMARKS TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON “ADDRESSING CLIMATE-RELATED SECURITY RISKS TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY THROUGH MITIGATION AND RESILIENCE BUILDING”
23 February 2021
[As delivered]
Mr. President, Excellencies,
I thank the British Presidency for convening this debate and for your invitation to brief on a subject of grave concern.
The climate emergency is the defining issue of our time.
The last decade was the hottest in human history. Carbon dioxide levels are at record highs, and wildfires, cyclones, floods, and droughts are the new normal. These shocks not only damage the environment on which we depend; they also weaken our political, economic and social systems.
The science is clear: we need to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.
And our duty is even clearer: we need to protect the people and communities that are being hit by climate disruption.
We must step up preparations for the escalating implications of the climate crisis for international peace and security.
Mr. President,
Climate disruption is a crisis amplifier and multiplier.
Where climate change dries up rivers, reduces harvests, destroys critical infrastructure, and displaces communities, it exacerbates the risks of instability and conflict.
A study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute found that eight of the ten countries hosting the largest multilateral peace operations in 2018 were in areas highly exposed to climate change.
The impacts of this crisis are greatest where fragility and conflicts have weakened coping mechanisms; where people depend on natural capital like forests and fish stocks for their livelihoods; and where women – who bear the greatest burden of the climate emergency – do not enjoy equal rights.
In Afghanistan, for example, where 40 percent of the workforce is engaged in farming, reduced harvests push people into poverty and food insecurity, leaving them susceptible to recruitment by criminal gangs and armed groups.
Across West Africa and the Sahel, more than 50 million people depend on rearing livestock for survival. Changes in grazing patterns have contributed to growing violence and conflict between pastoralists and farmers.
In Darfur, low rainfall and recurrent droughts are increasing food insecurity and competition for resources and we are seeing the result. The consequences are particularly devastating for women and girls, who are forced to walk farther to collect water, putting them at greater risk of sexual and gender-based violence.
Vulnerability to climate risks is also correlated with income inequality.
In other words, the poorest suffer most.
Unless we protect those most exposed and susceptible to climate-related impacts, we can expect them to become even more marginalized, and their grievances to be reinforced.
High levels of inequality, that climate change enhances, can weaken social cohesion and lead to discrimination, scapegoating, rising tensions and unrest, increasing the risk of conflict.
Those who are already being left behind will be left even farther behind.
Climate disruption is already driving displacement across the world.
In some small island nations in the Pacific, entire communities have been forced to relocate, with terrible implications for their livelihoods, culture and heritage.
The forced movement of larger numbers of people around the world will clearly increase the potential for conflict and insecurity beyond their suffering.
When I was High Commissioner for Refugees, I spent time with people who had been uprooted by the impact of climate change, in the Horn of Africa, Darfur, the Sahel and elsewhere.
Listening to their stories, I understood the deep suffering and trauma of families forced to abandon homes and land that had been theirs for generations.
Mr. President,
Much more needs to be done to address the specific risks the climate crisis poses to peace and security.
I see four priority areas.
First, we need a greater focus on prevention through strong, ambitious climate action.
We must get the world on track to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and avoid climate catastrophe.
We must create a truly global coalition to commit to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century.
And we must mobilize a decade of transformation through a successful COP26 in Glasgow. That requires all Member States to present, well before November, ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions with targets that will allow us to cut global emissions by 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels.
We are also asking all companies, cities and financial institutions to prepare concrete and credible decarbonization plans.
We still have a long way to go, and we look to the major emitters to lead by example in the coming months. This is a credibility test of their commitment to people and planet.
It is the only way we will keep the 1.5-degree goal within reach.
Second, we need immediate actions to protect countries, communities and people from increasingly frequent and severe climate impacts.
We need a breakthrough on adaptation and resilience, which means dramatically raising the level of investments.
All donors and multilateral and national Development Banks must increase the share of adaptation and resilience finance to at least 50 per cent of their climate finance support. And we must make these funds accessible to those on the frontlines of the climate crisis.
Developed countries must keep their pledge of channeling $100 billion annually to the Global South. They have already missed the deadline of 2020.
We need to scale up early warning systems and early action on climate-related crises, from droughts and storms to the emergence of zoonotic diseases.
We also need stronger social protection to support those impacted.
These actions must start now, with transformative policies as we emerge from the pandemic.
Economic and financial systems must incorporate climate risk into financial analysis, so that it is captured in business models and investment decisions.
We must invest in renewable energy and green infrastructure.
In short, we must close the finance gap by increasing support to the countries and communities that are suffering the worst impacts of the climate crisis.
That support must reach women and girls, who bear the brunt of the climate crisis; and constitute eighty percent of those displaced by climate change.
Third, we need to embrace a concept of security that puts people at its centre.
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the devastation that so-called non-traditional security threats can cause, on a global scale.
Preventing and addressing the poverty, food insecurity and displacement caused by climate disruption contributes to sustaining peace and reducing the risk of conflict.
The Nobel Committee recognized this when it awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the World Food Programme last year.
Respect for human rights, particularly women’s rights, the rule of law, inclusion and diversity, are fundamental to solving the climate crisis and creating more peaceful and stable societies.
The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals are the global blueprint for action.

UNICEF begins shipping syringes for the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines under COVAX
100,000 syringes will arrive in Maldives, with more countries to receive imminent deliveries for rollout of COVAX Facility vaccines
NEW YORK, 23 February 2021 – UNICEF has sent 100,000 syringes and 1,000 safety boxes for COVID-19 vaccinations to the Maldives by air freight from UNICEF’s humanitarian warehouse in Dubai—part of the first wave of COVID-19-related syringe shipments to begin rolling out in the coming days. Others in the first wave of shipments include Côte d'Ivoire and São Tomé and Príncipe.

The 0.5 ml syringes and safety boxes are expected to arrive in Malé, Maldives on Tuesday. Over the next few weeks, UNICEF will ship more than 14.5 million 0.5 ml and 0.3 ml auto-disable syringes to more than 30 countries. While the 0.5 ml syringes are meant for use with the Serum Institute of India/AstraZeneca vaccine, the 0.3 ml ones are to be used with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
“In this global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, syringes are as vital as the vaccine itself,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “It is critical to have adequate supplies of syringes already in place in every country before the vaccine arrives so that the vaccine can be administered safely. This would allow immunization to start immediately and help turn the tide on this terrible virus.”
The countries that will receive syringes in this initial tranche are from those included in the COVAX indicative distribution and that have put in requests to UNICEF to supply syringes. These shipments will support the country rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, and is part of work by the COVAX Facility to provide vaccines to all participating countries.
The 0.5 ml syringes are being dispatched from UNICEF’s humanitarian warehouse in Dubai, while the 0.3 ml & 2 ml syringes will be transported directly from a manufacturer in Spain. The consignments will also include safety boxes for the safe disposal of syringes.
Both syringes are of the auto-disable type, which means they cannot be used again after a single dose of vaccine has been administered. This reduces the risk of infection from blood-borne diseases as a result of syringe re-use.
In all, UNICEF will be supplying up to 1 billion syringes and 10 million safety boxes to countries in 2021 to ensure they are ready for COVID-19 vaccinations. In order to meet the demand for these vital supplies, UNICEF created a stockpile of almost half a billion syringes in its warehouses in Copenhagen and Dubai in preparation for the broader rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in 82 low- and lower middle-income countries.
UNICEF has been working with airlines, logistics operators and freight forwarders to ensure the syringes are treated as priority freight, whether they are being shipped direct from a manufacturer or from UNICEF warehouses to the destination country’s port of entry. Although the first deliveries will be transported by air, most of the syringes and safety boxes will be transported by sea due to the large amount of space they take up as cargo.
UNICEF is aiming to make 2 billion COVID-19 doses available for delivery in 2021. Even before COVID-19, UNICEF was already the largest single vaccine buyer in the world, procuring over 2 billion vaccines annually in order to reach almost half of the world’s children under 5. In addition, the agency procures and supplies around 600-800 million syringes for regular immunization programmes annually.
COVAX is a global collaboration co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, and includes UNICEF, which leads on procurement and delivery, as well as getting countries ready to receive vaccines.

Pakistan to host World Environment Day 2021
World Environment Day 2021 will also mark the launch of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration
Nairobi, 22 February2021 – Pakistan announced today that it will host World Environment Day 2021 in partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). This year’s observance of World Environment Day will be on the theme of ‘ecosystem restoration’ and focus on resetting our relation with nature. It will also mark the formal launch of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021 – 2030.
World Environment Day takes place every year on 5 June. It is the United Nations’ flagship day for promoting worldwide awareness and action for the environment. Over the years, it has grown to be the largest global platform for environmental public outreach and is celebrated by millions of people across the world.
Making the announcement on the margins of the virtual 5thUN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5), Pakistan’s Adviser to Prime Minister and Minister of Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam joined UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen to acknowledge the urgency of preventing, halting and reversing the degradation of ecosystems worldwide.
Led by Prime Minister Imran Khan, the Government of Pakistan – in one of the world’s most ambitious afforestation efforts – plans to expand and restore the country’s forests through a '10 Billion Tree Tsunami' spread over 5 years. The campaign includes restoring mangroves and forests, as well as planting trees in urban settings, including schools, colleges, public parks and green belts. Pakistan has launched Eco-System Restoration Fund for supporting nature based solution to climate change, facilitating transition towards environmentally resilient ecologically targeted initiatives covering afforestation and biodiversity conservation.
Recently, Prime Minister of Pakistan has launched “Protected Area Initiative” to develop 15 model Protected Areas across country to conserve over 7300. Sq km of land area as well as Green Stimulus with creation of over 5,500 green jobs
“The Government of Pakistan is fully committed to playing a leadership role in addressing the issue of climate change, including through the "10 Billion Trees Tsunami” initiative, which will restore and enhance over 1 million hectares of forest across the country," said Malik Amin Aslam, Adviser to the Pakistani Prime Minister and Minister of Climate Change. "We are honoured to host this year's World Environment Day and lend our support to global restoration efforts."
As Host of World Environment Day, Pakistan will highlight  environmental issues and showcase the country’s own initiatives and its role in global efforts. The day will be celebrated across the world through various events and activities, in line with latest COVID 19 regulations.
“2020 was a year of reckoning, facing multiple crises, including a global pandemic and the continued crises of climate, nature and pollution,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “In 2021, we must take deliberate steps to move from crisis to healing: and in so doing, we must recognize that the restoration of nature is imperative to the survival of our planet and the human race.”
“Pakistan has shown real leadership in efforts to restore the country’s forests; we are grateful for their commitment to host World Environment Day 2021 and lead the charge for all nations to restore our damaged ecosystems through the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration,” she added.
The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration is intended to massively scale up the restoration of degraded and destroyed ecosystems to fight the climate crisis, prevent the loss of a million species and enhance food security water supply and livelihoods.
Reviving natural carbon sinks – such as forests and peatlands – could help close the climate emissions gap by 25% by 2030. Replanting with native tree species can also help buffer some of the expected devastating effects of a warming planet, such as increased risk of forest fires. Currently, 3.2 billion people – 40% of the world’s population– suffer from the continued degradation of ecosystems, for example by losing access to fertile soil or safe drinking water.
The UN Decade runs from 2021 through 2030, which is also the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals and the timeline scientists have identified as the last chance to prevent catastrophic climate change.
To achieve restoration at the required scale, incentives and financial investments must be made in changing the way lands and oceans are exploited, in research and education, and in inspiring a movement of people, businesses and governments through celebrating success stories.
NOTES TO EDITORS
Ministry of Climate Change is the highest federal institution in the country mandated to address issues related to environment and climate change. The Ministry has developed policy documents including National Climate Change Policy, National Forest Policy and Electric Vehicle Policy

JOINT PRESS RELEASE
Japan donates USD 3.7 million to support refugees, host communities
ISLAMABAD, 22 February 2021: The Government of Japan has announced on Monday a contribution of USD 3.7 million to support UNHCR’s programmes and activities for Afghan refugees and host communities in Pakistan.
This three-year project will focus on education, livelihoods assistance and community structures in the provinces of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab, benefitting over 240,000 individuals.
The announcement was made at a ceremony in Islamabad. On this occasion, the Ambassador of Japan to Pakistan, His Excellency Mr. MATSUDA Kuninori, and UNHCR Representative, Ms. Noriko Yoshida, signed an agreement. The Chief Commissioner for Afghan Refugees, Mr. Saleem Khan, was also present.
“Acquiring education and vocational skills is vital for the social inclusion of Afghan refugees. In this project, we will continue to provide financial support, which will greatly contribute to the stability and peace of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Peace and stability are the precondition for achieving voluntary repatriation and sustainable reintegration in Afghanistan,” said Ambassador MATSUDA.
Ms. Yoshida thanked the people and Government of Japan for their generosity towards refugees and host communities. “This funding will go a long way to empowering young refugees and Pakistanis through skills development and education.”
The UNHCR Representative further said that given the protracted Afghan refugee situation in Pakistan, Japan is supporting sustained investments easing the burden on host communities.
Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Commissioner for Afghan Refugees said that Pakistan has been hosting Afghan refugees for over 40 years and called on the international community to step up their support for large refugee-hosting countries.
“Japan has always played its part in supporting humanitarian efforts in Pakistan,” commended Mr. Khan.
Japan is playing an important role in burden- and responsibility-sharing, as set out in the Global Compact for Refugees adopted at the United Nations General Assembly in December 2018.
The Government of Japan is one of UNHCR’s largest donors and supporters of many years.

The project will contribute to the implementation of the Sendai Framework targets based on the concept of “Build Back Better”, aiming to reduce lives lost, numbers of people affected, and economic damage from natural disasters and human security of the region through knowledge and know-how of UN Habitat.
Mr. Qaiser Humayun, Economic Advisor ,Embassy of Japan remarked that Education and Disaster preparedness is always a top priority of Government of Japan and hoped that this project will help students to learn safely and be an active part of the society.
Mr. Ikhlaq Ahmed, Additional Secretary, Elementary and Secondary Education Department thanked Government of Japan, JICA and UN Habitat for providing support to the Elementary and Secondary Education Department, Government of KP  and assured that they will provide all necessary support to ensure smooth implementation of the project to achieve its objectives. He also highlighted that the demand for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of schools is enormous compared to the available budgetary resources of the government. Hence, there is still a great need for support from the international development partners in order to improve the quality of the education system and ensure safety and health of the school children.

Building trust in vaccines, addressing the youth mental health crisis, and bridging the digital divide among key opportunities for the world’s children post-pandemic - UNICEF
In an open letter about reimagining the world after COVID-19, UNICEF’s Executive Director highlights five lessons from the global pandemic
NEW YORK, 17 February 2021 – Renewing global confidence in vaccines, addressing challenges to youth mental health and wellbeing, fighting discrimination, tackling climate change, and bridging the digital divide are the biggest opportunities for children that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented the international community, UNICEF’s Executive Director Henrietta Fore said in her annual open letter today.
In the letter, released as UNICEF launches worldwide commemorations of its 75th anniversary, Fore outlines how, while the world continues its fight against the global pandemic, we need to seize the key opportunities it presents to reimagine a world more fit for children.
“As we kick off UNICEF’s 75th anniversary, we are reminded that this organization was created in the midst of another historic crisis in the aftermath of World War II,” writes Fore. “Back then, it would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the scale of the problems facing children in a war-ravaged world. But we reimagined what was possible. We built new health and welfare systems around the world. We defeated smallpox and wild polio. We built the United Nations. History is calling upon us once again.”
On vaccines, Fore warns that vaccine hesitancy will have a profound effect on our ability to overcome COVID-19. Even while we work with governments, partners and donors to help procure, transport and deliver vaccines around the world, Fore writes, we must also build confidence in the vaccines in order for the public to accept them. “Without trust, vaccines are just expensive vials in a doctor’s cabinet.”
On mental health, Fore says that COVID-19 has added to a worrying rise in mental health disorders among children and young people, and urges the international community to do more. “Countries need to give this issue the investment it deserves, dramatically expand mental health services and support for young people in communities and schools, and build on parenting programmes to ensure that children from vulnerable families get the support and protection they need at home,” she writes.
On bridging the digital divide, Fore points out how global lockdowns have exposed the inherent inequity of the digital divide. During the peak of school closures in 2020, about 30 per cent of the world’s schoolchildren were unable to access remote learning – some of the same children who are already unlikely to have access to quality education. The letter calls for reimagining education and bridging the digital divide so that digital tools can be leveraged to reimage education and leapfrog into the future.
Finally, the letter points out how critical this moment of opportunity is. “The international community must support an inclusive recovery that prioritizes investments for children,” Fore writes. “This year, as UNICEF celebrates 75 years of reimagining the future for every child, let’s gather behind children and young people with a new spirit of urgency, as we create opportunities, ignite their dreams, and support them across every part of their lives.”

FAO presents Forest and Wildlife Action Plan for Sindh to fight climate change, food insecurity and malnutrition
Hyderabad (18/2/2022): A public consultation jointly organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Forest and Wildlife Department, Government of Sindh, saw participants from government, the conservation movement, academics, researchers, progressive farmers, and representatives from national and international organizations discussing the way forward for the fragile forests sector under the Sindh Agriculture Policy 2018-2030.
The government’s draft Action Plan for Forests and Wildlife aims to help address all four objectives of the Sindh Agriculture Policy. It highlights the major challenges faced by the sector, which include extensive loss of forested lands to other uses, and reduced water availability in a changed climate scenario. Recommendations are included that aim to grow the forest products industry in Sindh; contribute to poverty reduction, food security and nutrition; and sustain natural resources in the province, including protecting and rebuilding biodiversity.
FAO Pakistan, through European Union-assisted Food Security and Nutrition Impact, Resilience, Sustainability and Transformation (FIRST) programme, is seeking to help deepen the dialogue between different sectors with a stake in food security, through its policy assistance service, supporting evidence-based decision making and analysis of proposed policy frameworks and action plans. In Sindh, it has helped build capacity of the government officials of the Forest and Wildlife Department over 2019-2021 in formulating its action plan, with a view to making the case for more targeted investment in the forest and wildlife sector to meet modern requirements for sustainably produced forest products and ecosystem services, including clean water and well-managed wildlife reserves.
Head of FAO’s Sindh Provincial Program, Ms. Genevieve Hussain, pointed out that forests can strongly contribute to food security and nutrition through their provision of edible forest and wildlife products. She said that good tenure governance for forested areas was important for providing secure forest-based livelihoods. She highlighted that forests generate income for local people and provide essential ecosystem services that support agriculture by regulating water flows, stabilizing soils, maintaining soil fertility, regulating local climates and providing habitat for both pollinators and predators of agricultural pests.
Additional Secretary (Technical) Sindh Forest and Wildlife, Dr. Abdul Jabbar Qazi, expressed his appreciation for the efforts of FAO in providing policy assistance to formulate an Action Plan for forests and wildlife in Sindh. As Chief Conservator Riverine and Inland Forest Sindh, he said that more appropriate use and care of the riverine forest zones was badly needed, for both commercial and environmental reasons.
Mr. Hyder Raza Khan, Conservator of Social Forestry, explained the current status of Sindh forests and wildlife, while Mr Khawar Parvez Awan, FAO Policy Specialist, presented the proposed Action Plan for the Sindh Forest and Wildlife sector. After today’s public consultation, the Forest and Wildlife Action Plan will be presented before the Sindh Agriculture Policy Implementation Commission (SAPIC) for its endorsement, and will inform budgetary priorities in the coming year, they said.

Leading airlines commit to helping UNICEF in its historic mission of transporting COVID-19 vaccines around the world
COPENHAGEN, 16 February 2021 – UNICEF is today launching the Humanitarian Airfreight Initiative. Under this landmark initiative, over 10 leading airlines are signing agreements with UNICEF to support the prioritization of delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, essential medicines, medical devices and other critical supplies to respond to the pandemic. The Initiative will also act as a global logistics preparedness mechanism for other humanitarian and health crises over the longer term.
“Delivery of these life-saving vaccines is a monumental and complex undertaking, considering the sheer volumes that need to be transported, the cold chain requirements, the number of expected deliveries and the diversity of routes” said Etleva Kadilli, Director of UNICEF Supply Division. “We are grateful to these airlines for joining forces with the UNICEF Humanitarian Airfreight Initiative to support the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines.”
The UNICEF Humanitarian Airfreight Initiative brings together the airlines covering routes to over 100 countries, in support of the COVAX Facility – the global effort aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Based on the COVAX Facility’s indicative distribution and first round allocation plan, 145 countries will receive doses to immunize around three per cent of their population, on average, starting in the first half of 2021, subject to all requirements being met and final allocation plans.
In addition to prioritizing shipments of these life-saving supplies, the airlines will take measures such as temperature control and security, while also adding freight capacity to routes where needed. Their commitments are critical to the timely and secure delivery of vaccines and critical supplies.
Safe, timely and efficient transportation of life-saving supplies is critical to supporting access to essential services for children and families. COVAX deliveries and the subsequent vaccination of frontline workers will support health and social care systems to safely resume these critical services.

Consultation workshop held on draft Livestock Action Plan for Sindh to modernize livestock sector
Hyderabad 12/02/2021: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Sindh Livestock & Fisheries Department jointly held a public  consultation workshop to validate a proposed Livestock Action Plan for Sindh province, under the Sindh Agriculture Policy 2018-30. The Secretary, Livestock and Fisheries, Director General Livestock, Director General Sindh Animal Health Institute, and Director General Livestock Extension were among those leading the discussions aimed at prioritizing public spending on the sector.
FAO Pakistan, through the European Union-assisted Food Security and Nutrition Impact, Resilience, Sustainability and Transformation (FIRST) programme, is seeking to deepen the dialogue between different sectors with a stake in the food system. The FIRST policy assistance service is supporting evidence-based decision-making and analysis of proposed policy frameworks and action plans. In Sindh, FAO has helped build capacity of the government officials of the Livestock & Fisheries Department over 2019-2021 in formulating action plans for both the livestock and fisheries sectors, helping make the case for more targeted investment to meet modern requirements for quality, affordable food and stronger economic growth in the province, based on inclusive, climate-resilient production systems.
FAO Policy Officer, Ms. Genevieve Hussain, said that in Pakistan, the livestock sector is particularly important from a nutritional perspective. Fresh milk, meat and eggs are a traditional part of the diets of most communities in Sindh, but are often unaffordable to the poor, or not prioritized in household budgets. A ready supply of quality animal protein can make balanced eating habits possible, which helps provide the population with sufficient vitamins and minerals for better health, she informed.
Secretary Sindh Livestock & Fisheries Department, Mr. Aijaz Ahmed Mahesar, said that the Government of Sindh is very keen, through the Sindh Agriculture Policy, to create an efficient, prosperous and resilient food production sector that can provide good incomes and decent employment for those involved in livestock and allied sectors. For effective implementation of a good Livestock Action Plan, both public and privately sourced investments will be critical to enable the sector to meet the demand for its products at national as well as international level, he added.
The draft Livestock Action Plan was discussed among the participants of the workshop and a session of group work was also organized to take views from the participants, who included representatives from the research, commercial and non-profit sectors. As a second step, the Action Plan will be presented before Sindh Agriculture Policy Implementation Commission (SAPIC) for approval later in 2021.
FAO Livestock Policy Specialist, Mr Khawar Parvez Awan, while presenting the proposed Livestock Action Plan, said research and innovation are the key to transform the livestock sector and realise its potential in Pakistan. Breed improvements and a preventative approach to animal health and disease management will both bring profitability gains, he said.
Meanwhile, FAO has also collaborated with the Sindh Livestock & Fisheries Department to launch a new vaccination campaign in district Sanghar. A total of 50,000 cattle will be vaccinated against Foot and Mouth Disease, while 35,000 goats and sheep will receive medicine to prevent intestinal worms. The campaign was inaugurated by Deputy Director Livestock, Sanghar, Dr Easar Das. Speaking on the occasion, the Deputy Director said, “We are greatly appreciative of the coordination and technical assistance of FAO to deliver this important preventative animal health care initiative”.

UNICEF signs supply agreement for Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine
NEW YORK, 12 February 2021: UNICEF announced today the signing of an agreement with Pfizer on behalf of the COVAX Facility for the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine through 2021.
Deliveries of the vaccine are anticipated to start as early as the first quarter of 2021, once the countries that were allocated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses in the COVAX allocation confirm that they are in full compliance with all of the requirements established by Pfizer/BioNTech and the COVAX Facility.
The goal of the COVAX Facility is to provide the world with the best chance at making safe, efficacious COVID-19 vaccines available and affordable to all countries world-wide regardless of income level. This supply agreement allows UNICEF to procure doses out of the up to 40 million doses that have been secured under the COVAX Facility’s Advance Purchase Agreement (APA) with Pfizer/BioNTech to be available throughout 2021.
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which was the first to receive WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) on 31 December 2020, requires ultra-cold chain storage. UNICEF has been working around the clock with partners to support governments to ensure the cold chain facilities are in place to store and distribute a variety of COVID-19 vaccines with different cold chain requirements.
Today’s agreement is the second long-term supply agreement UNICEF has signed with a COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer on behalf of the COVAX Facility. Just last week, UNICEF signed an agreement with the Serum Institute of India to access two vaccines through technology transfer from AstraZeneca and Novavax, subject to the approval of the vaccine by WHO.
The COVAX Facility, co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, together with UNICEF, aims to provide at least 2 billion doses of approved COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021, enabling participating economies to protect frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.

UNESCO and Government of Pakistan Launch Coffee Table Book ‘From Landi Kotal to Wagah: Cultural Heritage Along the Grand Trunk Road’
Islamabad: UNESCO and the Government of Pakistan launched a new joint publication titled ‘From Landi Kotal to Wagah: Cultural Heritage Along the Grand Trunk Road’ on February 10, 2021 at the Pakistan National Council of Arts.
The result of a collaboration of more than two years, the coffee table book explores the built and intangible heritage along the Grand Trunk Road (GT Road) in Pakistan, combining a thoroughly researched narrative with a wealth of photos that illustrate the diverse and rich panorama of this 2500-year-old historical trade road. Over the centuries, the road has been extensively travelled by traders, pilgrims and great civilizations like the Greeks, Turks and Mughals who left their marks, perpetuating the mythical status of this legendary road. The aim of the book is to foster tourism, promote awareness and ultimately protect the little known historic sites (largely non-Muslim) along the GT road that spans over 2400km from Bangladesh to Afghanistan.
The development and publication of the book was supported by the Embassy of Switzerland, the European Union and the World Bank. The author is Mr. Salman Rashid, a preeminent travel writer and a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. The book is richly illustrated with photographs taken by Mr. Asad Zaidi. It is distributed in a co-publishing arrangement with Sang-E-Meel Publishers.
At the book launch, Ms. Patricia McPhillips (Country Representative and Director, UNESCO) welcomed the guests and thanked all partners for their support and contribution. She stated that, ‘through this book, UNESCO hoped to highlight the vast potential cultural development in various parts of Pakistan, and the pressing need to preserve and protect heritage sites, in order to further our shared cause of encouraging cultural pluralism and social cohesion.’
Welcoming the publication of the book, Mr. Bénédict de Cerjat (Ambassador of Switzerland) highlighted the rich and impressive cultural heritage of Pakistan. He emphasized that the Grand Trunk Road is one of Asia’s oldest and longest major roads, which has linked Central Asia to the Indian subcontinent, facilitated trade for centuries and is still used for transportation. He commended UNESCO for its valuable initiative and encouraged the guests to follow the author’s journey and discover the many fascinating places along the historical road.
In her speech, Ms. Androulla Kaminara (Ambassador of the European Union to Pakistan) emphasized: “Over the centuries, along the Grand Trunk Road not only goods but cultures, ideas, religions and languages were exchanged, leaving a permanent trace on the societies along the road today. This rich heritage is an important manifestation of cultural diversity that needs to be protected and promoted, especially for its key role in attracting tourism and boosting economic growth – which are both priorities of the Government of Pakistan.”
The author of the book Mr. Salman Rashid spoke about the many years he has spent traveling along the GT Road, and the fascinating history and culture he has experienced in his travels, which can now be shared with readers through this book.
The Chief Guest, Mr. Shafqat Mahmood (Federal Minister for the National Heritage and Culture Division) appreciated the role this book will play in fostering tourism, while also preserving the history and heritage of Pakistan for generations to come.
All partners emphasized that this unique book serves to encourage the people and government of Pakistan to protect and preserve the heritage which forms an integral part of the history of the land that is now Pakistan.
The book will be available for sale online and in major bookstores after February 10, 2021.

In the COVID-19 vaccine race, we either win together or lose together
Joint statement by UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore and WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus
NEW YORK/GENEVA, 10 February 2021 – “Of the 128 million vaccine doses administered so far, more than three quarters of those vaccinations are in just 10 countries that account for 60% of global GDP.
“As of today, almost 130 countries, with 2.5 billion people, are yet to administer a single dose.
“This self-defeating strategy will cost lives and livelihoods, give the virus further opportunity to mutate and evade vaccines and will undermine a global economic recovery.
“Today, UNICEF and WHO – partners for more than 70 years – call on leaders to look beyond their borders and employ a vaccine strategy that can actually end the pandemic and limit variants.
“Health workers have been on the frontlines of the pandemic in lower- and middle-income settings and should be protected first so they can protect us.
“COVAX participating countries are preparing to receive and use vaccines. Health workers have been trained, cold chain systems primed. What’s missing is the equitable supply of vaccines.
“To ensure that vaccine rollouts begin in all countries in the first 100 days of 2021, it is imperative that:
· Governments that have vaccinated their own health workers and populations at highest risk of severe disease share vaccines through COVAX so other countries can do the same.
· The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, and its vaccines pillar COVAX, is fully funded so that financing and technical support is available to lower- and middle-income countries for deploying and administering vaccines. If fully funded, the ACT Accelerator could return up to US$ 166 for every dollar invested.
· Vaccine manufacturers allocate the limited vaccine supply equitably; share safety, efficacy and manufacturing data as a priority with WHO for regulatory and policy review; step up and maximize production; and transfer technology to other manufacturers who can help scale the global supply.
“We need global leadership to scale up vaccine production and achieve vaccine equity.
“COVID-19 has shown that our fates are inextricably linked. Whether we win or lose, we will do so together.”

Advancing gender equality in science and technology is essential for building a better future.
We have seen this yet again in the fight against COVID-19.
Women, who represent 70 per cent of all healthcare workers, have been among those most affected by the pandemic and among those leading the response to it.
Gender inequalities have increased dramatically in the past year, as women bear the brunt of school closures and working from home.
Many women scientists are facing closed labs and increased care responsibilities, leaving less time for critical research.
For women in scientific fields, these challenges have exacerbated an already difficult situation.
According to UNESCO, women account for only one third of the world’s researchers, and occupy fewer senior positions than men at top universities.
This disparity has led to a lower publication rate, less visibility, less recognition and, critically, less funding.
Meanwhile, artificial Intelligence and machine learning replicate existing biases.
Women and girls belong in science.
Yet stereotypes have steered women and girls away from science-related fields.
It is time to recognize that greater diversity fosters greater innovation.
Without more women in STEM, the world will continue to be designed by and for men, and the potential of girls and women will remain untapped.
We must ensure that girls have access to the education they deserve and that they can see a future for themselves in engineering, computer programming, cloud technology, robotics and health sciences.
This is critical for our work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
Increasing women’s participation in STEM can close the gender pay gap and boost women’s  earnings by $299 billion over the next ten years.
STEM skills are also crucial in closing the global Internet user gap.
Together, let’s end gender discrimination, and ensure that all women and girls fulfill their potential and are an integral part in building a better world for all.

Canadian High Commissioner’s visit to GLOF-II office in Gilgit
The Canadian High Commissioner to Pakistan, Wendy Glimour and the First Secretary Emilie Milroy visited GLOF II Gilgit office on 9th Feb 2021.
The Provincial Coordinator GLOF-II briefed her about the project and its objectives and background; the Scaling-up of GLOF risk reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II) project is a continuation of the four-year ‘Reducing Risks and Vulnerabilities from GLOF in Northern Pakistan’ (GLOF-I) project. GLOF-II aims to help vulnerable communities to prepare for and mitigate GLOF risks through early warning systems, enhanced infrastructure and community-based disaster risk management.
Ms. Gilmore appreciated the efforts of project team, and the implementing units for incorporation and documentation of indigenous knowledge like glacial grafting and community engagement. The First Secretary inquired youth engagement in the interventions proposed under the project. GLOF-II Provincial Coordinator emphasised on the opportunities given to the youth under the internship program, where the local youth from different districts are involved to enhance knowledge of the professional world.  GLOF-II is also supporting research students working on climate change resilience.
The early warning systems were of immense interest to the ambassador and she wanted to learn how communities receive the alerts to safeguard against such catastrophise. She was fascinated to learn about the use of drone technologies to monitor GLOF events.
Possible avenues of collaboration between Canada and GLOF II were also discussed. The team was apprised on the selection of only 24 valleys for the project and talked about the need for more financial resources and technological access to upscale the project in future, and to expand its horizons in upcoming years to all the valleys vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
Ms Gilmore inquired about the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as the funding body for the project and appreciated the timely provision of resources from GCF and project team’s active collaboration with the donor for various project activities.
The High Commissioner and First Secretary were given project souvenirs as a token of thanks and  an invitation was extended for visiting the project management unit in Islamabad to know further about GLOF-II and GCF partnership.

Growing concern for well-being of children and young people amid soaring screen time – UNICEF
Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore on Safer Internet Day
NEW YORK, 9 February 2021 – “Under the shadow of COVID-19, the lives of millions of children and young people have shrunk to just their homes and their screens. For many, being online quickly became the only way to play, socialize and learn.
“While technology and digital solutions provide significant opportunities to keep children learning, entertained and connected, these same tools may also increase their exposure to a myriad of risks. Even before the pandemic, online sexual exploitation, harmful content, misinformation and cyberbullying all threatened children’s rights, safety and mental wellbeing.
“For children already experiencing harm or hurt – online or offline – the rise in screen time may have exacerbated their anguish. School closures, physical distancing, decreased services, and increased strain on already vulnerable families disrupted and reduced some of the protective measures available to them.
“At the same time, concern is mounting for children’s physical and emotional health, with some evidence suggesting that more time online is leading to less outdoor activity, reduced sleep quality, increased symptoms of anxiety and unhealthy eating habits.
“As the pandemic enters its second year, there’s no doubt that the Internet and technology will continue to play an elevated role in the lives of millions of children. This Safer Internet Day, we have an opportunity to reimagine a safer world for children online, and one that prioritizes and protects their physical and mental well-being. Here’s how:
·         By working with governments to train health, education and social service workers about the impact of COVID-19 on child well-being, including increased online risks, as well as bolstering core child protection and mental health services to make sure they remain open and active throughout the pandemic and beyond.
·         By ensuring the tech industry, including social networking sites, guarantees that online platforms have enhanced safety and safeguarding measures that are clearly accessible to teachers, parents and children.
·         By working with public and private sector partners to increase investments in safe technologies and content that promote quality learning and skills building, including through the Reimagine Education initiative and GIGA.
·         By supporting parents to help their children understand the risks presented by the Internet and digital technologies as well as being alert to signs of distress that may arise with online activity.
·         In schools, by granting children continued access to school-based counselling services – including virtually – and policies that respond to mental health and child protection concerns.
“For children and young people themselves, preparing for a kinder, more connected world post-COVID means helping strike a balance between their online and offline worlds, nurturing safe, positive relationships with those around them, and having access to the support they need.

UNICEF Hands Over ADB Funded Oxygen Concentrators to the Government
Islamabad, 5 February 2021 – Funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), 220 Oxygen Concentrators worth $331,000 were handed over by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MoNHS,R&C), in Islamabad yesterday.
An Oxygen Concentrator is a life-saving device used for treating patients suffering from coronavirus infection, birth asphyxia and complicated pneumonia. Recently procured Oxygen Concentrator have been shipped to seven major cities in the country including Islamabad, to be installed in public health facilities.
“Our nationally coordinated efforts have indeed helped Pakistan to effectively tackle the Pandemic so far. I am thankful to all stakehokders and partners including ADB and UNICEF who joined hands been since the pandemic landed  in Pakistan,” said Dr. Rana Muhammad Safdar, Director General (Health), MoNHS,R&C. “We are vigilantly monitoring the evolving disease patterns as well as our health systems capacity and have mechanisms in place to best use the available resources for the purpose. Oxygen Concentrators shall upbuild the capacity of our health facilities to effectively manage moderately symptomatic patients close to their place of residence and thus help in reducing load on major hospitals.
In addition to the initial grant of $500,000 which has been utilized for acquiring Personal Protective Equipment and Oxygen Concentrators, ADB has also provided an additional $20,00,000 to help Pakistan strengthen its efforts to combat COVID-19 pandemic. These funds will be used to acquire life-saving medical supplies, diagnostic and laboratory facilities, and other critical equipment for communities affected by the pandemic.
“Since the outbreak of COVID-19, ADB moved swiftly to support the people and the government of Pakistan in responding to the challenge,” said ADB Country Director Xiaohong Yang. “The provision of oxygen concentrators to health centers across the country will help save lives and support the poor and vulnerable, who are particularly dependent on public sector health facilities. We will continue to work closely with UNICEF and other development partners to help Pakistan overcome the challenges.”
Since the outbreak of COVID19 in Pakistan, ADB and UNICEF have been collaborating to support the MoNHS,R&C by providing funds and technical assistance in procurement of PPEs and other medical supplies to counter the spread of coronavirus in the country.
“Funds from ADB have helped us provide the most needed assistance to the Government of Pakistan in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “Realising the importance of Oxygen Concentrators as lifesaving devices, UNICEF had earlier provided 525 Oxygen Concentrators worth over $1 million to the MoNHS,R&C.”
“As the largest single vaccine buyer in the world, UNICEF has a unique and longstanding expertise in procurement and logistics. Besides procurement of PPE, UNICEF and its COVAX partners – Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, WHO and CEPI – are now procuring COVID-19 vaccine doses as the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in world history. We are determined to work with EPI and MoNHSRC to quickly acquire adequate COVID-19 vaccine for people on Pakistan and roll out inoculation to priority populations in phased manner, said UNICEF Chief”

Fisheries action plan presented for public consultation in Sindh
Karachi 02/02/2021: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations held a public  consultation workshop under the Sindh Agriculture Policy 2018-2030 to validate a proposed Fisheries Action Plan for Sindh province. The workshop was attended by Secretary Livestock and Fisheries, Director General Marine Fisheries, representatives of International Trade Centre, World Wildlife Fund, Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, private fisheries businesses, seafood processors and exporters.
FAO Pakistan, through European Union-assisted Food Security and Nutrition Impact, Resilience, Sustainability and Transformation (FIRST) programme, is seeking to help deepen the dialogue between different sectors with a stake in food security, through its policy assistance service, supporting evidence-based decision making and analysis of proposed policy frameworks and action plans. In Sindh, it has helped build capacity of the government officials of the Livestock & Fisheries Department over 2019-2021 in formulating its action plan with a view to making the case for more targeted investment in the fisheries and aquaculture sector to meet modern requirements for quality, efficiency and profitability.
FAO Policy Officer Ms. Genevieve Hussain highlighted that the government is keen, through the policy, to create an efficient, prosperous and resilient food production sector that can provide good incomes and decent employment to those involved in fisheries and aquaculture sector, and at the same time provide safe and nutritious food to urban and rural populations. “Fisheries is indeed an industry where there are complex trade-offs between sustainability, growth, inclusion of smaller fisherfolk and conservation of natural resources” she said. Country and provincial governments need to arrive at compromises that meet the desires of different size fishing operations, nutritional needs of the people, and economic aspirations of the fishing communities.
Secretary Sindh Livestock & Fisheries Department, Mr. Aijaz Ahmed Mahesar, expressed appreciation for the efforts of FAO in both the formulation of policy and development of action plans under it, saying, “without an Action Plan there can be no budgetary allocation, so it is essential that we have this plan agreed and in place so that the policy is implemented properly”. The Government of Sindh will facilitate strategy by working with industry to restructure the sector and create a regulatory framework to encourage finance institutions and private sector to invest in fisheries and aquaculture and to adopt technological improvements along the value chain, he added. He further added that the Government of Sindh is strongly committed to the Sindh Agriculture Policy and wants to leverage public resources in a smart way to support the fisheries and aquaculture industries.
FAO Fisheries Policy Specialist, Mr Khawar Parvez Awan, explained that the overall process of implementation of the Fisheries Action Plan and the corresponding plans for livestock, forestry and agriculture sectors will be overseen by the Sindh Agriculture Policy Implementation Commission (SAPIC) comprising concerned government institutions, farmers’ associations, private sector and academia and headed by the Minister of Agriculture, Supply and Prices, Sindh. The draft fisheries action plan was discussed today at length with the participants who actively articulated their considered views in plenary and group sessions. After today’s public consultation, the Fisheries Action Plan will be presented before Sindh Agriculture Policy Implementation Commission (SAPIC) for approval.

Ministry of Human Rights & UNDP launch report on Covid-19 and Disaster Vulnerability in Pakistan
Islamabad, 3rd February 2020 – The Ministry of Human Rights in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan launched a detailed report on “Covid-19 and Disaster Vulnerability in Pakistan: A Human Rights Based Analysis” in Islamabad today. The report presents a comprehensive framework to analyze and strengthen Pakistan’s official response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the report, Pakistan’s national Covid-19 response has been analysed according to the eight key thematic priority areas identified by the UN Secretary General in April 2020 Guidance Note, “COVID-19 and Human Rights: We are all in this together”. These priority areas are health; livelihoods and unemployment; education; food; security; gender-based violence; child rights protection; refugees and migrants; and prisons and detention centres. The report outlines government initiatives in each thematic area; gaps and opportunities; and rights-based recommendations to facilitate and ensure a human rights-based approach to Covid-19 and disaster vulnerability in Pakistan.
Each chapter identifies population groups that face a high degree of risk and vulnerability. It also offers a set of short and medium-term recommendations for relevant Pakistani authorities at both national and provincial levels to prioritize and protect human rights. The report also attempts to examine the methodologies and practices of developed nations in order to perform a comparative analysis and provide a robust roadmap and strategy to address potential gaps and shortcomings.
Speaking at the launch of the report, Federal Minister for Human Rights, Dr Shireen Mazari said, “The Government of Pakistan is cognizant of the multifaceted impacts of Covid-19 on the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in the country and across the globe. Our report approaches the crisis through a human rights lens to encourage and facilitate a people-centred approach to the pandemic. The proposed recommendations are integral not only in terms of ensuring that human rights are protected during the current pandemic, but have the far-reaching potential to serve as a roadmap for protecting human rights in a plethora of future emergency situations that Pakistan could face.”
Federal Secretary for Human Rights, Mr. Inamullah Khan said, “Our research report highlights integral achievements, unintended impacts, and short-comings of Pakistan’s national response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It adopts a medium to long term perspective for guidance and recommendations that seek to ensure that the rights of the vulnerable, based on their sex, socioeconomic status, geographic location, age and disability, are protected.”
UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Ms. Aliona Niculita said at the occasion that, “UNDP is pleased to have supported the Ministry of Human Rights in undertaking this groundbreaking research on COVID-19 and disaster vulnerability in Pakistan from a human rights perspective. We hope that the recommendations outlined in this report will guide the Government of Pakistan, UN Agencies, and other development partners in their response to COVID-19, including the roll out of the vaccination campaign, and future emergencies, with the aim of ensuring that no one is left behind in emergency response and recovery.

President of the General Assembly,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

2020 was a global annus horribilis – a year of death, disaster and despair.
The COVID-19 pandemic unleashed havoc in every country and every economy.
We lost 2 million lives, including many dear members of our UN family.
The human toll continues to multiply.
The economic costs continue to mount.
500 million jobs -- gone.
Extreme poverty -- back up to levels not seen in a generation.
Inequalities widening.
Hunger rising again.
And global fragilities continue to be exposed.
We have declared war on nature, and nature is striking back.
The climate crisis is raging.
Last year natural disasters caused $210 billion in damage – and incalculable human costs.
Biodiversity is collapsing.
Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions are undermining our collective efforts for peace.
Humanitarian needs are escalating.
Forced displacement reached record levels last year.
The risk of nuclear and chemical proliferation grows.
Human rights face a backlash.
Hate speech is booming.
Lawless behaviour in cyberspace has created a new domain for the propagation of crime, violence, misinformation and disruption.
And COVID-19 has had an especially pernicious impact on the world’s women and girls.
Excellencies,
2020 brought us tragedy and peril.
2021 must be the year to change gear and put the world on track.
We need to move from death to health; from disaster to reconstruction; from despair to hope; from business as usual to transformation.
The Sustainable Development Goals are more important now than ever.
Now is the time to secure the well-being of people, economies, societies and our planet.
It is possible.  So we must make it happen.  Together.
Excellencies,
Our first priority for 2021 is to respond to COVID-19.
Vaccines are the first great moral test before us.
These must be seen as global public goods – people’s vaccines – available and affordable to all.
The COVAX facility urgently needs more resources to procure and deliver vaccines for low- and middle-income countries, and to continue vital research and development.
I thank the countries and organizations that are supporting COVAX, and the leadership of the World Health Organization.
I welcome new engagement by major developed countries.
But the world is falling short.
Vaccines are reaching a handful of countries quickly, while the poorest countries have almost none.
Science is succeeding – but solidarity is failing.
Governments have a responsibility to protect their populations, but COVID-19 cannot be beaten one country at a time.
If the virus is allowed to spread like wildfire in the Global South, it will inevitably mutate, it is mutating becoming more transmissible, more deadly and, eventually, more resistant to vaccines, ready to come back to hound the Global North.
Moreover, recent studies have found that vaccine hoarding could cost the global economy up to $9.2 trillion – with almost half of that impact in the wealthiest countries themselves.
That figure is over 340 times more than the $27 billion funding gap for the ACT-Accelerator.
There is only one victor in a world of vaccine haves and vaccine have-nots: the virus itself.
Today I am calling for six specific steps:
Prioritize healthcare workers and those most at risk everywhere.
Protect health systems from collapse in the poorest countries.
Ensure enough supply and fair distribution, including by having manufacturers prioritize supply to COVAX.
Share excess doses with the COVAX facility.
Make licenses widely available to scale up manufacturing.
Boost vaccine confidence.
Our “Verified” initiative is fighting the infodemic.
But there is no panacea in a pandemic.
We must continue to take the scientifically proven steps that reduce transmission.
Wearing masks.  Physical distancing.  Washing hands.
To defeat COVID-19 is possible.
We must make it happen.  Together.
Excellencies,
Second, the world cannot heal from the virus if economies are on life support.  An inclusive and sustainable recovery must start now.
We need massive investments in health systems everywhere.
Universal health coverage.
Mental health care.
Social protection.
Decent work.
And children safely back in school.
Developing countries have been drained of remittances, tourism revenues and earnings from commodities.
Wealthier countries are implementing recovery and stimulus plans worth trillions of dollars.
Yet the poorest countries have been able to spend only about 2 per cent of their small gross domestic product.
Recovery must be inclusive.
No country should be forced to choose between providing basic services and servicing their debts.
The High-Level events I convened last year with the Prime Ministers of Canada and Jamaica highlighted the urgent need for a quantum leap in financial support.
This includes:
An expansion of the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative.
Debt relief for all developing and middle-income countries that need it.
Increased resources for multilateral financial institutions, and a new allocation of Special Drawing Rights to the benefit of developing countries.
A voluntary reallocation of unused Special Drawing Rights.
Liquidity is crucial to prevent debt defaults.
Recovery must also be sustainable – embracing renewable energy, and green and resilient infrastructure.
Otherwise, we will lock in harmful practices for decades to come.
The 2030 Agenda points the way.
A sustainable and inclusive recovery is possible.
We must make it happen.  Together.
Excellencies,
Our third priority must therefore be making peace with nature.
2021 is a critical year for climate and biodiversity.
Last month, I called on all Member States to declare a climate emergency in their countries.
Today, I call on the international community to reach five key milestones by COP26 in November.
First, let’s keep building the global coalition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
The coalition now represents 70 per cent of the world economy and 65 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions.
In the year ahead, let’s ensure it covers at least 90 per cent of emissions.
G20 countries and main emitters must lead the way.
I call on every city, company and financial institution to adopt concrete roadmaps with clear intermediary milestones to get to carbon neutrality by 2050.
Key sectors such as shipping, aviation, industry and agriculture must do the same.
Second, Governments must submit Nationally Determined Contributions to cut global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 compared with 2010 levels.
Third, we need to achieve a breakthrough on adaptation.
Adaptation cannot be the forgotten component of climate action.
Donors and multilateral development banks should increase the share of adaptation finance from 20 to at least 50 per cent by 2024.
Fourth, meet all finance commitments.
Developed countries must fulfil their pledge to mobilize $100 billion annually for climate action in developing countries and it is not yet happening.
This should include full capitalization of the Green Climate Fund.
All development banks should align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals by 2024, and help mobilize private finance and investment through guarantees and partnerships.
This will shift billions of financial flows.
The UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance and Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance are critical to this effort.
Fifth, adopt transformational policies.
It is time to:
Put a price on carbon.
Stop building new coal power plants.
Phase out coal in OECD countries by 2030, and everywhere else by 2040.
Phase out fossil fuel finance, starting with the overseas financing of coal.
End subsidies to fossil fuels.
Shift the tax burden from income to carbon, from taxpayers to polluters.
Make climate-related financial risk disclosures mandatory.
Integrate carbon neutrality into all economic and fiscal policies and decisions.
And finally, promote, fund and implement just transition plans.
Excellencies,
Particular solidarity is owed to the world’s small island developing states.
Some face an existential threat – their territories could disappear within our lifetimes.
We must never allow any Member State to be forced to fold its flag because of a problem that is within our power to fix.
COP26 in November will be a moment of truth for climate action.
COP15 on biodiversity is a chance to halt the extinction crisis through a new post-2020 biodiversity framework.
Let’s not forget that 75 per cent of new and emerging human infectious diseases are zoonotic.
This year’s high-level dialogue on energy will propose solutions for the shift to renewables and the expansion of energy access.
As we prepare for the Ocean Conference in Portugal, the world must accelerate action to stop overfishing, drastically reduce pollution -- including plastics -- and promote the blue economy.
The Food Systems Summit and the global conference on sustainable transport can transform these vital sectors.
2021 will also be critical in advancing the New Urban Agenda and all cities are important.
To reconcile with nature is possible.
We must make it happen.  Together.
Excellencies,
Our fourth priority is to tackle the pandemic of poverty and inequality.
More than 70 per cent of the world’s people are living with rising wealth inequality.
But wealth is not the only measure.
People’s chances in life depend on their gender, race, family and ethnic background, whether they have a disability, and other factors.
These injustices feed each other, cause people to lose trust in governments and institutions -- and resound down the generations.
The pandemic has made things worse.
We see it in the way Covid-19 has preyed on the vulnerable and marginalized.
This week’s report by Oxfam found also that simply the increase in the wealth of the ten richest men, and they are men, during the crisis would be enough to prevent anyone from falling into poverty because of the virus, and to pay for COVID-19 vaccinations for all everywhere.
I continue to call for a New Social Contract within countries – to ensure that all people have prospects and protection.
Education and digital technology must be the two great enablers and equalizers.
Reforms to labour markets and forceful efforts against corruption, tax havens, money-laundering and illicit financial flows will also be critical.
Societies must transform the world of care.
Official Development Assistance remains a lifeline.
It is time to redress the wrongs of the past and address the systemic injustices of our time.
To keep our promise to leave no-one behind is possible.
We must make it happen.  Together.

75,000 Afghan refugee families impacted by COVID-19 received emergency cash
ISLAMABAD, 29 January 2021: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency completed the disbursement of emergency cash assistance for 75,000 vulnerable Afghan refugee families that have been the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
More than 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees are hosted in Pakistan.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, their ability to work and earn a minimum livelihood, mainly as daily wage earners, has been severely affected.
In response, UNHCR launched an emergency cash programme in May 2020. The programme mirrored the Government of Pakistan’s Ehsaas social protection programme under which vulnerable Pakistani families receive a one-off cash grant of Rs. 12,000. UNHCR’s support helped vulnerable refugee families meet their critical needs, such as food, health, education, as well as rent and transportation.
UNHCR’s cash assistance programme was established and rolled out in collaboration with the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON)/Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CAR), the Pakistan Post, some partner NGOs, and a network of refugee volunteers and community leaders. Using vulnerability criteria, this volunteer refugee network supported the process of identifying the neediest refugee families.
The UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Noriko Yoshida, said, “Cash assistance to 75,000 refugee families is about leaving no one behind, as the COVID-19 pandemic does not discriminate.”
“With the support of the Government of Pakistan and the international community, emergency cash assistance has made a difference in the lives of refugees during this very challenging time. The assistance has not only allowed refugees to meet their immediate needs in dignity but has also been a gesture of the solidarity,” she added.
UNHCR’s emergency cash programme has supported a total of 450,000 Afghan refugees in Pakistan. One out of every three Afghan refugees has benefitted from this support.

FAO and Sindh Agriculture University join hands to promote the agricultural innovations and SDGs in Pakistan
Tandojam, Sindh: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) have agreed to set up a Resource Centre at SAU to develop and strengthen the capacity of the university, enhance their technical advisory and to promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and agricultural innovations in Pakistan.
A letter of agreement was signed between FAO and SAU by Rebekah Bell, FAO Representative in Pakistan a.i. and Prof. Dr. Fateh Muhammad Marri, Vice Chancellor SAU at an agreement signing ceremony held at the Sindh Agriculture University Tandojam. The event was attended by FAO and SAU officials.
Vice-Chancellor Sindh Agriculture University Prof. Dr. Fateh Muhammad Marri while appreciating the efforts of FAO said that exchange of information and access to the online platforms of FAO will provide the students an international exposure to the latest and scientific information and this information will help them to excel in their careers and ultimately enrich the agricultural sector in Pakistan.
While speaking at the ceremony, FAO Representative in Pakistan a.i. Ms. Rebekah Bell said that the transformation of Pakistan’s food systems and the achievement of the SDGs requires strong partnership with academia. This partnership with SAU will not only improve the research agenda of the university, but it will also add more value to the food systems globally.
The agreement between FAO and SAU will enable the exchange of knowledge on tools and technologies and share expertise for developing project designs, technical notes, policy briefs and studies relevant to FAO and SAU.  FAO Resource Centre will also host a Repository Library at SAU campus to facilitate the students, faculty and researchers and FAO official publications will be available at the Repository Library. Access to world's leading academic journals through AGORA (Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture), an online database launched by FAO in 2003, will also be provided to SAU students and faculty to fulfill their research needs. FAO and SAU will run knowledge sharing activities which will lead to improved agricultural practices and will create value in the agriculture sector.
Partnerships with academia and research institutions greatly enhance FAO's ability to eliminate hunger and malnutrition and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). FAO actively collaborates with higher education and research institutions to mobilize knowledge and innovations, strengthen capacities, provide evidence-based solutions to policy processes and share its own experience from the ground with the academic community.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL VIDEO MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF COMMEMORATION IN MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST,  27 January 2021
ILO - PRESS RELEASE : ILO: Uncertain and uneven recovery expected following unprecedented labour market crisis
Today we honour the memory of the six million Jews and millions of others who were systematically murdered in the Holocaust by the Nazis and their collaborators.
This year’s anniversary takes place under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has revealed longstanding fractures and injustices in our societies and contributed to a resurgence in antisemitism and xenophobia.
The Holocaust was the culmination of two millennia of discrimination, attacks, expulsions and periodic mass killings of Jews. It should have ended antisemitism for good. But it did not.
Antisemitism unfortunately remains alive and well.
Today, white supremacists and neo-Nazis are resurgent, organizing and recruiting across borders, intensifying their efforts to deny, distort and rewrite history including the Holocaust.
The COVID-19 pandemic has given them new opportunities to target minorities, based on religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, disability and immigration status.
We must make urgent joint efforts to stop them.
As we consider the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, we must address the fragilities and gaps exposed by the pandemic and strengthen our mutual bonds, based on our common humanity.
This year must be a year of healing. Healing from the pandemic, and healing our broken societies in which hatred has all too easily taken root.
As we remember those who died in the Holocaust and honour the survivors, our best tribute is the creation of a world of equality, justice and dignity for all.

ILO: Uncertain and uneven recovery expected following unprecedented labour market crisis
The latest analysis of the labour market impact of COVID-19 by the ILO, records massive damage to working time and income, with prospects for a recovery in 2021 slow, uneven and uncertain unless early improvements are supported by human-centred recovery policies.
GENEVA (ILO News) – Tentative signs of recovery are emerging in global labour markets, following unprecedented disruption in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the latest report from the International Labour Organization.

New annual estimates in the seventh edition of the ILO Monitor: COVID-19 and the world of work confirm the massive impact that labour markets suffered in 2020. The latest figures show that 8.8 per cent of global working hours were lost for the whole of last year (relative to the fourth quarter of 2019), equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs1. This is approximately four times greater than the number lost during the 2009 global financial crisis.

These lost working hours are accounted for either by reduced working hours for those in employment or “unprecedented” levels of employment loss, hitting 114 million people2. Significantly, 71 per cent of these employment losses (81 million people) came in the form of inactivity, rather than unemployment, meaning that people left the labour market because they were unable to work, perhaps because of pandemic restrictions, or simply ceased to look for work. Looking at unemployment alone drastically understates the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market.

These massive losses resulted in an 8.3 per cent decline in global labour income (before support measures are included), equivalent to US$3.7 trillion or 4.4 per cent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Women have been more affected than men by the pandemic’s labour market disruptions. Globally, employment losses for women stand at 5 per cent, versus 3.9 per cent for men. In particular, women were much more likely than men to drop out of the labour market and become inactive.

Younger workers have also been particularly hard hit, either losing jobs, dropping out of the labour force or delaying entry into it. The employment loss among youth (15-24 years old) stood at 8.7 per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent for adults. This “highlights the all too real risk of a lost generation”, the Monitor says.

The report shows the uneven impact on different economic, geographic, and labour market sectors. It highlights concerns of a “K-shaped recovery”, whereby those sectors and workers hit hardest could be left behind in the recovery, leading to increasing inequality, unless corrective measures are taken.

The worst affected sector has been accommodation and food services, where employment declined by more than 20 per cent, on average, followed by retail and manufacturing. In contrast, employment in information and communication, and finance and insurance, increased in the second and third quarters of 2020. Marginal increases were also seen in mining, quarrying and utilities.
While there is still a high degree of uncertainty, the latest projections for 2021 show that most countries will experience a relatively strong recovery in the second half of the year, as vaccination programmes take effect.

The Monitor puts forward three scenarios for recovery; baseline, pessimistic and optimistic. The baseline scenario (which draws on International Monetary Fund forecasts from October 2020), projects a 3 per cent loss of working hours globally in 2021 (compared to Q4 2019), equivalent to 90 million full time jobs.
The pessimistic scenario, which assumes slow progress on vaccination in particular, would see working hours drop by 4.6 per cent, while the optimistic scenario forecasts a 1.3 per cent decline. This would depend on the pandemic being under control and an upsurge of consumer and business confidence.

In all scenarios the Americas, Europe and Central Asia would experience around twice the working hour losses of other regions.

The Monitor includes a series of policy recommendations for recovery:
“The signs of recovery we see are encouraging, but they are fragile and highly uncertain, and we must remember that no country or group can recover alone,” said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.

“We are at a fork in the road. One path leads to an uneven, unsustainable, recovery with growing inequality and instability, and the prospect of more crises. The other focuses on a human-centred recovery for building back better, prioritizing employment, income and social protection, workers’ rights and social dialogue. If we want a lasting, sustainable and inclusive recovery, this is the path policy-makers must commit to.”

FAO, WFP AND IFAD JOIN HANDS TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN’S CONTRIBUTION TO FOOD SYSTEM SUMMIT 2021
Islamabad: The United Nations will host a Food Systems Summit in October 2021 to identify the problems we must solve so that no one goes hungry, and to radically transform the way we manage food on the planet. The Summit will be the turning point in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. With only 10 years remaining, many of the 17 SDGs remain distant. Unsafe or unsustainable food systems are part and parcel of the development challenge.

 Rebuilding the food systems of the world enables us to answer the UN Secretary-General António Guterres call to “build back better” from COVID-19 and to leave no one behind.
 
As part of Pakistan’s commitment to achieve SDGs by 2030, the Government is keen to amplify its participation in the Food Systems Summit in close consultation with the UN organizations. With this aim, a consultative meeting was held by the Secretary of the Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR) Ghufran Memon and attended by the Representatives and Country Directors of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations a.i. Rebekah Bell, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) Chris Kaye and the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) Mohammad Fida.

Under the convenorship of the Secretary Ministry of National Food Security and Research, the partners discussed how to organize dialogues at the provincial and national levels based on five identified action tracks i.e. ensure access to safe and nutritious food for all; shift to sustainable consumption patterns; boost nature-positive production; advance equitable livelihoods and build resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks and stress. The recommendations generated through these dialogues will be presented in a pre-Summit in July in Rome, Italy and final recommendations will be presented in the Summit in October in New York.

The Summit actions and commitments will be informed by the best evidence, ideas, initiatives and alliances from around the world. The Summit will develop principles to guide the national and local governments, companies and citizens seeking to leverage their food systems to support sustainable development. These principles will set an optimistic and encouraging vision in which food systems play a central role in building a fairer, more sustainable world. The Food System Summit also aims to create a system of follow-up and review to ensure that the Summit’s outcomes continue to drive new actions and progress across all member states.

With the call to build back better, transforming our food systems is among the most powerful ways to change course and make progress towards all 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

UN agencies warn economic impact of COVID-19 and worsening inequalities will fuel malnutrition for billions in Asia and the Pacific
Child and maternal diets particularly vulnerable
20/01/2021, Bangkok, Thailand – The economic impact of COVID-19 on the world’s most populous region is threatening to further undermine efforts to improve diets and nutrition of nearly two billion people in Asia and the Pacific who were already unable to afford healthy diets prior to the pandemic, says a new report published today by four specialized agencies of the United Nations.
The report, ‘Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition 2020: Maternal and Child Diets at the Heart of Improving Nutrition’ found that 1.9 billion people were unable to afford a healthy diet in this region, even before the COVID-19 outbreak and the damage it has since caused to economies and individual livelihoods. The report was published jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization.
Due to higher prices for fruits, vegetables and dairy products, it has become nearly impossible for poor people in Asia and the Pacific to achieve healthy diets, the affordability of which is critical to ensure food security and nutrition for all – and for mothers and children in particular.
Food prices and available incomes govern household decisions on food and dietary intake. But the outbreak of COVID-19 and a lack of decent work opportunities in many parts of the region, alongside significant uncertainty of food systems and markets, has led to a worsening of inequality, as poorer families with dwindling incomes further alter their diets to choose cheaper, less nutritious foods.
Making nutritious foods affordable and accessible
More than 350 million people in the Asia and the Pacific were undernourished in 2019, or roughly half of the global total. Across the region, an estimated 74.5 million children under 5 years of age were stunted (too short for their age) and 31.5 million suffered from wasting (too thin for height). The majority of these children live in Southern Asia with nearly 56 million stunted and more than 25 million wasted. At the same time, overweight and obesity has increased rapidly, especially in South-Eastern Asia and the Pacific, with an estimated 14.5 million children under 5, being overweight or obese.
Poor diets and inadequate nutritional intake is an ongoing problem. The cost of a healthy diet is significantly higher than that of a diet that provides sufficient calories but lacks in nutritional value, showing significant gaps in the food system to deliver nutritious options to all at an affordable price. These costs are even greater for women and children, given their added nutritional needs.
The report calls for a transformation of food systems in Asia and the Pacific, with an aim to increase the affordability of, and families’ access to, nutritious, safe, and sustainable diets. Nutritious and healthy diets need to be accessible to everyone, everywhere. To ensure that happens, the report recommends integrated approaches and policies are needed. These steps are vital to overcome unaffordability issues, and also to ensure healthy maternal and child diets.
Improving maternal and child diets requires strengthening vital systems
Nutrition is vitally important throughout a person’s life. The impact of a poor diet is most severe in the first 1000 days, from pregnancy to when a child reaches the age of 2. Young children, especially when they start eating their “first foods” at 6 months, have high nutritional requirements to grow well and every bite counts.
Mainstreaming nutrition-focused behaviour change campaigns throughout these systems should lead to greater knowledge uptake and sustainability of behaviours helping people to achieve healthy diets.
Education on what constitutes a healthy diet and how to create hygienic environments at home, in schools and in the community, together with investment in girl’s education and infrastructure that underlies good water, sanitation and hygiene practices, are critical.
Therefore, providing a nutritious, safe, affordable and sustainable diet for all requires coordinating with partners in the Food, Water and Sanitation, Health, Social Protection and Education systems, to collectively create an enabling environment.
Greater attention is also needed to operationalize national policies and plans to improve the delivery of health services for maternal and child diets and good nutrition outcomes. Services to improve the diets of mothers and young children should be prioritized as part of the essential package of health services needed to address undernutrition, overweight and obesity and to achieve universal health coverage.
In the meantime, social protection efforts can protect and stabilize incomes and improve access to healthy diets during disasters and crises. At least nine governments in Asia and Pacific have established a targeted mother and child COVID-19 component in their social protection systems. However, more data collection and analysis are needed to document the effectiveness of social protection in improving maternal and child diets in the region.
Bringing everyone to the table
Food systems play a critical role in achieving food and nutrition security for all. A sustainable and nutrition-sensitive food system is essential to produce diverse and nutritious foods for healthy diets. Improved efficiency and productivity of value chains can reduce the costs of essential foods to make them more affordable.
These actions are needed now more than ever because the face of malnutrition is changing in Asia and the Pacific, with highly processed and inexpensive foods readily available throughout the region. These foods are often packed with sugar and unhealthy fats and lack the vitamins and minerals required for growth and development. Consumption of these foods increases the risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Governments need to invest in nutrition and food safety in fresh and street food markets to promote healthy diets. Regulation of sales and marketing of food for consumers, especially children, is important to curb overweight, obesity and related diseases and illness.
The report also calls for action within the private sector, as it has an important role to play in supporting the transformation of the food system and its value chains for achieving healthy diets.
Leveraging these systems, in a coordinated fashion that expands the opportunities to address barriers to accessing and consuming healthy diets, will help countries and the people of Asia and the Pacific  recover faster from the economic impact of COVID-19, and be better prepared for future crises.
The report, ‘Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition 2020: Maternal and Child Diets at the Heart of Improving Nutrition’ launched today in Bangkok, is jointly published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Children’s Fund,  the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization.

Homeworkers need to be better protected, says the ILO
The dramatic increase in working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic ‎has highlighted the poor working conditions experienced by many ‎homeworkers who, prior to the crisis, numbered an estimated 260 million ‎people worldwide.‎
GENEVA (ILO News) – Those working from home, whose number has ‎greatly increased due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, need better ‎protection, says the International Labour Organization (ILO) in a new report.
Since homeworking occurs in the private sphere it is often “invisible”. In low- ‎and middle-income countries for instance, almost all home-based workers (90 ‎per cent) work informally.
They are usually worse off than those who work outside the home, even in ‎higher-skilled professions. Homeworkers earn on average 13 per cent less in ‎the United Kingdom; 22 per cent less in the United States of America; 25 per ‎cent less in South Africa and about 50 per cent in Argentina, India and ‎Mexico. ‎
Homeworkers also face greater safety and health risks and have less access ‎to training than non-home-based workers, which can affect their career ‎prospects.
The report, Working from home. From invisibility to decent work , also shows ‎that homeworkers do not have the same level of social protection as other ‎workers. They are also less likely to be part of a trade union or to be covered ‎by a collective bargaining agreement.‎
Renewed urgency
According to ILO estimates, prior to the COVID-19 crisis , there were ‎approximately 260 million home-based workers worldwide, representing 7.9 ‎per cent of global employment; 56 per cent of them (147 million) were ‎women.
They include teleworkers who work remotely on a continual basis, and a vast ‎number of workers who are involved in the production of goods that cannot ‎be automated, such as embroidery, handicrafts, electronic assembly. A third ‎category, digital platform workers, provide services, such as processing ‎insurance claims, copy-editing, or data annotation for the training of artificial ‎intelligence systems.
In the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 an estimated one-in-‎five workers found themselves working from home. Data for the whole of ‎‎2020, once it is available, is expected to show a substantial increase on the ‎previous year.
The growth of homeworking is likely to continue in the coming years, the ‎report says, bringing renewed urgency to the need to address the issues ‎facing homeworkers and their employers.‎
Poorly regulated with lack of compliance
Homeworking is often poorly regulated and compliance with existing laws ‎remains a challenge. In many instances, homeworkers are classified as ‎independent contractors and therefore excluded from the scope of labour ‎legislation.‎
‎ “Many countries around the world have legislation, sometimes ‎complemented by collective agreements, that addresses various decent work ‎deficits associated with homework. Nonetheless, only 10 ILO Member ‎States  have ratified Convention No. 177 , that promotes equality of treatment ‎between homeworkers and other wage earners, and few have a ‎comprehensive policy on homework,” said Janine Berg, ILO senior economist ‎and one of the report’s authors.‎
Recommendations
The report includes concrete recommendations to make homeworking more ‎visible and thus better protected.
For industrial homeworkers, the report underlines the importance of ‎facilitating their transition to the formal economy by extending legal ‎protections, improving compliance, generalizing written contracts, providing ‎access to social security and making homeworkers aware of their rights.
For home-based, digital platform workers, whose activities raise particular ‎challenges for compliance as they cross multiple borders, the report ‎advocates the use of data generated by their work to monitor working ‎conditions and tools to set fair wages.
For teleworkers, the report calls on policymakers to put in place specific ‎actions to mitigate psychosocial risks and introduce a “right to disconnect”, to ‎ensure respect for the boundaries between working life and private life.
Homeworking is likely to take on greater importance in the years to come, the ‎report says. Governments, in cooperation with workers’ and employers’ ‎organizations, should work together to ensure that all homeworkers – ‎whether they are weaving rattan in Indonesia, making shea butter in Ghana, ‎tagging photos in Egypt, sewing masks in Uruguay, or teleworking in France ‎‎– move from invisibility to decent work.

Thanks to Japan, UNHCR supported thousands of vulnerable families impacted by COVID-19
ISLAMABAD, 7 January 2021: While the COVID-19 pandemic has prevailed throughout the year and posed serious humanitarian challenges, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency stayed and delivered by supporting Afghan refugees and their host communities as well as contributing to the Government’s COVID-19 prevention and response in Pakistan.
Thanks to the generous contribution of USD 1 million made by the Government of Japan earlier this year, UNHCR was able to strengthen its own response to the urgent needs of the most vulnerable families impacted by COVID-19.
With the support of the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON), the Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CAR) and other partners, UNHCR – through the Japanese funding – carried out emergency health, water and sanitation, and cash-based interventions that benefitted an estimated 135,000 Afghan refugees and Pakistanis.
Health facilities were provided with personal protective equipment and medical supplies. Water and sanitation facilities were improved in refugee villages and refugee-hosting areas through the provision of sanitation products. UNHCR’s emergency cash program alleviated the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic on Afghan refugees, most of whom are daily wage earners.
“The people and the Government of Japan’s generous and timely contribution helped us provide much-needed relief to the most vulnerable refugees and host communities during the pandemic,” said UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Noriko Yoshida.
The Government of Japan is one of UNHCR’s key donors and supporters in Pakistan and across the globe.

FAO enhances GIS professionals capacities for effective land monitoring in Pakistan
Land cover or land use information plays an important role for many environmental and monitoring tasks, including climate change, ecosystem dynamics analysis, food security, and others. Accurate information about land cover affects the accuracy of all subsequent applications, therefore accurate and timely land cover information is in high demand. In land cover classification studies over the past decade, higher accuracies were produced when using time series satellite images than when using single date images. Recently, the availability of the Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based computing geospatial platform, has gained the attention of remote sensing based applications designed to process large data sets for global applications, analysis and ultimate decision making.
In this regard, to develop the expertise and capacities of GIS professionals in Pakistan, FAO conducted a virtual course on Google Earth Engine and its applications for agricultural mapping and for land monitoring. This 10-days training was held in collaboration with the Geospatial Unit at FAO headquarters.  Around 20 GIS professionals were able to complete the training, which will be shared online with a wider audience. The training aimed to provide essential skills on innovative topics related to the use of satellite images: from selection, process, manipulation and thematic classification required to assess and monitor natural and agricultural resources. While traditional desktop GIS and Remote Sensing (RS) tools are currently being used in Pakistan, the Google Earth Engine will provide users with a web-based application for the selection, access and analysis of satellite imageries such as Landsat, Copernicus, and Modis.
Speaking at the closing day of the training, Rebekah Bell, FAO Representative a.i. in Pakistan, defined the usage of GIS tools as beneficial for decision makers. “Timely and reliable data is important and with improved capacities and upgraded tools like GEE, constant access to up-to-date time-series information will allow us to monitor through specific indicators (e.g. vegetation indices) and algorithms the land dynamics so as to detect land use changes, land degradation and restoration”, she added.
FAO will continue to provide support to the country by enhancing remote sensing capacities and by providing innovative algorithms to monitor land dynamics. Capacity development of GIS professionals will help in mapping forest cover, detecting deforestation, classifying land cover, estimating forest biomass and carbon, mapping urban area expansion, population mapping, and changes in agricultural production and forecasting, and rangeland dynamics.

Dear Friends,
2020 has been a year of trials, tragedies and tears.
COVID-19 upended our lives and plunged the world into suffering and grief.
So many loved ones have been lost — and the pandemic rages on, creating new waves of sickness and death.
Poverty, inequality and hunger are rising. Jobs are disappearing and debts are mounting. Children are struggling.
Violence in the home is increasing, and insecurity is everywhere.
But a New Year lies ahead. And with it, we see rays of hope:
-          People extending a helping hand to neighbors and strangers;
-          Frontline workers giving their all;
-          Scientists developing vaccines in record time;
-          Countries making new commitments to prevent climate catastrophe.
If we work together in unity and solidarity, these rays of hope can reach around the world.
That’s the lesson of this most difficult year.
Both climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic are crises that can only be addressed by everyone together – as part of a transition to an inclusive and sustainable future.
The central ambition of the United Nations for 2021 is to build a global coalition for carbon neutrality - net zero emissions - by 2050.
Every government, city, business and individual can play a part in achieving this vision.
Together, let’s make peace among ourselves and with nature, tackle the climate crisis, stop the spread of COVID-19, and make 2021 a year of healing.
Healing from the impact of a deadly virus. Healing broken economies and societies. Healing divisions. And starting to heal the planet.
That must be our New Year’s Resolution for 2021.
I wish you all a happy and peaceful New Year, from the United Nations.

SECRETARY-GENERAL MESSAGE - URDU
سیکرٹری جنرل اقوامِ متحدہ کا سال 2021ء کے لیے ویڈیو پیغام

عزیز دوستو!
2020ء آزمائشوں اور سختیوں کا سال رہا۔
کووڈ-19 نے ہماری زندگیوں کو  بری طرح متاثر کیا اور اس کی وجہ سے دنیا کو دکھ اور تکالیف دیکھنا پڑیں۔
بہت سی قیمتی جانیں ضائع ہوئیں—اور یہ وباء اب بھی پھیل رہی ہے،بیماری اور موت نئی نئی شکلوں میں سامنے آ رہی ہے۔
غربت، عدم مساوات اور بھوک  بڑھ رہی ہے۔ ملازمتیں ختم ہو رہی ہیں اور قرضے بڑھ رہے ہیں۔ بچوں کو  مسائل کا سامنا کرنا پڑ رہا ہے۔
گھریلو تشدد بڑھ رہا ہے اور ہر طرف عدم تحفظ پایا جاتا ہے۔
لیکن ایک نیا سال آ رہا ہے جس کے ساتھ ہمیں امید کی کرنیں نظرآ رہی ہیں:
-        لوگ اپنے آس پاس والوں اور حتیٰ کہ اجنبی افراد کی مدد میں پیش پیش ہیں؛
-        اگلی صفوں  میں کام کرنے والے تن من دھن کی بازی لگائے ہوئے ہیں؛
-        سائنس دان قلیل ترین  مدت میں ویکسین تیار کرنے کے لیے کوشاں ہیں؛
-        ماحولیاتی تباہی سے بچاؤ کے لیے ممالک نئے عہد کر رہے ہیں۔
اگر ہم مل کر اور یگانگت سے کام کریں تو امید کی یہ کرنیں پوری دنیا پر چھا سکتی ہیں۔
سب سے مشکل ترین سال کا یہی سبق ہے۔
ماحولیاتی تبدیلی اور کووڈ-19 کی وباء ایسے بحران ہیں جن سے صرف اسی صورت میں  نمٹا جا سکتا ہے جب ہر کوئی متحد ہو جائے –تاکہ ایک پائیدار اور ہر ایک کی شرکت پر مبنی مستقبل کی طرف بڑھا جا سکے۔
2021ء کے لیے اقوام متحدہ کا  بنیادی عزم یہ ہے کہ2050ء تک کاربن سے پاک گیسوں کے اخراج کے ہدف کو حاصل کرنے کے لیے عالمی اتحاد قائم کیا جائے۔
ہر حکومت، شہر، کاروباری ادارہ اور ہر فرد اس مقصد کو حاصل کرنے کے لیے اپنا کردار ادا کر سکتا ہے۔
آئیے مل کر  ایک دوسرے کے ساتھ اور ماحول کے ساتھ امن کا رشتہ قائم کریں، ماحولیاتی بحران کا مقابلہ  کریں، کووڈ-19 کے پھیلاؤ کو روکیں اور 2021ء کو  تندرستی کا سال بنائیں۔
تباہ کن وائرس کے اثرات سے تندرستی، ٹوٹ پھوٹ کا شکار معیشتوں اور معاشروں کی تندرستی،  اور اس کرہ ارض کی تندرستی۔
نئے سال 2021ء کے لیے  ہمارایہی عزم ہونا چاہیے۔

Pakistani babies will account for nearly 3.8 per cent of the estimated 371,504 babies to be born on New Year’s Day. Their average life expectancy is expected to be around 73 years.
“This has been a difficult year for all of us, and there is perhaps no better way to turn the page than to welcome new young lives into the world,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “With the challenges of 2020 behind us, and the opportunities of 2021 before us, now is the time to begin to build a better world. Children born today will inherit the world we begin to build for them—today.”
2021 marks the 75th anniversary of UNICEF. Over the course of the year, UNICEF and its partners will be commemorating the anniversary with events and announcements celebrating three-quarters of a century of protecting children from conflict, disease and exclusion and championing their right to survival, health and education.
Today, as the world faces unprecedented challenges caused by the pandemic, economic slowdown, rising poverty and inequality, we are reminded that the need for UNICEF’s work is as great as ever.
“There is no more appropriate year than this - the year of UNICEF’s 75th Anniversary - to renew our commitment to end preventable newborn and child deaths, and give every child, the best start in life. We owe it to the young lives who will inherit the world we leave,” said Aida Girma.

سیکرٹری جنرل اقوامِ متحدہ کا سال 2021ء کے لیے ویڈیو پیغام

عزیز دوستو!
2020ء آزمائشوں اور سختیوں کا سال رہا۔
کووڈ-19 نے ہماری زندگیوں کو  بری طرح متاثر کیا اور اس کی وجہ سے دنیا کو دکھ اور تکالیف دیکھنا پڑیں۔
بہت سی قیمتی جانیں ضائع ہوئیں—اور یہ وباء اب بھی پھیل رہی ہے،بیماری اور موت نئی نئی شکلوں میں سامنے آ رہی ہے۔
غربت، عدم مساوات اور بھوک  بڑھ رہی ہے۔ ملازمتیں ختم ہو رہی ہیں اور قرضے بڑھ رہے ہیں۔ بچوں کو  مسائل کا سامنا کرنا پڑ رہا ہے۔
گھریلو تشدد بڑھ رہا ہے اور ہر طرف عدم تحفظ پایا جاتا ہے۔
لیکن ایک نیا سال آ رہا ہے جس کے ساتھ ہمیں امید کی کرنیں نظرآ رہی ہیں:
-        لوگ اپنے آس پاس والوں اور حتیٰ کہ اجنبی افراد کی مدد میں پیش پیش ہیں؛
-        اگلی صفوں  میں کام کرنے والے تن من دھن کی بازی لگائے ہوئے ہیں؛
-        سائنس دان قلیل ترین  مدت میں ویکسین تیار کرنے کے لیے کوشاں ہیں؛
-        ماحولیاتی تباہی سے بچاؤ کے لیے ممالک نئے عہد کر رہے ہیں۔
اگر ہم مل کر اور یگانگت سے کام کریں تو امید کی یہ کرنیں پوری دنیا پر چھا سکتی ہیں۔
سب سے مشکل ترین سال کا یہی سبق ہے۔
ماحولیاتی تبدیلی اور کووڈ-19 کی وباء ایسے بحران ہیں جن سے صرف اسی صورت میں  نمٹا جا سکتا ہے جب ہر کوئی متحد ہو جائے –تاکہ ایک پائیدار اور ہر ایک کی شرکت پر مبنی مستقبل کی طرف بڑھا جا سکے۔
2021ء کے لیے اقوام متحدہ کا  بنیادی عزم یہ ہے کہ2050ء تک کاربن سے پاک گیسوں کے اخراج کے ہدف کو حاصل کرنے کے لیے عالمی اتحاد قائم کیا جائے۔
ہر حکومت، شہر، کاروباری ادارہ اور ہر فرد اس مقصد کو حاصل کرنے کے لیے اپنا کردار ادا کر سکتا ہے۔
آئیے مل کر  ایک دوسرے کے ساتھ اور ماحول کے ساتھ امن کا رشتہ قائم کریں، ماحولیاتی بحران کا مقابلہ  کریں، کووڈ-19 کے پھیلاؤ کو روکیں اور 2021ء کو  تندرستی کا سال بنائیں۔
تباہ کن وائرس کے اثرات سے تندرستی، ٹوٹ پھوٹ کا شکار معیشتوں اور معاشروں کی تندرستی،  اور اس کرہ ارض کی تندرستی۔
نئے سال 2021ء کے لیے  ہمارایہی عزم ہونا چاہیے۔
میں اقوام متحدہ کی طرف سے آپ سب کو نئے  سال کی مبارکباد پیش کرتا ہوں۔

Dear Friends,
2020 has been a year of trials, tragedies and tears.
COVID-19 upended our lives and plunged the world into suffering and grief.
So many loved ones have been lost — and the pandemic rages on, creating new waves of sickness and death.
Poverty, inequality and hunger are rising. Jobs are disappearing and debts are mounting. Children are struggling.
Violence in the home is increasing, and insecurity is everywhere.
But a New Year lies ahead. And with it, we see rays of hope:
-          People extending a helping hand to neighbors and strangers;
-          Frontline workers giving their all;
-          Scientists developing vaccines in record time;
-          Countries making new commitments to prevent climate catastrophe.
If we work together in unity and solidarity, these rays of hope can reach around the world.
That’s the lesson of this most difficult year.
Both climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic are crises that can only be addressed by everyone together – as part of a transition to an inclusive and sustainable future.
The central ambition of the United Nations for 2021 is to build a global coalition for carbon neutrality - net zero emissions - by 2050.
Every government, city, business and individual can play a part in achieving this vision.
Together, let’s make peace among ourselves and with nature, tackle the climate crisis, stop the spread of COVID-19, and make 2021 a year of healing.
Healing from the impact of a deadly virus. Healing broken economies and societies. Healing divisions. And starting to heal the planet.
That must be our New Year’s Resolution for 2021.
I wish you all a happy and peaceful New Year, from the United Nations.

EU FUNDING ALLOWS WFP TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES DEVASTATED BY FLOODS IN SINDH PAKISTAN
ISLAMABAD – Thanks to a contribution of € 500,000 from the European Union (EU), tens of thousands of families in Sindh Province have received food and cash assistance from WFP in the aftermath of the devastating floods that hit the country in August.
Support from committed donors like the EU allowed WFP to reach over 71,000 people, who were most affected by the disaster, with in-kind food assistance by early September. The second phase of the response is currently underway, aiming to support 117,000 people. Each family will receive PKR 15,000 (EUR 76) in cash that will help them meet their food and other essential needs.
“The unconditional cash support from the EU has enabled the most vulnerable families to cover their essential food and non-food needs such as medicine, water and shelter repairs,” said WFP Pakistan Representative and Country Director Chris Kaye.
Apart from the food and cash assistance, the EU’s support has allowed WFP to produce and disseminate information packages on nutrition and hygiene among mothers and children across Sindh Province. Another awareness-raising initiative has sensitised communities to the importance of precautionary measures preventing the spread of COVID-19 and dengue.
WFP’s emergency response has been coordinated with the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of Sindh, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and implementing partners including ACTED and Secours Islamique France (SIF).

Balochistan farmers increase yield and incomes with support from government and FAO
ISLAMABAD/QUETTA: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in collaboration with the Government of Balochistan, and financial support from the Australian Government have assisted farmers from six districts of Balochistan increase the gross yield and value of their agricultural produce under the ‘Australia Balochistan Agribusiness (AusABBA) programme.
Representatives of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Government of Balochistan and the Australian High Commission held a closing ceremony to celebrate the successful completion and achievements of the Australian Government funded Australia Balochistan Agribusiness Programme - AusABBA , in Quetta. The AusABBA programme during its two phases (Phase I, 2014 - 2017 and Phase II, 2017 - 2020) improved the household incomes for more than 23,000 households in south west Balochistan by working with households to improve water, food and economic security.
The programme was implemented in collaboration with Government of Balochistan, UN agencies and other stakeholders, with the objective of improving the resilience and living conditions of male and female small holder farmers people in the province. The programme has assisted agriculture-based households to adopt sustainable, profitable and diversified agriculture livelihoods that have increased their household income and food and nutrition security. The programme achieved at least a 25% increase in crop yield. The programme has also enhanced the capacities of farming communities to utilize innovative agriculture practices, market their goods, develop and sustain businesses, strengthened supply chains and has connected farmers to markets across Pakistan. The programme worked in specific commodities such as onions, fruit trees, livestock, wool shearing, certified seed production, poultry, dates and household food production.
During this period, the AusABBA ensured that at least 25% of the farmers engaged in the programme were women. This was achieved through the introduction of specific supply chain activities, which are now carried out by women (grading, packaging, seedling production) and by the enhanced development of womens’ Farmer Marketing Collectives (FMCs) and Mutual Marketing Organizations (MMOs). The programme also helped establish 21 MMOs register with the Agriculture Cooperatives Department as cooperatives/legal entities. Registration of these MMOs has helped farmers to upscale their businesses at the national and international level, providing them access to financial facilities from financial institutes such as banks, microfinance institutes.
Speaking on the occasion, FAO Representative a.i. in Pakistan, Ms. Rebekah Bell applauded the efforts of AusABBA and stated that over the course of time and with the support of AusABBA Phases I and II, the programme supported male and female farmers in developing their farming businesses and improving their production yields, while simultaneously working with the agriculture supply and market businesses so as to increase their access to the farmer producers. Additionally, AusABBA provided technical advisory support to the Government of Balochistan for policy reforms in livestock and agriculture sectors, she said.
She further stated that FAO under the AusABBA programme has responded to the increased levels of food insecurity in Balochistan due to Covid19 by initiating a household food production and experiential nutrition education intervention through which families that have pregnant and/or lactating women are trained under Integrated Household Food Systems (IHFS). This activity has provided support to women improve the production of diversified and nutritious food at the household level as well as improving knowledge and practice of good nutrition for women children and the broader household, she added.
The First Secretary Development at Australian High Commission Ms. Nazia Nur, addressing the audience virtually stated that Austalia has been a long standing supporter of Balochistan in livestock and agriculture sector. Our aid programme has strong focus on food security, promoting sustainable and inclusive agriculture and better nutritional outcomes. Australia has a long term commitment to the rural sector through our Centre for Agriculture Research that has been working in Balochistan for several years on water management, efficient irrigation system and diary in Balochistan, she said.
She further added that, at the policy level, Australia has supported the livestock strategy development which also includes women empowerment. There is a great potential in agriculture and livestock sectors in Balochistan, without empowering farmers and women who are important in agriculture and livestock, this potential cannot be reached, she said.
On behalf of Government of Balochistan, Mr. Mitha Khan Kakar, Minister Livestock, Balochistan expressed his gratitude’s to the DFAT and people of Australia on the successful completion of AusABBA II programme. He stated that government of Balochistan applauds the project’s achievements and welcomes other development partners to continue the work of this important and impactful programme. He continued and said that based on achievements of the project in providing assistance in economic growth, food security and poverty alleviation, the government of Balochistan looks forward to future collaboration and would like to recommend the further dissemination of the best practices of the programme.
The ceremony was virtually attended by the Australian High Commission officials and programme farmers, as well as by officials from FAO and the Government of Balochistan.
Finally, after thanking the Australian Government for its support to people of Balochistan and congratulating the stakeholders and partners on the conclusion of a successful project, the FAO Head of Provincial Office, Balochistan a.i. Mr. Ahmed Jan Essa, reiterated that AusABBA had been a flagship programme for FAO in Balochistan. The programme was able to attract other donors to invest in Balochistan, with the USAID funded THAzA programme and the EU funded GRASP programme implemented by ITC, replicating and building on the many of the successes of developed in AusABBA. He continued to thank Australia for their commitment to reduce poverty, improve food security and enhance the nutrition status of families in Balochistan and was thankful for the generous contribution of the people of Australia.

Prime Minister of Pakistan and UNDP commit to accelerate Pakistan’s Digital Transformation agenda
Islamabad, 17 December 2020 — The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) aims to improve governance through digital interventions and formally develop its growing Digital Transformation portfolio. To expand this agenda, a UNDP delegation met Imran Khan, Prime Minister of the Republic of Pakistan to discuss future collaboration on Digital Transformation between the Government of Pakistan and UNDP.  Mr. Tariq Malik, Chief Technical Advisor on Digital Governance from UNDP’s Headquarters in New York and former chairman of NADRA, is leading the mission to create the first formal and strategic portfolio on Digital Transformation. Accompanying him was Ms. Aliona Niculita, UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative a.i.
During the meeting, UNDP discussed five priority digital interventions with the Prime Minister which emerged after briefings with 15 Government Ministries, departments, agencies and over 50 key stakeholders from the government, private sector and the development community. These priority interventions include supporting NADRA's digital registration; development of Digital ID stack to  extend the digital infrastructure of Pakistan which includes digital payments system and more; supporting Ehsaas's introduction of a One-Window Portal for integrated social protection services; digitization of Police Investigation Manual and establishing a national emergency helpline with National Police Bureau; and development of Pakistan Business Portal (PBP), with the Board of Investment, an online platform for ease of doing business within the country. UNDP is also conducting a digital maturity assessment in parallel to prioritize digital interventions using read data driven approach.
The Prime Minister appreciated UNDP’s partnership in development of a digital transformation roadmap for the country. He reiterated the importance of digital solutions for improved governance and that Pakistan is committed to using digital technologies for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

On this International Migrants Day, we reflect on a year in which, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions upon millions of people have experienced the pain of separation from friends and family, the uncertainty of employment and the need to adapt to a new and unfamiliar reality.
These are emotions felt by migrants around the world every day.
Across this challenging year, we have also come to appreciate our dependence on those who are too often invisible within our communities. Migrants have played an outsized role on the frontlines of responding to the crisis – from caring for the sick and elderly to ensuring food supplies during lockdowns – highlighting their broader contributions to societies around the world.
Just as migrants are integral to our societies, they should remain central to our recovery.
We must ensure that migrants, irrespective of their legal status, are included in every country’s pandemic response, particularly in health and vaccination programming. We must reject hate speech and acts of xenophobia. And we must find solutions for those migrants who have been left stranded, without income or legal status, and without means to return home.
On this International Migrants Day, let us seize the opportunity of the recovery from the pandemic to implement the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, reimagine human mobility, enable migrants to reignite economies at home and abroad and build more inclusive and resilient societies.

UNICEF outlining plans to transport up to 850 tonnes of COVID-19 vaccines per month on behalf of COVAX, in ‘mammoth and historic’ logistics operation
UNICEF – in partnership with Gavi and WHO – is also helping low- and lower-middle-income countries prepare to receive COVID-19 vaccines in 2021
NEW YORK/Islamabad, 18 December 2020 – UNICEF could potentially transport up to 850 tonnes of COVID-19 vaccines per month in 2021, should such quantities become available, according to a new assessment. This is more than double the average weight of vaccines UNICEF transports every month.
The assessment is part of UNICEF’s work to lead on the procurement and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines for 92 low- and lower middle-income countries on behalf of the COVAX Facility, in collaboration with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).
“This is a mammoth and historic undertaking,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “The scale of the task is daunting, and the stakes have never been higher, but we are ready to take this on.”
“With the imminent arrival of globally approved COVID-19 vaccines, we can begin to see signs of hope. But hope will not be restored by the vaccine alone. Countries need urgent technical and financial support to strengthen their capacities for cold and supply chains, to train health workers, and to work with communities in combatting misinformation and building trust in vaccines. Without urgent funding and support, many of the poorest countries still risk being left behind, said Fore.”
The UNICEF assessment looked at global airfreight capacity and transport routes to better understand the challenges of delivering COVID-19 vaccines in 2021. It found that commercial airlines will be able to deliver vaccines to almost all 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries, which are among the 190 economies participating in the COVAX Facility, at an estimated cost of up to US$70 million.
“The day is not far when we start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in Pakistan,” said UNICEF Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Aida Girma. “As the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination leads the formation of a comprehensive and effective strategy for in-country supply and administering of the vaccine prioritizing frontline health workers and patients in urgent need, UNICEF will use its strengths in community engagement and vaccine supply to make sure that COVAX facility have safe, fast and equitable access to the vaccine.”
“It is, however, important to realise that strict adherence to the preventive SoPs such as hand washing, physical distancing and mask wearing, is equally important besides having a safe and effective vaccine, diagnostics and treatments,” she added.
Comparing vaccine volume estimates against commercial and cargo routes across the globe, the assessment also found that current air cargo capacity would be sufficient to make deliveries covering 20 per cent of the population for most of the 92 countries. COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be primarily shipped using existing passenger and cargo flight capacity, although charters or alternative transport options may still be needed for some small countries and others with access issues. UNICEF is working with airlines and the wider logistics industry to prioritise the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines around the world.
One major challenge in the COVID-19 vaccine operation is local cold chain capacity for vaccine storage within some low- and lower-middle-income countries. UNICEF, WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, developed a guidance note on supply and logistics to help countries develop their supply chain strategies to receive, store, distribute and manage COVID-19 vaccines and related products. Given the range of storage temperatures required for COVID-19 vaccines, countries will continue to train logisticians and health workers on how to keep COVID-19 vaccines at the right temperatures.
As part of a programme that started in 2017, with support from Gavi, UNICEF continues to procure and support the installation of 70,000 cold-chain fridges in lower-income countries by the end of 2021, which will help in the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines that need to be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. Almost half of these will be solar powered.
UNICEF, WHO and Gavi are also working to help countries prepare and develop national deployment and vaccination plans for the large-scale roll out of COVID-19 vaccines. Currently, countries are continuing to monitor their readiness against key milestones, which include expediting regulatory approvals and putting in place ways to monitor vaccine safety.
In addition, a UNICEF meeting this week with more than 300 vaccine procurement experts globally, including government officials, looked at ways to procure and roll-out COVID-19 vaccines and strengthen regulatory systems and supply chains.
Funding is critical. UNICEF has called for US$410 million to help countries with the delivery of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostic tools in 2021. Further, UNICEF estimates a funding gap of US$133 million to cover in-country vaccine logistics and the required cold chain equipment for the poorest 92 countries

81 million jobs lost as COVID-19 creates turmoil in Asia-Pacific labour markets
Pandemic leads to huge reduction in working hours, reverses job growth and pushes millions into working poverty.
BANGKOK (ILO News) – Massive drops in working hours due to the COVID-19 crisis  have had a devastating effect on jobs and incomes in Asia and the Pacific according to a new report by the International Labour Organization (ILO).

According to Asia–Pacific Employment and Social Outlook 2020: Navigating the crisis towards a human-centred future of work  estimates, the economic backlash of the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out some 81 million jobs in 2020. In nearly all economies with available quarterly data for 2020, employment levels contracted compared to 2019.

The impact of the crisis has been far-reaching, with underemployment surging as millions of workers are asked to work reduced hours or no hours at all. Overall, working hours in Asia and the Pacific decreased by an estimated 15.2 per cent in the second quarter and by 10.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2020, relative to pre-crisis levels.

Working-hour losses are also influenced by the millions of persons moving outside the labour force or into unemployment as job creation in the region collapsed. Using available quarterly data, the report provides a preliminary estimate that the regional unemployment rate could increase from 4.4 per cent in 2019 to somewhere between 5.2 per cent and 5.7 per cent in 2020.

“COVID-19 has inflicted a hammer-blow on the region’s labour markets, one that few governments in the region stood ready to handle. Low levels of social security coverage and limited institutional capacity in many countries have made it difficult to help enterprises and workers back on their feet, a situation compounded when large numbers remain in the informal economy. These pre-crisis weaknesses have left far too many exposed to the pain of economic insecurity when the pandemic hit and inflicted its toll on working hours and jobs,” said Ms Chihoko Asada Miyakawa, ILO Assistant Director General and Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific.
According to the report, most countries in the region saw a larger decline in working hours and employment for women than men. Also, women were more likely to move into inactivity than men. Young people have also been especially affected by working-hour and job losses. The youth share in overall employment loss was 3 to 18 times higher than their share in total employment.

“The report shows a clear picture of young people and women being pushed out of work compared to other workers,” says Ms Sara Elder, Senior Economist at the ILO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific and lead author of the report. “With increased unemployment, young workers are likely to find it difficult to compete for new jobs. When they do find work, it may well be a job that does not match to their aspirations. Millions of women have also paid a high price and it could take years for those who have exited the labour force to return to full employment.”
With fewer paid hours of work, median incomes are falling. Overall, labour income is estimated to have fallen by as much as 10 per cent in the Asia–Pacific region in the first three quarters of 2020, equivalent to a 3 per cent loss in gross domestic product. A further consequence is the increase in working poverty levels. In absolute numbers, preliminary estimates in the report find an additional 22 million to 25 million persons could fall into working poverty, which would push the total number of working poor (living on less than $1.90 a day) in the Asia–Pacific region to between 94 and 98 million in 2020.

The report also warns that given the scope of the damage to labour markets, the overall size of the fiscal response in the region has been insufficient, especially in the region’s developing economies. As a result of fiscal expenditure gaps, the crisis is likely to exacerbate inequalities among countries in the Asia and the Pacific.

“On the more positive side,” says Ms Elder, “we are able to show in this report that government efforts to help enterprises retain workers, albeit on reduced hours, have worked to prevent what would otherwise be larger job losses. Given the mounting evidence that social protection and employment policies save jobs and incomes, the hope is that the crisis brings about a more permanent and increased investment in elements needed to boost resilience and promote a more people-centred future of work.”

Government of Pakistan and UNICEF Urge People to Continue Taking Precautions

ISLAMABAD, 16 December 2020 – The Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MoNHSRC), provincial health departments and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) urged the public to strictly adhere to COVID-19 Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) in the wake of increasing number of infections in the country during the second wave of COVID-19.
While chairing an online event about Reinforcing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during Second Wave of COVID-19, organized jointly by MoNHSRC and UNICEF, Dr. Faisal Sultan said, “The second wave of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading and the virus is reaching areas in the country where the virus did not reach during the first wave. The number of positive cases is increasing at a rapid pace and we have had to increase the capacity of treating COVID-19 cases in our hospitals.”
“COVID-19 is deadly virus but we can control it just as we controlled it by following the SoPs during the first wave. The Government of Pakistan is seeking your full cooperation in adhering to the SoPs. We can save precious lives including those of our near and dear ones by taking preventive measures. Wear a mask, maintain social distance, wash hands with soap frequently and avoid crowded places. Do celebrate on Christmas and wedding events but please keep the gatherings limited and take all precautions by following the SoPs. We are a strong nation and can defeat COVID-19 but for that cooperation from the provincial government is imperative, he added.”
Referring to the incident of the Army Public School on this day in 2014, the SAPM said, “We shall always remember our martyrs from the tragic event of APS in Peshawar and they shall always be alive in our hearts”.
With over 440,000 confirmed cases in the country till date, the Government of Pakistan is once again taking strict measures to mitigate the spread of coronavirus infection in the country. Provincial governments are following suit with health departments and administrative services enforcing necessary preventing measures at public places and encouraging people to protect themselves and others from the virus by adhering to the SoPs.
“With increase in number of coronavirus infections, the number of patients in the hospitals has also increased, said Dr. Yasmin Rashid, Health Minister Punjab. “This has happened because we did not continue to practice SoPs. We must wear a mask when going out as it reduces transmission of infection by 70 per cent. Proper handwashing with soap is very beneficial and so is social distancing. If we continue to practice all SoPs, I assure you that we will counter the second wave of COVID-19 just as successfully as we managed the first time.”
In his message for the occassion, Mr. Taimur Saleem Jhagra, Minister for Finance and Health, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa said, “It is after 102 years that a pandemic such as COVID-19 has hit the world. Pakistan countered the first wave very well but now the second wave has hit the country and it can be even more dangerous. I request people to alter their social behaviour in terms of following the SoPs strictly so that neither our health system is overburdened, nor is the economic development affected. We must also follow the instructions of the NCOC for avoiding mass gatherings. And within our families, we must adhere to the SoPs and take special care of the elderly and those showing symptoms.”
“Despite all difficulties, the first wave of COVID-19 was tackled by Pakistan in a very efficient manner, “said Ms. Rubaba Khan Buledi, Parliamentary Secretary Health, Balochistan. “Responsible civic behaviour of the general public made it possible. Now that the second wave of COVID-19 has hit Pakistan and we need the people to follow the SoPs very diligently. Please ensure that you wash your hands frequently, wear the mask properly when going out, do not go out unnecessarily and maintaining social distance with others. We in Balochistan are taking all possible measures to curb and curtail this disease.”
Dr. Irshad Memon, Director General Health Services Sindh said, “In Sindh, we managed to control the situation well during the first wave of COVID-19, however, just as the number of cases started to decrease, we became complacent in taking precautions against the virus. The positivity rate that had come down to around 2.5 percent has now gone up to 14 percent in the province, but we can control this by practicing the SoPs”
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan, UNICEF has been on the forefront supporting the Government of Pakistan to help prevent the spread of the virus. It has supported the national response in Risk Communication and Community Engagement by ensuring timely and accurate information to families and communities and promoting positive behavior towards following of SoPs.
“As we are now receiving positive news about COVID-19 vaccines, we must realise that the existence of a safe and effective vaccine alone will not end the pandemic,” said UNICEF Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Aida Girma. “We need a diverse set of tools to help slow the spread of COVID-19, including continuation of preventive measures such as hand washing, physical distancing and mask wearing, diagnostics and treatments. We can’t be complacent; we can’t let our guards down and we must continue to adhere to SOPs.”
“UNICEF has joined the Advance Market Commitment of the COVAX Facility to allow low- and lower-middle income countries access to COVID-19 vaccines. In Pakistan, UNICEF will be leveraging its unique strengths in community engagement and vaccine supply to make sure that COVAX facility have safe, fast and equitable access to the vaccine. This is an enormous undertaking and many challenges still lay ahead, but we are determined to make sure that Pakistan receives sufficient number and citizens have access to it”.
During the online event, a COVID-19 survivour shared her experience of suffering and recovering from the infection and the importance of practicing SoPs, young adolescents talked about safe behaviour inside and outside their homes and a video was aired encouraging people to:
· Avoid public gatherings
· Wear a mask when they leave their house, including when shopping at the market and if praying at the mosque
· Wash their hands with soap for 20 seconds, or with a sanitizer, regularly
· Refrain from touching their eyes, nose, mouth and ears with unwashed hands
· Stay at least six feet away from other people
· Stay at home in case they develop COVID-19 symptoms.

حکومتِ پاکستان اور یونیسف کا زور کہ لوگ حفاظتی اقدامات پر سختی سے عمل جاری رکھیں

اسلام آباد، 16 دسمبر 2020 – وزارتِ صحت حکومت پاکستان، صوبائی محکمہ جاتِ صحت اور اقوام متحدہ کے بچوں کے فنڈ (یونیسف) نے عوام پر زور دیا ہے کہ وہ کووِڈ- 19 کی دوسری لہر کا مقابلہ کرنے کے لئے ایس او پیز پر سختی سے عمل کریں کیونکہ دوسری لہر کے دوران ملک بھر میں کورونا سے متاثر ہونے والے لوگوں کی تعداد میں خطرناک حد تک اضافہ دیکھنے میں آرہا ہے۔
وزارتِ صحت حکومتِ پاکستان اور یونیسف کے منعقد کردہ مشترکہ آن لائن سیمنار کی صدارت کرتے ہوئے وزیرِ اعظم کے مشیرِ خصوصی ڈاکٹر فیصل سلطان نے اس موقع پر کہا: کورونا کی دوسری لہر تیزی سے پھیل رہی ہے یہاں تک کہ ان علاقوں تک پہنچ چکی ہے جو پہلی لہر کے دوران وائرس سے بچ گئے تھے۔ مثبت کیسز کا تناسب بہت تیزی سے بڑھ رہا ہے۔ ہسپتال پر بوجھ بھی بڑھ رہا ہے ۔ کورونا وبا مہلک ہے لیکن اس پر قابو پایا جا سکتا ہے۔ ایس او پیز پر عمل کرنے کی وجہ سے ہم نے پہلی لہرکوقابوکرلیا تھا۔ وبا کے خلاف ہمارا بروقت ردعمل اور احتیاطی تدابیر پرعمل کرنا دنیا کے لئے ایک مثال بنی تھی۔
انہوں نے مزید کہا: حکومت کو ایک بار پھر آپ سے تعاون درکار ہے۔ سب سے گزارش ہے کہ احتیاطی تدابیر پر عمل کریں۔  صرف چند احتیاطی تدابیر اختیار کرکے آپ اپنے پیاروں اور ہم وطنوں کی زندگیوں کو بچا سکتے ہیں۔ ماسک پہنیں،دوسروں  6 فٹ کا فاصلے رکھیں، ہاتھ دھوتے رہیں، اور بڑے اجتماعات سے اجتناب کریں۔ کرسمس اور شادی تقریبات کے دوران احتیاط لازمی کریں۔ آئیے اس بات کو یقینی بنائیں کہ ہماری خوشیاں کسی کے لیے پریشانی یا دکھ کا باعث نہ بنیں۔ کورونا کا مقابلہ کرنے کے لیے ایک اہم بات یہ ہے کہ ہم اس بات کو یاد رکھیں کہ یہ وبا ابھی ختم نہیں ہوئی۔ آج کے دن اے پی ایس کے شہدا کو ہم اپنی دعاوں میں یاد رکھیں اور وہ ہمیشہ ہمارے دلوں میں زندہ رہیں گے۔
اس وقت تک ملک بھر میں کورونا کے 440,000  سے زیادہ مصدقہ کیسز منظر عام پر آچکے ہیں اور حکومتِ پاکستان ایک مرتبہ پھر وائرس کے پھیلاؤ میں کمی لانے کے لئے سخت اقدامات اٹھا رہی ہے۔ صحت کے صوبائی محکمہ جات اور انتظامیہ عوامی مقامات پر تمام ضروری اقدامات اٹھاتے ہوئے لوگوں کی حوصلہ افزائی کررہی ہے کہ وہ ایس او پیز پر سختی سے عمل درآمد یقینی بنائیں تاکہ وائرس سے بچا جاسکے۔
اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے صوبہ پنجاب میں وزیر برائے صحت ڈاکٹر یاسمین راشد نے کہا کہ ـ’’ کورونا وائرس کے متاثرین میں اضافہ کی وجہ سے ہسپتالوں میں مریضوں کی تعداد میں کئی گنا اضافہ ہوچکا ہے‘‘۔
انہوں نے مزید کہا:
’’ مریضوں کی تعداد میں اضافے کی وجہ یہ ہے کہ ہم نے ایس او پیز پر عمل جاری نہیں رکھا۔ ہمیں چاہیے گھر سے باہر نکلتے وقت ماسک کا استعمال کریں تاکہ وائرس کے پھیلاؤ کو 70 فی صد تک کم کیا جاسکے۔ صابن سے باقاعدہ سے ہاتھ دھونا اور سماجی دُوری قائم رکھنا بھی وائرس سے بچنے کے لئے بے حد فائدہ مند ہے۔ اگر ہم تمام ایس او پیز پر عمل جاری رکھیں، میں آپ کو یقین دلاتی ہوں کہ ہم کووِڈ- 19 کی دوسری لہر کا بھی اسی طرح کامیابی سے مقابلہ کرسکتے ہیں جیسے ہم نے پہلی مرتبہ اس کی پہلی لہر کا کیا تھا‘‘۔
اس موقع پر اپنا پیغام  میں  وزیر صحت و مالیات خیبر پختونخواہ جناب تیمور سلیم جھگڑا نے کہا کہ دنیا کو تقریباً سو برس بعد کووِڈ- 19 جیسی عالمی وبا کا سامنا ہے۔ پاکستان نے کووِڈ- 19 کی پہلی لہر کا اچھی طرح مقابلہ کیا مگر اب ہمیں اس کی دوسری لہر کا سامنا ہے جو کہ پہلی لہر سے زیادہ خطرناک ثابت ہوسکتی ہے۔ میں آپ سے درخواست کرتا ہوں کہ وہ اپنے سماجی رویوں میں ضروری تبدیلیاں لاکر ایس او پیز پر سختی سے عمل کریں تاکہ ہمارے صحت کے نظام پر زیادہ بوجھ نہ پڑے اور نہ ہی معاشی ترقی کا عمل متاثر ہو۔ ہمیں چاہیے کہ ہم نیشنل کمانڈ آپریشن سنٹر کی ہدایات پر سختی سے عمل کریں اور عوامی اجتماعات سے پرہیز کریں۔ ہم اپنے خاندان کے ساتھ رہتے ہوئے گھر پر بھی ایس او پیز پر سختی سے عمل کریں اور بزرگ افراد کے ساتھ ساتھ ان لوگوں کا بھی خاص خیال کریں جن میں بیماری کی علامات ظاہر ہوچکی ہوں‘‘۔
پارلیمانی سیکرٹری صحت بلوچستان محترمہ رباب خان بلیدی نے اس موقع پر  کہا کہ مشکلات کے باوجود پاکستان نے کووِڈ- 19 کی پہلی لہر کا بے حد موثر انداز میں مقابلہ کیا اور اس کی بنیادی وجہ عوام کا ذمہ دارانہ رویہ تھا۔ اب جبکہ پاکستان کووِڈ- 19 کی دوسری لہر کی لپیٹ میں آچکا ہے لوگوں کا ایس او پیز پر مستقبل مزاجی اور سختی سے عمل کرنا نہایت ضروری ہے۔ براہ مہربانی باقاعدگی سے ہاتھ دھونا یقینی بنائیں، گھر سے باہر جاتے ہوئے ماسک ضرور پہنیں، اگر ضروری نہ ہو تو گھر سے باہر ہرگز نہ جائیں اور سماجی دُوری کے اصول پر سختی سے عمل کریں۔ ہم بلوچستان میں اس بیماری کی روک تھام اور اس کا پھیلاؤ روکنے کے لئے ہر ممکنہ کوشش کررہے ہیں۔
صوبہ سندھ کے ڈائریکٹر جنرل ہیلتھ سروسز ڈاکٹر ارشاد میمن نے اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے کہا کہ ہم  صوبہ سندھ میں کووِڈ- 19 کی پہلی لہر کے دوران حالات پر قابو پانے میں بہت حد تک کامیاب رہے۔ تاہم جب کیسز کی تعداد میں بہت حد تک کمی آگئی تو ہم نے غیر ذمہ دارانہ رویہ اپنایا اور وائرس سے بچاؤ کے لئے ضروری حفاظتی اقدامات پر عمل کرنا ترک کردیا۔ اس کا نتیجہ یہ نکلا کہ جو کیسز میں 2.5 فی صد تک کم ہوگئے تھے ان کی تعداد بڑھتے ہوئے اب صوبہ بھر میں 14 فی صد ہوچکی ہے۔ اگر ہم ایس او پیز پر سختی سے عمل یقینی بنائیں تو ہم اب بھی اس صورت حال پر قابو پاسکتے ہیں۔
پاکستان میں کووِڈ- 19 کی وبا پھیلنے سے لے کر اب تک یونیسف حکومت پاکستان کے ساتھ مل کر وائرس کے پھیلاؤ کا عمل روکنے میں کلیدی کردار ادا کرتا رہا ہے۔ اس ادارے نے خطرات سے آگاہی اور روک تھام کے عمل میں لوگوں کی شمولیت کو یقینی بنانے کے لئے نہایت اہم کردار ادا کیا ہے۔ ادارہ بروقت درست معلومات فراہم کرتا رہا ہے تاکہ  لوگ ایس او پیز پر عمل کریں۔
پاکستان میں یونیسف کی نمائندہ محترمہ عائدہ گِرما نے کہا کہ ہم اس وقت یہ مثبت خبریں سن رہے ہیں کہ کووِڈ- 19 کی ویکسین تیار ہوچکی ہے لیکن ہمیں یہ بات ذہن میں رکھنی چاہیے کہ صرف ویکسین اس عالمی وبا پر قابو پانے کے لئے ہرگز کافی نہیں ہے۔ ہمیں اس پر مکمل طور پر قابو پانے کے لئے مختلف طریقہ ہائے کار پر عمل کرنا ہوگا تاکہ ہم وائرس کے پھیلاؤ کے عمل میں خاطر خواہ کمی لاسکیں۔ ہمیں حفاظتی اقدامات پر عمل جاری رکھنا ہوگا جن میں باقاعدگی سے ہاتھ دھونا، سماجی دُوری کا اصول اپنانا ،  ماسک پہننا، تشخیص اور علاج کرانا شامل ہیں۔ ہم غفلت کا رویہ نہیں اپنا سکتے، ہم اپنے تحفظ سے دستبردار نہیں ہوسکتے اس لئے ضروری ہے کہ ہم ایس او پیز پر سختی سے عمل جاری رکھیں۔
انہوں نے مزید کہا:
’’ یونیسف درمیانے اور کم آمدنی کے ممالک کو کووِڈ- 19 کی ویکسین (کو ویکس) فراہم کرنے کے لئے ایڈوانس مارکیٹ کمٹمنٹ کا حصہ بن چکا ہے۔ پاکستان میں یونیسف اپنی مثالی صلاحیت سے فائدہ اٹھاتے ہوئے ویکسین کے تک تیز اور محفوظ رسائی کے عمل کو یقینی بنائے گا۔ یہ ایک بہت بڑا اقدام ہے جس کی راہ میں اب بھی کچھ مشکلات حائل ہیں مگر ہم اس بات کو یقینی بنائیں گے کہ پاکستان کو مناسب مقدار میں ویکسین فراہم کی جائے اور یہ لوگوں کی اس تک رسائی ہو‘‘۔
اس موقع پر کووِڈ- 19 سے صحت یاب ہونے والے لوگوں نے بیماری میں مبتلا ہونے اور تندرست ہونے کے تجربات سے آگاہ کیا۔ انہوں نے   بیماری سے بچنے کے لئے ایس او پیز پر سختی سے عمل کرنے کی تاکید کی۔ اس موقع پر نوجوانوں اور نو بالغوں نے گھر کے اندر اور گھر سے باہر محفوظ رویوں پر عمل کرنے کے بارے میں بات کی اور ایک ویڈیو کے ذریعے لوگوں کو درج ذیل رویے اپنانے کا پیغام بھی دیا :
· عوامی اجتماعات سے دُور رہیں
· گھر سے باہر نکلتے ہوئے، یہاں تک کہ خریداری اور مسجد میں جاتے وقت ماسک پہنیں۔
· 20 سیکنڈز تک ہاتھ دھوئیں یا پھر سینیٹائزر کی مدد سے ہاتھوں کو باقاعدگی سے صاف کریں۔
· دھوئے بغیر اپنے ہاتھوں سے آنکھیں، ناک اور کان چھونے سے اجتناب کریں۔
· دوسرے لوگوں سے کم از کم چھ فٹ کا فاصلہ رکھیں۔
· کووِڈ- 19 کی علامات ظاہر ہونے کی صورت میں گھر پر رہیں۔

Fourth steering committee meeting convened to advance Rule of Law roadmap in Balochistan
16 December 2020, Quetta – The Steering Committee on the Rule of Law (RoL) Roadmap Balochistan convened its fourth stock take meeting on 16 December 2020 in Quetta. The session concluded with a firm commitment made by Mr. Ziaullah Langove, Minister Home & Tribal Affairs, GoB towards advancing the criminal justice sector reforms envisioned under the Rule of Law roadmap in Balochistan.
Balochistan has achieved significant milestones under the RoL Roadmap Project since its inception to date. This project is being implemented by UNODC and supported by the British High Commission. Balochistan has succeeded to establish a fully functional governance mechanism that drives evidence-based and cross institutional RoL Reform which was possible due to the commitment and dedication of the government of Balochistan and all stakeholders to make this reform meaningful and sustainable.
The progress made under the roadmap was applauded by all the stakeholders despite the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19. The participants took stock of the achievements, lessons and exchanged views on next prospects for cooperation. Mr. Hafiz Abdul Basit, Additional Chief Secretary, Home & Tribal Affairs, GoB appraised the SC members of another major milestone, which is the final approval of the PC-1 by the Government, committing the amount PKR 500 million for the RoL reform in the province under the Roadmap.  He further thanked all those who have been working relentlessly to get this approval.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Jeremy Milsom, Representative, UNODC Pakistan emphasized that through the coordination efforts with the Government of Balochistan, considerable progress under the Rule of Law reforms has been achieved. However, the time is now to continue pushing forward and move the needle on implementing a robust set of reforms to align the criminal justice institutions to reinforce human rights and address underlying challenges of gender-based violence through promoting the rule of law and democracy in Balochistan.
Key findings from the assessment survey on citizens’ perception regarding the performance of criminal justice institutions and the baseline study in Balochistan were presented. While the findings of the survey and baseline provide a benchmark to use a demand-driven approach through citizens’ perspectives to enhance legitimacy, fairness, efficiency and transparency of the criminal justice sector towards ensuring safety and security of the citizens, the baseline also provides a yardstick for criminal justice institutions to measure their performance and progress against RoL provincial set targets.
The Delivery Unit apprised the forum further on the progress made to date, particularly on the digital platforms through a demonstration of the website which is continuously being updated to project the dynamic nature of the criminal justice reforms led by the RoL roadmap. The digital interface of the roadmap is powered by a dashboard that provides a convergence platform through evidence-led data analytics to inform both policy and practice of  criminal justice institutions.
The Roadmap project is recognized as a groundbreaking and innovative approach to drive evidence-based policy and reform through a robust governance structure and regular stock takes.
The organizers of the steering committee meeting thanked all stakeholders for their participation and acknowledged UNODC’s efforts and the British High Commission for their continued and generous support.

'بلوچستان قانون کی حکمرانی روڈمیپ'
پر پیشرفت کے جائزہ کے لئے سٹیرنگ کمیٹی کا چوتھا اجلاس

کوئٹہ: (16 دسمبر 2020)
'بلوچستان قانون کی حکمرانی روڈمیپ'  کی سٹیرنگ کمیٹی کا چوتھا جائزہ اجلاس 16 دسمبر 2020 کو کوئٹہ میں منعقد ہوا۔ بلوچستان کے وزیر داخلہ و قبائلی امور جناب ضیاء اللہ لنگوو نے اس روڈمیپ کے تحت فوجداری نظام انصاف کے لئے وضع کی گئی اصلاحات کو آگے بڑھانے کے پختہ عزم کا اظہار کیا۔
'قانون کی حکمرانی روڈمیپ' پراجیکٹ کے تحت بلوچستان نے نمایاں پیشرفت دکھائی ہے۔ یو این او ڈی سی اس  پراجیکٹ پر برٹش ہائی کمیشن کی معاونت سے عملدرآمد کر رہا ہے۔ صوبے نے طرزحکمرانی کا ایک مضبوط اور فعال نظام تشکیل دینے میں کامیابی حاصل کر لی ہے جس کے تحت اس میدان میں مختلف اداروں کی شمولیت سے، شواہد پر مبنی اصلاحات کے عمل کو آگے بڑھایا جا رہا ہے۔ حکومت بلوچستان اور تمام متعلقہ فریقوں کے پختہ عزم اور لگن کی بدولت ان اصلاحات کو بامعنی اور پائیدار شکل ملی ہے۔
کووڈ -19 کے باعث شدید مشکلات کے باوجود روڈمیپ پر پیشرفت کا عمل جاری رہا جسے تمام متعلقہ فریقوں نے سراہا ہے۔ شرکاء نے اس سلسلے میں حاصل کی گئی کامیابیوں اور سبق آموز تجربات کا جائزہ لیا اور تعاون کے آئندہ امکانات پر تبادلہ خیالات کیا۔ بلوچستان کے داخلہ و قبائلی امور کے آڈیشنل چیف سیکرٹری جناب حافظ عبدالباسط نے سٹیرنگ کمیٹی کے ارکان کو ایک اور اہم  سنگِ میل کے بارے میں آگاہ کرتے ہوئے بتایا کہ حکومت نے پی سی ون کی حتمی منظوری دے دی ہے اور روڈمیپ کے تحت صوبے میں قانون کی حکمرانی اصلاحات کے لئے 500 ملین روپے کی رقم رکھی گئی ہے۔ انہوں نے اس منظوری کے سلسلے میں انتھک کام کرنے والے تمام لوگوں کا شکریہ ادا کیا۔
اس موقع پر اظہار خیال کرتے ہوئے یو این او ڈی سی پاکستان کے ریپریزنٹیٹو جناب جیریمی مِلسم نے کہا کہ حکومت بلوچستان کی مربوط کوششوں کی بدولت قانون کی حکمرانی اصلاحات پر پیشرفت خاطرخواہ رہی ہے۔ تاہم وقت کا تقاضا ہے کہ ان کو آگے بڑھانے کا سلسلہ جاری رکھا جائے اور ایسی مضبوط اصلاحات  کو عملی جامہ پہنانے پر زور دیا جائے جو فوجداری انصاف کے اداروں کو انسانی حقوق کے تقاضوں سے پوری طرح ہم آہنگ بنائیں اور صنفی تشدد جیسی مشکلات کو دور کرنے کے لئے صوبے میں قانون کی حکمرانی اور  جمہوریت کو فروغ دیں۔
اس موقع پر شرکاء کو صوبے میں فوجداری انصاف کے اداروں کی کارکردگی کے بارے میں شہریوں کے خیالات کے تجزیہ سروے اور بیس لائن سٹڈی سے حاصل ہونے والی اہم معلومات سے بھی آگاہ کیا گیا۔ یہ معلومات ایک بنیادی معیار کا کام دیتی ہیں جنہیں استعمال کرتے ہوئے شہریوں کے خیالات اور صورتحال کے تقاضوں کے مطابق ایک لائحہ عمل اپنایا جا سکتا ہے جس سے شہریوں کا تحفظ اور سلامتی یقینی بنانے میں ایک طرف فوجداری نظام انصاف کی جائز و منصفانہ حیثیت، کارکردگی اور شفافیت میں بہتری آئے گی جبکہ دوسری جانب بیس لائن سٹڈی ان اداروں کی کارکردگی اور قانون کی حکمرانی کے سلسلے میں صوبے کے طے شدہ اہداف پر ہونے والی پیشرفت کا اندازہ لگانے کے لئے ایک پیمانے کا کام بھی دیتی ہے۔
ڈلیوری یونٹ نے اجلاس کو بالخصوص ڈیجیٹل پلیٹ فارمز کے شعبے میں ہونے والی پیشرفت سے آگاہ کیا۔ اس سلسلے میں ویب سائٹ کے ڈیمو کے ساتھ بتایا گیا کہ ویب سائٹ کو مسلسل بنیاد پر اپ ڈیٹ کیا جا رہا ہے تاکہ 'قانون کی حکمرانی روڈمیپ' کے تحت فوجداری نظام انصاف کی اصلاحات کو بھرپور انداز میں اجاگر کیا جا سکے۔ روڈمیپ کے بارے میں ڈیجیٹل طریقے سے معلومات مہیا کرنے کے لئے ایک ڈیش بورڈ ترتیب دیا گیا ہے جہاں شواہد پر مبنی  تجزیاتی معلومات کو یکجا کیا گیا ہے اور فوجداری نظام انصاف کے اداروں کو پالیسی اور عملی دونوں طرح کی معلومات بآسانی مل سکتی ہیں۔
یہ روڈمیپ پراجیکٹ اپنی نوعیت کا پہلا اور جدت آمیز طریقہ ہے جو گورننس کے مضبوط ڈھانچے اور باقاعدہ جائزوں کی شکل میں شواہد پر مبنی پالیسی  اور اصلاحات کے عمل کو آگے بڑھانے میں مدد دیتا ہے۔
سٹیرنگ کمیٹی کے منتظمین نے اجلاس میں شرکت پر تمام متعلقہ فریقوں کا شکریہ ادا کیا اور پراجیکٹ کے سلسلے میں یو این او ڈی سی کی کوششوں اور برٹش ہائی کمیشن کی مسلسل اور بھرپور معاونت پر انہیں خراج تحسین پیش کیا۔

Fruits and vegetables are the cornerstone of a healthy and varied diet.  They provide the human body with an abundance of nutrients, strengthen immune systems and help lower risks for a number of diseases.  Yet, despite these tremendous benefits, we do not consume enough of them.
By declaring 2021 as the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables, we are taking a closer look at a critical sector and urging the adoption of a more holistic approach to production and consumption that benefits human and environmental health.
A key moment in the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables will be the Food Systems Summit where we will call on all stakeholders to intensify efforts to make food systems more inclusive, resilient and sustainable.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development emphasizes the role our food systems play in fighting hunger, ending poverty and protecting our planet.  Yet, today, rising populations, increased urbanization, the growing scarcity of natural resources, agricultural pollution and land use change, high levels of food loss and waste and the impacts of climate change are all highlighting the fragility of our food systems.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the health and livelihoods of people across the world, we must come together to ensure that nutritious food, including fruits and vegetables, reaches the most vulnerable, leaving no one behind.
Let us use this International Year to rethink our relationship with how we produce and consume food.  Let us re-examine our food systems and commit to a healthier, more resilient and sustainable world where everyone can access and afford the diverse nutrition they need.

Broken societies put people and planet on collision course, says UNDP
An experimental global index offers a new measurement of human progress that illustrates the challenge of tackling poverty and inequality while easing planetary pressure.
New York, 15 December 2020 – The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest crisis facing the world, but unless humans release their grip on nature, it won’t be the last, according to a new report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which includes a new experimental index on human progress that takes into account countries’ carbon dioxide emissions and material footprint.
The report lays out a stark choice for world leaders - take bold steps to reduce the immense pressure that is being exerted on the environment and the natural world, or humanity’s progress will stall.
“Humans wield more power over the planet than ever before. In the wake of COVID-19, record- breaking temperatures and spiraling inequality, it is time to use that power to redefine what we mean by progress, where our carbon and consumption footprints are no longer hidden,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.
“As this report shows, no country in the world has yet achieved very high human development without putting immense strain on the planet. But we could be the first generation to right this wrong. That is the next frontier for human development,” he said.
The report argues that as people and planet enter an entirely new geological epoch, the Anthropocene or the Age of Humans, it is time to for all countries to redesign their paths to progress by fully accounting for the dangerous pressures humans put on the planet, and dismantle the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that prevent change.
To illustrate the point, the 30th anniversary edition of the Human Development Report, The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene, introduces an experimental new lens to its annual Human Development Index (HDI).
By adjusting the HDI, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standards of living, to include two more elements: a country’s carbon dioxide emissions and its material footprint, the index shows how the global development landscape would change if both the wellbeing of people and also the planet were central to defining humanity’s progress.
With the resulting Planetary-Pressures Adjusted HDI – or PHDI - a new global picture emerges, painting a less rosy but clearer assessment of human progress. For example, more than 50 countries drop out of the very high human development group, reflecting their dependence on fossil fuels and material footprint.
Despite these adjustments, countries like Costa Rica, Moldova, and Panama move upwards by at least 30 places, recognizing that lighter pressure on the planet is possible.
“The Human Development Report is an important product by the United Nations. In a time where action is needed, the new generation of Human Development Reports, with greater emphasis on the defining issues of our time such as climate change and inequalities, helps us to steer our efforts towards the future we want,” said Stefan Löfven, Prime Minister of Sweden, host country of the launch of the report.
The next frontier for human development will require working with and not against nature, while transforming social norms, values, and government and financial incentives, the report argues.
For example, new estimates project that by 2100 the poorest countries in the world could experience up to 100 more days of extreme weather due to climate change each year- a number that could be cut in half if the Paris Agreement on climate change is fully implemented.
And yet fossil fuels are still being subsidized: the full cost to societies of publicly financed subsidies for fossil fuels - including indirect costs - is estimated at over US$5 trillion a year, or 6.5 percent of global GDP, according to International Monetary Fund figures cited in the report.
Reforestation and taking better care of forests could alone account for roughly a quarter of the pre-2030 actions we must take to stop global warming from reaching two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
“While humanity has achieved incredible things, it is clear that we have taken our planet for granted,” said Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy Youth. “Across the world young people have spoken up, recognizing that these actions put our collective future at risk. As the 2020 Human Development Report makes clear, we need to transform our relationship with the planet — to make energy and material consumption sustainable, and to ensure every young person is educated and empowered to appreciate the wonders that a healthy world can provide.”
How people experience planetary pressures is tied to how societies work, says Pedro Conceição, Director of UNDP’s Human Development Report Office and lead author of the report, and today, broken societies are putting people and planet on a collision course.
Inequalities within and between countries, with deep roots in colonialism and racism, mean that people who have more capture the benefits of nature and export the costs, the report shows. This chokes opportunities for people who have less and minimizes their ability to do anything about it.
For example, land stewarded by indigenous peoples in the Amazon absorbs, on a per person basis, the equivalent carbon dioxide of that emitted by the richest 1 percent of people in the world. However, indigenous peoples continue to face hardship, persecution and discrimination, and have little voice in decision-making, according to the report.
And discrimination based on ethnicity frequently leaves communities severely affected and exposed to high environmental risks such as toxic waste or excessive pollution, a trend that is reproduced in urban areas across continents, argue the authors.
According to the report, easing planetary pressures in a way that enables all people to flourish in this new age requires dismantling the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that stand in the way of transformation.
Public action, the report argues, can address these inequalities, with examples ranging from increasingly progressive taxation, to protecting coastal communities through preventive investment and insurance, a move that could safeguard the lives of 840 million people who live along the world’s low elevation coastlines. But there must be a concerted effort to ensure that actions do not further pit people against planet.
“The next frontier for human development is not about choosing between people or trees; it’s about recognizing, today, that human progress driven by unequal, carbon-intensive growth has run its course,” said Pedro Conceição.
“By tackling inequality, capitalizing on innovation and working with nature, human development could take a transformational step forward to support societies and the planet together,” he said.

WFP CHIEF URGES WORLD TO USE ITS WEALTH TO PREVENT FAMINE IN NOBEL ACCEPTANCE SPEECH
Transcript as delivered of the speech given by UN World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley during today’s Nobel Peace Prize acceptance ceremony.
ROME:
Waking up this morning in the beautiful city of Rome, it is hard to imagine that in about 400 AD this city experienced a massive famine, that ended up killing almost 90% of its population.  Students of history associate something else with that ancient date:  the beginning of the Fall of the Roman Empire.  Now, did the famine cause the fall?  Or did the fall cause the famine?  I think the answer is yes — both.
Waking up in this wealthy, modern, technologically advanced world, it’s hard to imagine us going through a famine like that.  But my tragic duty today is to tell you: famine is at humanity’s doorstep.  For millions and millions of people on earth.
Failure to prevent famine in our day will destroy so many lives and cause the fall of much we hold dear.
On behalf of Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations, our Board, our sister agencies, our incredible partners and donors and most importantly on  behalf of 19,000 peacemakers at the World Food Programme, and for all those who came before us, especially those who died in the line of duty and their families who carry on, and on behalf of the 100 million hungry people we serve, to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, thank you, for this great honour.
Also, thank you for acknowledging our work of using food to combat hunger, to mitigate against destabilization of nations, to prevent mass migration, to end conflict and… to create stability and peace.
We believe food is the pathway to peace.
I wish today that I could speak of how working together we could end world hunger for all the 690 million people who go to bed hungry every night. But, today we have a crisis at hand.
This Nobel Peace Prize is more than a thank you. It is a call to action. Because of so many wars, climate change, the widespread use of hunger as a political and military weapon, and a global health pandemic that makes all of that exponentially worse —270 million people are marching toward starvation.  Failure to address their needs will cause a hunger pandemic which will dwarf the impact of COVID.
And if that’s not bad enough, out of that 270 million, 30 million depend on us 100% for their survival.
How will humanity respond?
Let me tell you why what we do at the World Food Programme works.
First, food is sacred.  Anyone who has sat down to a Thanksgiving or a holiday meal, or taken communion, attended a Seder, fasted for Ramadan or made a food offering at a Buddhist temple knows that.
And every human, whether they are people of faith or not, knows the power of food not only to sustain us, but bring us together in our common humanity.
Here’s the second reason the World Food Programme works: because what the 19,000 of us are doing is an act of love.  Dr. King, Nobel Laureate in 1964 said, “Love is the most durable power in the world.”
And, like Dr. King, from a very young age, I learned this teaching from Jesus of Nazareth, as he taught from the Torah: “Love your neighbour as yourself.”  I have come to understand that a better translation of what Jesus actually said was “Love your neighbour as your equal.”   Think for a moment what that really means.
Imagine every woman, man, girl and boy we share this planet with is our equal … and if we would just love them as such. Imagine what that would do to war, to conflict, to racism, to division, and to discrimination of every kind.
What warms my heart is this: 100 million of my equals – my neighbours - received food from the World Food Programme this last year and we averted famine.
What tears me up inside is this: this coming year, millions and millions and millions of my equals – my neighbours, your neighbours - are marching to the brink of starvation.
We stand at what may be the most ironic moment in modern history. On the one hand — after a century of massive strides in eliminating extreme poverty, today those 270 million of our neighbours are on the brink of starvation.  That’s more than the entire population of Western Europe.
On the other hand, there is $400 trillion dollars of wealth in our world today.  Even at the height of the COVID pandemic, in just 90 days, an additional $2.7 trillion dollars of wealth was created. And we only need $5 billion dollars to save 30 million lives from famine.
What am I missing here?
A lot of my friends and leaders around the world have said to me, “You’ve got the greatest job in the world, saving the lives of millions of people.”
Well, here is what I tell them: “I don’t go to bed at night thinking about the children we saved, I go to bed weeping over the children we could not save. And, when we don’t have enough money, nor the access we need, we have to decide which children eat and which children do not eat, which children live, which children die.  How would you like that job?”
Please don’t ask us to choose who lives and who dies.
In the spirit of Alfred Nobel, as inscribed on this medal - “peace and brotherhood” - let’s feed them all.
Food is the pathway to peace.

Broadcast quality footage of the ceremony and speech will be released later this afternoon. Please contact jonathan.dumont@wfp.org or wfp.media@wfp.org for more details.

Balochistan launches Gender Equality & Women Empowerment Policy 2020-2024 on Human Rights Day
QUETTA: Women Development Department (WDD) Balochistan, in collaboration with UN Women Pakistan, launched the Provincial Gender Equality and Women Empowerment Policy (2020-2024) here on Thursday. The policy was approved by the Provincial Cabinet earlier in the month of October. Addressing the launching ceremony, which coincided with the commemoration of International Human Rights Day and culmination of 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence (GBV), the Chief Minister Balochistan Jam Kamal Khan said that the approval and launch of the policy reaffirms the commitment of the provincial government towards advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women in the province.
The launch event was attended by parliamentarians, provincial government officials, members of civil society, representatives from UN and donor agencies and media.
The Chief Minister said, “Today is an important day for the women of Balochistan. Effective implementation of this policy, which provides a guideline to all departments, will help uplift the status of women in the province.”
Jam Kamal added that anti-harassment cells have been established at district level across the province to ensure women work in harassment free environment. “For the first time in the history of Balochistan, numerous Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) schemes have been initiated to empower women of Balochistan,” he said while adding, “The provincial government is committed to ensure equal rights for women and we are in the process of finalizing the Heirship Law and other pro-women legislations.”
Addressing the launch event, Chief Secretary Balochistan Capt. (r) Fazeel Asghar, said “I want to congratulate the Women Development Department for the formal launch of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment Policy, and hope that this policy will contribute to the social, economic and political empowerment of women as well as enhancing the leadership role of women in humanitarian crisis.”
Secretary WDD, Bilal Jamali said, “Women Development Department endeavours to protect women from violence and provides them with the opportunities to contribute in the development of the province. The GEWE Policy has been re-aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with an extensive review by the WDD and technical expertise provided by UN Women.”
He informed the audience that work on approved PSDP schemes for the year 2020-21 was underway including women business incubation centres, women bazars in Quetta, Khuzdar, Kharan, Loralai, and Gwadar, and working women hostel for single women and women with families at divisional headquarters of Balochistan, while already established shelter homes in Quetta, Khuzdar and Sibi were providing services for women survivors of violence. “Through Women Economic Empowerment Council, WDD is extending and creating avenues for women to take advantage of economic opportunities.”
Addressing the event, Head of UN Women Sub Office Balochistan, Ayesha Wadood highlighted the significance of the pro-women Legislative reforms for Balochistan province and also briefed the audience about the normative work of UN Women Pakistan to help federal and provincial governments deliver on country’s national and international commitments towards advancing gender equality.

Overcoming gaps in legislation and implementation critical to protect and uphold human rights, says Shireen Mazari
ISLAMABAD: It is important to take stock of the critical advancements that have been made towards the promotion and protection of human rights in Pakistan, as well as the barriers and obstacles that we have to overcome at an institutional and societal level to ensure that every citizen can live a life in which their integral human dignity and their rights are respected, said the Federal Minister for Human Rights, Shireen Mazari at an event to mark the International Human Rights Day and culmination of 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) campaign in Pakistan. The event was jointly hosted by the Ministry of Human Rights and UN Women at the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Crisis Centre (SBBCC) in Islamabad on Thursday, where survivors of violence shared their experiences and gave suggestions on how institutions and duty-bearers can be more responsive to them.
Representatives from legal fraternity, police, civil society, government officials, and UN and diplomatic community attended the event which was held both online and in-person. A video of an acid survivor’s journey and her struggle to get the perpetrator behind bars was also shown during the event to highlight the plight of survivors as well as shine light on their courage and resilience.
“With an emphasis on overcoming gaps in legislation, strengthening implementation, and increasing awareness about human rights, the Ministry of Human Rights is committed to upholding the human rights enshrined in the constitution of Pakistan,” remarked the Minister.
The Minister also inaugurated a computer lab at SBBCC, established with support from UN Women Pakistan, where residents will be taken through several computer skills with an objective to rehabilitate and enable them to fight poverty and become independent citizens.
16 Days of Activism against GBV is a global campaign that takes place each year from 25th November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10th December, International Human Rights Day, highlighting the continued prevalence of violence against women worldwide and the need to take concerted action to prevent and respond to it. The campaign is used as an organizing strategy by individuals and organizations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls.
Given the COVID-19 pandemic situation, this year’s theme for the 16 Days of Activism against GBV was “Fund, Respond, Prevent, Collect!” that called for global actions to bridge funding gaps, ensure essential services for survivors of violence during the COVID-19 crisis, focus on prevention, and collection of data that can improve life-saving services for women and girls.
“Today’s event brought together diverse stakeholders impacted by, and working to end, violence against women in Pakistan,” stated Canadian High Commissioner to Pakistan, Wendy Gilmour. “It was a valuable exchange and will help ensure that ongoing efforts to strengthen systems and services are informed by, and responsive to, survivors and their needs”.
Joanne Frederiksen, Deputy High Commissioner of Australia in Pakistan, said, “Gender-based violence is a barrier to lasting peace, a burden on economies and a violation of human rights. It is a global challenge, that while serious at any time, is particularly devastating during COVID-19 when access to help is limited. Today may mark the end of the 16 Days of Activism Campaign to eliminate gender-based violence, but Australia’s advocacy and support in Pakistan will continue year-round. After all, to live free from violence is a basic human right.”
Country Representative UN Women Pakistan Sharmeela Rassool in her remarks deliberated on the issue of increasing incidence of GBV in Pakistan especially an escalation during the pandemic. She said, “Women face numerous problems, and among the most serious is violence, which is a grave violation of human rights. The problem of gender-based violence that is affecting Pakistan is global, and of pandemic nature. One in three women experience violence in their lives. We need to have a holistic approach and it should be business of everybody to deal with it,” said Sharmeela, who was attending the event from Violence Against Women Centre in Multan, where a similar activity was hosted by UN Women and both events were interconnected to share best practices in order to help women survivors living in shelters rehabilitate and reintegrate in the society and explore their potentials.
Sharmeela stressed the need for robust coordination mechanisms across sectors and between the provinces and the federation to help GBV survivors access speedy justice as well as quality essential services to face the challenges. She informed the audience that during this year’s campaign, UN Women adopted a different approach and not only involved all stakeholders including legislators, judiciary, police, religious leaders, private sector, civil society and academia to identify collaborative and coordinated solutions to reform and strengthen the justice system but also took pledges to advance efforts for effective and sustainable measures to address the issue of violence.
“UN Women will continue to monitor progress made on the commitments by all stakeholders and help strengthen processes and services for survivors’ access to justice as well as undertake awareness-raising and advocacy for both the promulgation and implementation of laws in order to ensure that survivors are rehabilitated and reintegrated in society and lead a better life with respect and dignity,” she remarked.

انسانی حقوق کا عالمی دن
قانون سازی اور عملدرآمد کے درمیان خلاء کو دور کرنا انسانی حقوق کے تحفظ اور پاسداری کے لئے ناگزیر ہے: شیریں مزاری
اسلام آباد: انسانی حقوق کی وفاقی وزیر، شیریں مزاری نے کہا ہے کہ انسانی حقوق کے تحفظ اور فروغ کے سلسلے میں پاکستان نے جو   نمایاں بہتری دکھائی ہے، اس کے ساتھ ساتھ اداروں اور معاشرے کی سطح پر ان رکاوٹوں اور بندشوں کو پیش نظر رکھنا بھی ضروری ہے جن پر قابو پا کر ہم اس امر کو یقینی بنا رہے ہیں کہ ہر شہری ایسی زندگی بسر کر سکے جس میں اس کے انسانی وقار اور حقوق کا احترام کیا جائے۔ وہ انسانی حقوق کے عالمی دن اور پاکستان میں صنفی تشدد کے خلاف 16 روزہ سرگرمیوں کے اختتام کے موقع پر منعقد کی گئی ایک تقریب سے خطاب کر رہی تھیں جس کا اہتمام انسانی حقوق کی وزارت اور یو این ویمن پاکستان نے مشترکہ طور پر شہید بے نظیر بھٹو کرائسس سنٹر، اسلام آباد میں جمعرات کو کیا۔ اس موقع پر تشدد کا مقابلہ کرنے والی کئی خواتین نے شرکاء کو اپنی روداد سنائی اور اپنی تجاویز بھی پیش کیں کہ مختلف ادارے اور ذمہ داران اس سلسلے میں اپنی سرگرمیوں کو کس طرح زیادہ موثر بنا سکتے ہیں۔
شعبہ قانون، پولیس، سول سوسائٹی، حکومتی اداروں، اقوام متحدہ کے اداروں اور سفارتی برادری کے نمائندوں کی بڑی تعداد نے اس تقریب میں شرکت کی جس کا انعقاد براہ راست آن لائن بھی کیا گیا۔ تیزاب گردی کا شکار ہونے والی ایک خاتون کی کہانی پر مبنی ایک وڈیو بھی اس موقع پر دکھائی گئی جس میں بتایا گیا کہ کس طرح اس خاتون نے مجرم کو قانون کے کٹہرے میں لانے کے لئے جدوجہد کی۔یہ وڈیو اس مقصد کے تحت تیار کی گئی کہ نہ صرف متاثرہ افراد کی  حالت زار پر روشنی ڈالی جائے بلکہ ان کی ہمت، حوصلے اور پختہ عزم کو بھی اجاگر کیا جائے۔
اپنے خیالات کا اظہار کرتے ہوئے وفاقی وزیر نے کہا کہ انسانی حقوق سے متعلق قوانین میں موجود خلاء کو دور کرنے، ان پر عملدرآمد کو مضبوط بنانے، اور ان کے بارے میں آگاہی میں اضافہ پر زور دیتے ہوئے وزارت انسانی حقوق نے آئینِ پاکستان کی روشنی میں انسانی حقوق کی مکمل پاسداری کا تہیہ کر رکھا ہے۔
وفاقی وزیر نے اس موقع پر یو این ویمن پاکستان کی مدد سے شہید بے نظیر بھٹو کرائسس سنٹر میں قائم کی گئی کمپیوٹر لیب کا افتتاح بھی کیا جس کی بدولت اس مرکز کی رہائشی خواتین کمپیوٹر کی  مختلف مہارتیں حاصل کر سکیں گی جو ان کی بحالی ، غربت سے نجات اور آزاد شہری بننے کی کوششوں میں انہیں مدد دیں گی۔
صنفی تشدد کے خلاف 16 روزہ سرگرمیاں، ایک عالمی مہم ہے جن کا آغاز ہر سال 25 نومبر کو خواتین پر تشدد کے خاتمہ کے عالمی دن  سے ہوتا ہے اور 10 دسمبر کو انسانی حقوق کے عالمی دن تک جاری رہتی ہیں۔ اس دوران دنیا بھر میں خواتین پر تشدد کے مسلسل رجحان اور اس کی روک تھام  کے سلسلے میں بھرپور کارروائیوں کی ضرورت کو اجاگر کیا جاتا ہے۔ اس مہم کو دنیا بھر کے افراد اور ادارے ایک ایسی تنظیمی حکمت عملی کے  طور پر استعمال کرتے ہیں جس کے ذریعے لوگوں سے خواتین اور لڑکیوں پر ہر طرح کے تشدد کے خاتمہ اور روک تھام میں اپنا کردار ادا کرنے کی اپیل کی جاتی ہے۔
کرونا وائرس کے باعث موجودہ حالات کے پیش نظر، رواں سال،  صنفی تشدد کے خلاف 16 روزہ سرگرمیوں کا انعقاد "فنڈ کریں، جوابی اقدام کریں، روک تھام کریں، جمع کریں" کے مرکزی پیغام کے تحت کیا گیا جس کا مقصد فنڈز کی کمی کو دور کرنے، کرونا وائرس کے بحران کے دوران تشدد سے متاثرہ افراد کے لئے لازمی خدمات کی فراہمی یقینی بنانے، روک تھام ، اور ایسے اعدادوشمار جمع کرنے پر زور دینا تھا جن کے ذریعے خواتین اور لڑکیوں کے لئے جان بچانے والی خدمات کو بہتر بنایا جا سکے۔
پاکستان میں کینیڈا کی ہائی کمشنر، وینڈی گلمور نے تقریب سے خطاب کرتے ہوئے کہا کہ آج کی تقریب کی بدولت پاکستان میں خواتین پر تشدد سے متاثر ہونے والوں اور اس کے خاتمہ کے لئے سرگرم مختلف شعبہ ہائے زندگی کے متعلقہ فریقوں کو یکجا کرنے کا موقع ملا۔ اس طرح انہوں نے نہ صرف آپس میں خیالات کا تبادلہ کیا بلکہ اس بات کو یقینی بنانے میں بھی مدد ملے گی کہ متعلقہ نظام اور خدمات کو مضبوط بنانے کی کوششوں میں متاثرہ افراد سے معلومات لی جائیں  اور ان کی روشنی میں ان کی ضروریات کو پورا کیا جائے۔
پاکستان میں آسٹریلیا کی ڈپٹی ہائی کمشنر جوان فریڈرکسن کا کہنا تھا کہ صنفی تشدد پائیدار امن میں ایک رکاوٹ ہے، معیشت پر ایک بوجھ ہے اور انسانی حقوق کے منافی ہے۔ یہ ایک عالمی چیلنج ہے جو کسی بھی حال میں ایک طرف تو سنگین ہے اور دوسری جانب کرونا وائرس کی وباء جیسے حالات میں جب مدد تک رسائی محدود ہوتی ہے، خاص طور پر تباہ کن ثابت ہوتا ہے۔ انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ آج صنفی تشدد کے خاتمہ کی 16 روزہ سرگرمیاں اپنے اختتام کو پہنچ رہی ہیں لیکن آسٹریلیا کی جانب سے پاکستان میں اس سے متعلق ایڈووکیسی سرگرمیوں اور معاونت کا سلسلہ جاری رہے گا کیونکہ کسی بھی صورت میں تشدد سے پاک زندگی گزارنا ایک بنیادی انسانی حق ہے۔
یو این ویمن پاکستان کی کنٹری ریپریزنٹیٹو، شرمیلا رسول نے اپنے خیالات کا اظہار کرتے ہوئے پاکستان میں بالخصوص وباء کے دوران صنفی تشدد کے واقعات میں اضافے کے مسئلے پر روشنی ڈالی۔ ان کا کہنا تھا کہ خواتین کو لاتعداد مسائل درپیش ہیں جن میں تشدد سب سے سنگین ہے جو انسانی حقوق کی سنگین خلاف ورزی ہے۔ انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ صنفی تشدد کا مسئلہ محض پاکستان کا نہیں بلکہ پوری دنیا کا مسئلہ ہے اور یہ وبائی نوعیت کا حامل ہے۔ شرمیلا رسول نے بتایا کہ اوسطاً ہر تیسری خاتون کو اپنی زندگی میں تشدد کا سامنا کرنا پڑتا ہے۔ ہمیں اس سے نمٹنے کے لئے کلی سوچ پر مبنی لائحہ عمل اپنانا ہو گا اور یہ کسی ایک فرد کی نہیں بلکہ ہر فرد کی ذمہ داری ہونی چاہئے۔ خیال رہے کہ شرمیلا رسول نے ملتان کے 'وائلنس اگینسٹ ویمن سنٹر' سے آن لائن طریقے سے تقریب میں شرکت کی جہاں یو این ویمن کی جانب سے اسی طرح کی ایک تقریب کا انعقاد کیا گیا تھا اور ان دونوں تقاریب کو آپس میں جوڑنے سے نہ صرف شرکاء کو پناہ گاہوں اور خصوصی مراکز میں رہنے والی متاثرہ خواتین کی مدد کے بہترین طریقوں پر باہمی تبادلہ خیالات کا موقع ملا بلکہ امید ہے کہ ان کی بحالی اور انہیں دوبارہ معاشرے کا حصہ بنانے اور ان کی صلاحیتوں کو بروئے کار لانے میں بھی مدد ملے گی۔
شرمیلا رسول نے اپنے خطاب میں زور دیا کہ صنفی تشدد  کے متاثرین کو انصاف تک فوری رسائی میں مدد دینے اور مشکل حالات کا مقابلہ کرنے کے لئے ضروری معیاری خدمات کی فراہمی یقینی بنانے کے لئے مختلف شعبوں  کے درمیان اور وفاق اور صوبوں کے درمیان کوآرڈینیشن کے مضبوط نظام وضع کرنے کی ضرورت ہے۔ انہوں نے شرکاء کو بتایا کہ رواں سال کی مہم کے دوران یو این ویمن نے ایک نیا لائحہ عمل اپنایا اور مقننہ، عدلیہ و پولیس کے ارکان، مذہبی رہنماؤں، نجی شعبے، سول سوسائٹی اور شعبہ تدریس سمیت تمام متعلقہ فریقوں کو ساتھ ملا کر نہ صرف نظام عدل کی اصلاح اور استحکام کے لئے اشتراک عمل پر مبنی طریقے وضع کرنے پر کام کیا بلکہ ان سے وعدے بھی لئے کہ وہ تشدد کے مسئلے کے ازالے کے لئے موثر اور پائیدار اقدامات کو آگے بڑھانے کی کوششیں کریں گے۔
شرمیلا رسول نے کہا کہ یو این ویمن تمام متعلقہ فریقوں کی طرف سے کئے گئے وعدوں پر ہونے والی پیشرفت کی مسلسل نگرانی کرے گا اور نہ صرف متاثرہ افراد کو انصاف تک رسائی دینے کے طریقوں اور خدمات کو مستحکم بنانے میں مدد دے گا بلکہ قوانین کے نفاذ اور عملدرآمد پر آگاہی اور ایڈووکیسی سرگرمیوں کے ذریعے اس امر کو یقینی بنانے کی کوشش بھی کرے گا کہ متاثرہ افراد کی بحالی اور انہیں دوبارہ معاشرے کا حصہ بنانےکے لئے اقدامات کئے جائیں تاکہ وہ ایک باوقار اور باعزت زندگی گزار سکیں۔

INCLUDING HIV PREVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES IN PAKISTAN’S ESSENTIAL PACKAGE OF HEALTH SERVICES: A PIONEERING INITIATIVE
Islamabad, 9 December 2020: The Government of Pakistan has recently launched another landmark initiative, the Essential Package of Health Services—its national version of universal health coverage. Universal health coverage is a globally promoted initiative and is in line with Pakistan’s commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly target 3 on health for all and leaving no one behind.
Prime Minister Imran Khan said: “Pakistan has adopted an essential list of health services, which, once implemented, will put into action a set of preventive and curative interventions without stigma, delivered at the primary and secondary levels, that directly impact upon the health of vulnerable populations and marginalized communities; will help to achieve our human development goals; and will reduce the burden of many diseases and conditions, including HIV and AIDS.”
The Essential Package of Health Services will benefit everyone, including the furthest marginalized populations in geographically far-flung areas, and will improve access to lifesaving and life-prolonging services.
Pakistan has also recognized pro-poor health strategies for responding to the HIV epidemic and the need to significantly increase public-sector investment at the federal and provincial levels to enhance primary health-care services.
This comprehensive package, which includes HIV prevention and treatment services, is a compelling vision of a future in which everyone, including people at the grassroots level, has access to health services that are responsive to their needs and are provided in a timely manner.
Dr Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health, emphasized: “The provision of many health-promotive, preventive and curative services is effectively possible only if woven into the normal delivery of care at the primary level. HIV is not an exception, and its quality of care will benefit greatly once it is part of a universal package.”
The Essential Package of Health Services includes specific services for people living with or affected by HIV, including:
The 90,000 community-based Lady Health Workers (LHW) all over the country mandated to provide primary, preventive, promotive and curative care services mainly in remote rural and urban slum communities will now play a stronger role in providing HIV education and referral services at the community level. Comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support services will now be an integral part of LHW Programme, thus normalizing HIV and reducing HIV related stigma. In the long run, it is expected to increase the uptake of HIV services and improve the quality of lives of people living with and affected by HIV.  

Highlighting equitable access to health services, Dr Zafar Mirza, former Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health and now WHO Advisor on Universal Health Coverage, said: “Pakistan is well on its way in advancing universal health coverage. Steady expansion of social health insurance for poor people and vulnerable groups and launching of the national essential services package are major milestones. Universal health coverage promotes equity and promotes affirmative action for marginalized and vulnerable people, including people living with HIV, people who use drugs, transgender people and other vulnerable populations.
Aware of the limited resources available, the Government of Pakistan is carefully calibrating decisions to ensure it can bring the greatest impact for people in need. Its success depends on the delivery of all interventions that are critical for good health, including prevention and other non-medical interventions, such as awareness-raising, advocacy, treatment adherence support, and linking key populations to friendly health services.
“I am so glad this is happening now, and I am excited not only for myself but for my brothers and sisters living with HIV, to benefit from this government program. This programme will help normalize the HIV response in the country along with addressing stigma and discrimination and capacity strengthening of health care providers”, said Asghar Satti, National Coordinator, Association of People Living with HIV and AIDS
UNAIDS strongly believes that ensuring access to good-quality services for all, at the time and place where they are needed, is critical to the success of universal health coverage. Dr Maria Elena Filio Borromeo, UNAIDS Country Director for Pakistan, reiterated: “The inclusion of HIV prevention and treatment services in the Essential Package of Health Services is a positive step towards improving access to comprehensive HIV services—not for some but for all. With its effective implementation, Pakistan could sustain its HIV response and potentially end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.”

This Media Update includes:
In recent years, anger and frustration have erupted at corrupt leaders and governments. In some countries, people have taken to the streets with demands for social justice and accountability.
Amidst these deep concerns, the COVID-19 crisis creates additional opportunities for corruption. Governments are spending rapidly to get economies back on track, provide emergency support and procure medical supplies. Oversight may be weaker. And the development of vaccines and treatments adds to the risk of bribery and profiteering.
Corruption drains resources from people who need them, undermines trust in institutions, exacerbates the vast inequalities exposed by the virus, and hinders a strong recovery. We cannot allow stimulus funds and vital emergency resources to be diverted.
Recovery from the pandemic must include measures to prevent and combat corruption and bribery. We need broad partnerships to strengthen oversight, accountability and transparency, building on the global anti-corruption tools provided by the United Nations Conventions against Corruption.
Action against corruption should be part of broader national and international reforms and initiatives to strengthen good governance, tackle illicit financial flows and tax havens, and return stolen assets, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. We must take the opportunity for ambitious reforms and initiatives at the first-ever General Assembly special session against corruption next year.
On International Anti-Corruption Day, all of us – governments, businesses, civil society and all stakeholders – must resolve to work together to promote accountability and end corruption and bribery for a more just and equal world.

Message for International Anti-Corruption Day
9 December 2020 
VIENNA, 9 December (UN Information Service) — The 2020 International Anti-Corruption Day comes as our world has been shattered by a global pandemic that continues to unfold.
The COVID-19 crisis threatens to push more than 100 million people into extreme poverty this year alone.
To save lives and livelihoods, governments are spending and fast-tracking economic stimulus packages. Corruption is targeting these emergency measures, weakening vital health and social systems, with lethal consequences.
People have lost jobs and social protection in the crisis, giving rise to dangerous frustrations and turmoil. In our time of greatest need, corruption is fuelling even greater instability.
Now more than ever, governments need to use the tools provided by the UN Convention against Corruption to further strengthen anti-corruption bodies, improve oversight over stimulus investments, and increase transparency and accountability.
As guardian of the Convention, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime has supported 179 countries to date to implement this global framework, and we are working with governments to promote anti-corruption action in the COVID response and recovery.
A world made poorer and more fragile by the pandemic cannot afford to let corruption compromise our efforts to build forward, or our hopes for a fairer future.
We need to stand up for justice, and stand united against corruption.
Countries of destination and origin need to work as partners, to deny safe haven to the corrupt, stop illicit financial flows and return stolen assets.
Together, we can unleash the power of diversity and inclusion by engaging all actors – women and youth, the private sector, civil society and academia – to protect our systems against corrupt networks and practices, and end impunity.
In advancing anti-corruption action, we can build more resilient societies, and get back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
On this year’s International Anti-Corruption Day, let us commit to recovering better by recovering with integrity.

Ending gender-based violence crucial for peaceful and just society, say religious scholars
PESHAWAR: Religious leaders and scholars from different faith groups on Tuesday emphasized ending all forms of violence against women and girls terming it critical to building a peaceful society and maintaining and promoting interfaith harmony. They were invited for a dialogue by UN Women, Provincial Office Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and EVAW Alliance KP as part of commemoration of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence (GBV), a global campaign that runs from 25 November – International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women – to 10 December, the International Human Rights Day. The event was attended by religious scholars, members of EVAW Alliance, UN officials and civil society.
Religious scholars discussed the issue of GBV in detail and jointly signed a declaration condemning gender-based violence and pledging to play their role in sensitizing communities in order to prevent and eliminate GBV. They observed that, women, being the most vulnerable segment of the society and deprived of their basic rights, were more prone to violence followed by transgender community. “There is a need to strengthen state-run social protection networks and ensure the provision of required support to the vulnerable groups,” the scholars underlined.
“For prevention of gender-based violence, the State has primary responsibility to protect its citizens and religious leaders have a strong potential to influence the lives and behaviour of those who follow their faith and share their beliefs,” stressed the participating scholars.
Zainab Qaisar Khan, Provincial Head UN Women KP, said that like other parts of the world, GBV was also rampant in Pakistani society. “It can happen anywhere, anytime and across all classes irrespective of education level and income status. It can happen against boys, men, elderly and transgender but mostly the target are women and girls,” she remarked, while adding that GBV included, but was not limited to, domestic abuse, sexual violence including rape and honour crimes.
Qamar Naseem, Co-Chair EVAW/G Alliance, threw some light on the role of religious leaders, while stating that religious leaders had great influence and could play a significant role in shaping the behaviours of local communities. He said, “It is essential to engage religious scholars from different faith groups, as a practical strategy, to raise awareness on gender-based violence and address the issue.”

UNDP and Unilever Pakistan to work together to make Rahim Yar Khan a Zero Plastic Waste City
Islamabad, 7 December  2020— UNDP Pakistan and Unilever Pakistan announced their partnership today to test solutions in an effort to minimize plastic waste in Rahim Yar Khan city.
Through this partnership, Unilever and UNDP will work together to enable the plastic waste management ecosystem in Rahim Yar Khan. This initiative will test solutions to reduce plastic waste, and potentially turn waste into resource. The key goal is to create a circular economy system for plastics waste management in Pakistan— by testing new economic models, industrial, and consumer behavior, policy shift and, engaging private sector, and other non-traditional partners.
A virtual event was held today to commemorate this partnership. Present at the event were Ms. Aliona Niculita, Resident Representative a.i., UNDP Pakistan; Mr. Amanullah Khan, Assistant Resident Representative, and Head of Environment and Climate Change Unit (ECCU), UNDP Pakistan; and Mr. Amir Paracha, CEO Unilever Pakistan Ltd, along with relevant representatives of UNDP Pakistan, Unilever Pakistan Ltd, and local government of Rahim Yar Khan City.
Rahim Yar Khan city is home to Unilever’s first and largest factory in Pakistan, and is of key strategic importance to the company’s national footprint. Unilever recently announced a multipronged ambition to reduce its plastic footprint and to play its role towards a circular economy. The company has pledged to collect more plastic than it sells as part of its environmental responsibility.
This vision is also inline of UNDP’s global commitment to work with governments worldwide on business solutions for waste management. UNDP Pakistan is part of the regional cohort of five Countries (Pakistan, Maldives, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and Philippines) that are working on the challenge of plastic waste management with the Regional Innovation Center in Bangkok. UNDP is also a regional partner to Unilever, and has been actively engaging with the company on its plastics waste management agenda.
“UNDP is committed to promote public private partnership  through innovative solutions to tackle complex development challenges,” stated Ms. Aliona Niculita, Resident Representative a.i. UNDP Pakistan. “UNDP’s plastic waste management portfolio is building a movement towards creating a circular economy for plastics in Pakistan. Through our partnership with Unilever Pakistan, we are working on creating innovative business solutions to turn waste into resource.”
Amir Paracha, Chairman & CEO, Unilever Pakistan added “Unilever has been a part of Pakistan since 1948, and we started that journey in the city of Rahim Yar Khan seven decades ago. This initiative is a means of giving back to our home city and to provide an economic model that can then be replicated across our country. We are confident that this partnership will identify a solution that will not only reduce plastic waste but also provide an opportunity for livelihoods to thousands of people across the country.”
The results from testing these solutions will provide field-tested and holistic insights on effective solutions to develop a larger programme and policy on plastic waste and circular economy.

Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and UNDP start week-long public awareness on human rights ahead of International Human Rights Day 2020
Peshawar, December 7, 2020—The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa together with UNDP Pakistan celebrated International Human Rights Day in Peshawar, under the slogan “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stands for Human Rights and Inclusive Recovery”. Due to recent spike in COVID-19 cases, the event was attended by limited number of people who strictly observed all SOPs.
The objective of the event was to raise public awareness on human rights principles and Pakistan’s national and international commitments of human rights, particularly the rights of marginalized communities including women, people with disabilities and transgender persons who have faced additional rights-based challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Speaking at the event Mr. Masood Ahmad, Secretary for Law, Parliamentary Affairs and Human Rights, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said: “The Provincial Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is taking all possible measures to ensure human rights of its citizens are protected, especially those who are vulnerable and marginalized”. He further said, that “although International Human Rights Day is celebrated on 10th December each year, we in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are taking the opportunity to observe and celebrate human rights progress and International Human Rights Day for the entirety of this week”.
UNDP’s Representative Mr. Ejaz Mustafa congratulated the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on their ongoing commitment to the protection, promotion and enforcement of human rights, of all those living in the province, while recognizing the emerging rights-based challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He iterated  that “UNDP looks forward to continued collaboration with the Department of Law, Parliamentary Affairs and Human Rights, including support to strengthening human rights policy implementation at all levels of governance, coordination and collection of human rights data and implementation of the Business and Human Rights National Action Plan.”
Secretary Masood Ahmed and representatives of the Social Welfare Department jointly distributed relief packages to the transgender community whose incomes were affected by the prevailing COVID-19 crisis. In the current situation, the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with facilitation from UNDP has taken several steps to ensure the protection and promotion of the rights of vulnerable populations who have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic i.e. women, children, transgender persons and persons with disabilities.

COVID-19 drives wages down, new ILO report finds
Even before the COVID pandemic hit, hundreds of millions of workers worldwide were being paid less than the minimum wage.
GENEVA (ILO News) – A new report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) has found that monthly wages fell or grew more slowly in the first six months of 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic , in two-thirds of countries for which official data was available, and that the crisis is likely to inflict massive downward pressure on wages in the near future.

The wages of women and low-paid workers have been disproportionately affected by the crisis.

Furthermore, while average wages in one-third of the countries that provided data appeared to increase, this was largely as a result of substantial numbers of lower-paid workers losing their jobs and therefore skewing the average, since they were no longer included in the data for wage-earners.

In countries where strong measures were taken to preserve employment, the effects of the crisis were felt primarily as falls in wages rather than massive job losses.

The Global Wage Report 2020/21  shows that not all workers have been equally affected by the crisis. The impact on women has been worse than on men. Estimates based on a sample of 28 European countries find that, without wage subsidies, women would have lost 8.1 per cent of their wages in the second quarter of 2020, compared to 5.4 per cent for men.
The crisis has also affected lower-paid workers severely. Those in lower-skilled occupations lost more working hours than higher-paying managerial and professional jobs. Using data from the group of 28 European countries the report shows that, without temporary subsidies, the lowest paid 50 per cent of workers would have lost an estimated 17.3 per cent of their wages.

Without subsidies, the average amount of wages lost across all groups would have been 6.5 per cent. However, wage subsidies compensated for 40 per cent of this amount.

“The growth in inequality created by the COVID-19 crisis threatens a legacy of poverty and social and economic instability that would be devastating,” said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder. “Our recovery strategy must be human-centred. We need adequate wage policies that take into account the sustainability of jobs and enterprises, and also address inequalities and the need to sustain demand. If we are going to build a better future we must also deal with some uncomfortable questions about why jobs with high social value, like carers and teachers, are very often linked to low pay.”
The report includes an analysis of minimum wage systems, which could play an important role in building a recovery that is sustainable and equitable. Minimum wages are currently in place in some form in 90 per cent of ILO Member States. But even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic the report finds that, globally, 266 million people – 15 per cent of all wage earners worldwide – were earning less than the hourly minimum wage, either because of non-compliance or because they were legally excluded from such schemes. Women are over-represented among workers earning the minimum wage or less.

“Adequate minimum wages can protect workers against low pay and reduce inequality,” said Rosalia Vazquez-Alvarez, one of the authors of the report. “But ensuring that minimum wage policies are effective requires a comprehensive and inclusive package of measures. It means better compliance, extending coverage to more workers, and setting minimum wages at an adequate, up-to-date level that allows people to build a better life for themselves and their families. In developing and emerging countries, better compliance will require moving people away from informal work and into the formal sector”.

The Global Wage Report 2020/21 also looks at wage trends in 136 countries in the four years preceding the pandemic. It found that global real wage growth fluctuated between 1.6 and 2.2 per cent. Real wages increased most rapidly in Asia and the Pacific and Eastern Europe and much more slowly in North America and northern, southern and western Europe.

KP Government looks at UNDP’s Amn-o-Insaf programme as flag bearer of rule of law interventions
Peshawar, 3 December 2020: – Despite the many challenges faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic, UNDP’s Amn-o-Insaf (AOI) Programme has been able to achieve its outputs and make significant progress in 2020. The Programme supports both the supply and demand sides of rule of law. This is made possible by strengthening justice institutions and citizen rights as well as deepening ongoing efforts to secure peace and stability in the country. The same was highlighted by UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative (a.i.) Ms. Aliona Niculita in her welcome remarks at AOI’s Annual Progress Review Board (PRB) Meeting held virtually yesterday.
Co-chaired by Additional Chief Secretary, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Mr. Shakeel Qadir Khan and UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative (a.i.) Aliona Niculita, the PRB was attended by representatives from KP Home Department, KP Police, KP Prosecution Department, Economic Affairs Division, KP Bar Council and donors including Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) and Government of Japan.
Mr. Shakeel Qadir Khan welcomed the participants and said that rule of law in the development sector is a new area for international assistance and the UNDP AOI is the flag bearer to attract more international support in the area.“In the past three years, I have seen UNDP AOI make major strides. What makes this programme unique is that it is a good blend of soft activities with infrastructural support”, he highlighted while mentioning the importance of the sector to Government of KP and stressing on the significance of development efforts in the Merged Areas (MAs). He also offered the support of Planning & Development Department to take the work further.
UNDP AOI Manager Mr. Jakhongir Khaydarov delivered a detailed presentation and highlighted areas of success for the programme during 2020. He mentioned that UNDP will be supporting PHC to establish 14 virtual courts in KP and MAs. Among achievements, digitization of case file record has been completed and the next phase is also anticipated, and UNDP has provided necessary institutional support to courts in MAs for their functionality.
Throughout this year, AOI has been working on the capacity building of judges and courts staff, which will continue next year as well.
In spite of the restrictions imposed due to Covid-19, 6731 persons, including 2204 women were made aware of their legal rights through legal awareness campaigns in MAs with the support of KP Bar Council and Civil Society Organization partner. The programme provided law libraries and bar room furniture to three bar associations in districts of the MAs namely Khyber, Mohmand and Bajaur and digitized KA Bar Council’s record room.
Mr. Jakhongir further highlighted that 100% of the original construction work at the Joint Police Training Center Nowshera under the INL Pakistan funding has been completed and savings of US $1.6 million that occurred are being used to build additional facilities. This is expected to be completed in 2021.
Looking forward to 2020, another successful year for UNDP and AOI, Mr. Jakhongir said that in addition to completion of several ongoing projects, five Model Police Stations will be constructed in the MAs with support from Government of Japan and support KP Police in training of 500 MAs police personal.
Moreover, four training centres to eradicate poppy cultivation will be constructed in KP and MAs with funding from Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.
Ms. Aliona Niculita appreciated the support of partners and said this meeting has given a great opportunity to identify gaps on where to direct additional efforts. The meeting successfully concluded with a vote of thanks.

This year’s global protests against systemic racism have brought renewed attention to a legacy of injustices all over the world whose roots lie in the dark history of colonialism and slavery.
But slavery is not simply a matter of history.
Today, more than 40 million people are still victims of contemporary slavery.
Women and girls account for over 71 per cent.
Slavery manifests itself today through descent-based servitude, forced labour, child labour, domestic servitude, forced marriage, debt bondage, trafficking in persons for the purpose of exploitation, including sexual exploitation, and the forced recruitment of children in armed conflict.
Poor and marginalized groups, in particular racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples and migrants, are disproportionally affected by contemporary forms of slavery.
Gender inequality further reinforces patterns of discrimination.
Today, I call on Member States, civil society and the private sector to strengthen their collective efforts to end these abhorrent practices.
I also call for support to identify, protect and empower victims and survivors, including by contributing to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery.
Next year is the 20th Anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference against Racism and Racial Discrimination.
This milestone document defines slavery and slavery-like practices as flagrant violations of human rights.
We cannot accept these violations in the 21st century.

Eighty eight percent of South Asia’s school-age children have no internet access at home, new UNICEF-ITU report says
The International Telecommunication Union and UNICEF call for urgent investment to bridge a digital divide currently preventing children and young people from accessing quality digital learning and opportunities online
NEW YORK/GENEVA/ISLAMABAD, 1 December 2020 – Eighty eight percent of South Asia’s school-age children do not have internet connection in their homes, according to a new joint report from UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
The report How Many Children and Youth Have Internet Access at Home? notes that globally two-thirds of school-age children have no internet access at home. There is a similar lack of access among young people aged 15-24 years old, with 759 million or 63 per cent of young people unconnected at home.
“That so many children and young people have no internet at home is more than a digital gap –it is a digital canyon,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “Lack of connectivity doesn’t just limit children and young people’s ability to connect online. It prevents them from competing in the modern economy. It isolates them from the world. And in the event of school closures, such as those currently experienced by millions due to COVID-19, it causes them to lose out on education. Put bluntly: Lack of internet access is costing the next generation their futures.”
In Pakistan, around 40 million children are affected by COVID-19 school closures forcing students to rely on virtual learning. For those with no internet access, education can be out of reach. Even before the pandemic, a growing cohort of young people needed to learn foundational, transferable, digital, job-specific and entrepreneurial skills to compete in the 21st century economy.
The digital divide is perpetuating inequalities that already divide countries and communities, the report notes. Children and young people from the poorest households, rural and lower income states are falling even further behind their peers and are left with very little opportunity to ever catch up.
Globally, among school-age children from richest households, 58 per cent have internet connection at home, compared with only 16 per cent from the poorest households. The same disparity exists across country income level as well. Less than 1 in 20 school-age children from low-income countries have internet connection at home, compared with nearly 9 in 10 from high-income countries.
There are also geographic disparities within countries and across regions. Globally, around 60 per cent of school-age children in urban areas do not have internet access at home, compared with around three-quarters of school-age children in rural households. School-age children in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are the most affected, with around 9 in 10 children unconnected.

Last year, UNICEF and ITU launched Giga, a global initiative to connect every school and its surrounding community to the Internet. Working with governments, Giga has now mapped over 800,000 schools in 30 countries. With this data, Giga works with governments, industry, civil sector, and private sector partners to craft compelling investment cases for blended public-private funding to build the connectivity infrastructure needed to deploy digital learning solutions and other services.
The initiative is now collaborating under the Reimagine Education initiative and in coordination with Generation Unlimited. Through its Reimagine Education initiative, UNICEF aims to address the learning crisis and transform education by giving children and young people equal access to quality digital learning. A key to achieving this is universal internet connectivity.
Building on these efforts and on the importance of youth engagement, Generation Connect is an initiative launched by ITU to empower young people to engage and participate in the digital world.
Although the numbers in the UNICEF-ITU report present an alarming picture, the situation is likely worse due to compounding factors, such as affordability, safety and low levels of digital skills. According to the latest ITU data, low digital skills remain a barrier to meaningful participation in a digital society, while mobile telephony and internet access remain too expensive for many in the developing world as the result of vast disparities in purchasing power.
Even when children have a connection at home, they may not be able to access it because of the pressure to do chores or to work, lack of sufficient devices in the households, girls being permitted less or no internet access, or a lack of understanding of how to access opportunities online. There are also issues related to online safety since parents may be inadequately prepared to keep their children safe.

With the world’s attention focused on the COVID-19 crisis, World AIDS Day is a reminder of the need to maintain focus on another global pandemic that is still with us nearly 40 years after it emerged.
Despite significant successes, the AIDS emergency is not over.  HIV still infects 1.7 million people each year and kills some 690 000.  And inequalities mean that those who are the least able to stand up for their rights are still the most affected.
COVID-19 has been a wake-up call to the world.  Inequalities in health affect all of us.  No one is safe unless we all are safe.
The HIV response has much to teach the fight against COVID-19.  We know that to end AIDS and defeat COVID-19 we must eliminate stigma and discrimination, put people at the centre and ground our responses in human rights and gender-responsive approaches.
Wealth should not determine whether people get the health care they need.  We need a COVID-19 vaccine and HIV treatments and care that are affordable and available to everyone, everywhere.
Health is a human right.  Health must be a top investment priority to achieve universal health coverage.  On this World AIDS Day let us recognize that, to overcome COVID-19 and end AIDS, the world must stand in solidarity and share responsibility.

BRT Peshawar joins call for ending violence against women to commemorate 16 Days of Activism campaign
Peshawar: Trans Peshawar, the operating company of the Peshawar’s BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) service, offers the Office of the Ombudsperson against Sexual Harassment at Workplace Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and UN Women in Peshawar to promote awareness messages and sensitize passengers on the issue of harassment at public places and violence against women through BRT buses and terminals as we continue to commemorate the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaign in Pakistan and worldwide.
To create awareness on the law for protection of women against harassment at public place, hundreds of posters on the Section 509 of Pakistan Penal Code were displayed in all the buses of the modern mass transit system in Peshawar city, on Monday. The Section 509 says, “Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any word, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen, by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished.”
This year’s 16 Days of Activism campaign is focusing on the emergence as the shadow pandemic of violence against women amid Covid-19. The global theme “Fund, Respond, Prevent, Collect!” calls for global actions to bridge funding gaps, ensure essential services for survivors of violence during the COVID-19 crisis, focus on prevention, and collection of data that can improve life-saving services for women and girls.
Shah Muhammad Khan, Provincial Minister for Transport and Technical Education, was the Chief Guest of the event. “BRT Peshawar is a convenient and successful travel facility for citizens. Men and boys should avoid sitting on seats designated for women. Respecting women is a collective responsibility,” said Mr. Shah.
Rukhshanda Naz, Ombudsperson KP, said “The objective of this activity is to increase awareness of general public on the Section 509 of Pakistan Penal Code and enhance their access to the services offered by Ombudsperson Office.”
Audio visuals messages, both in Urdu and Pashtu languages, will also be played on BRT terminals and in buses. This initiative will help in warning the harassers about repercussion and give confidence to women passengers so that they feel safe and secure while using public transport.
“Survivors, activists, decision-makers, the UN system, and people from all walks of life must collectively voice for funding for women organizations, essential services, and prevention from violence,” said Zainab Qaiser Khan, Head of Provincial Office UN Women in KP. She said that ending violence against women is everyone’s responsibility, so including stakeholders like Transport Department shows the commitment of the government to fulfill the shared responsibility. “Safe transportation means freedom of mobility for women with comfort which contributes towards women empowerment. Empowered women not only raise voice for themselves but also for other vulnerable women,” she remarked.

Second Provincial Project steering committee held to review the progress of UNDP’s Scaling up of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Risk Reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II) Project
Islamabad, November 24, 2020— UNDP in Pakistan held the second Provincial Project Steering Committee (PPSC) for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) to review the progress of the Scaling up of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Risk Reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II) Project. Chaired by Nauman Afridi, Chief Economist, Planning and Development Department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the agenda of the meeting was to review the progress of the Annual Work Plan (AWP) 2020, endorse the most vulnerable valleys under the project, and to review the AWP for 2021, in consultation with the Provincial PSC members.
Attendees of the meeting included Chief Foreign-Aid, Representatives of line Departments, PDMA, PMD, Agriculture, Forest and Environment, and GLOF-II Project members. Following the welcome remarks by the Chair, and Office In-charge GLOF II project, a progress update on the AWP 2020 was provided by relevant line department of KP. Since project activities started in KP after transfer of funds in June 2020, the aim of the PPSC is to review and discuss the progress achieved against each agreed activity. The implementation status and consolidated progress to date of the approved activities under AWP 2020 in notified valleys was presented along with challenges, and lesson learnt to set basis for the AWP 2021.
PPSC approved all the activities proposed for the year 2021  including the three valleys remaining for KP for National PSC to notify. Key activities in 2021 would include development of small-scale infrastructure, irrigation channel repairs, slope stabilization activities, community-based interventions by establishing safe-havens, safe access routes, and kitchen gardening. PPSC members also discussed the provincial planning for disaster risk reduction including mock drills to be conducted in the vulnerable valleys, particularly GLOFs, to be incorporated in the provincial contingency planning.
As a pre-requisite to the National PSC, all future activities under AWP 2021 must be endorsed at the provincial level. As of now, the five-year project, funded by the Green Climate Fund is extensively working in the northern areas of the country to strengthen the technical capacity of sub-national decision-makers to integrate climate change, and disaster risk management into medium- and long-term development planning, to help communities adapt to the impacts of climate change particularly GLOFs.

UNHCR organizes activities to mark 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence
ISLAMABAD, 25 November 2020: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency organizes a number of activities across Pakistan in collaboration with UN agencies, its partners and refugees to mark the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence – an international campaign that runs from 25 November through 10 December every year.
Individuals, institutions and organizations across the world plan activities to highlight that violence against women is a breach of human rights, calling for the prevention and elimination of violence against women and girls.
To support this initiative, started by the first Women’s Global Leadership Institute in 1991, the United Nations Secretary-General’s UNiTE by 2030 to End Violence against Women campaign by 2030 (UNiTE campaign) calls for global action to increase awareness, galvanize advocacy efforts, and share knowledge and innovations. This year’s theme is "Orange the World: Fund, Respond, Prevent, Collect!" which focuses on the COVID-19 crisis.
While keeping in mind COVID-19 SOPs, UNHCR’s offices across Pakistan have planned activities that focus on combating violence against women and girls, including to emphasize the positive role of individuals.
The UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Noriko Yoshida, said that arranging such activities are aimed at expressing solidarity with survivors of violence and raising awareness about discriminatory practices against women. “Everyone has a role to play to end violence against women and make the world a safer and prosperous place to live in,” she said.
She further said that COVID-19 has exacerbated the risks of gender-based violence for women and girls, including those forcibly displaced, adding that prevention and response are life-saving, and this must be maintained as essential during COVID-19 lockdowns.
In Islamabad, UNHCR, together with its partners, aims to hold a virtual power talk event in December. It will be an opportunity for refugee youth and academics to discuss and shed light on the voices of women during the COVID-19 crisis and their resilience and efforts to act as agents of change in their communities.
In Peshawar, UNHCR and UN Women held an opening ceremony on Wednesday to mark the start of the 16 Days of Activism. On the occasion, the speakers, including female parliamentarians, called for collective efforts to prevent and address the issues of gender-based violence.
Students also performed a role play underlining the risks of gender-based violence in the COVID-19 pandemic. Female Afghan refugees also narrated their stories and shed light on how they pursued their ambitions amid challenges.
In Quetta, a seminar was held on Wednesday in Pishin City on the theme of “Ending violence against women”. The speakers included religious scholars and other notable community members.
To mark the last day of the 16 Days of Activism on 10 December – Human Rights Day – UNHCR will also hold an event in Quetta with refugees and Pakistani host community members. The event will include experience-sharing by female social change promoters from the refugee community.

320,000 children and adolescents newly infected with HIV in 2019, 1 every 100 seconds – UNICEF
UNICEF warns of COVID-19 disruptions to HIV service delivery in one third of high burden countries
NEW YORK/JOHANNESBURG, 25 November 2020 – Approximately every minute and 40 seconds, a child or young person under the age of 20 was newly infected with HIV last year, bringing the total number of children living with HIV to 2.8 million, UNICEF said in a report released today.
The report, Reimagining a resilient HIV response for children, adolescents and pregnant women living with HIV, warns that children are being left behind in the fight against HIV.
Prevention efforts and treatment for children remain some of the lowest amongst key affected populations. In 2019, a little more than half of children worldwide had access to life-saving treatment, significantly lagging behind coverage for both mothers (85 per cent) and all adults living with HIV (62 per cent). Nearly 110,000 children died of AIDS that year.
Despite some progress in the decades-long fight against HIV and AIDS, deep regional disparities persist among all populations, especially for children, the report says. Paediatric coverage of antiretroviral treatment is highest in the Middle East and North Africa, at 81 per cent, followed by South Asia (76 per cent), Eastern and Southern Africa (58 per cent), East Asia and the Pacific (50 per cent), Latin America and the Caribbean (46 per cent) and West and Central Africa (32 per cent).
“Even as the world struggles in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic, hundreds of thousands of children continue to suffer the ravages of the HIV epidemic,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “There is still no HIV vaccine. Children are still getting infected at alarming rates, and they are still dying from AIDS. This was even before COVID-19 interrupted vital HIV treatment and prevention services putting countless more lives at risk.”
The COVID-19 crisis has further exacerbated inequities in access to life-saving HIV services for children, adolescents and pregnant mothers everywhere.
In a recent UNICEF survey of 29 HIV priority countries, one third responded that service coverage for children, adolescents and women living with and vulnerable to HIV is lower by 10 per cent or more compared with pre-pandemic numbers.
UNAIDS’ HIV service disruption data, cited in the report, further illustrate the impact of necessary control measures, supply chain disruptions, lack of personal protective equipment, and the redeployment of healthcare workers on HIV services.
In the months of April and May, coinciding with partial and full lockdowns, paediatric HIV treatment and viral load testing in children in some countries declined between 50 to 70 per cent, and new treatment initiation fell by 25 to 50 per cent.
Similarly, health facility deliveries and maternal treatment were also reported to have reduced by 20 to 60 per cent, maternal HIV testing and ART initiation declined by 25 to 50 per cent, and infant testing services declined by approximately 10 per cent.
Though the easing of control measures and the strategic targeting of children and pregnant mothers have successfully led to a rebound of services in recent months, challenges remain, and the world is still far from achieving the global 2020 paediatric HIV targets.
Additional 2019 data included in the report:
· 150,000 children aged 0-9 years were newly infected with HIV, bringing the total number of children in this age group living with HIV to 1.1 million.
· 170,000 adolescents aged 10-19 were newly infected with HIV, bringing the total number of adolescents living with HIV to 1.7 million.
· 130,000 adolescent girls were newly infected with HIV in 2019, compared with 44,000 adolescent boys.
· The total number of AIDS-related deaths of children and adolescents was 110,000; 79,000 aged 0-9 years and 34,000 aged 10-19.
· Mothers’ access to antiretroviral therapy to prevent the transmission of the virus to their babies increased globally to 85 per cent and early infant diagnosis reached 60 per cent.
· The number of pregnant women living with HIV was 1.3 million; an estimated 82,000 children under the age of five were infected during pregnancy or birth and 68,000 were infected during breastfeeding.
The report calls on all governments to protect, sustain and accelerate progress in fighting childhood HIV by maintaining essential health services and strengthening health systems.

National Assembly, Presidency turn orange to launch 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence in Pakistan
Speaker, parliamentarians pledge actions to free Pakistan from violence against women
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly of Pakistan and President House buildings went orange on Wednesday to show solidarity with the global 16 Days of Activism campaign against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and officially launch it in Pakistan.
Women parliamentarians from several political parties as well as representatives from the government, UN agencies and civil society also participated in the event and pledged to put in efforts for ending violence against women and girls in Pakistan. They promised to play an active role in freeing the country from all forms of gender-based violence and discrimination and stand with and support survivors.
The event was jointly arranged by the Federal Women’s Parliamentary Caucus (WPC) and UN Women Pakistan to kick off the 16 Days of Activism against GBV, a global campaign that takes place each year from 25th of November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10th of December, International Human Rights Day, indicating that violence against women is the most pervasive violation of human rights worldwide. The 16 Days campaign is used as an organizing strategy by individuals and organizations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls.
With the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, this year’s theme for the 16 Days of Activism against GBV is “Fund, Respond, Prevent, Collect!” The theme calls for prioritizing support and funding to essential services for GBV prevention and response especially in the COVID-19 situation, supporting women’s rights organizations working at the nexus of COVID-19 and GBV, declaring a national policy of zero tolerance for GBV with a concrete action plan, launching behavior change social mobilization campaigns, undertaking explicit measures to maintain services for survivors of GBV as essential during COVID-19 lockdowns, ensuring a continuum of adequate criminal justice response mechanisms, and collecting data with the aim to inform and improve GBV services and interventions.
Speaker National Assembly, Mr. Asad Qaiser graced the event as the Chief Guest. Secretary WPC Ms. Munaza Hassan gave the welcome remarks at the start of the event. Resident Coordinator United Nations in Pakistan, Mr. Julien Harneis addressed the event that was attended by parliamentarians, representatives of the government, UN agencies, civil society and media, both virtually and in-person at the National Assembly.
Speaker National Assembly, Mr. Asad Qaiser while addressing the event, said: “The Government is committed to end violence against women as a topmost priority. It’s time to recognize the role of women and take substantial steps for ensuring equal participation of women in legislation. Gender equality cannot be achieved without ending violence against women and girls. Women need to be encouraged and motivated and the present government was committed for the protection of women’s rights and providing them safe environment. In order to give women their due status, we also need to change the mindset and behavior. Joint efforts are needed to bring them into mainstream.”
While giving welcome remarks, Secretary Women’s Parliamentary Caucus, Munaza Hassan said: “The world is undergoing significant social, political, economic and environmental development, which leaves a deep mark on our people – especially women of every household. With Covid-19 resurgence, the world retreats inside homes due to lockdowns, making situation even worse for women. Escalation in already existing pandemic of violence against women is quite visible. The Constitution of Pakistan negates any discrimination on the basis of gender. Its Articles 25(3) and 34 are the two most significant articles in favor of women. Article25(3) states that nothing shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the protection of women. The Women’s Parliamentary Caucus has been at the forefront of improving legislations for the rights of women and we will continue our efforts along with our trusted partners.”
“The fact that we have women in key decision-making roles of national importance, leading portfolios of human rights, social safety, health, and climate change, guarantees women protection and representation at all levels,” she remarked.
Mr. Harneis appreciated the pledge taken by all participants during the event, and expressed the hope that each person would follow through on this pledge in their lives to prevent gender-based violence from happening in all public and private settings.
He also commended the WPC’s role in promoting the agenda of women’s rights and leadership in the country. While acknowledging that Pakistan has made great progress especially in the area of legislative and policy reform, the RC highlighted that there was a lot left to do for effective implementation of existing pro-women laws. “The World Economic Forum places Pakistan at 151 out of 153 countries in its latest Global Gender Gap Report. But a positive sign is that women have around 24 percent representation in both houses of the Parliament, and women parliamentarians contributed 33 percent of the parliamentary business. With more women in power and decision-making, we can make great strides in advancing women’s empowerment and gender equality and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls,” he stated.

Balochistan Regulatory Reform Committee holds first meeting
Quetta, November 23, 2020: The first meeting of the Balochistan Regulatory Reform Committee (BRRC) was held today in Quetta.

Inter-Departmental coordination realized through BRRC will ensure that different laws and policies developed by different Departments of the government are mutually supportive.
Mr. Ghulam Farooq, Secretary Planning and Development Department while concluding the session acknowledged the efforts of all stakeholders and stated that establishment of this forum is a significant step for policy coherence.

EU provides €10 million support for refugees and Pakistanis impacted by COVID-19
Assistance will help UNHCR mitigate short-term and medium-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic on refugees and Pakistani host communities
ISLAMABAD, 24 November 2020: The European Union (EU) is providing €10 million to significantly boost UNHCR’s assistance for Afghan refugees and their host communities in Pakistan. The funding will focus on mitigating the short and medium-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
With this funding, UNHCR will expand its health response as well as improve water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in refugee and host communities. Another important component of the new project will be implementing activities that help protect and empower vulnerable Afghan refugees and host communities, including through livelihood opportunities.
The three-year project will be implemented across the country and is expected to benefit some 370,000 Afghan refugees and Pakistani host communities.
The Ambassador of the EU Delegation to Pakistan, H.E. Ms. Androulla Kaminara, and UNHCR’s Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Noriko Yoshida, signed the agreement at a ceremony on Monday.
The agreement coincides with the quadrennial Afghanistan Conference held in Geneva, which is intended to present an important opportunity for the Afghan Government and the international community to commit to common objectives for promoting sustainable development, prosperity and peace in Afghanistan.
At the signing ceremony, Ms. Kaminara said: “As the world faces a second surge of COVID-19, it is clearer than ever that we must assist the most vulnerable and the most in need. We are glad to partner with UNHCR in assisting the Afghan refugee community, which is generously hosted in Pakistan, as well as the Pakistani host communities.”
Placing the support for refugees in a larger political context, the Ambassador underlined: “The European Union has reaffirmed its strong support to an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process which ultimately would ensure safety, fundamental rights and prosperity for all Afghans and allow refugees to return to their homeland in safety and dignity.”
The UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Yoshida, welcomed the EU’s contribution and said such support amid the current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the EU’s commitment to “leaving no one behind”. “This support is truly significant. At a time when it is most urgently needed, the EU will help make a difference in the lives of so many refugees and Pakistani host communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said.
She said that UNHCR’s overall emergency response is in support of efforts by the Government of Pakistan to prevent and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. She added that UNHCR has been advocating for the inclusion of refugees in the Government’s COVID-19 Prevention and Response Plan.
Since July 2018, the EU has contributed €37 million from its development budget and €10 million from its humanitarian resources to support Afghan refugees and their host communities, in particular through UNHCR’s regional programmes.
In May 2020, the EU announced a €150 million package to support Pakistan’s efforts in addressing the short-term and long-term public health and socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including this new funding of €10 million for UNHCR. This funding will be channelled towards three sectors: health, WASH and social protection.
In the health sector, it will boost health initiatives by helping to provide personal protective equipment, medical supplies and other relief items to health facilities in support of refugees and host communities. Community outreach on the prevention and response to COVID-19 will also be strengthened.
In the WASH sector, the EU’s contribution will help enable UNHCR to upgrade or construct facilities such as toilets, handwash basins and water pumps in schools, health centres and communal facilities in or close to refugee villages – benefitting both refugees and Pakistanis.
In terms of social protection, the assistance will contribute to UNHCR’s emergency cash programme for the most vulnerable registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan. The one-time cash assistance mitigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by helping refugees meet their basic needs.
In addition, the project – covering a three-year period – aims to support the COVID-19 recovery through medium-term interventions, such as income-generating activities and technical and vocational skills training. This will ultimately help provide new skill sets to both refugees and their host communities.

Statement by Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, UN Women Executive Director, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women
With the will, there’s a way to end violence against women
25 November 2020
We’ve seen the close connection between the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise in reported violence of all kinds. We called it the Shadow Pandemic.
We have also seen the difference between the way that our societies and our public services respond to citizens who present with a life-threatening illness, and those who come for help with a life- or health- threatening partner.
We have seen the whole world respond to the coronavirus pandemic, with all hands on deck, with responsive investment and protocols backed by determination. Every continent has recognized the health pandemic’s disastrous consequences and the need to stop it in its tracks. Men’s violence against women is also a pandemic – one that pre-dates the virus and will outlive it. It too needs our global, coordinated response and enforceable protocols.  It too affects vast populations of all ages. Last year alone, 243 million women and girls experienced sexual or physical violence from their partner.  This year, reports of increased domestic violence, cyberbullying, child marriages, sexual harassment and sexual violence have flooded in.
If you take a test to see if you have a coronavirus infection, no one asks you what you were wearing when you caught it, or if you’d been drinking. You can expect with certainty that your test will be laboratory processed, and with reasonable probability that you will get medical attention. The response won’t depend on whether you are believed. You won’t feel such shame that you probably won’t even try to go to the authorities. You can expect care and support.
If only ending men’s violence against women was as simple as vaccinating against it. If only responding to it was as well funded as our response to the virus and its impacts on our societies and economies. Imagine if we invested the same amount of expertise and energy in finding a sustainable, global solution. If all leaders including heads of state dropped everything to lead the fight, if front-line workers like prosecutors, judges and policemen worked to save lives of women and girls as the health workers have done, and if ministers of finance allocated funds and provided forensic laboratories and rape kits like they provided personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing services. Imagine if everyone did this until we flattened the curve of violence against women. Imagine the impact.
We are at the beginning of a promising response that could be expanded to be proportionate to the challenge. Already 146 countries have undertaken measures to make the prevention and redress of violence against women and girls a key part of their national response plans for COVID- 19 in response to the UN Secretary-General’s call for ‘peace in the home’ and as a key part of the UN’s next decade of action. But it is not yet at the heart of agendas, and change is not yet at the scale required.
The collaboration between scientists, governments, civil society and industry has been a game changer in the COVID-19 pandemic. That, and more, is the scale and nature of the collaboration needed to end violence against women and girls, across all sectors, and at societal, community, family and individual levels. The Generation Equality Forum and its multi-stakeholder Action Coalitions reflect this consistent, holistic approach with a five-year plan to engage on change that is systematic and lasting.
Civil society is a key partner in this. To play its role fully, it must be flexibly resourced and the funding cuts limiting women’s organizations, crisis centres, helplines and shelters reversed. The EU-UN Spotlight Initiative is leading the way on this – and others need to join in order to build the response that will truly make a difference.   Women are currently being failed by their elected representatives, and under-capacitated nongovernmental organizations are unable to fill the void. Every country’s fiscal stimulus packages should include provisions for ending violence against women, and for well-funded social services – crucially including sexual and reproductive health provisions – that support survivors and enable recovery.
Women must have full access to justice, with reliable prosecution of perpetrators of violence and effective prevention of these crimes. One of the reasons that women report less than 40 per cent of serious violent crimes against them or seek help of any sort, is their lack of faith in the system’s response. The turn-around starts with law schools and police academies that teach their cohorts to recognize and respond to abuse and be alert to discrimination. It means ending impunity, with strong legal and policy frameworks, and data to monitor progress and help us hold ourselves and authorities to account.
Equally important are the cultural changes that help prevent violence against women and girls in the first place. For this, we have to shift the stereotypes and attitudes that shame  survivors and normalize and excuse the perpetrators. And we must engage allies in this, including men and boys. After all, while a virus is indiscriminate, a man or boy can choose not to be violent and society can guide him not to be violent and hold him accountable if he is.
All these interventions must occur concurrently, continuously, in collaboration, and at scale to succeed.  

The economics of violence are simple and devastating. No one gains. Everyone loses, and we have to turn this around. As we face COVID-19’s devastation, there has never been a more important moment to resolve to put our combined resources and commitment behind the biggest issues, and to end violence against women and girls, for good.  We know what it takes to fight a pandemic. Now we need the will to do it, and with Generation Equality, lead the way.

As impact of COVID-19 intensifies, UN Women calls for concrete actions to respond to the concurrent shadow pandemic
Galvanizes partners to fund organizations, respond to survivors’ needs, prevent violence and collect data to build a post-pandemic “new normal” as the 16 days of Activism campaign kicks off
New York, November 25 – As the COVID-19 pandemic and a prevailing culture of impunity threatens progress achieved on gender equality and ending violence against women and girls, UN Women is calling for robust and decisive action in response to this unprecedented crisis on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. In the run up to the 2021 Generation Equality Forum – where global actors will step up to make bold new commitments to eradicate violence against women – governments, civil society, youth, influencers and the private sector will lend their voices for the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, a global mobilization campaign that runs from today until 10 December. Together, they will demand a reset and to build a “new normal” that delivers a future without violence for all women and girls.
Even before COVID-19, violence against women was one of the most widespread violations of human rights, with almost 18 per cent of women and girls experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner over a 12-month period. As the pandemic raged on, an alarming upsurge of the “shadow pandemic” of violence against women became evident, with increased rates of reporting on domestic violence, as well as in the streets, online and in a variety of settings. Calls to helplines increased up to five-fold in some countries during the first weeks of the coronavirus  outbreak – while in others, they decreased given the inability of women to seek help through the regular channels, while sheltered in place with their perpetrators. Projections show that for every three months the lockdown continues, an additional 15 million women are expected to be affected by violence.
“We have seen the whole world respond to the coronavirus pandemic, with all hands on deck, and with responsive investment and protocols backed by determination. Violence against women is also a pandemic – one that pre-dates the virus and will outlive it. As we face COVID-19’s devastation, there has never been a more important moment to resolve to put our combined resources and commitment behind the biggest issues, and to end violence against women and girls, for good,” said UN Women Executive Director, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka.
In response to a “cease-fire at home” called by the UN Secretary-General earlier this year, almost 150 countries agreed to make  ending violence against women and girls a key part of their response plans for COVID-19. Many have followed through with stronger essential services, such as shelters, helplines and other reporting mechanisms.  Yet, only 48 countries, less than a quarter of the 206 analysed in a recent study, treated violence against women and girls-related services as an integral part of their national and local COVID-19 response plans, with very few adequately funding these measures.
Addressing the pervasive under-resourcing of this critical issue, UN Women has convened the Action Coalition on Gender-based Violence, an innovative partnership of governments, civil society, youth leaders, private sector and philanthropies to develop a bold agenda of catalytic actions and leverage funding to eradicate violence against women. These bold actions and investments will be announced at the Generation Equality Forum in 2021, in Mexico and France, along with those of other five Generation Equality Action Coalitions.
Orange the World: Fund, Prevent, Respond, Collect!
The 16 Days of Activism, which is powered by grassroots organizations globally, is an opportunity to leverage the renewed sense of urgency COVID-19 has created and propel concrete action against gender-based violence. In the lead up to the International Day commemoration, UN Women has appealed to Member States to make concrete, tangible commitments during the 16 Days of Activism.
This year’s theme, “Orange the World: Fund, Prevent, Respond, Collect!”, announced by the UNiTE campaign, bolsters the UN Secretary-General’s appeal and UN system-wide rapid response to the alarming surge in violence against women and girls seen this year.
“Together, we must tackle male violence that affects and damages everyone – families and communities, societies and economies – and holds back all our efforts for peace and security, human rights and sustainable development. We need to increase accountability and question attitudes and approaches that enable violence. And we must provide resources for women’s civil society organizations on the front lines," said UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
In that vein, this year’s campaign urges all governments and partners to accelerate concrete policy responses within four areas:
o   FUND essential services on gender-based violence and women’s organizations working on the issue in all COVID-19 response efforts
o   PREVENT gender-based violence though mobilization campaigns and a zero-tolerance policy
o   RESPOND to survivors’ needs for services like hotlines, shelters and justice response, even during lockdowns
o   COLLECT data to improve services, programmes and policies
Addressing gender-based violence in humanitarian contexts
Women and girls are disproportionately affected by humanitarian crises. COVID-19 has shown  the need to prioritize the rights and needs of women and girls in humanitarian crises. Intimate partner violence and other forms of violence increased as women were trapped inside their homes, tents and refugee camps with abusers during lockdown.
Signaling the increasing needs for financial resources to address this, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) today announced a contribution of USD 8 million to UN Women to fight gender-based violence in emergency contexts.
This new allocation, from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) will provide much needed boost to help local women-led and women's organizations working in humanitarian emergencies to prevent gender-based violence, to facilitate access to justice, and to provide survivor-centred services to women and adolescent girls. It will also support women, including survivors of violence, to develop and lead transitional justice processes (i.e. measures to redress legacies of massive human rights abuse), at the local and national level. The funding will be channeled into two year-programmes in five countries where interventions specific to women’s needs are currently underfunded.
Around the world
The UN official commemoration of the International Day will take place for the first time in a virtual format and will be an opportunity for Member States to strengthen and advance their commitments to end violence against women and girls. The event will count on the participation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres, representatives from UN Member States, Under-Secretary-General and UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Under-Secretary-General and UNFPA Executive Director Natalia Kanem. UN Women Goodwill Ambassadors  Nicole Kidman and  Cindy Bishop; SDG Advocate, UNODC Goodwill Ambassador and Nobel Peace Prize,  Nadia Murad; and Nobel Peace Prize Nominee and Founder of Rise,  Amanda Nguyen, among others, will participate via video.
As in previous years, iconic buildings and monuments all over the world will be lit in orange to call for a brighter future where women and girls can live free from violence, including the Giza Pyramids and the Sphinx in Egypt; the Moai statues in Eastern Island, Chile; the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova; the Kuwait Towers; and the Brussels Town Hall in Belgium. In the Netherlands, over 200 municipalities will be lighted up in orange in solidarity with survivors and to mark the 16 Days of Activism.
Hundreds of  events around the world will also shine a light on this shadow pandemic, including a TV-show style event in Thailand focused on leaders’ commitments to end gender-based violence during COVID-19; and  a series of discussions, debates, art exhibitions in universities in Jordan on the role of men and youth in combating violence against women. In Bonn, Germany, there will be a feminist tour in which participants can discover a new side of the city’s past and present, learn about famous daughters of the city and about feminism, using GPS coordinates.
A human chain in Bangladesh; an online flash-mob with popular young video bloggers in Tajikistan; a video competition addressing  violence against women migrant workers and trafficking in Indonesia; a training on self-defense to service providers and women's organizations in Albania; and a high-level virtual event in Panama with representatives from Member States in the region, are also among the many events planned during the 16 Days.

UNICEF calls for averting a lost generation as COVID-19 threatens to cause irreversible harm to children’s education, nutrition and well-being
Children and adolescents account for 1 in 9 of reported COVID-19 infections, according to new analysis released on World Children’s Day
NEW YORK/ISLAMABAD, 20 November 2020 – On World Children’s Day (WCD), 30 iconic monuments and landmarks across Pakistan turned blue as the country celebrated, from the Khyber Pass to Mazar-e-Quaid in Karachi, from Lahore Fort to Quaid-e-Azam residency in Ziarat, and through Pakistan Monument in Islamabad.
This initiative, implemented by UNICEF together with the Federal Ministry of Human Rights, marked a commitment to help every girl and boy fulfill their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). It is the third year in a row that buildings in Pakistan and across the world go blue to call for a world in which the vision of the Convention of the Rights of the Child becomes a reality for every child.
Released on World Children’s Day, a new UNICEF report warned of significant and growing consequences for children as the COVID-19 pandemic lurches toward a second year, jeopardizing their rights. ‘Averting a Lost COVID Generation’ is the first UNICEF report to comprehensively outline the dire and growing consequences for children as the pandemic drags on. It shows that while symptoms among infected children remain mild, infections are rising and the longer-term impact on the education, nutrition and well-being of an entire generation of children and young people can be life-altering.
“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a persistent myth that children are barely affected by the disease. Nothing could be further from the truth,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “While children can get sick and can spread the disease, this is just the tip of the pandemic iceberg. Disruptions to key services and soaring poverty rates pose the biggest threat to children. The longer the crisis persists, the deeper its impact on children’s education, health, nutrition and well-being. The future of an entire generation is at risk.”
The report finds that, as of 3 November, in 87 countries with age-disaggregated data, children and adolescents under 20 years of age accounted for 1 in 9 of COVID-19 infections, or 11 per cent of the 25.7 million infections reported by these countries. More reliable, age-disaggregated data on infection, deaths and testing is needed to better understand how the crisis impacts the most vulnerable children and guide the response.
“The COVID-19 crisis is a child rights crisis. We must work together to avert a lost generation as the global pandemic threatens to cause irreversible harm to children’s education, nutrition and well-being,” said Ms. Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “This includes making sure that every child and adolescent can continue to access the essential services that are their rights so they can survive, stay healthy, learn and fulfill their potential. UNICEF staff are on the ground doing everything they can to help children and communities respond to, and recover from, the pandemic. We will continue to support the Government so that no child in Pakistan is left behind.”
While children can transmit the virus to each other and to older age groups, there is strong evidence that, with basic safety measures in place, the net benefits of keeping schools open outweigh the costs of closing them, the report notes. Schools are not a main driver of community transmission, and children are more likely to get the virus outside of school settings.
COVID-related disruptions to critical health and social services for children pose the most serious threat to children, the report says. Using new data from UNICEF surveys across 140 countries, it notes that:
More alarming data from the report include:
To respond to this crisis, UNICEF is calling on governments and partners to:
“This World Children’s Day, we are asking governments, partners and the private sector to listen to children and prioritize their needs,” Fore said. “As we all reimagine the future and look ahead toward a post-pandemic world, children must come first.”

بچوں کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر منظرِ عام پر لائے گئے نئے تجزیے کے مطابق کووِڈ- 19 کا شکار ہونے والوں میں 9 میں سے 1 بچہ یا پھر نو بالغ ہے۔
نیو یارک/ اسلام آباد، 20 نومبر 2020 – بچوں کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر درہ خیبر سے مزارِ قائد کراچی تک ، لاہور کے شاہی قلعے سے زیارت میں قائد اعظم کی رہائش گاہ تک اور اسلام آباد میں یادگارِ پاکستان سمیت ، پاکستان کی 30 اہم تاریخی اور یادگاری عمارات کو نیلے رنگ کی روشنیوں سے سجایا گیا ہے۔
پاکستان میں یونیسف نے  یہ اقدام  وفاقی وزارت برائے انسانی حقوق کے ساتھ مل کر    اٹھایا ہے اور اس موقع پر اس عزم کا اظہار  کیا گیا ہے کہ بچوں کے حقوق کے کنونشن (سی آر سی)  کی روشنی میں ملک کے ہر بچے کو اس کے تمام  حقوق فراہم  کئے جائیں گے۔ پاکستان اور دنیا بھر میں  اہم، تاریخی اور یادگاری عمارات کو علامتی طور پر نیلے رنگ کی روشنی سے روشن کرنے کا یہ مسلسل تیسرا سال ہے اور اس کا مقصد دنیا کی توجہ بچوں کے حقوق کے کنونشن کی بنیاد بننے والے   نصب العین (وژن) کی طرف دلانا ہے تاکہ بچوں کے حقوق پاکستان سمیت  دنیا بھر کے ہر بچے کے لئے حقیقت کا روپ دھار سکیں۔
بچوں کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر منظرِ عام پر لائی جانے والی   یونیسف  کی نئی رپورٹ   کووڈِ- 19 کے دوسرے  سال میں داخل ہونے سے بچوں کے لئے  تیزی سے بگڑتی   ہوئی  صورتِ حال   سے خبردار  کررہی ہے  کہ  موجودہ  صورتِ حال بچوں کے حقوق کو خطرے میں ڈال سکتی ہے۔
پاکستان اور دنیا بھر میں منائے جانے والے بچوں کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر یونیسف کووِڈ- 19 پر اپنی   نئی  رپورٹ ’ایورٹنگ لوسٹ کووِڈ جنریشن‘ منظرِ عام پر لایا ہے جس میں وبا کی صورتِ حال جاری رہنے سے بچوں پر ہونے والے خطرناک حد تک منفی اثرات کا جائزہ لیا گیا ہے۔ رپورٹ میں بتایا گیا ہے کہ اگرچہ عام طور پر بچوں میں کووِڈ- 19 کی علامات شدت اختیار نہیں کرتیں تاہم بچوں میں اس کے اثرات دیر تک رہتے ہیں اور ان کی تعلیم، غذائیت اور صحت کی خدمات پر منفی اثرات مرتب ہونے سے ان کی زندگیاں متاثر ہوتی ہیں۔
کووِڈ- 19 کی عالمی وبا کے دوران یہ غلط فہمی مسلسل پھیلائی جاتی رہی ہے کہ اس بیماری کے بچوں پر اثرات نہ ہونے کے برابر ہیں۔ یونیسف کی ایگزیکٹو ڈائریکٹر ہنریٹا فور نے اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے کہا  کہ بچے نہ صرف بیماری سے متاثر ہوسکتے ہیں بلکہ بیماری پھیلانے کا بھی باعث بن سکتے ہیں لیکن یہ ایک بڑے مسئلے کا محض مختصر حصہ ہے۔ بچوں کے لئے ضروری خدمات کی فراہمی میں تعطل اور غربت کی شرح میں اضافہ بچوں کے لئے اس سے بھی کہیں بڑا خطرہ بن چکا ہے۔ یہ بحران جس حد تک طول پکڑے گا بچوں کی تعلیم ، صحت، غذا اور زندگیوں پر اس کے اس قدر زیادہ منفی اثرات مرتب ہونگے۔ اس لئے ہم سمجھتے ہیں کہ بچوں کی موجودہ نسل کا مستقبل شدید خطرے میں پڑچکا ہے۔
اس رپورٹ کے مطابق (3 نومبر تک) 87 ممالک جن میں مختلف عمر کے لوگوں کے اعداد و شمار جمع کئے ہیں وہاں کووِڈ- 19 سے متاثر ہونے والے بچوں یا نو بالغوں کی تعداد ، 9 میں سے 1 یا پھر 25.7 ملین کی آبادی میں 11 فی صد رہی ہے۔ عمر کے تناسب سے حاصل کردہ زیادہ قابلِ اعتماد اعداد و شمار کے مطابق بیماری، اموات اور ٹیسٹ کی بہتر سہولیات کی مدد سے یہ اندازہ بخوبی لگایا جاسکتا ہے کہ کووِڈ- 19 کا عالمی بحران زدپذیر یا زیادہ خطرات کا شکار بچوں کو کس حد تک متاثر کررہا ہے اور اس صورتِ حال کے موثر جوابی اقدامات کیا ہوسکتے ہیں۔
اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے پاکستان میں یونیسف کی نمائندہ مس عائدہ گرما نے کہا:
’’کووِڈ- 19 کی وجہ سے آنے والا بحران بچوں کے حقوق کا بحران ہے۔ ہم سب کو  اس سلسلے میں مل جل کر کام کرنے کی ضرورت ہے کیونکہ عالمی وبا بچوں کی تعلیم، غذا اور صحت کو وہ نقصان پہنچا رہی ہے جس کی تلافی ممکن نہیں۔ ہمیں اس بات کو یقینی بنانے کی ضرورت ہے کہ ہر بچے کو وہ ضروری خدمات فراہم کی جارہی ہیں جن کا حصول اس کا بنیادی ہے حق ہے۔ ان خدمات سے بچوں کی بقا، صحت، تعلیم اور ان کی صلاحیتوں کے  بھرپور اظہار کا حق مشروط ہے۔ یونیسف پاکستانی بچوں اور لوگوں کی ہر ممکن مدد کررہا ہے تاکہ وہ وبائی صورتِ حال سے جلد از جلد نجات حاصل کرسکیں۔ ہم پاکستانی حکومت مدد جاری رکھیں گے تاکہ پاکستان کا کوئی بھی بچہ پیچھے نہ رہ پائے‘‘۔
بچے نہ صرف ایک دوسرے کو بلکہ بڑوں کو بھی متاثر کرسکتے ہیں تاہم رپورٹ میں یہ بھی کہا گیا ہے کہ اگر بنیادی حفاظتی انتظامات کا خیال رکھا جائے تو بچوں کے لئے سکول کھلے رکھنا سکول بند کرنے کی نسبت کم نقصان دہ ہے کیونکہ سکول گلی محلے کی سطح پر وائرس کے پھیلاؤ کا بنیادی ذریعہ نہیں ہیں اور اس بات کے امکانات زیادہ ہیں کہ بچے سکول کی بجائے سکول سے باہر وائرس کا شکار ہوجائیں۔
رپورٹ میں مزید بتایا گیا ہے کہ کووِڈ- 19 کی وجہ سے صحت اور سماجی خدمات کی معطلی بچوں کے لئے انتہائی خطرناک صورتِ حال اختیار کرچکی ہے۔ یونیسف کے مذکورہ سروے کے دوران 140 ممالک سے حاصل شدہ اعداد و شمار کے استعمال سے یہ واضح ہوتا ہے کہ:
رپورٹ میں منظرِ عام پر آنے والے مزید پریشان کن اعداد و شمار بتاتے ہیں کہ:
اس بحران کے جوابی اقدامات کے طور پر یونیسف دنیا بھر کی حکومتوں اور شراکت داروں پر زور دے رہا ہے کہ وہ:
بچوں کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے ڈاکٹر فور نے کہا کہ اس دن ہم حکومتوں، شراکت داروں اور نجی شعبوں پر زور دے رہے ہیں کہ وہ بچوں کی بات سنیں اور ان کی ضروریات کو ترجیحی بنیادوں پر پورا کریں۔ اس وقت جب وبا کے دنوں سے آگے ایک نئے مستقبل کو دیکھ رہے ہیں، ہمیں چاہیے کہ ہم بچوں کو اپنی اولین ترجیح سمجھیں۔

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, 20 November 2020 – Tonight, more than 25 buildings across Pakistan will turn blue as the country celebrates World Children’s Day – a global day of action for children, by children, to raise awareness on the need to help millions of them realize their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
To celebrate this momentous day, the Federal Ministry of Human Rights and UNICEF are turning more than 25 iconic landmarks and monuments blue in Islamabad and Pakistan’s four provinces in the evening of 20 November, as a symbol of their commitment to children’s rights. It is the third year in a row that buildings in the country and across the globe are lit up to call for a world in which the vision of the Convention of the Rights of the Child becomes a reality for every child.
“Tonight, iconic buildings will be lit up blue in Pakistan and all around the world to celebrate World Children’s Day and demonstrate our solidarity with children. This is also a reminder of the Government’s strong commitment to defend children’s rights and to ensure that they are safe and protected against abuse. We will continue to work to make sure that our children, who are our assets and the future of our nation, can live in a safe, enabling environment,” said Dr. Shireen Mazari, Federal Minister for Human Rights.
“World Children’s Day is an opportunity to remind ourselves and the world how important it is to cherish, protect and empower our children. Government work and partnerships at every level will help us deliver a better world in which every child can realise their dreams and live a safe, carefree life,” said Ms Rabiya Javeri Agha, Secretary, Ministry for Human Rights.
World Children’s Day also marks a commitment to listen to the voices of children, adolescents and young people as they demand to be heard on issues that matter to them and ask to be part of the solution. Children must be included in decisions that affect their future, especially as this year brought forth new challenges related to the COVID-19 crisis.
“While millions of girls and boys in Pakistan have seen their lives improve, millions of others continue to grapple with poverty, inequality, and lack of access to the essential services,” said Ms. Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan.
“The COVID-19 crisis is a child rights crisis. We must work together to avert a lost generation as the global pandemic threatens to cause irreversible harm to children’s education, nutrition and well-being. This includes making sure that every child and adolescent can continue to access the essential services that are their rights so they can survive, stay healthy, learn and fulfill their potential. UNICEF staff are on the ground doing everything they can to help children and communities respond to, and recover from, the pandemic. We will continue to support the Government so that no child in Pakistan is left behind,” Ms. Girma added.
World Children’s Day marks the adoption of the Convention on 20 November 1989. Pakistan ratified the Convention the following year.
###

پاکستان بھر کے اہم مقامات اور یادگاری عمارات پر  بچوں کے حقوق کی حمایت کے اظہار کے لئے نیلے رنگ کی روشنی میں دکھائی دیں گی۔

اسلام آباد، پاکستان، 20 نومبر 2020 – آج کے روز پاکستان بھر کی 20 عمارتیں بچوں کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر بچوں کے حقوق کی حمایت کے اظہار میں نیلے رنگ میں نہائی دکھائی دیں گی۔ بچوں کا عالمی دن بچوں کے لئے اور بچوں کی جانب سے عملی اقدامات اٹھانے کا دن ہے۔ اس روز بچوں کے حقوق کے کنونشن (سی آر سی) کے تحت دنیا بھر کے لاکھوں بچوں کو ان کے حقوق سے آگہی کی ضروررت پر زور دیا جاتا ہے۔
یہ اہم دن منانے کے لئے پاکستان کے ہر صوبے میں 20 نومبر کی شب وزارتِ انسانی حقوق اور یونیسف ملک بھر کی 20 اہم، تاریخی اور یادگاری عمارات کو نیلے رنگ کی روشنیوں میں میں نہلا دیا جائے گا۔ واضح رہے ان  عمارات کو نیلے رنگ کی روشنی سے بچوں کے حقوق کی حمایت کی علامت کے طور روشن کیا جائے گا  ۔ اس طرح یہ مسلسل تیسرا سال ہوگا جب پاکستان اور دنیا بھر میں بچوں کے حقوق کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر اہم، تاریخی اور یادگاری نوعیت کی عمارات کو نیلی روشنی سے منور کیا جائے گا اور یہ اس بات کا اظہار ہوگا کہ دنیا بچوں کے حقوق کے کنونشن کے نصب العین (وژن) کو ہر بچے کے لئے حقیقت میں بدلنے کے لئے عملی اقدامات کی حمایت کرتی ہے۔
وفاقی وزیرِ برائے انسانی حقوق ڈاکٹر شیریں مزاری نے اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے کہا:
’’ آج کی رات بچوں کا عالمی دن منانے اور بچوں سے یکجہتی کے اظہار کے لئے پاکستان اور دنیا بھر کی اہم عمارات نیلے رنگ کی روشنی سے روشن کی جائیں گی۔ یہ علامتی عمل حکومت کے اس عزم کا بھی اظہار ہوگا کہ حکومت پاکستان بچوں کے حقوق کے تحفظ کے لئے بے حد سنجیدہ ہے اور اس بات کو یقینی بنانا چاہتی ہے کہ ہمارے بچے ہر قسم کے استحصال سے محفوظ ہیں۔ ہم اس بات کو یقینی بنانے کے لئے اپنا کام جاری رکھیں گے کہ ہمارے بچے ، جو نہ صرف ہمارا سرمایہ ہیں بلکہ ہماری قوم کا مستقبل ہیں، محفوظ اور  اپنی صلاحیتوں فروغ کے لئے موذوں ماحول میں سانس لے رہے ہیں‘‘۔
بچوں کے حقوق کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے انسانی حقوق کی وزارت کی سیکرٹری مس رابعہ جویری آغا نے کہا، ’’ بچوں کا عالمی دن ہمیں ایک بار پھر یہ یاد کرنے کا موقع فراہم کرتا ہے ہمارے لئے اپنے بچوں کو عزیز رکھنا، انہیں تحفظ اور تقویت دینا کس حد تک ضروری ہے۔ حکومت اپنی کارکردگی اور شراکت داروں کی مدد سے ہماری مدد کرے گی کہ ہم اپنے بچوں کو ایک بہتر دنیا دے سکیں، ایک ایسی دنیا جہاں وہ اپنے خوابوں کی تعبیر پاکر محفوظ اور خوف سے پاک زندگی گذار سکیں‘‘۔
بچوں کے عالمی دن کے موقع پر اس عزم کا اظہار کیا جاتا ہے کہ ہم بچوں، نو بالغوں اور نوجوانوں کی بات غور سے سنیں گے، ان کے مسائل اور مطالبات پر غور کریں گے اور انہیں ان کے مسائل کے حل تلاش کرنے کے لئے فیصلہ سازی کے عمل میں بھی شامل کیا جائے گا۔ بچوں کے مسائل کے حل کے لئے کی جانے والی فیصلہ سازی میں ان کی شمولیت اس لئے نہایت ضروری ہے کیونکہ یہ فیصلے بچوں کے مستقبل پر اثر انداز ہوتے ہیں خاص طور پر اس سال کووِڈ- 19 کی وجہ سے آنے والے بحران نے بچوں کے لئے نئی مشکلات پیدا کردی ہیں۔
اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے پاکستان میں یونیسف کی نمائندہ مس عائدہ گرما نے کہا:
’’ جب پاکستان میں لاکھوں بچوں کی صورتِ حال میں بہتری آئی ہے وہاں دیگر لاکھوں بچے آج بھی غربت ، عدم مساوات اور ضروری سہولیات تک مساوی رسائی جیسے مسائل سے نبرد آزما ہیں۔‘‘
انہوں نے مزید کہا:
’’کووِڈ- 19 کی وجہ سے آنے والا بحران بچوں کے حقوق کا بحران ہے۔ ہم سب کو  اس سلسلے میں مل جل کر کام کرنے کی ضرورت ہے کیونکہ عالمی وبا بچوں کی تعلیم، غذا اور صحت کو وہ نقصان پہنچا رہی ہے جس کی تلافی ممکن نہیں۔ ہمیں اس بات کو یقینی بنانے کی ضرورت ہے کہ ہر بچے کو وہ ضروری خدمات فراہم کی جارہی ہیں جن کا حصول اس کا بنیادی ہے حق ہے۔ ان خدمات سے بچوں کی بقا، صحت، تعلیم اور ان کی صلاحیتوں کے  بھرپور اظہار کا حق مشروط ہے۔ یونیسف پاکستانی بچوں اور لوگوں کی ہر ممکن مدد کررہا ہے تاکہ وہ وبائی صورتِ حال سے جلد از جلد نجات حاصل کرسکیں۔ ہم پاکستانی حکومت مدد جاری رکھیں گے تاکہ پاکستان کا کوئی بھی بچہ پیچھے نہ رہ پائے‘‘۔
بچوں کے عالمی دن کے کنونشن کی منظوری 20 نومبر 1989 کو عمل میں آئی تھی اور پاکستان نے اس کے اگلے برس اس کنونشن کی توثیق کردی تھی۔

UNICEF condemns abuse of four-year-old girl and mother in Kashmore, Pakistan
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, 13 November 2020 – UNICEF expresses its deep shock at the abuse of a four-year-old Pakistani girl and her mother in Kashmore, in the Sindh province of Pakistan.
According to media reports, the girl and her mother were detained and sexually abused by several men for days. The police managed to find and rescue the child after the perpetrators let her mother go.
“UNICEF strongly condemns this vicious attack on a child” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “We offer our deepest sympathy to the family affected by this horrific act and share hopes for her full recovery. UNICEF is supporting the Child Protection Authority and social welfare officers in Kashmore and Larkana to ensure that appropriate support and services are extended to the child and her family.
“While it is encouraging to see that the police managed to rescue the child and arrest one of the alleged perpetrators, greater efforts must be made to develop mechanisms that help prevent sexual abuse against children. We need to make sure that victims can access appropriate counselling and treatment, and that perpetrators are held accountable,” Ms. Girma added.
Every child has the right to be protected from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. UNICEF will continue to work with federal, provincial authorities and communities to put in place effective, preventive mechanisms and improve the safety of children.

Many efforts have been made to prevent and treat diabetes.  Yet the number of people with diabetes is going up. What’s more, it is rising most rapidly in low- and middle-income countries, the countries least well-equipped with the diagnostics, medicines, and knowledge to provide life-saving treatment.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought additional pain.  Many people who require regular care and treatment for their diabetes have struggled to access that care.  And people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19.
Next year, the World Health Organization will launch the Global Diabetes Compact, a new initiative that will bring structure and coherence to our complementary efforts to reduce the burden of diabetes.
Let us work together to make sure that, through this ambitious and much-needed collaboration, we will soon be talking about the decline in diabetes as a public health problem.  And as we strive to overcome the pandemic, let us do our utmost to ensure Universal Health Coverage, strengthen health systems and advance good health and resilience for all.

New York, 15 November 2020
Road traffic collisions are a major health and development concern.  Some 3700 fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, friends and colleagues are lost on the world’s roads every day.  Road traffic incidents are the leading cause of death for children and young adults between 5 and 29 years old, and ninety percent of victims live in low- and middle-income countries.
We need to remember this as we resolve to build a strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our mobility systems must have safety at their core.  This is the only way we will achieve the ambitious goal of halving road deaths and injuries by 2030.
The United Nations road safety conventions are key to helping countries address the main causes of accidents.  I welcome the recent General Assembly Resolution that proclaimed a second Decade of Action for Road Safety from 2021 to 2030, and urged support for the efforts of my Special Envoy for Road Safety and for the United Nations Road Safety Fund.
As we remember the victims of road traffic collisions, let’s commit to reimagining ways to move around the world that are safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable for all, everywhere.

Norway Expands its Support to UNESCO for Girls’ Transition from Primary to Lower Secondary Education Programme in Pakistan
Islamabad, 11 November 2020 The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has extended its support to UNESCO Pakistan with the approved funding of  13.5 million Norwegian Kroner (NOK) for the improvement of the “Girls’ Lower Secondary Education Programme (GLSEP)”. Currently, Norway supports the GLSEP programming in the districts of Swat and Kohistan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. Considering the low transition of girls’ from primary to secondary level due to multiple reasons, the Norwegian support has significant importance to facilitate girls’ post-primary education in Pakistan.
To strengthen the existing GLSEP portfolio, the Norwegian Government has agreed to the proposal of programme expansion in three additional districts of Pakistan. H.E. Kjell-Gunnar Eriksen, Norwegian Ambassador to Pakistan and Ms. Patricia McPhillips, UNESCO’s Representative/Director signed the agreement for additional funding of NOK 11 million to extend the scope of GLSEP in Mohamand, a newly merged tribal district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Muzaffargarh in Punjab and Tharparkar in Sindh provinces respectively. With the additional funding, 112 additional girls’ lower secondary schools including 20 schools from Mohmand district, 30 from Muzaffargarh, and 62 (12 for girls and 50 mixed schools) from Tharpakar will come under the purview of the Norwegian programme. With 46 girls’ schools in Kohistan and Swat, the total coverage of schools under the Norwegian programme will now be 158 girls/mixed lower secondary schools in 05 target districts. In addition to  Kohistan and Swat districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, the GLSEP in the three newly added districts will supplement its support in the transition of girls from primary to lower secondary education, through local and institutional interventions targeting multiple stakeholders including education officials, school management committees, community leaders, teachers and parents.
Ms. Patricia McPhillips commended the additional contribution of the Norwegian government and shared, “Huge number of girls are dropping out after the completion of primary education in Pakistan, particularly in the remotes areas, which is a serious issue.” She opined, “The Norwegian support is a significant step forward for promotion of girls’ lower secondary education in the most isolated districts of Pakistan.” UNESCO is already operational in the target districts and made substantive progress for access and quality of girls’ primary education. Norwegian support has been playing a vital role for UNESCO to work for the promotion of girls’ lower secondary education in the same geographical territories.
H.E. Kjell-Gunnar Eriksen appreciated UNESCO’s consistent support and stated, “The promotion of girls’ education is a priority for Norwegian programme support in Pakistan. The GLSEP is one of the biggest programmes of Norway in Pakistan, which is a testimony to our shared aspirations of winning the common goal of promoting girls’ education in the marginalised areas of the country.” He further added, “I am delighted to add on the existing funding, which will ensure consistency of our efforts for supporting the transition of girls to lower secondary education.”
Norway’s constant and long-standing programme support has made remarkable contributions to increasing both access and quality of education, with a special focus on girls. The Norwegian Government’s persistent commitment to invest in the education sector, with a holistic approach, to improve girls’ access and transition to quality lower secondary education, will further the prospects of girls’ education in Pakistan.

Worldwide Measles Deaths Climb 50% from 2016 to 2019 Claiming Over 207,500 Lives in 2019
NEW YORK/ GENEVA/ ATLANTA, 13 November 2020 – Measles surged worldwide in 2019 reaching highest number of reported cases in 23 years.  Highlighted in a publication by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), measles cases worldwide increased to 869,770 in 2019, the highest number reported since 1996 with increases in all WHO regions. Global measles deaths climbed nearly 50 percent since 2016, claiming an estimated 207,500 lives in 2019 alone.
After steady global progress from 2010 to 2016, the number of reported measles cases climbed progressively to 2019. Comparing 2019 data with the historic low in reported measles cases in 2016, authors cite a failure to vaccinate children on time with two doses of measles-containing vaccines (MCV1 and MCV2) as the main driver of these increases in cases and deaths.
“We know how to prevent measles outbreaks and deaths,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “These data send a clear message that we are failing to protect children from measles in every region of the world.  We must collectively work to support countries and engage communities to reach everyone, everywhere with measles vaccine and stop this deadly virus.”
Measles outbreaks occur when people who are not protected from the virus are infected and spread the disease to unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations.  To control measles and prevent outbreaks and deaths, vaccination coverage rates with the required MCV1 and MCV2 must reach 95 percent and be maintained at national and subnational levels.  MCV1 coverage has been stagnant globally for more than a decade at between 84 and 85 percent.  MCV2 coverage has been steadily increasing but is only now at 71 percent.   Vaccination coverage against measles remains well below the 95 percent or higher needed with both doses to control measles and prevent outbreaks and deaths.
Global response to COVID-19 pandemic must not exacerbate the measles crisis
Although reported cases of measles are lower in 2020, necessary efforts to control COVID-19 have resulted in disruptions in vaccination and crippled efforts to prevent and minimize measles outbreaks. As of November, more than 94 million people were at risk of missing vaccines due to paused measles campaigns in 26 countries.  Many of these countries are experiencing ongoing outbreaks.  Of countries with postponed planned 2020 campaigns, only eight (Brazil, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines and Somalia) resumed their campaigns after initial delays.
“Before there was a coronavirus crisis, the world was grappling with a measles crisis, and it has not gone away,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “While health systems are strained by the COVID-19 pandemic, we must not allow our fight against one deadly disease to come at the expense of our fight against another. This means ensuring we have the resources to continue immunization campaigns for all vaccine-preventable diseases, even as we address the growing COVID-19 pandemic.”
Causes of failure to control measles are many and must be addressed 
Global immunization partners are engaging leaders and public health professionals in affected and at-risk countries to ensure that measles vaccines are available and safely delivered, and that caregivers understand the life-saving benefit of the vaccine.  On 6 November 2020, WHO and UNICEF issued an emergency call to action for measles and polio outbreak prevention and response.
“Measles virus easily finds unprotected children, adolescents and adults because it is so contagious,” said Dr. Robert Linkins, Measles & Rubella Initiative Management Team Chair and Accelerated Disease Control Branch Chief at U.S. CDC. “Infections are not only a sign of poor measles vaccination coverage, but also a known marker, or ‘tracer,’ that vital health services may not be reaching populations most at-risk. Our collective efforts to reach children with vaccines now, ahead of the possible easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions and increased population movement, will save lives.”
The Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI), which includes American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the U.S. CDC, UNICEF and WHO, and global immunization partners like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others, are working to address the current measles crisis and ensure that resources are positioned to address immunization delays – for measles and all vaccines – in every region of the world.  A bold strategy released by M&RI, Measles & Rubella Strategic Framework 2021 – 2030, will help to address reversals in global progress toward measles elimination by bolstering strong, national immunization systems that can reach and protect children. This strategic shift by the partnership will focus on strengthening the routine delivery of all vaccines, and quickly and effectively detecting and responding to measles outbreaks.
Quotes from Our Partners
“These alarming figures should act as a warning that, with the COVID-19 pandemic occupying health systems across the world, we cannot afford to take our eye off the ball when it comes to other deadly diseases. Measles is entirely preventable; in a time in which we have a powerful, safe and cost-effective vaccine nobody should still be dying of this disease. COVID-19 has resulted in dangerous declines in immunization coverage, leading to increased risk of measles outbreaks. This is why countries urgently need to prioritize measles catch-up immunization through routine services to mitigate the risk of outbreaks and ensure no child goes without this lifesaving vaccine.” - Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
“The fact that measles outbreaks are occurring at the highest levels we’ve seen in a generation is unthinkable when we have a safe, cost-effective, and proven vaccine. No child should die from a vaccine-preventable disease. We are proud to chart a bold way forward with partners to close gaps in access to immunization and rapidly respond to outbreaks so everyone, everywhere can live healthy lives.” - Elizabeth Cousens, President & CEO, United Nations Foundation.
“We are concerned that COVID-19 will contribute to an increase in the number of measles cases and deaths. Measles knows no borders, and it is imperative we work together to vaccinate more children and continue the fight against this preventable disease. “Around the globe, Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers help families in chronically unvaccinated communities to protect their children. Join us in this effort.” - Gail McGovern, President & CEO of the American Red Cross.

The ‘Framework for SDG Aligned Finance’ identifies solutions to steer trillions of dollars available internationally towards the developing world
Paris, France - The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) launched a plan today to help public and private actors identify and prioritise investments contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The OECD-UNDP Framework for SDG Aligned Finance, presented at the Paris Peace Forum, identifies solutions to shift the trillions of dollars available internationally towards more sustainable and resilient investments and to further mobilize investment, especially to least developed countries, small islands developing states, and developing countries.
With an expected USD 700 billion drop in external finance to developing countries this year, the financing needed to meet the Global Goals is at risk of collapse, threatening decades of progress on poverty alleviation and sustainable development. But trillions of dollars available in the financial system could be better aligned with SDGs to curb this trend, considering that the financing gap to achieve the SDGs --around USD 2.5 trillion per year-- barely represents a small fraction of the global financial assets, including cash, bank deposits, bonds, stocks, etc.
“Over 379 trillion dollars of total assets are in the system held by banks, institutional investors and asset managers. Reallocating only 1.1% could be enough to fill the growing SDG financing gap. We need harmonised policies along the investment chain to make our savings and investment work better for people and the planet and build systemic resilience,” said OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria.
Requested by France’s G7 presidency last year, the framework was informed by an expert group of individuals across the public and private sectors. It builds upon existing principles and provides an ambitious yet feasible set of complementary measures, pertaining to policies, standards and tools, for both private actors and public authorities to deploy capital in ways that drive the greatest impact towards achieving SDGs without harming the intertwined goals.
A living document, OECD and UNDP will continue to refine the SDG Alignment Framework through ongoing dialogues in international economic and financial policymaking fora. Progress towards alignment of finance and the implementation of the framework will be updated and discussed at an annual event in Paris, as originally commissioned at the G7 development ministers meeting in 2019.
“SDG alignment is indeed the first and necessary step to put finance to work for the prosperity, peace and wellbeing of people and planet, reduce global inequalities, and to secure the long-term value of assets otherwise challenged by recurrent systemic shocks linked to poor management of global public goods. COVID-19 has made the case for alignment even stronger, waking us up to the costs of ignoring systemic risks, the interdependence of countries in their progress towards achieving the SDGs, and the interlinkages between the SDGs. As Covid-19 exposes, failure to meet one SDG will be of detriment to the others and will affect us all,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.
The framework was included as a key reference instrument in a declaration signed today in Paris by 450 development banks at the Finance in Common Summit, the first global summit of Public Development Banks. The declaration affirmed banks’ willingness to collectively shift their strategies, investment patterns and operating modalities to align with sustainable finance principles and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs and the objectives of the Paris Agreement while responding to the Covid-19 crisis.
“We need an international common framework for all actors, to ensure that public and private investments are compatible with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the challenge today is to ensure that the "recovery" of our economies, everywhere in the world, is indeed sustainable,” said the Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, French Minister of State for Tourism, French Nationals Abroad and Francophonie.
While the framework lays out the foundations for aligning the financial system to the SDGs, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, OECD and UNDP recognized that rethinking and transforming the financial system is a collective agenda. They called for private and public communities and international finance and economic platforms (such as the G7, G20, COP26) to translate recommendations into individual community action plans.
These efforts should converge into a coherent global strategy that supports and help implementing the United Nations Secretary General’s strategy for financing the 2030 agenda, and the menu of options presented by the Financing for Sustainable Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond.

Severe pneumonia leaves 4.2 million children desperate for oxygen each year
LONDON/ NEW YORK, 12 November 2020 – Severe pneumonia leaves an estimated 4.2 million children under the age of five in 124 low- and middle-income countries with critically low oxygen levels each year, new analysis from UNICEF, Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), Save the Children and Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI) has revealed.[i]
The agencies say the COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions to health services threaten to be a further blow in the battle against the world’s biggest infectious killer of children, which already claims the lives of over 800,000 children under the age of five each year. Pneumonia is caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, and leaves children fighting for breath as their lungs fill with pus and fluid. Severe pneumonia affects more than 22 million young children in low- and middle-income countries each year and kills more than malaria, measles and diarrhoea combined.
“COVID-19 has infected millions of people and rendered difficult global conditions for children even worse,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “While the world grapples with the pandemic and the severe consequences it poses for the most vulnerable, we must not lose sight of the fact that pneumonia continues to claim more than 2,000 young lives every day. Medical oxygen can help save some of these lives.”
Medical oxygen could save the lives of many children with severe pneumonia, coupled with antibiotics. But in many places, oxygen to treat a child with severe pneumonia over 3-4 days can cost at least £30-45. For the poorest families, that bill represents a huge barrier to treatment – if the child is able to get to a health facility with functioning oxygen and trained health workers at all, which are often scarce in poorer countries.
Poorer countries faced a huge lack of oxygen systems and supplies even before the onset of COVID-19. But surging needs due to the pandemic have given these shortages prominence. The good news is, oxygen can be produced locally at affordable cost.
Save the Children UK CEO Kevin Watkins said, “The pandemic has exposed a devastating oxygen shortage in the poorest countries. Each year millions of children reach health facilities in developing countries needing oxygen support. In much of Africa fewer than one-in-five get the treatment they need. Many die from exhaustion – their fragile bodies starved of the oxygen they need to recover.
“It doesn’t have to be this way. As the world races to scale up oxygen supply, to save lives from both COVID-19 and pneumonia it must get to the hardest to reach, be free for everyone and be sustainable. If we focus only on short term fixes, we risk missing a pivotal opportunity to save millions of lives for generations to come.”
Dr. Ian Barton, CHAI CEO said, “Helping countries establish resilient systems to provide oxygen reliably and efficiently will save lives during this pandemic and treat patients sustainably in the future.”
Modelling from Johns Hopkins has shown that disruption to newborn care, access to antibiotics and the delivery of pneumonia-fighting vaccines mean a combination of pneumonia and neonatal sepsis could be taking more than 25,000 additional children’s lives every month.[ii] In many countries, analysis of data from routine health information systems separately carried out by Save the Children and UNICEF shows that the numbers of children receiving immunization, diagnosis and treatment have fallen.
Following the onset of the pandemic, worsening shortages and rising prices of oxygen have been reported in countries with some of highest numbers of child pneumonia deaths, such as India[iii], Bangladesh[iv] and Nigeria[v]. According to the World Health Organisation, the poorest countries may currently have just five to 20% of the medical oxygen they need, overall[vi].
But the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked global efforts to improve oxygen supply systems. In just one sign of the scale of efforts to increase supply, the WHO and partners have distributed 30,000 oxygen concentrators to countries across the world. UNICEF alone has delivered over 15,000 concentrators to over 90 countries.[vii]
In a commentary published in the Lancet on World Pneumonia Day, 12 November, global health agencies including Save the Children and UNICEF call for governments and donors to build on the investment and efforts made to respond to COVID-19 to strengthen health systems that can tackle childhood pneumonia[viii].
Save the Children, CHAI and UNICEF are calling on donors and governments to:
· Invest in oxygen systems in lower- and middle- income countries, including in Africa and South Asia, to provide a sustainable supply of oxygen, closer to the children who need them.
· Maintain and strengthen essential routine health services critical for child survival during the COVID-19 outbreak and beyond, with a free to use basic health services package that includes oxygen therapy, including for children.
· Generate better data to monitor the pandemic and its effects on the health care system including coverage of pulse oximetry for diagnosis, oxygen and the recommended first line antibiotics for child pneumonia - amoxicillin in dispersible tablet form and injectable antibiotics for severe pneumonia.
Across the world, Save the Children, UNICEF and CHAI are scaling up programmes on the ground and joining forces with partners to get life-saving diagnosis and treatment to children. For example:
· In Nigeria, Save the Children has partnered with GSK to ensure every bed in the paediatric ward in Dutse General Hospital in Nigeria has a reliable supply of oxygen.
· In Ghana and Senegal, UNICEF procured oxygen supplies for the COVID-19 response while building on and expanding efforts to support government to improve access to essential treatment for children with pneumonia. In Sierra Leone, UNICEF supported the installation of three Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants across the country and in Bangladesh, UNICEF established a liquid medical oxygen plant for the Special Care Newborn Unit in Cox´s Bazar Sadar District Hospital to service Rohingya refugees.
· In Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, and Uganda—five countries that represent a third of global deaths from low-blood oxygen—CHAI has been working since 2016 to increase access to diagnosis and treatment. As finalists in the MacArthur Foundation’s 100&Change competition, CHAI and MCRI are seeking to save tens of thousands of lives each year by sustainably scaling up oxygen therapy and diagnosis in these five high-burden countries. CHAI is also working in partnership with PATH and the Every Breath Counts (EBC) Coalition on a COVID-19 Respiratory Care Response Coordination project to support countries in the development and execution respiratory care plan to meet the demands of COVID-19.

Over 50,000 Afghan refugee families benefit from emergency cash assistance
ISLAMABAD, 10 November 2020: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency has provided emergency cash assistance to over 50,000 vulnerable Afghan refugee families impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan.
The UNHCR emergency cash programme follows the Government of Pakistan’s Ehsaas emergency cash programme, where vulnerable Pakistani families receive a one-off cash grant of Rs.12,000 (approximately $77). UNHCR is targeting 70,000 of the most vulnerable refugee families.
This assistance is being carried out in close collaboration with the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON) and with the Pakistan Post. The Pakistan Post is currently disbursing the emergency cash assistance.
On Tuesday, UNHCR’s Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, Mr. Indrika Ratwatte – who is on a three-day visit to Pakistan – participated in the distribution of cash assistance to refugees at a Post Office in Islamabad. He also interacted with Afghan refugee elders. The UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Noriko Yoshida, and senior officials from the Post Office were also present on the occasion.
Mr. Ratwatte appreciated the progress achieved in reaching the significant milestone of 50,000. “I hope that efforts will continue to be made to reach the remaining vulnerable families affected by the pandemic,” he said.
Pakistan hosts over 1.4 million Afghan refugees, and during the pandemic thousands of refugees, including daily wage earners, were left without a source of income.
Mr. Ratwatte said that the assistance will help those hardest hit by the economic downturn. “Emergency cash assistance enables refugees to meet their most urgent needs,” he said.
He also thanked the Government of Pakistan for providing refugees with access to public services, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pakistan Post offers a protected environment for male and female refugees to receive their cash.
Appreciating the generous support of the international community, particularly Japan, the United States of America and the European Union, Mr. Ratwatte said donor support has been crucial at a time when refugees were going through immense challenges.
During Mr. Ratwatte’s stay in Pakistan, he will meet with senior Pakistani government officials, donors and UN representatives.

On this World Cities Day, we recognize the extraordinary contribution made by grassroots communities in our cities and towns.
The value of communities has been brought into sharp focus during the response to COVID-19.
Cities have borne the brunt of the pandemic.
Urban areas are already home to 55 per cent of the world’s population, and that figure is expected to grow to 68 per cent by 2050.
Our rapidly urbanizing world must respond effectively to this pandemic and prepare for future infectious disease outbreaks.
With the pandemic often overwhelming public health and support services, communities have organized to keep their neighbourhoods safe and functioning, engaging with local and national governments to support the official response.
We have seen neighbours shopping and cooking for the sick and elderly, residents cheering health workers, and local volunteer and faith-based groups supporting the vulnerable.
Communities are innovative, resilient and proactive.
They play a vital role in building economically, socially and environmentally sustainable cities.
Let us maintain this recognition of their value.
As we rebuild from the pandemic and engage in the Decade of Action for Sustainable Development, we have an opportunity to reset how we live and interact.
Local action is the key.
When urban communities are engaged in policy and decision making, and empowered with financial resources, the results are more inclusive and durable.
Let’s put our communities at the heart of the cities of the future

UNESCO Commemorates International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists (IDEI) 2020
November 2, Monday, Islamabad: International Day to End Impunity for All Crimes Against Journalists (IDEI) 2020 was commemorated on November 2, 2020 under UNESCO’s Multi-Donor Program on Freedom of Expression and Safety of Journalists. The event was held in collaboration with the European Union Delegation in Pakistan, the Embassy of Sweden, the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the High Commission of Canada.
At the 68th Session in 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution marking November 2, as the International Day to End Impunity for All Crimes Against Journalists (IDEI). Across the globe more than 1,000 journalists have been killed from 2006 – 2017 while reporting the news and bringing information to the public. This day recognizes the far reaching consequences of impunity, especially of crimes against journalists.
In the context of increasing gender based violence online, this year’s IDEI in Pakistan focused on the challenges faced by the women journalists and media workers. Earlier this year, women journalists, bloggers, media workers and human rights activists issued a statement highlighting the abuse/harassment faced by them on different online platforms. This statement has brought attention to the growing concerns of women journalists and media workers while performing their duties. According to reports the number of women journalists is already less than five percent, and those in the profession face substantial risks and hurdles. The nature of risks are exacerbated by a rapidly evolving spree of hateful speech, incitement, cyber harassment and violence now occurring online.
Ms. Patricia McPhillips, Country Representative and Director, UNESCO welcomed the participants and stressed that, “It is necessary to recognize that if women’s voices are silenced, half of Pakistan is silenced.
Therefore, increasing gender-based violence on online platforms is not a women’s issue alone, or an issue for transgender persons or digital activists, journalists and bloggers alone, but an issue central to protecting democratic values”.
During the event, Ms. Tanzeela Mazhar, a journalist argued that in order to ensure media freedom, women media workers should be protected from coordinated campaigns of abuse and harassment. Digital rights expert, Ms. Nighat Dad, who runs the only cyber harassment helpline in Pakistan, shared her experiences of supporting individuals that reach out via the helpline. She further highlighted the gaps in available avenues for legal aid, psychosocial support and capacity building of ordinary citizens in safely experiencing the internet. Mr. Ali Arsalan explained that harassment and abuse occurring in online and offline spaces are resulting in creating huge implications for youth.
H.E. Ms. Wendy  Gilmour, High Commissioner of Canada in her concluding remarks emphasized that the role of independent media in a democracy is crucial and it must be protected at all costs. She noted there is growing recognition by the international community of the need to take into account the specific risks women journalists face both offline and online.

ADB, Pakistan Sign $2 Million Grant Agreement to Combat COVID-19 through UNICEF
ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN (3 November 2020) — The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Pakistan today signed a $2 million grant agreement to strengthen Pakistan’s efforts to combat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
Secretary of the Economic Affairs Division, Noor Ahmed and ADB Country Director for Pakistan, Xiaohong Yang signed the agreement. The grant financed from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund, will help provide life-saving medical supplies, diagnostic and laboratory facilities, and other critical equipment for communities affected by the pandemic.
Ms. Yang and Representative of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in Pakistan Aida Girma signed the administrative agreement, which will enable UNICEF to procure the supplies and equipment using the grant.
“ADB continues to work closely with the Government of Pakistan and development partners to assist Pakistan in sustaining the gains made in combating the pandemic” said ADB Country Director for Pakistan Xiaohong Yang. “The grant to be administered through UNICEF will help strengthen Pakistan’s response to the COVID-19 challenge. Pakistan needs to maintain its strong efforts to contain the pandemic through robust prevention and control measures as well as by ensuring the provision of essential medical and emergency healthcare facilities, considering the recent increase in the infection rates.”
The grant supplements an initial $500,000 provided by ADB through UNICEF to support Pakistan’s procurement of emergency supplies and personal protective equipment. These have been delivered to doctors, nurses, and other medical staff in major health facilities prioritized by the government.
“Since the outbreak of the pandemic, UNICEF has been at the forefront supporting the Government of Pakistan in its efforts to mitigate the spread of coronavirus in the country, said UNICEF Representative in Pakistan,” Aida Girma. “More specifically, UNICEF has supported the national response in risk communication and community engagement by ensuring timely and accurate information to families and communities and promoting positive behavior to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19, and procured life-saving medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE).  We have also endeavored to ensure continuation of essential services including immunization and health, nutrition, education, child protection and water, sanitation and hygiene. We appreciate the Asian Development Bank’s continued and generous financial support to UNICEF’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic”.
In April, ADB reallocated $30 million from the National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF) to support Pakistan’s pandemic response. The NDRMF Board of Directors allocated an additional $20 million from earned interest from the Endowment Fund capitalized under the project.
In May, ADB approved a $300 million emergency assistance loan to solidify Pakistan’s public health response to the pandemic and help reboot economic activities. The Government of Norway has also contributed a $5.28 million grant to be administered through ADB to strengthen the emergency response system in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province amid the COVID-19 crisis. In June, the bank approved a $500 million budget support loan to help deliver social protection programs to the poor and vulnerable, expand health sector capabilities, and deliver a pro-poor fiscal stimulus to boost growth and create jobs.
ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members—49 from the region.

Special Training for Women Law Enforcement Officers on Investigative Techniques related to Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants
02 November 2020, Islamabad - The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), under the framework of the Global Action to Prevent and Address Trafficking in Persons and the Smuggling of Migrants in Asia and the Middle East (GLO.ACT – Asia and the Middle East), is organizing from 2 to 6 November 2020 a special training for 25 female law enforcement officers on investigative techniques related to Trafficking in Persons (TIP) and the Smuggling of Migrants (SOM) at the Ramada Hotel Islamabad, Pakistan.
GLO.ACT-Asia and the Middle East is a four year joint initiative by the European Union (EU) and UNODC implemented in partnership with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in four countries in the region of Asia and Middle East, including Pakistan. The project reaffirms that combating human trafficking and migrant smuggling is of the highest importance for the EU and the United Nations as a whole.
Welcoming the participants, Jeremy Milsom, Representative, UNODC Pakistan said “As a woman who is raising a family while pursuing a career you face the challenge of doing two full-time jobs at once. Yet your positions as law enforcement officers place additional burdens on you at work and at home, requiring you to intervene, console, and protect other families while also maintaining peace within your community. We deeply admire the dedication, skills and enthusiasm you bring to both these tasks.”
Wajid Zia, Director General FIA, in his opening remarks, while thanking UNODC and EU said“ The presence of all these women law enforcement officers here is evidence of a strong partnership and a shared recognition in the indisputable correlation between women’s empowerment and global peace.” He further added that “during the past few years, our joint efforts have resulted in several accomplishments. These include the development of Pakistan’s National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling (2015-2020), the enactment of TIP and SOM Laws in June 2018. These efforts show our strong commitment to address problems related to human trafficking and migrant smuggling.”
Highlighting the importance of women’s role in policing, Androulla Kaminara, Ambassador of the European Union to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan said, “There are many benefits when women are better represented in law enforcement. In gender-based forms of violence, such as trafficking in persons, the security needs of men and women differ.  Women bring skills that strengthen and improve the police force - and are less likely to resort to force. Women police officers are able to connect with communities on a different level- and their presence can help improve internal team dynamics. I hope to see more women represented in law enforcement to make justice more accessible to a broader spectrum of society”
17 female officers from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and 8 female police officers of the Punjab police will participate in the training. Upon conclusion of the training the participants will understand the differences and connections between TIP and SOM, and will have gained a demonstrable understanding of both, international and national legal frameworks, concerning those crimes. Participants will also understand how human trafficking and migrant smuggling intersect with other crimes, and how other articles of law can be relevant in such cases.  GLO.ACT seeks to address the heavly gendered nature of TIP and SOM through such specialized training and is hopeful that middle and senior managers will be encouraged to ensure that the training participants will be given access to the full range of police duties.
The training is being in strict adherence to  the government COVID-19 guidelines and is made possible with the financial support of the European Union.

UNICEF condemns attack on religious school in Peshawar
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - 27 October 2020: UNICEF strongly condemns the attack on a religious school which took place in Peshawar earlier today, reportedly killing at least seven people and injuring more than 75 -- some of them children and teachers.
“Education is the fundamental right of every girl and boy, everywhere. Schools must never be targeted. They must remain safe learning environments at all times to protect the growth and healthy development of children, adolescents and young people,” said UNICEF’s Pakistan Representative Ms. Aida Girma.
According to several reports, the blast occurred as students were attending an early morning class at Jamia Zubairia Madrasa in the Dir Colony Area of Pakistan’s northwestern city. This comes two years after an attack on a school in Chitral in October 2018, and a string of attacks on a dozen schools ─ most of them for girls ─ in Gilgit-Baltistan's Diamer district in August 2018.

Dear friends,
The 75th anniversary of the United Nations falls in the middle of a global pandemic. Our founding mission is more critical than ever.
To promote human dignity.
Protect human rights.
Respect international law.
And save humanity from war.
When the pandemic hit, I called for a global ceasefire.
In our world today, we have one common enemy: COVID-19.
Now is the time for a stepped-up push for peace to achieve a global ceasefire.  The clock is ticking.
We must also make peace with our planet.
The climate emergency threatens life itself.
We must mobilize the whole world to reach carbon neutrality -- net zero emissions of greenhouse gasses by 2050.
A growing number of countries and companies have already pledged to meet this goal.
Around the world, we must do more to end human suffering from poverty, inequality, hunger and hatred -- and fight discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender or any other distinction.  The months of pandemic have seen a horrific rise in violence against women and girls.
We must build on progress.  A remarkable global collaboration is under way for a safe, affordable and accessible COVID-19 vaccine for all.
The Sustainable Development Goals give us an inspiring blueprint for recovering better.
We face colossal challenges.  With global solidarity and cooperation, we can overcome them.
That’s what the United Nations is all about.
On this anniversary, I ask people everywhere to join together.
The United Nations not only stands with you…
The United Nations belongs to you and is you: “we the peoples”.
Together, let us uphold the enduring values of the United Nations Charter.
Let us build on our advances across the decades.
Let us realize our shared vision of a better world for all.

World Food Day 2020 marks FAO’s 75th anniversary - calls for solidarity to support those who suffer from hunger and for the need to ensure healthy diets for all, as the country deals with the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic
16 October 2020, Islamabad: At the global World Food Day ceremony today, speakers called for solidarity to help all populations and to build back better by making food systems more robust and resilient. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) observed World Food Day 2020 in collaboration with the Ministry of National Food Security Research, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC), World Food Program (WFP), Oxfam and IFAD.
This year’s commemoration is being held at the National Agriculture Research Center (NARC) Auditorium in Islamabad, under the theme “Grow, nourish, sustain. Together”. The focus is on the importance of healthy diets and the contribution of food heroes, particularly smallholder farmers, including women towards achieving “zero hunger” and fighting malnutrition in their communities. Considering the COVID-19 health measures’ advice against physical gatherings, the event was held under strict COVID-19 SOPs. The event is attended by several experts and guests virtually. The primary aim of the day is to enhance public awareness about long-term global food challenges and to advance further national and international cohesion in the fight against hunger, malnutrition and poverty.
Chief Guest of the event, Syed Fakhar Imam the Federal Minister for National Food Security & Research, while delivering his speech, stated that “Present Government fully appreciates the importance of agriculture in ensuring food security and we are focusing to ensure supply of key inputs fertilizer, seed, pesticides at rational prices and endeavors to create an environment where farmers get a fair return to their produce.”
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations-FAO Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Mina Dowlatchahi highlighted the importance of reliable data and information to support targeted policies and collective action by government, civil society and private sector to address food insecurity and malnutrition in Pakistan, at a challenging time amidst COVID-19 pandemic impacts and natural hazards shocks and transboundary pests. Small holder farmers and off-farm agriculture workers, women and men, need to be able to access financial resources, knowledge, technology and innovation to produce and move “farm to fork” more, safer, and diversified food to improve livelihoods and diets of the people of Pakistan. She further added “Our future food systems need to ensure affordable and healthy diets for all, and decent livelihoods for food system workers, while preserving natural resources and biodiversity”.
On the occasion, Dr. Muhammad Azeem Khan, the Chairman, PARC, stressed that “we have compromised agriculture sector performance due to vagaries of climate change and food insecurity is one of the worst effects of climate change.” He added that PARC has successfully carried out research and now promoting foods which have high value of quality protein and rich source of minerals and vitamins like Talapia fish, Soybean and its products, food legumes dairy products etc. The Chairman was also of the view that to address the low productivity issues, PM Agriculture emergency program was launched for 13 major areas of agriculture worth 277 billon.
“The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) is humbled and honored to have been awarded the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. We are grateful as it shines a light on the importance of the right to food,” said Chris Kaye, Representative and Country Director WFP Pakistan. “WFP is committed to working together with the Government of Pakistan to provide the support needed by the most vulnerable and at-risk communities, to improve nutrition and build resilience”, Chris added.
Country Representative of IFAD Mr. Hubert Boirard ensured the organization’s commitment to contribute with the other UN agencies, the government and the development partners, to achieve the objective of Zero Hunger. He stated that “IFAD co-invests in rural people through its program of loans and grants (POLG) in partnership with Government of Pakistan and aims to sustainably eradicate rural poverty.
On the occasion, Country Director of Oxfam Pakistan Mr. Shahnawaz called for stronger cooperation in the face of global health and food security. The speakers at the event underscored the urgent need to step up collective efforts to reach the Zero Hunger goal.
Collective action across 150 countries makes World Food Day one of the most celebrated days of the UN calendar. The government, the private sector and civil society need to make sure that our food systems grow a variety of food to nourish a growing population and sustain the country together. To achieve a prosperous tomorrow, we need enriched production, enhanced nutrition, and a healthier environment; more importantly, we need every one of us—for a sustainable livelihood of all the people.

Title: Media Update: United Nations Pakistan, 15 October 2020
Content: 15 October 2020
This Media Update includes:
Rural women play a critical role in agriculture, food security and nutrition, building climate resilience, and managing land and natural resources. But many rural women suffer from discrimination, systemic racism and structural poverty.
The COVID-19 pandemic has now affected more than half the world’s women farmers with restrictions on movement, the closure of shops and markets, and disruption to their supply chains. Combined with challenges including increased unpaid care and domestic work and rising rates of gender-based violence, rural women are bearing some of the heaviest burdens of the pandemic.
Digital channels can offer a lifeline in rural areas, providing information on access to healthcare as well as agricultural updates. However, the gender digital divide is particularly wide for rural women, who make up just a quarter of users of digital agricultural solutions.
Helping rural women through the pandemic and building their resilience for the future will require solidarity and support from all.
Together, we must invest in rural women so that they have access to the healthcare, social protection and agricultural information services they need. We must close the digital divide and provide essential services to respond to the shadow pandemic of violence against women. And we must tackle the discriminatory land and inheritance laws and practices that make rural women vulnerable to losing their sources of income.
On the International Day of Rural Women, let us renew our commitment to rural women in all their diversity; increase our efforts to support them through the COVID-19 pandemic; and work with them to build their resilience to future crises.

Voices of Food Systems Live: 24-Hour Global Relay Conversation
WHAT: A 24-hour global relay conversation on World Food Day to launch the UN Food Systems Summit engagement process for the coming year. The marathon virtual conversation will bring together celebrity chefs, indigenous peoples, CEOs, youth activists, celebrities, small farmers, heads of state, and the general public, to discuss how to transform our food systems in the next 10 years.
WHEN: Friday, October 16, starting at 12 p.m. Fiji Standard Time (8 p.m. EST October 15) and moving around the world every hour for the entire day.
WHO: Jioji Konrote, President of Fiji, will open this one-of-kind global dialogue with chef, author and TV presenter Robert Oliver.
Speakers across the 24-hours will include:
The sessions will focus on some of the world’s most pressing issues: saving the last original colony of bees on a remote island; growing food in the middle of the desert; reintroducing ancient foods into modern kitchens; promoting non-violent movements to create change; hearing from refugees about the loss of their food culture; and much more.
Dr. Kalibata, and deputy to the Special Envoy, Martin Frick, are available for interviews on request.
Dr. Kalibata will also brief the press on Monday, 12 October, as guest at the daily UN noon briefing (12pm ET) on WebTV.
WHERE: The sessions will be broadcast via Zoom across Twitter, Facebook Live and YouTube. More information, including registration details, are available here: https://bit.ly/VoicesofFoodSystems
WHY: The UN Food Systems Summit is under way to identify bold new actions, solutions and strategies to deliver progress on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals, each of which relies to some degree on healthier, more sustainable and equitable food systems.
The Food Systems Summit Dialogues, launching on World Food Day, are a core component of the Food Systems Summit process and offer one of the most dynamic ways to engage stakeholders in considering their role in food systems, how their roles link with others, and ways in which they can unite around transformative actions in support of the SDGs. The Dialogues present an opportunity to engage all citizens as food system stakeholders, and to bring people together in a time where so much is pushing them apart.
The 24-hour global relay conversation will also highlight the Food Systems Summit’s five “Action Tracks” and cross-cutting levers of change. With 10 years to go to deliver the SDGs, the online conversation must stimulate greater local participation and partnership for a global movement.
Each 50-minute session, which will be produced by Future Food Institute, will feature video messages, statements, commitments and calls to action.

Thai celebrity Cindy Sirinya Bishop campaigning for women’s rights as new UN Women Regional Goodwill Ambassador for Asia and the Pacific
Bangkok, Thailand -- Thai celebrity and rights activist Cindy Sirinya Bishop is working to stop violence and other abuses against women as the newly appointed UN Women Regional Goodwill Ambassador for Asia and the Pacific.
Bishop, 41, is a model and actress who is best known as the host of Asia's Next Top Model, a television show broadcast in most countries in the region.
During her 2-year appointment, which began in September, Bishop is representing UN Women to promote gender equality and other UN Women priority goals, raise funds and build partnerships. She is promoting public awareness through education, dialogue and cooperation with schools, communities and governments.
“It is truly an honour to become the first UN Women Goodwill Ambassador to Asia and the Pacific,” Bishop said. “My mother instilled in me very early on a strong sense of justice and fierce belief in the resilience and strength of women, and these values continue to guide me today. I am so deeply grateful for the opportunity to work towards achieving greater gender equality in the region, especially in the areas of eliminating gender-based violence and in providing equal opportunity for girls and women to realize their full potential.”
Bishop is one of Thailand’s leading campaigners on ending violence against women.
In early 2018, she came across a newspaper headline about Thai authorities telling women to not look “sexy” if they want to avoid sexual assault during the Thai new year festival. Having experienced violence herself at the festival, Bishop spoke out in a social media video hashtagged #DontTellMeHowtoDress. #DontTellMeHowtoDress quickly evolved into a movement championing gender equality and has been extensively covered by local and international media.
In July 2018, Bishop collaborated with UN Women to organize the Social Power Exhibition Against Sexual Assault. The exhibition was supported by United Nations agencies; the governments of Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; embassies; the media; and civil society and youth groups. Bishop worked with civil society organizations in the Philippines and Singapore on #DontTellMeHowToDress.
In November 2018, Bishop received the “Activist of the Year Award” from the office of the Prime Minister of Thailand.
Bishop also is the Knowledge Director of Dragonfly360, a regional platform that advocates for gender equality in Asia. She is writing a series of children’s books on safety, rights and respectful relationships.
“Your strong commitment to ending violence against women, demonstrated through your creation of the #DontTellMeHowtoDress movement and your work with UN Women so far, has shown you to be a compelling and eloquent advocate,” UN Women Regional Director Mohammad Naciri said in inviting Bishop to be UN Women regional goodwill ambassador.
UN Women is the United Nations organization dedicated speeding up progress on gender equality and the empowerment of women worldwide.

بنکاک، تھائی لینڈ – تھائی لینڈ کی مشہور شخصیت اور حقوق کی  فعال کارکن سنڈی سیرینیا بشپ، ایشیا اور پیسیفک کے لئے یو این ویمن کی علاقائی خیرسگالی سفیر مقرر ہونے کے بعد خواتین پر تشدد اور دیگر اقسام کی بدسلوکی  روکنے کی مہم  پر بھرپور انداز میں کام کر رہی ہیں۔
اکتالیس سالہ سنڈی بشپ ایک مشہور ماڈل اور اداکارہ ہیں جنہوں نے خطے کے بیشتر ممالک میں نشر ہونے والے ٹی وی شو "ایشیاز نیکسٹ ٹاپ ماڈل" کی میزبان کی حیثیت سے خاصی شہرت حاصل کی۔
سنڈی بشپ کو ستمبر 2020 میں  دوسالہ مدت کے لئے خیرسگالی سفیر مقرر کیا گیا اور وہ صنفی مساوات  سمیت یو این ویمن کے ترجیحی مقاصد کے فروغ، فنڈز مہم اور پارٹنرشپس کی ترویج سے متعلق سرگرمیوں میں یو این ویمن کی نمائندگی کر رہی ہیں۔ وہ مختلف حکومتوں، سکولوں اور کمیونٹیز کے ساتھ تعاون، ڈائیلاگ اور شعور و آگاہی جیسی سرگرمیوں کے ذریعے لوگوں میں آگاہی پیدا کرنے کے لئے بھی کام کر رہی ہیں۔
سنڈی بشپ نے اپنے خیالات کا اظہار کرتے ہوئے ایشیا اور پیسیفک  کے لئے یو این ویمن کی پہلی خیرسگالی سفیر کے طور پر تقرری کو اپنے لئے اعزاز قرار دیا اور کہا کہ میری والدہ نے چھوٹی عمر سے ہی میرے اندر انصاف اور عورتوں کی ہمت و قوت پر پختہ یقین کا بھرپور احساس پیدا کیا اور یہ اقدار آج بھی میری رہنمائی کرتی ہیں۔ میں خطے میں صنفی برابری کی صورتحال کو بہتر بنانے کے  ساتھ ساتھ صنفی تشدد کے خاتمہ اور لڑکیوں اور خواتین کو ان کی بھرپور استعداد کے مطابق برابر مواقع فراہم کرنے کی اس جدوجہد میں اپنا کردار ادا کرنے کا یہ شاندار موقع ملنے پر انتہائی شکرگزار ہوں۔
سنڈی بشپ، تھائی لینڈ میں بھی خواتین پر تشدد کے خاتمہ کی مہم میں پیش پیش رہی ہیں۔
2018 کے اوائل میں  تھائی اخبارات میں شائع ہونے والی یہ خبر سنڈی بشپ کی نظر سے بھی گزری جس میں تھائی حکام نے خواتین کو مشورہ دیا تھا کہ اگر وہ سال نو کے جشن کے موقع پر جنسی تشدد سے بچنا چاہتی ہیں تو "جا‍‍زب" نظر نہ آئیں۔ سنڈی بشپ خود بھی ماضی میں اس تہوار کے موقع پر تشدد کا سامنا کر چکی تھیں، لہٰذا انہوں نے اس پر آواز اٹھائی اور "ڈونٹ ٹیل میں ہاؤ ٹو ڈریس" (#DontTellMeHowtoDress) کے ہیش ٹیگ کے ساتھ سوشل میڈیا پر اپنی وڈیو شیئر کی۔ اس ہیش ٹیگ نے بڑی تیزی کے ساتھ صنفی برابری کی ایک تحریک کی شکل اختیار کر لی جسے ملکی اور بین الاقوامی میڈیا نے بھرپور کوریج دی۔
جولائی 2018 میں سنڈی بشپ نے یو این ویمن کے ساتھ مل کر جنسی تشدد کے خلاف سماجی قوت کی نمائش   کا اہتمام کیا۔ نمائش کی حمایت کرنے والوں میں اقوام متحدہ کے ادارے، تھائی لینڈ، فلپائن اور سنگاپور کی حکومتیں، ایسوسی ایشن آف ساؤتھ ایسٹ ایشین نیشنز، غیرملکی سفارتخانے، میڈیا، سول سوسائٹی اور نوجوانوں کے گروپ بھی شامل تھے۔ سنڈی بشپ نے فلپائن اور سنگاپور کی حکومتوں کے ساتھ مل کر بھی "ڈونٹ ٹیل می ہاؤ ٹو ڈریس"  پر کام کیا۔
نومبر 2018 میں سنڈی بشپ کو تھائی لینڈ کے وزیراعظم کی جانب سے "ایکٹیوسٹ آف دی ایئر" کا ایوارڈ دیا گیا۔
سنڈی بشپ، ایشیا میں صنفی برابری کے لئے سرگرم علاقائی پلیٹ فارم ڈریگن فلائی 360،   کی نالج ڈائریکٹر بھی ہیں۔ وہ تحفظ، حقوق اور احترام پر مبنی تعلقات پر بچوں کے لئے سلسلہ وار کتب بھی تحریر کر رہی ہیں۔
سنڈی بشپ کو یو این ویمن کی علاقائی خیرسگالی سفیر بننے کی دعوت دیتے ہوئے یو این ویمن کے ریجنل ڈائریکٹر محمد ناصری نے کہا کہ "خواتین پر تشدد کے خاتمہ کے لئے آپ کا پختہ عزم، جس کا اظہار آپ 'ڈونٹ ٹیل می ہاؤ ٹو ڈریس' جیسی مہم اور یو این ویمن کے لئے اپنی اب تک کی خدمات کی شکل میں کر چکی ہیں، یہ ظاہر کرتا ہے کہ آپ ان مقاصد کی مضبوط اور پرزور حامی ہیں"۔

یو این ویمن، دنیا بھر میں صنفی برابری اور خواتین کی خودمختاری کے عمل کو تیز کرنے کے لئے سرگرم عمل اقوام متحدہ کا ادارہ ہے۔

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought renewed attention to the importance of strengthening disaster risk reduction.
Many countries are facing multiple crises simultaneously.
We will see more of this.
Extreme weather events have risen dramatically over the past two decades.
Yet, we have seen little progress on reducing climate disruption and environmental degradation.
Bad situations only get worse without good disaster risk governance.
Disaster risk isn’t the sole responsibility of local and national authorities.
COVID-19 has shown us that systemic risk requires international cooperation.
Good disaster risk governance means acting on science and evidence.
And that requires political commitment at the highest level to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
To eradicate poverty and reduce the impacts of climate change, we must place the public good above all other considerations.
For these reasons and more, this year’s International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is all about strengthening disaster risk governance to build a safer and more resilient world.

UNODC HANDS-OVER CRIME SCENE VEHICLES TO GUJRANWALA POLICE
12 October 2020, Gujranwala: A ground-breaking ceremony of handing over state-of-the-art purpose-built Crime Scene Vehicles to Gujranwala Police concludes among a lot of applause at the Gujranwala Police Lines on 12 October 2020. It brought together a cross-section of criminal justice sector stakeholders, including district police Gujranwala, Punjab Police and key representatives from UNODC. The event was appreciated as one of the milestones among a stream of transformative activities supported by the partnership between the Punjab Police and UNODC with the generous support of the Government of Norway.

As the first-ever intervention of its kind for the Gujranwala Police, Mr. Milsom mentioned that this will go a long way in modeling investigation techniques and skills of front-line police personnel through access to state-of-the-art crime scene vehicles. He further affirmed UNODC’s commitment towards delivering peace and justice to the people of Pakistan
Through the Crime Scene Vehicles, Gujranwala Police will have the means to deploy better support in the gathering and processing of physical and forensic evidence in line with international standards. The ceremony was well-represented by senior representatives of Gujranwala Police. The participants appreciated the intervention as a refreshing and long-awaited step towards modernizing a speedy and efficient gathering of evidence in crime scene investigations.

I am delighted by the decision of the Nobel Committee to award this year’s Prize for Peace to the United Nations World Food Programme.
I warmly congratulate David Beasley, WFP Executive Director, and the entire staff of the World Food Programme, on this recognition.
The World Food Programme is the world’s first responder on the frontlines of food insecurity.
In a world of plenty, it is unconscionable that hundreds of millions go to bed each night hungry.  Millions more are now on the precipice of famine due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In my ten years as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I had the privilege to work hand-in-hand with my colleagues from the World Food Programme.
I have seen them in the most remote and dangerous locations with enormous courage, dedication and competence serving the most vulnerable of the vulnerable people of this world.
There is also a hunger everywhere for international cooperation.  The World Food Programme feeds that need, too.  WFP operates above the realm of politics, with humanitarian need driving its operations.  The organization itself survives on voluntary contributions from UN Member States and the public at large.
Such solidarity is precisely needed now to address not only the pandemic, but other global tests of our time.  We know that existential threats such as climate change will make the hunger crisis even worse.  We know that achieving zero hunger is an imperative for peace.
A hungry world is not a peaceful world.
I salute the women and men of the World Food Programme — and indeed the entire UN team — for all their efforts to advance the cause of peace and the values of the United Nations today and every day.

This year, we mark the International Day of the Girl against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, and resurgent movements for social justice.
As we strengthen the response to the pandemic and plan for a strong recovery, we have an opportunity to create a better, fairer, more equal world for girls everywhere. The best way to achieve this is by following the leadership of girls themselves.
This year’s theme, “My Voice: Our Equal Future” calls on us to amplify the voices of adolescent girls, and put their needs at the forefront of laws, policies and practices in every country and community around the world.
The gaps between girls and boys remain unacceptably wide. Adolescent girls are locked out of opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), not for lack of talent or ambition — but because they are girls. Globally, the percentage of women among graduates in these subjects is below 15 percent in over two-thirds of countries.
It doesn’t have to be this way.
Generation Equality is our global campaign and call to commit to working with and for girls, everywhere.
We must support girls by giving them access to the tools they need to shape their own destinies. That includes the technological skills, connectivity and safety they need to thrive in a digital world.
We can all draw inspiration from the adolescent girls who are taking the lead and shaping better lives for themselves — and for others.
Teenage girls are the new leaders of our time, creating global movements for change. They’re ready for the challenge.
On this International Day of the Girl, let’s stand together with them and for them.
Let’s nourish their talents, amplify their voices and work together for a better, more equal future for us all.

WFP HANDS OVER HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE FACILITY TO AZAD JAMMU & KASHMIR TO BOOST GOVERNMENT EMERGENCY RESPOSNE CAPACITY
Muzaffarabad – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) today handed over a state-of-the-art Humanitarian Response Facility (HRF) to the Government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). The facility will be used to store and dispatch humanitarian relief supplies for future emergencies, augmenting national capacity and reducing the time needed to respond to crises.
The Honorable Prime Minister of AJK, Raja Muhammad Farooq Haider Khan, expressed his gratitude to WFP, donor countries and the United Nations for their support and assistance in relief and rebuilding efforts following the 2005 earthquake. He thanked WFP for standing with the people and the Government in times of such grave humanitarian needs and in strengthening the capacity of the State Disaster Management Authority.
“Pakistan is a disaster-prone country frequently hit by earthquakes, floods, droughts and blizzards. Due to climate change, incidents of natural calamities are on the rise and so are their damaging force,” said Chris Kaye, WFP Pakistan Country Director.
“We hope through the Humanitarian Response Facility, local authorities and communities can be better prepared for future hazards. WFP is committed to continuing its support to the National Disaster Management Authority and the Provincial and State Disaster Management Authorities in building such resilience against future shocks,” he added.
The total storage capacity amounts to 960 metric tons within two 15 x 32 metre warehouse units and an open storage space of up to 10,000 metric tonnes. A second phase to expand the facility will commence soon. The facility in AJK is the eighth central storage response facility built by WFP to strengthen the disaster management capacity in the country. Similar humanitarian response facilities have been set-up in Muzaffargarh, Quetta, Lahore, Hyderabad, Peshawar, Sukkur and Gilgit Baltistan and have played an important role in responding to droughts, floods, snow emergencies and more recently, COVID-19.
The handover ceremony held in Muzaffarabad also commemorated the 15th anniversary of the devastating 7.6 magnitude earthquake that struck on 8 October 2005. Thousands of lives were lost and many more were injuried, with massive destruction to infastructure.
The new facility was built in close collaboration with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the AJK State Disaster Management Authority, with generous contributions from the governments of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States.
The event was also attended by the representatives from ECHO, Australia, Islamic Development Bank and Canada, government line departments, NDMA, SDMA, government departments, civil society and media.

1,000,000 people to benefit from the supply of critical medical equipment by Japan through UNOPS to support the COVID-19 response in Pakistan
Urgently needed testing equipment, medical supplies and personal protective equipment worth $4 million funded by the Government of Japan will be provided for patients and medical staff across the country.
●     Funded by the Government of Japan, UNOPS is working with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the Health Department-Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to provide critical medical supplies and equipment to support the Government of Pakistan’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
●     Vital medical supplies, including PCR testing equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE), are being provided through UNOPS’ efficient emergency procurement procedures.
●     Gender-responsiveness in the procurement process will ensure that the PPEs supplied can be used safely and effectively and comfortably by all medical staff.
●     The project commenced in June 2020 and all project partners are working closely to continue to identify and provide the most essentially-needed medical supplies.
In partnership with the Government of Japan, NDMA and Health Department-Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, UNOPS will utilise the $4 million funding for procuring essential medical supplies to support the Government of Pakistan’s efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus and provide effective medical care to those affected. An estimated 900,000 patients and 100,000 medical staff are expected to benefit from these supplies.
Under this project, PCR testing kits will be provided for continued widespread testing for COVID-19, medical equipment will be supplied for the treatment and management of patients and personal protective equipment (PPE) will be given to doctors and medical staff to reduce their risk of infection.
To ensure that the PPE can be used with ease by both men and women, various factors are being used to determine the specifications of these supplies. This includes sizing requirements for men and women, color coding by gender, culturally-sensitive design for items such as medical suits and 50% of PPEs allocated for women.
UNOPS is working closely with all project partners to identify areas of need in the country and obtain the necessary medical supplies. The quick and safe delivery of these items will be done through UNOPS’ emergency procurement procedures, which have been utilized to effectively support countries across the globe in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. After procuring the equipment, UNOPS will continue to coordinate the timely distribution of supplies with partners, ensuring maximum transparency in the process.
Ms. Marysia Zapasnik, UNOPS Country Manager for Pakistan, said, "The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for essential medical supplies in the country. With generous support from the Government of Japan, we are working with the NDMA and HD-KP to provide protective equipment for healthcare workers and critically-needed resources for widespread testing and effective medical treatment of patients. UNOPS is committed to supporting the Government of Pakistan in tackling this pandemic and working with our partners for the health and well-being of the Pakistani people.”
Mr. Muhammad Idrees Mahsud, Member DRR NDMA  said, “NDMA highly appreciates the support being provided by the Government of Japan and the UNOPS through provision of supplies and critical equipment particularly testing kits and paraphernalia. Such support during this critical time is likely to contribute to the effective response and strategy implementation for COVID 19 in Pakistan. The Government of Japan has been generously supporting disaster management activities in Pakistan.  The Government of Pakistan and NDMA looks forward to continued support and cooperation with Japanese Government and UN organizations particularly UNOPS.”
Mr. Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Secretary to Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa said, "This project will play a key role in our response to COVID-19. Through the testing kits, medical equipment and PPEs, the project will enable us to serve the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and help provide patients and medical personnel with the necessary medical supplies to tackle this pandemic. We are proud to work with the Government of Japan and UNOPS Pakistan towards this shared goal."
Dr. Amena Hasan, Project Manager, UNOPS said, "Through UNOPS' efficient and transparent emergency procurement procedures, this project will address the critical need of medical supplies to combat COVID-19 across the country. We have been working with the Government of Japan, NDMA and HD-KP to identify the most essentially needed supplies and will work in close coordination with them to provide these items. We'd like to thank all our partners for their continued support in this project."
H.E Mr. SHINDO Yusuke, Charge d’ Affaires ad interim of Japan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan said, “I would like to salute the efforts by the government and people of Pakistan in their fight against COVID-19, which have so far produced commendable results. We do hope that this assistance through UNOPS will help Pakistan deal with the pandemic. I would also like to mention the Government of Japan will continue to support the efforts of the Government of Pakistan to fight against COVID-19 and I hope that people in Pakistan will be able to go back to normal life very soon.”

Each year World Habitat Day focuses attention on the state of the world’s towns and cities. This year’s observance highlights the centrality of housing as a driver for sustainable urban development.
Currently, 1 billion people live in overcrowded settlements with inadequate housing.  By 2030, that number will rise to 1.6 billion.  Action is needed now to provide low-income families and vulnerable populations with affordable housing with security of tenure and easy access to water, sanitation, transport and other basic services.  To meet global demand, more than 96,000 housing units will need to be completed every day – and they must be part of the green transition
The urgency of improving living conditions has been brought to the fore by COVID-19, which has devastated the lives of millions in cities.  Access to clean water and sanitation, along with social distancing, are key responses to the pandemic.  Yet in slums it has proved difficult to implement these measures.  This means an increased risk of infection, not only within slums, but in whole cities, many of which are largely serviced by low-income informal sector workers living in informal settlements.
On World Habitat Day, in this crucial Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, I call for heightened efforts to promote the partnerships, pro-poor policies, and regulations needed to improve housing in cities.  As we strive to overcome the pandemic, address the fragilities and inequalities it has exposed, and combat climate change, now is the time to harness the transformative potential of urbanization for the benefit of people and planet.

In marking the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, this International Day highlights the remarkable power of non-violence and peaceful protest.  It also a timely reminder to strive to uphold values that Gandhi lived by: the promotion of dignity, equal protection for all, and communities living together in peace.
On this year’s observance, we have a special duty: stop the fighting to focus on our common enemy: COVID-19.  There is only one winner of conflict during a pandemic: the virus itself.
As the pandemic took hold, I called for a global ceasefire.
Today we need a new push by the international community to make this a reality by the end of this year.
Cease-fires would ease immense suffering, help to lower the risk of famine, and create space for negotiations towards peace.
Deep mistrust stands in the way.  Yet I see reasons for hope.  In some places, we see a standstill in the violence.
A great many Member States, religious leaders, civil society networks and others back my call.
Now is the time to intensify our efforts.
Let us be inspired by the spirit of Gandhi and the enduring principles of the UN Charter.

The world marks the 30th anniversary of the International Day of Older Persons as we reckon with the disproportionate and severe impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has wrought on older persons around the world – not only on their health, but on their rights and well-being.
Older people must be a priority in our efforts to overcome COVID-19.  In keeping with the theme of this year’s commemoration, we must also examine how the pandemic might change how we address age and ageing in our societies.  Expanding opportunities for older persons and increasing their access to health, pensions and social protection will be crucial.
This year’s observance falls as the world is also marking the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife, which highlights the vital role of health and social workers, such as nurses and midwives, in responding to the pandemic. The majority of them are women, including many older persons. These are the people who devote their lives to our care, and to the care of older persons, mothers and children, and deserve far greater support.
As we seek to recover better together, we must make concerted efforts across the Decade of Healthy Ageing 2020-2030 to improve the lives of older persons, their families and communities.  The potential of older persons is a powerful basis for sustainable development. More than ever, we must listen to their voices, suggestions and ideas to build more inclusive and age-friendly societies.

UNESCO, PCRWR and partners launch reports on UN World Water Development 2020; Groundwater Investigations and Mapping in the Lower Indus Plain
Islamabad, 30 September — UNESCO Islamabad in partnership with Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), and in collaboration with The Asia Foundation, theUnited States Agency for International Development and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) launched two reports; the UN World Water Development Report 2020, and PCRWR’s Groundwater Investigations and Mapping in the Lower Indus Plain. The launch was followed by a stakeholder consultation for the development of the “Groundwater Management Plan” for Pakistan. The consultation aims to help the government of Pakistan with the long-term  management of groundwater resources.
The World Water Development Report 2020 sheds light on the impact of climate change on the availability, quality and quantity of water needed for basic human needs, thus undermining the basic rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for billions of people.  Such a situation will also hinder the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6, that ensures access to safe drinking water and sanitation for all. This presents a considerable challenge as 2.2 billion people currently do not have access to safely managed drinking water, and 4.2 billion, or 55% of the world's population, are without safely managed sanitation.
The report on Groundwater Investigations and Mapping in the Lower Indus Plain provides  information on areas where groundwater is under stress due to water depletion and quality deterioration. The report also identifies areas where usable groundwater is available. This information will help the stakeholders in future groundwater management.
Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, Federal Minister for Science and Technology in his remarks said that the present government has substantially increased the water resources development budget of the country.
Ms. Patricia McPhillips, UNESCO Representative in Pakistan, Dr. Muhammad Ashraf, Chairman, PCRWR, Mr. Muhammad Nawaz, USAID and Mr. Farid Alam, Director Programs, The Asia Foundation spoke on different aspects of water and climate change.

Food loss and waste is an ethical outrage.  In a world with enough food to feed all people, everywhere, 690 million people continue to go hungry and 3 billion cannot afford a healthy diet.
Food loss and waste also squanders natural resources – water, soil and energy, not to mention human labour and time.  It worsens climate change, given the significant role of agriculture in generating greenhouse gas emissions.
International concern is reflected in Sustainable Development Goal 2, which enshrines a commitment to achieving zero hunger, and in SDG 12, which calls on us to halve food waste and reduce food loss by 2030. While many countries are taking action, we need to step up efforts.
The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the fragility of our food systems, and worsened food loss and waste in many countries.  We need new approaches and solutions.
This inaugural observance of the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste comes as we prepare for the 2021 Food Systems Summit.
I urge countries to set a reduction target aligned with SDG 12, measure their food loss and waste and act boldly to reduce it. Policy action in this area should also be included in climate plans under the Paris Agreement.
Many businesses should take a similar approach.  Individuals can shop carefully, store food correctly and make good use of leftovers.
Let us work together to reduce food loss and waste for the benefit of people and our planet.

NEW YORK, 29 September 2020 – “The 30th anniversary of the first ever World Summit for Children is an opportunity to celebrate the huge gains of the past three decades but also a stark reminder of how COVID-19 could turn back the clock.
“The first meeting in the United Nations’ history to focus exclusively on children’s needs was held against a backdrop of increasing global concerns including war and violence, poverty and environmental issues. The more than 70 world leaders who attended pledged to protect children’s lives and well-being through concerted international action, including reducing malnutrition and infant deaths; guaranteeing access to clean water and basic education; eradicating polio; and making prenatal and maternal care available to all.
“Three decades since that landmark meeting, there have been impressive gains for children as more and more are living longer, better and healthier lives. Between 1990 and 2019, the global under-five mortality rate had fallen by about 60 per cent. The global number of out-of-school children of primary school age dropped from 100 million in 2000 to 59 million in 2018. Fewer children are suffering from malnutrition or preventable illness.
“Yet the odds continue to be stacked against the poorest and most vulnerable. In addition to the persistent challenges of health, nutrition and education, hard-won gains to protect and advance children’s rights are being threatened by ongoing issues such as inequality, climate change, raging conflicts and, now more critically, the COVID-19 crisis.
“We know that, in any crisis, the young and the most vulnerable suffer disproportionately. The number of countries experiencing violent conflict is the highest it has been in the last 30 years. The result is that more than 30 million children have been displaced by conflict. Many of them are trafficked, abused and exploited. Many more are
living in limbo, without official immigration status or access to education and health care.
“In addition, due to the current pandemic, the number of children living in multidimensional poverty has soared by 15 per cent to approximately 1.2 billion worldwide. At least 24 million children risk dropping out of school. Thousands of children could die every day if the pandemic continues to weaken health systems and disrupt routine services. Restricted movement and school closures have also cut children off from teachers, friends and communities leaving them at increased risk of violence, abuse and exploitation.
“Unless we act now, we risk not only causing irreversible damage to the social and emotional development, learning and behavior of an entire generation, but reversing the advances made since the World Summit for Children 30 years ago. Now more than ever, countries and communities around the world must work together to address the crises affecting children with stronger commitment to ending conflict and with increased investments in children.
“What the world looks like for children and young people tomorrow is our collective responsibility today.”

Conflict, climate crisis and COVID-19 pose great threats to the health of women and children
New York City, 25 September 2020 – Fragile gains made to advance women and children’s health are threatened by conflict, the climate crisis and COVID-19, according to a new report from Every Woman Every Child.
Protect the Progress: Rise, Refocus, Recover, 2020 highlights that since the Every Woman Every Child movement was launched 10 years ago, spearheaded by the United Nations Secretary-General, there has been remarkable progress in improving the health of the world’s women, children and adolescents. For example, under-five deaths reached an all-time recorded low in 2019, and more than 1 billion children were vaccinated over the past decade. Coverage of immunization, skilled birth attendant and access to safe drinking water reached over 80 per cent. Maternal deaths declined by 35 per cent since 2000, with the most significant declines occurring from 2010. An estimated 25 million child marriages were also prevented over the past decade.
However, conflict, climate instability and the COVID-19 pandemic are putting the health and well-being of all children and adolescents at risk. The COVID-19 crisis, in particular, is exacerbating existing inequities, with reported disruptions in essential health interventions disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable women and children. At the height of pandemic lockdowns, schools were closed in 192 countries, affecting 1.6 billion students. Domestic violence and abuse of girls and women increased. Poverty and hunger are also on the rise.
“Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, a child under the age of five died every six seconds somewhere around the world,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “Millions of children living in conflict zones and fragile settings face even greater hardship with the onset of the pandemic. We need to work collectively to meet immediate needs caused by the pandemic while also strengthening health systems. Only then can we protect and save lives.”
In 2019, 5.2 million children under the age of 5 and 1 million adolescents died of preventable causes. Every 13 seconds a newborn baby died. Every hour 33 women did not survive childbirth; and 33,000 girls a day were forced into marriages, usually to much older men.
The report examines the deep-rooted inequities which continue to deprive women, children and adolescents of their rights – noting birthplace as a significant determinant of survival. In 2019, 82 percent of under-5 deaths and 86 percent of maternal deaths were concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Nine in 10 paediatric HIV infections occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal, newborn, child and adolescent mortality rates were substantially higher in countries chronically affected by conflict.
“For too long, the health and rights of women, children, and adolescents have received insufficient attention and services have been inadequately resourced,” said former Prime Minister of New Zealand and Board Chair of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, Helen Clark. “We call on all partners to work together to support governments to strengthen health systems and tackle the inequities that constrain progress.”
The report calls upon the global community to fight COVID-19 while honoring and respecting commitments that can improve the lives of women and children, and not widen the gap between promise and reality.
“The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to turn back the clock on years of progress in reproductive, maternal, child and adolescent health. This is unacceptable,” said Muhammad Ali Pate, Global Director for Health, Nutrition and Population at the World Bank Group and Director, Global Financing Facility. “The GFF partnership will double down on its efforts to engage with partners and countries and honor the global commitment to ensure that all women, adolescents and children can access the quality, affordable health care they need to survive and thrive.”
The past decade of progress to advance the health of women, children and adolescents must be protected from the impact of the pandemic and the responses to it, the report says.
“Rapid reversal of hard-fought progress in women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health is a real threat,” said Ties Boerma, Director of the Countdown to 2030 for Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health. “As the intensive tracking of the COVID-19 pandemic tells us, timely local data are necessary to be able to target actions and prevent rising inequalities. Global and country investments in local health information systems are much needed to guide the response and protect progress.”
Without intensified efforts to combat preventable child deaths, 48 million children under age 5 could die between 2020 and 2030. Almost half of these deaths will be newborns.
The report advocates for countries to continue investing in the health of all women, children and adolescents, in all crises.
"As we respond to COVID-19 and reimagine a better future, with sustained peace, including at home, we must repeat unequivocally that the rights of women and girls are not negotiable. Even in times of crisis – especially in times of crisis – their sexual and reproductive health and rights must be safeguarded at all costs," said Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director.
The report argues that the Every Woman Every Child movement is more critical than ever as we step into the SDG Decade of Action in the midst of the worst global health crisis of a generation. The momentum of the movement must continue to champion multilaterialism, to mobilize action across all sectors to safeguard the tremendous investments and gains realized by commitments since its launch 10 years ago, and to protect the health and well-being of every woman, child and adolescent, everywhere.
"There is no doubt that the pandemic has set back global efforts to improve the health and well-being of women and children, but that should only serve to strengthen our resolve," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.  “Our joint action under the Every Woman Every Child movement is more important than ever.  We now must renew our commitment to a healthier, safer, fairer and more sustainable world for women, children and future generations.”

Almost 75 years since the adoption of the first General Assembly resolution in 1946 committed the United Nations to the goal of nuclear disarmament, our world continues to live in the shadow of nuclear catastrophe.
Relationships between States possessing nuclear weapons are characterized by division, distrust and an absence of dialogue.  As they increasingly choose to pursue strategic competition over cooperation, the dangers posed by nuclear weapons are becoming more acute.
This International Day highlights the need to reverse course and return to a common path to nuclear disarmament.
The use of nuclear weapons would affect all States, meaning that all States have a responsibility to ensure that such deadly armaments are never used again and are eliminated completely from national arsenals.
COVID-19 has exposed a wide range of global fragilities, from pandemic readiness and inequality to climate change to lawlessness in cyberspace; our preparedness to address the threat of nuclear weapons is one of those vulnerabilities.  We need a strengthened, inclusive and renewed multilateralism built on trust and based on international law that can guide us to our shared goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.
Those States that possess nuclear weapons must lead. They must return to real, good-faith dialogue to restore trust and confidence, reduce nuclear risk and take tangible steps in nuclear disarmament. They should reaffirm the shared understanding that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought. They should take steps to implement the commitments they have undertaken.
The death, suffering and destruction caused by the atomic bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki must not be repeated. The only guarantee against the use of these abhorrent weapons is their total elimination. The United Nations stands ready to work with all States to achieve this shared goal.

In the 40 years since the very first World Tourism Day, much has changed.  Demand for travel has soared.  The world has opened up, allowing more people than ever to explore the globe and its different cultures.
Today, tourism is firmly established in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as an engine for advancing prosperity, protecting our planet and laying the foundations for peace and understanding among peoples.
Many millions of people around the world rely on tourism for income, especially women and young people.  People who might otherwise have been left behind have found decent work and the chance of a better life thanks to tourism’s unique potential.
Tourism has suffered enormously during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Some 120 million jobs are at risk.  The impacts could lead to the loss of between 1.5 and 2.8 per cent of the global GDP.  This will particularly affect the most vulnerable countries, including Small Island Developing States, the Least Developed Countries and many African nations, where tourism can represent between 30 and 80 per cent of exports.
As we look to recover from this profound crisis, the safe restart of tourism is essential, not least for rural development – the focus of this year’s World Tourism Day.  We have an unprecedented opportunity to transform the relationship of the tourism sector with people, nature, the climate and the economy.  We must ensure a fair distribution of its benefits and advance the transition to a carbon-neutral and resilient tourism economy,
As well as providing opportunities for people, tourism can play an important role in preserving our unique and shared cultures and protecting the biodiversity and the ecosystems that sustain us.
In this most challenging year, let us focus on tourism’s importance for people living in rural areas, so we can deliver on the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals to leave nobody behind.

The theme of this year’s World Maritime Day – sustainable shipping for a sustainable planet – has gained extraordinary resonance as shipping has continued to transport more than 80 per cent of world trade, including vital medical supplies, food and other basic goods that are critical for the COVID-19 response and recovery.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the professionalism and sacrifice of the two million seafarers who serve on the world’s merchant fleet.
I remain very concerned about the growing humanitarian and safety crisis facing hundreds of thousands of these indispensable workers.  Despite the unprecedented conditions brought about by the pandemic, seafarers have continued to tirelessly support the often invisible global logistics chain.  Physically and mentally exhausted, away from their families and loved ones, their time at sea has now been extended far beyond the standards stipulated in international conventions, with some tours of duty now stretching more than 17 months.  Fatigued seafarers cannot operate indefinitely, and disruptions to international shipping would have devastating consequences.
I renew my appeal to Governments to address their plight by formally designating seafarers and other marine personnel as “key workers”, ensuring safe crew changes and implementing the protocols developed by UN agencies, as well as the International Chamber of Shipping  and the International Transport Workers’ Federation, allowing stranded seafarers to be repatriated and others to join ships.
In the longer term, a sustainable shipping industry is vital. Shipping will play a central role in achieving most, if not all, of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals.  But shipping activities must be balanced with the long-term health and biodiversity of the oceans. The UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) has developed global standards which support cleaner and greener shipping. Governments and IMO must continue to work together to support the decarbonization of shipping and improved energy efficiency; the facilitation of shipping through increased digitalization, involving ports; and efforts to ensure the sustainability and protection of the workforce, including a focus on diversity.
Shipping can and must continue to make its contribution to the global economy without upsetting nature’s delicate balance. The maritime sector underpins world trade and will continue to be essential for building a sustainable future for people and planet.

Stakeholder Consultation on Developing National Fisheries and Aquaculture Development Policy and Plan of Action for 2020-2030
Islamabad–The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with Fisheries Development Board, Ministry of National Food Security & Research held a stakeholder consultation webinar for developing a national fisheries and aquaculture development policy and plan of action for 2020-2030.
The webinar was attended by participants from Federal Ministries of National Food Security and Research, Maritime Affairs, fisheries departments of all provinces, technical experts from FAO, representatives of fisheries organization and experts from various NGOs and academia.
The “National Policy for Fisheries and Aquaculture in Pakistan” aims for sustainable management and utilization of fisheries and aquaculture resources through creation of a conducive and enabling environment for equitable, economic and social development in the country. The policy will help to achieve the contribution of fisheries and aquaculture to achieve the sustainable development goals. There is a dire need to conduct a holistic sectoral analysis of the fisheries and aquaculture sector in Pakistan to identify the investment gaps and constraints hindering development opportunities in the sector.
Emphasizing on the need of policy formulation, the Country Representative of FAO Pakistan, Ms. Mina Dowlatchahi in her remarks stated that “The existing fisheries legislations need to conform to the international standards for sustainable management and utilization of fisheries resources. Increased investment in the sector can contribute significantly to create income-generating opportunities in fisheries and aquaculture. We need to establish an enabling environment and right policy and legal framework for investors. This will contribute to improving food security, nutrition, and poverty reduction in the country,” she said.
CEO of Fisheries Development Board, Ministry of National Food Security and Research, Dr. Anser Mehmood Chatta stated that “To critically assess the needs of the fisheries and aquaculture sector, this would be the first ever policy formulation in line to the government policy of economic growth. The Government of Pakistan requested FAO for technical support which was granted through a Technical Cooperation Program by FAO. Fisheries and aquaculture sector provide employment to 1.8 households in the country. The current government has approved three mega projects to promote the sector. We need feedback and consensus by the stakeholders on the policy formulation so that the policy is finalized and presented to the government,” he said.
Technical experts from FAO delivered detailed presentation on the outline draft of the national policy for fisheries and aquaculture. The final policy will be presented to the government after a second consultation with the fisheries and aquaculture stakeholders.

Toolkit on understanding and addressing sexual harassment at workplace launched in Punjab
LAHORE: The Provincial Office of the Ombudsperson for Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace, in collaboration with UN Women Pakistan, today launched a resource toolkit on ‘Understanding Sexual Harassment, Legal Provisions, Roles of Duty Bearers and Right Holders’ to offer comprehensive guidance to train and capacitate stakeholders on the law and redressal mechanisms for dispensation of justice to victims of sexual harassment at workplace in the Punjab province.
The adverse and lasting consequences of harassment are not limited to women and their families, but they also negatively affect communities and national progress. UN Women and Ombudsperson Office Punjab have prioritized the area of protection against harassment of women at workplace to ensure women and girls can access opportunities to advance their careers in a safe and secure working environment. Ombudsperson for Protection against Harassment, Punjab in partnership with UN women Pakistan, is working to implement the legislation through strengthening existing mechanisms, raising awareness, developing knowledge products and enhancing the capacity of public and private actors for the effective implementation and monitoring of the law for ending harassment at the workplace.
Addressing the launch, Minister for Women Development Punjab, who was the chief guest of the event, Ashifa Riaz Fatyana said, “A safe and enabling environment for women is a must for a society to prosper socially and economically. Sexual harassment of women at workplace is a heinous crime and we all should come forward to play our due role in discouraging this from of violence anywhere in our country. When we don’t speak up against incidents of violence against women and girls, such evil acts become normalized. Creating awareness and sensitizing masses especially men that women are equal beings and have a right to live their lives free from violence, harassment and discrimination is critical for making our province, country and this world a better place for all. This event is of utmost importance as the toolkit launched today will lead to advancing consolidated efforts against harassment in the province.”
The Minister lamented that while we have women police stations, but they don't have mandate to file a FIR (First Information Report). “In fact, many women police officials, serving in traditional police stations, themselves face harassment within their stations,” she remarked while stressing the need for safe spaces for women.
Sharmeela Rassool, Country Representative UN Women Pakistan, stressed that it was a high time to step forward for protection of women and girls and move ahead on a legislative path for ending sexual harassment against them. Quoting some alarming figures of incidence of harassment in the developed world as well as many South Asian countries, she observed that sexual harassment was a dilemma which was not only affecting Pakistan, but it was prevalent everywhere in the world. “So, we require collective actions from all fronts and I'm glad that Women Development Department Punjab and Ombudsperson Office are prioritizing this issue even during the pandemic situation.” Pakistan is ahead of many South Asian countries in terms of having specific legislation against sexual harassment at workplace.
Underpinning that sexual harassment has negative consequences for women and girls in terms of career barrier, declined costs productivity and restricted movement and growth options, Sharmeela said that addressing harassment will have a direct impact on advancing our journey towards achieving Sustainable Development goals (SDGs), especially SDG 8, decent work; and SDG 5, gender equality. “If you want to stay in economic growth trajectory, female participation in labor force is a must,” she said while reiterating that UN Women was committed to continue working with government and other stakeholders for ending harassment and violence against women and girls in Pakistan.
Other distinguished speakers and participants at the event included Members of Provincial Assembly (MPAs) Raheela Khadim Hussain and Musarrat Cheema; Ambreen Raza, Secretary Women Development Department, Government of Punjab; Irum Bukhari, Secretary Higher Education; Justice Retd. Nasira Iqbal, senior legal expert; Usman Ijaz Bajwa, Assistant Inspector General (AIG) Punjab Police and Head of Provincial Gender Crimes Cell. Nabila Malick, EVAW and Governance Advisor, UN Women Pakistan, gave a presentation on key highlights of the toolkit and Saman Ahsan, Portfolio Manager EVAW, Governance and Human Rights, UN Women Pakistan, informed participants on the process followed to develop the toolkit. The event was attended by representatives from the government, civil society, academia and media.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF SIGN LANGUAGES
23 September 2020
On the International Day of Sign Languages this year, we find ourselves in the midst of a pandemic that has disrupted and upended lives everywhere, including the lives of the deaf community.
It has been encouraging to see some countries providing public health announcements and information on COVID-19 with national sign language interpretation. In my dedicated policy brief on a disability-inclusive response to the pandemic, I called for COVID-19 response and recovery measures to be accessible to all.
The United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy, launched last year, aims to strengthen our efforts to ensure the meaningful participation and full inclusion of people with disabilities in all that we do, including in times of crisis. That is the only way to fulfil the central promise of the 2030 Agenda – to leave no one behind.
On this International Day of Sign Languages, I call on all local, national and global leaders to protect and promote the diversity of sign languages and cultures, so that every Deaf person can participate in and contribute to society and reach their full potential.

Inauguration of 3rd Air Control Unit (ACCU) at Islamabad International Airport
UNODC-WCO Container Control Programme
Islamabad – 23 September 2020: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Country Office Pakistan – the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the UNODC Container Control Program (CCP), in partnership with national counterparts Anti-Narcotics Force, Civil Aviation Authorities, and Pakistan Customs inaugurated its 3rd Air Cargo Control Unit (ACCU) at Islamabad Airport today. The Unit is tasked to profile inbound and outbound air consignments and identify and stop those that may carry illicit substances.
Smugglers have long been using legitimate cargo to cover their illegal shipments. The high volume of global trade consignment movements makes it particularly hard for Customs and law enforcement officers to spot illicit loads tactfully concealed in an apparently legitimate consignment. To address this challenge, UNODC and World Customs Organization (WCO) developed the Container Control Programme concept and methodology which invests on human resource development and training profiling experts. The aim of the Programme is to bring the best of counterpart agencies together and streamline the focus of the Unit on risk analysis, joint profiling and targeting in an inter-agency setup.
The UNODC-WCO Container Control Programme was initiated in 2004 and Pakistan was among the first countries to join the initiative, with the first unit being established in Karachi seaport. With promising results of the Karachi Port Control Unit, Pakistan volunteered to be the host of the very first CCP Air Cargo Control Unit at Karachi International Airport. Thanks to contributions by the Government of Denmark, Karachi ACCU was established in 2016. Lahore ACCU followed in 2018 with Japan and United States of America being its major donors.
The inauguration of Islamabad ACCU marks the 3rd operational Air Cargo Control Unit in Pakistan after Karachi and Lahore, expanding the initiative to all three major airports of the country. The investments by both Pakistan, international donors, UNODC and WCO in setting up ACCUs started to payoff and show excellent results. In 2019, the Units in Pakistan stopped 40 attempts of narcotics trafficking resulting in seizures of total 128 kg Heroin, 25 kg Cocaine, 303 kg Ketamine and 9 kg Methamphetamines. Most frequent destination of these seizures were United Kingdoms (19 cases), Canada (5 cases) and Malaysia (3 cases).
“The success of the Container Control Programme in Pakistan is a result of the great commitment from national counterparts” said Mr. Jeremy Milsom, UNODC Representative for the Country Office in Pakistan during his opening remarks. “This is a great example where the joint initiative of UNODC and WCO flourishes through national counterparts’ reception, collaboration and appreciation” Mr. Milsom continued.
The event was also a venue to pay a sincere gratitude to the Governments of Japan and the United States of America, the major donors to the establishment of Islamabad ACCU.
H.E Mr. SHINDO Yusuke, Charge d’ Affaires ad interim of Japan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in his speech mentioned, “strengthening aviation security to prevent trafficking of illegal items is one of the major challenges not only for Pakistan but other countries as well. Here, I would also like to mention that stability and peace is one of the important pillars of the foreign policy of Japan. The Government of Japan continues to contribute to the stability based on laws and regulations in various countries.”
Other major donors of the Global Container Control Programme include Australia, Canada, Denmark, European Union, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, and United Kingdoms.

WDD, UN Women launch Punjab Women Development Policy Implementation Framework to support gender mainstreaming in govt departments
LAHORE: Women Development Department (WDD) Punjab and UN Women Pakistan launched Punjab Women Development Policy (PWDP) 2018 Implementation Framework on Thursday with an objective to integrate gender focused activities in the workplans of all government departments and institutions to ensure gender mainstreaming in provincial planning.
The provincial government developed the PWDP 2018 to systematically eradicate all manifestations of explicit and implicit gender discrimination across all spheres of society and address the whole range of women development concerns and challenges in line with the spirit of the Constitution, Pakistan’s international commitments and priorities of the provincial government to pursue the goal of gender mainstreaming and women empowerment in Punjab. The policy has seven key sectoral strategies, namely Women Political Empowerment and Rights Based Governance; Women and Education/Skills Development, Women and Health; Women Poverty Reduction and Economic Empowerment; Gender Based Violence; Women and Climate Change and last but not the least Women and ICT.
The Implementation framework provides a set of activities, their monitoring and evaluation plan keeping within these strategic areas. The framework was finalized after a long process of individual and group consultations and validation workshops, repeatedly engaging with all 36 departments.
Minister Women Development Ashifa Riaz Fatyana, in her keynote address expressed her optimism that the framework will play a key role in changing realities in women’s favour in the province. She further added that poor implementation is often the cause for lack of success of any policy. This document spells out roles and responsibilities and provides one platform to all departments in Punjab for measuring success and chalking a way forward.
Ambreen Raza, Secretary WDD, said, “This framework will bring us closer to our vision of a gender-sensitive Punjab, where women and men enjoy equity and equality in all walks of life; women and girls are able to fulfil their roles towards achieving and enjoying individual and collective well-being, development and prosperity without any explicit or implicit discrimination.”
Sidra Minhas, Consultant UN Women, presented highlights of the framework identifying gender disaggregated data collection, capacity building and awareness as key activities for all relevant departments.
Jacqui Ketunuti, Deputy Country Representative UN Women Pakistan, in her opening remarks, said, “It is a matter of great pride for us that, with the strong and capable leadership of the WDD, 36 provincial departments came together and endorsed the integration of activities in their workplans to ensure that Punjab can make progress on gender equality in the thematic areas of political empowerment, education, health, economic empowerment, gender-based violence, climate change and ICT. This is the first and largest such initiative for gender mainstreaming in the province.”
Saman Ahsan, Portfolio Manager EVAW, Governance & Human Rights UN Women Pakistan, said, “UN Women and Women Development Department form a natural alliance as we both work on same agenda of women empowerment and gender equality. The framework is one commendable result that came out of this collaboration. We will continue to work together for our mutual goals and objective.”

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
VIDEO MESSAGE FOR EVENT
“BUILDING BACK A BETTER FUTURE OF WORK BY ENSURING PAY EQUITY: A GLOBAL CALL TO ACTION”
18 Sept 2020
Around the world, despite decades of activism, and dozens of laws on equal pay, women still earn less than 80 cents for every dollar men do. For women with children, women of colour, women refugees and migrants, and women with disabilities, that figure is even lower.
If you had told me this forty years ago, I would have been shocked. But according to the World Economic Forum, it will take 257 years to close this gap.
The early signs are that the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will make the gender pay gap even wider – partly because so many women work in service industries, hospitality and the informal sector which have been hardest hit.
Women’s unequal status at work feeds inequality in other areas of their lives. Women’s jobs are less likely to come with benefits like health insurance and paid time off. Even when women are entitled to a pension, lower salaries mean lower payments in their old age.
Equal pay laws have failed to put this right. We need to go deeper and work harder to find solutions.
Raising the profile of the gender pay gap is an important step. So I welcome this first International Equal Pay Day, and I congratulate everyone who has made it happen.
We need to ask why women are relegated to lower-paid work; why professions that are female-dominated have lower salaries – including jobs in the care sector; why so many women work part-time; why women see their wages decrease with motherhood while men with children often enjoy a salary boost; and why women hit a ceiling in higher-earning professions.
Some of the solutions lie in ending harmful gender stereotypes; removing institutional barriers; and sharing family responsibilities equally. We need to recognize, redistribute, and value the unpaid care work that is disproportionately done by women.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exploited and exposed inequalities of all kinds, including gender inequality. As we invest in recovery, we must take the opportunity to end pay discrimination against women.
Equal pay is essential not only for women, but to build a world of dignity and justice for all.

150 million additional children plunged into poverty due to COVID-19, UNICEF, Save the Children say
New analysis reveals the number of children living in multidimensional poverty – without access to education, health, housing, nutrition, sanitation, or water – has increased by 15 per cent since the start of the pandemic
NEW YORK/LONDON, 17 September 2020 – The number of children living in multidimensional poverty has soared to approximately 1.2 billion due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new UNICEF and Save the Children analysis published today. This is a 15 per cent increase in the number of children living in deprivation in low- and middle-income countries, or an additional 150 million children since the pandemic hit earlier this year.
The multidimensional poverty analysis uses data on access to education, healthcare, housing, nutrition, sanitation and water from more than 70 countries. It highlights that around 45 per cent of children were severely deprived of at least one of these critical needs in the countries analyzed before the pandemic.
Although the analysis paints a dire picture already, UNICEF warns the situation will likely worsen in the months to come. Save the Children and UNICEF are committed to continue to monitor this evolving situation and work with governments and civil society to confront it.
“COVID-19 and the lockdown measures imposed to prevent its spread have pushed millions of children deeper into poverty,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “Families on the cusp of escaping poverty have been pulled back in, while others are experiencing levels of deprivation they have never seen before. Most concerningly, we are closer to the beginning of this crisis than its end.”
The report notes that child poverty is much more than a monetary value. Although measures of monetary poverty such as household income are important, they provide only a partial view of the plight of children living in poverty. To understand the full extent of child poverty, all potential deprivations must be analysed directly. This also points to the need to implement multi-sectoral policies addressing health, education, nutrition, water and sanitation and housing deprivations to end multidimensional poverty.
Social protection, inclusive fiscal policies, investments in social services, and employment and labor market interventions to support families are critical to lifting children out of poverty and preventing further devastation. This includes expanding access to quality health care and providing the tools and technology needed for children to continue their education remotely; and investing in family-friendly policies such as paid leave and child care.
“This pandemic has already caused the biggest global education emergency in history, and the increase in poverty will make it very hard for the most vulnerable children and their families to make up for the loss”, said Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children. “Children who lose out on education are more likely to be forced into child labour or early marriage and be trapped in a cycle of poverty for years to come. We cannot afford to let a whole generation of children become victims of this pandemic. National governments and the international community must step up to soften the blow.”
There are not only more children experiencing poverty than before, the poorest children are getting poorer as well, the report notes. Some children may suffer one or more deprivations and others experience none at all, therefore the average number of deprivations suffered per child can be used to assess how poor children are. Before the pandemic, the average number of severe deprivations per child was around 0.7. It is now estimated to have increased by 15 per cent to around 0.85.
“We must act now to prevent additional children from being deprived in basic life needs like school, medicine, food, water and shelter,” said Fore. “Governments must prioritize the most marginalized children and their families through rapid expansion of social protection systems including cash transfers and child benefits, remote learning opportunities, healthcare services and school feeding. Making these critical investments now can help countries to prepare for future shocks.”

###
Notes to editors:
To reach the number of deprivations children are experiencing before the pandemic and today, UNICEF and Save the Children looked at how many children were deprived of each indicator of multidimensional poverty and compared it with the child population in the countries analyzed.

WDD, PCSW and UN Women launch Gap Analysis Report to identify and address legislative gaps for ending violence against women in Punjab
LAHORE: Women Development Department (WDD) Punjab, the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW) and UN Women Pakistan launched a seminal report on ‘Gap Analysis of Legislation related to Ending Violence Against Women (EVAW) in Punjab’ on Tuesday. The aim of this report is to review the existing provincial legal framework in the light of national and international obligations of Pakistan and provide a detailed analysis of the normative, implementation, monitoring and information gaps and propose forward looking recommendations.
The Gap Analysis Report has been designed and commissioned by UN Women Pakistan in partnership with WDD with the financial support of UK Aid. The virtual launch was chaired by the Provincial Minister for Women Development, Ashifa Riaz Fatiyana, Secretary WDD Ambreen Raza, government officials, representatives of civil society organizations, media, academia, and legal community.
Minister Ashifa Riaz Fatiyana, in her remarks, said, “While we have many laws, the implementation of laws is critical to support women and girls in the province. The Motorway rape incident could have been avoided if there had been effective implementation of women protection laws and speedy dispensation of justice in such cases. I believe that the Police should be engaged through advocacy efforts as their sensitization and capacity building is key to addressing such issues. All of us must continue to strive to introduce new and continue existing better initiatives for women in the province.”
Ambreen Raza, Secretary WDD, said, “This Gap Analysis Report of Laws relating to Ending Violence Against Women is our joint venture with UN Women which will create a better understanding of the legislative framework to support the enactment and effective implementation of inclusive legislation in Punjab.”
She informed that seven normative, and eleven implementation laws in Punjab, and twelve normative, and seven implementation laws at the federal level that are applicable in Punjab have been reviewed and analyzed under this process. She termed the launch as a landmark achievement, saying that it would lead to further advocacy efforts for legislative amendments.
Jacqui Ketunuti, Deputy Country Representative UN Women Pakistan, in her opening remarks said, “An important aspect of our work in Pakistan and globally is to focus on the alignment of national laws and policies with international commitments, particularly the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Beijing Platform of Action and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our strong partnership with WDD and PCSW has resulted in the launch of this EVAW Laws Gap Analysis Report today. UN Women is committed to continue this work with government and other partners for developing and implementing long-term legislative initiatives for gender equality and women’s empowerment so that we can create an environment where girls and women can be free from all forms of violence.”
Saman Ahsan, Portfolio Manager EVAW, Governance & Human Rights UN Women Pakistan, said, “WDD is our longstanding partner and we are pleased to work together on CEDAW-compliant legislation to promote gender equality in the province. Punjab has developed many laws that are pro-women. To address the issue of violence against women and support and promote women’s empowerment, laws need to be very strong and their proper implementation ensured. This report will help in advancing the legislative reform agenda of the province.”
Khadija Ali, the key author and researcher, gave a presentation on gap analysis report.

As the world confronts COVID-19, democracy is crucial in ensuring the free flow of information, participation in decision-making and accountability for the response to the pandemic.  Yet since the beginning of the crisis, we have seen the emergency used in a range of countries to restrict democratic processes and civic space. This is especially dangerous in places where democracy’s roots are shallow and institutional checks and balances are weak.
The crisis is also highlighting – and aggravating – long-neglected injustices, from inadequate health systems to social protection gaps, digital divides and unequal access to education; from environmental degradation to racial discrimination and violence against women. Along with the profound human toll, these inequalities are themselves threats to democracy.
Well before the pandemic, frustration was rising, and trust in public authorities was declining. A lack of opportunities was driving economic unease and social unrest.  Today, it is clear that Governments must do more to listen to people demanding change, open new channels for dialogue and respect freedom of peaceful assembly.
On this International Day of Democracy, let us seize this pivotal moment to build a more equal, inclusive and sustainable world, with full respect for human rights.

EU humanitarian aid mobilizes €5M for basic health service provision during COVID-19
ISLAMABAD, 14 September 2020: The European Union has mobilized €5M for UNICEF to ensure availability of basic health care services for women and children in Sindh and Balochistan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This support will be provided through the EU’s Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid (ECHO) department and reach over 1.25 million individuals in three districts in Sindh (Karachi East, Larkand) and Balochistan (Jafarabad).
The EU is working to strengthen Pakistan’s primary healthcare system and improve resilience to emergencies and disasters. The EU’s support will allow continuation of life-saving basic services and infection prevention and control measures – including increased access to water and sanitation – to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19.
In addition, frontline health workers will receive PPE’s to continue carrying out their duties. There will also be greater efforts for community mobilization & awareness, and to increase access to safe severe acute malnutrition treatment for young children in Sindh and Balochistan during the pandemic.
Healthcare providers and frontline workers will also be trained to set up telemedicine services to increase coverage and access, and frontline workers will also receive the critical psychosocial support they require during this challenging time.
Ambassador of the European Union to Pakistan, Androulla Kaminara said,
“Mothers and newborns are at particular risk during the pandemic. Their well-being is of paramount importance. Our support will help ensure that they continue to receive basic health services – including immunizations and nutrition treatments – in a safe environment. The EU will continue to work closely with its partners to support Pakistan’s healthcare system during this difficult time.”
This contribution to UNICEF is part of the European Union’s dedicated €150 million package for the short- and medium-term response to the COVID-19 crisis in Pakistan. This support is being extended through our development work, humanitarian aid and working with civil society organizations.
UNICEF Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Aida Girma said,
“In response to COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF is working closely with the Government of Pakistan, leading the Risk Communication and Community Engagement besides assisting the country in continuation of essential services including immunization, education, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, and procurement of Personal Protective Equipment for frontline health workers.”
“We are grateful to EU and ECHO for their generous contribution to this humanitarian cause. It will not only provide an impetus to our efforts but will also help Pakistan to counter the socio-economic impact of the pandemic, with a specific focus on the most vulnerable women and children.”

The COVID-19 pandemic is devastating lives and livelihoods around the world. It poses the greatest risks to developing countries and to vulnerable people and communities.
As we mark this year’s United Nations Day for South-South Cooperation, we are highlighting the power of the Global South to support and advance sustainable development, even during these challenging times.
Southern countries are demonstrating the spirit of South-South cooperation, equal partnership and global solidarity during the pandemic, by collaborating in science, technology and innovation, delivering medical supplies, providing financial resources, sending health workers and experts to bridge gaps in capacity, and sharing best practices.
South-South and triangular cooperation must also have a central place in our preparations for a strong recovery. They can never replace official development assistance, or the responsibilities of the global North set out in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Paris Agreement. But we will need the full contributions and cooperation of the Global South to build more resilient economies and societies, and implement the Sustainable Development Goals.
The United Nations is playing its part in supporting South-South and triangular cooperation through the pandemic, by fast-tracking financial allocations for developing countries as they cooperate with each other and with development banks and agencies.
As we look beyond the immediate crisis, the United Nations will continue to stand with the Global South.
Let us coordinate our efforts to scale up Southern development successes, share them widely through enhanced cooperation, build a strong recovery and achieve the SDGs by 2030.
Thank you.

UNHCR steps up efforts to support flood-affected refugees and Pakistani communities
ISLAMABAD, 11 September 2020: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has stepped up efforts to support hundreds of Afghan refugee and Pakistani families affected by severe rainfall and flooding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh provinces.
According to government’s estimates, more than 190 people were killed, and thousands of homes were washed away in flooding across the country.
The UN Refugee Agency is working with local authorities and partners to assist the most vulnerable families – badly affected by the flooding. Core relief items are being distributed to the affected Afghan refugees and Pakistani communities.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, UNHCR, Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees, (CAR) and refugee elders conducted a joint assessment. Emergency supplies such as tents, blankets, tarpaulins and kitchen sets are being provided to the most vulnerable Afghan refugee families in nine districts of the province.
UNHCR has already handed over 2,000 blankets, 2,000 sleeping mates, 1,000 jerrycans and 1000 plastic sheets to the National Disaster Management Authority for onward distribution to Pakistani communities in Karachi and other parts of the Sindh province.
“These emergency supplies will enable the vulnerable Afghan refugees and Pakistani communities to meet their immediate needs,” said Ms. Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR Representative in Pakistan.
Ms. Yoshida said that Pakistan has witnessed multiple challenges this year such as severe rainfall, flooding as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our support and efforts are in solidarity with Pakistan and its people who have been hosting Afghan refugees for more than 40 years,” she said.
“In the same spirit, we also helped millions of Pakistanis during different emergencies in Pakistan in the past,” she added.

WHO - REPORT : The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on noncommunicable disease resources and services: results of a rapid assessment
On the opening day of the Virtual Fast-Track Cities 2020 conference on urban HIV and COVID-19 responses, UNAIDS has released a new report on how to strengthen responses to health emergencies
GENEVA, 9 September 2020—A new report from UNAIDS shows how countries grappling with COVID-19 are using the experience and infrastructure from the AIDS response to ensure a more robust response to both pandemics. COVID-19 and HIV: 1 moment, 2 epidemics, 3 opportunities—how to seize the moment to learn, leverage and build a new way forward for everyone’s health and rights shows that by identifying the dynamic changes needed, systems can be found that are effective, inclusive, equitable and sufficiently resourced.
“Given the epic dimensions of the emergency, the world needs unity and solidarity,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. “Our decades-long fight against HIV offers essential lessons. By heeding those lessons and working together, we can ensure that national health responses deliver on the promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the health and well-being of all.”
The three opportunities highlighted in the report are: (1) that key lessons learned from the HIV response should inform COVID-19 responses; (2) how the HIV infrastructure is already driving COVID-19 responses and has the potential to catalyse accelerated progress; and (3) how the COVID-19 and HIV responses offer a historic opportunity to build a bridge to adaptable, results-driven systems for health that work for people.
“This is a unique opportunity to reimagine systems for health,” said Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “All eyes are on health, health systems and health care, with countries wanting to be better equipped to deal not only with COVID-19 but also to create healthier, more resilient societies. We can seize this opportunity by learning from HIV and from COVID-19 to make important changes to develop rights-based, equitable, people-centred systems for health.”
The report highlights how the HIV response can help to jump-start an accelerated response to COVID-19 in ways that can help to ensure that such efforts do not come at the expense of the HIV response or other essential health priorities. At the same time that the world undertakes focused efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, it must also redouble efforts to limit any interruption and promote rapid recovery of HIV-related services, including ensuring uninterrupted supplies of essential commodities and technologies for HIV and other global health priorities.
“COVID-19 has caused significant loss of life in many communities, but notably in those where inequities make people more vulnerable to ill health. Leveraging of the HIV infrastructure and workforce has helped to mitigate what might have been a far worse situation,” said José M. Zuniga, President/Chief Executive Officer of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care and co-organizer of the Virtual Fast-Track Cities 2020 event with UNAIDS. “However, with current HIV spending substantially off-track, the world urgently needs to increase investments in the responses to both HIV and COVID-19 and not siphon off one to respond to the other.”
The extensive, dynamic and agile infrastructure that has been built up around the HIV response is being leveraged in many ways to assist the response to COVID-19 and includes innovative, community-led service delivery. For example, 280 000 new health-care workers trained by the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief are currently assisting as first responders to COVID-19 in many low- and middle-income countries. In addition, 17 HIV treatment reference centres in Morocco are now functioning as the first line for COVID-19 treatment services. The HIV nongovernmental organization Housing Works in New York City opened two shelters specifically for homeless people who have tested positive for COVID-19.
The report highlights that although different in many respects, COVID-19 and HIV share important characteristics and that by incorporating key lessons learned from HIV, the response to COVID-19 can avoid many errors. One essential element is the buy-in and leadership of communities. Community activism has sped up the delivery of life-saving HIV medicines, community surveillance has alerted officials to dangerous medicine stock-outs and communities have delivered essential door-to-door HIV testing and treatment services and are leading efforts to strike down punitive laws that drive populations such as gay men and other men who have sex with men, sex workers and people who use drugs away from critical health services.
The report also shows the importance of firmly grounding health responses in human rights and the need for gender-transformative responses. Other actions include strengthening strategic information systems capable of delivering timely, accurate data on the pandemic to identify new outbreaks and global coordination, sustained political will and a multisectoral response.
“The emergence of COVID-19 has exposed the underlying weaknesses in health systems, which have proved to be under-resourced, unprepared and unsustainable,” said Ms Byanyima. “UNAIDS is urging that systems for health be reimagined to ensure that they are inclusive, just and equitable.”
Systems for health in the future must be prepared to address any new major health crisis by being agile, results-driven, inclusive and people-centred. COVID-19 and the response to HIV should be used as an opportunity to reimagine systems for health that work for people, maximize efficiency and effectiveness, attract sufficient resources and engage communities as essential partners for health.
The Virtual Fast-Track Cities 2020 conference is taking place on 9 and 10 September, bringing together around 1500 representatives of more than 300 cities and municipalities around the world to discuss urban responses to COVID-19 and HIV. Anthony Fauci, Director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will give the keynote speech and UNAIDS will be presenting on the importance of the continuity of HIV services during COVID-19 and discussing mitigation strategies to protect gains made in the response to HIV.
UNAIDS
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) leads and inspires the world to achieve its shared vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths. UNAIDS unites the efforts of 11 UN organizations—UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, UNDP, UNFPA, UNODC, UN Women, ILO, UNESCO, WHO and the World Bank—and works closely with global and national partners towards ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.

COVID-19 could reverse decades of progress toward eliminating preventable child deaths, agencies warn
With the number of under-five deaths at an all-time recorded low of 5.2 million in 2019, disruptions in child and maternal health services due to the COVID-19 pandemic are putting millions of additional lives at stake
NEW YORK/ GENEVA, 9 September 2020– The number of global under-five deaths dropped to its lowest point on record in 2019 – down to 5.2 million from 12.5 million in 1990, according to new mortality estimates released by UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the World Bank Group.
Since then, however, surveys by UNICEF and WHO reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to health services that threaten to undo decades of hard-won progress.
“The global community has come too far towards eliminating preventable child deaths to allow the COVID-19 pandemic to stop us in our tracks,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “When children are denied access to health services because the system is overrun, and when women are afraid to give birth at the hospital for fear of infection, they, too, may become casualties of COVID-19. Without urgent investments to re-start disrupted health systems and services, millions of children under five, especially newborns, could die.”
Over the past 30 years, health services to prevent or treat causes of child death such as preterm, low birthweight, complications during birth, neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria, as well as vaccination, have played a large role in saving millions of lives.
Now countries worldwide are experiencing disruptions in child and maternal health services, such as health checkups, vaccinations and prenatal and post-natal care, due to resource constraints and a general uneasiness with using health services due to a fear of getting COVID-19.
A UNICEF survey conducted over the summer across 77 countries found that almost 68 per cent of countries reported at least some disruption in health checks for children and immunization services. In addition, 63 per cent of countries reported disruptions in antenatal checkups and 59 per cent in post-natal care.
A recent WHO survey based on responses from 105 countries revealed that 52 per cent of countries reported disruptions in health services for sick children and 51 per cent in services for management of malnutrition.
Health interventions such as these are critical for stopping preventable newborn and child deaths. For example, women who receive care by professional midwives trained according  to internationals standards are 16 per cent less likely to lose their baby and 24 per cent less likely to experience pre-term birth, according to WHO.
"The fact that today more children live to see their first birthday than any time in history is a true mark of what can be achieved when the world puts health and well-being at the centre of our response,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Now, we must not let the COVID-19 pandemic turn back remarkable progress for our children and future generations. Rather, it’s time to use what we know works to save lives, and keep investing in stronger, resilient health systems.”
Based on the responses from countries that participated in the UNICEF and WHO surveys, the most commonly cited reasons for health service disruptions included parents avoiding health centers for fear of infection; transport restrictions; suspension or closure of services and facilities; fewer healthcare workers due to diversions or fear of infection due to shortages in personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves; and greater financial difficulties. Afghanistan, Bolivia, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Libya, Madagascar, Pakistan, Sudan and Yemen are among the hardest hit countries.
Seven of the nine countries had high child mortality rates of more than 50 deaths per 1000 live births among children under five in 2019. In Afghanistan, where 1 in 17 children died before reaching age 5 in 2019, the Ministry of Health reported a significant reduction in visits to health facilities. Out of fear of contracting the COVID-19 virus, families are de-prioritizing pre- and post-natal care, adding to the risk faced by pregnant women and newborn babies.

Even before COVID-19, newborns were at highest risk of death. In 2019, a newborn baby died every 13 seconds. Moreover, 47 per cent of all under-five deaths occurred in the neonatal period, up from 40 per cent in 1990. With severe disruptions in essential health services, newborn babies could be at much higher risk of dying. For example, in Cameroon, where 1 out of every 38 newborns died in 2019, the UNICEF survey reported an estimated 75 per cent disruptions in services for essential newborn care, antenatal check-ups, obstetric care and post-natal care.
In May, initial modelling by Johns Hopkins University showed that almost 6,000 additional children could die per day due to disruptions due to COVID-19.
These reports and surveys highlight the need for urgent action to restore and improve childbirth services and antenatal and postnatal care for mothers and babies, including having skilled health workers to care for them at birth. Working with parents to assuage their fears and reassure them is also important.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has put years of global progress to end preventable child deaths in serious jeopardy,” said Muhammad Ali Pate, Global Director for Health, Nutrition and Population at the World Bank. “It is essential to protect life-saving services which have been key to reducing child mortality. We will continue to work with governments and partners to reinforce healthcare systems to ensure mothers and children get the services they need.”
"The new report demonstrates the ongoing progress worldwide in reducing child mortality,” said John Wilmoth, Director of the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. “While the report highlights the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on interventions that are critical for children’s health, it also draws attention to the need to redress the vast inequities in a child's prospects for survival and good health.”

Analyzing Government Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
Islamabad: A virtual public private dialogue was held today to analyze the regulatory and institutional response by the federal and provincial governments of Sindh and Balochistan during Covid-19, and to help augment emergency response to revive the rural economy in the two provinces.
Growth for Rural Advancement and Sustainable Progress project (GRASP), funded by the European Union and implemented by the International Trade Centre (ITC), organized the webinar with Sustainable Development Policy Institute to share findings of The research on regulatory and institutional response of Sindh and Balochistan during Covid-19, with key stakeholders and policy makers.
The event brought together key influencers and policy makers, who participated in a meaningful debate on the institutional, regulatory, and government response in the wake of pandemic, and how the rural economy could be assisted to recover from its adverse effects.
Speaking at the event, Ovidiu Mic, Head of the EU’s Development Cooperation in Pakistan said,“Research and discussions such as these are at the heart of GRASP in order to come up with more inclusive solutions to policy issues. Countering an unprecedented situation, such as COVID-19, requires public and private stakeholders to work together to align development efforts and emergency response strategies to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the pandemic. There is a particular need to support SME’s which are critical for economic growth – particularly in these challenging times.”
Dr. Vaqar Ahmed, Executive Director SDPI, presented the findings of the study to the participants, where he stated that through better utilization of budgets already allocated for Covid-19 response, targeting micro and small farms in both formal and informal sector, and inclusion of informal agri-businesses in social protection databases, targeted and effective interventions could be implemented during future Covid-19 rounds.
Robert Skidmore, Chief of Sector and Enterprise Development at the International Trade Centre in Geneva said, ‘’Increasing connectivity, improving primary data collection in rural areas, fine-tuning communication and coordination between all stakeholders in the field and  addressing the differential impacts on women were some of the areas that both the public and private sectors can focus on together”.
GRASP has been adapted in response to the pandemic, and a Covid-19 emergency response work plan is being implemented. Through impact surveys, awareness campaigns, and policy dialogues the project has been working to improve MSME’s in Sindh and Balochistan. GRASP Coordinator Azher Ali Choudry thanked the government officials and private sector representatives for their inputs, and concluded the event by stating, “Financing needs of the agriculture sector need to be assessed and expedited, and GRASP will continue its work to uplift small and medium enterprise in Sindh and Balochistan through work on the ground, and policy recommendations.

Around the world, nine out of every ten people breathe unclean air.
Air pollution contributes to heart disease, strokes, lung cancer and other respiratory diseases.
It causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths every year, predominantly in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution also threatens the economy, food security and the environment.
As we recover from the coronavirus pandemic, the world needs to pay far greater attention to air pollution, which also increases the risks associated with COVID-19.
We must also urgently address the deeper threat of climate change.
Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees will help reduce air pollution, death and disease.
This year’s lockdowns have caused emissions to fall dramatically, providing a glimpse of cleaner air in many cities.
But emissions are already rising again, in some places surpassing pre-COVID levels.
We need dramatic and systemic change.
Reinforced environmental standards, policies and laws that prevent emissions of air pollutants are needed more than ever.
Countries also need to end subsidies for fossil fuels.
And, at the international level, countries need to cooperate to help each other transition to clean technologies.
I call on governments still providing finance for fossil fuel-related projects in developing countries to shift that support towards clean energy and sustainable transport.
And I urge all countries to use post-COVID recovery packages to support the transition to healthy and sustainable jobs.
Today, 7 September, marks the first International Day of Clean Air for blue skies.
Let us work together to build a better future with clean air for all.

FAO Regional Conference calls for greater action to tackle COVID-19’s impacts across Asia and the Pacific
Ministerial Session highlights the importance of supporting the livelihoods of the most vulnerable people through sustained and stronger collaboration
04/09/2020 Bangkok/Thimphu
On the third day of the FAO Regional Conference for Asia-Pacific, the FAO Director-General QU Dongyu, Government Ministers as well as civil society and private sector representatives voiced concern over COVID-19's impacts on the food security and livelihoods of millions of people, and urged for greater action to overcome the food and agriculture challenges facing the region.
They spoke during the Ministerial Session of the virtual conference, which is hosted by Bhutan and aims to define the region priorities for the coming years, as well as to elaborate strategies to fight hunger and malnutrition and advance the transformation of agri-food systems, making them more sustainable, productive and resilient.
"We need to recognize that the food and agriculture sectors, including fisheries, forestry, crops and livestock, and the families that rely on them for their livelihoods, have been badly affected by the spread of the pandemic," said Bhutan's Foreign Minister Tandi Dorji, who delivered the session's keynote address on behalf of his country's Prime Minister.
The FAO Director-General highlighted that small and vulnerable farmers must be at the centre of the response. "Smallholder farmers and their families, food workers in all sectors, and those living in commodity- and tourism-dependent economies are particularly vulnerable. They urgently need our attention," QU urged.
The Asia-Pacific region is home to more than half of the world's undernourished people, and with the impacts of COVID-19 the number of hungry people in Southern Asia could rise by nearly a third to 330 million in the next ten years.The speakers noted the importance of acting in two fronts simultaneously: revising public policies and implementing practical measures in the field.
"The novel coronavirus has implications for local, national, regional and global policies and it is important that global and local conditions alike are recognized when confronting this pandemic," said the Independent Chairperson of the FAO Council, Khalid Mehboob.
"The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the vulnerability and weaknesses of already fragile global food systems. We must take urgent action to transform our food systems," stressed Thanawat Tiensin, the Chairperson of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS), an international and intergovernmental platform which includes the private sector and civil society and reports to the FAO Conference and the UN General Assembly through the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
Sustained and stronger collaboration
The FAO Director-General and many participants also urged for sustained and stronger collaboration, including leveraging agricultural technologies and innovations, to end hunger and tackle COVID-19's impacts.
In this respect, the FAO chief presented the organization's recently launched COVID-19 Response and Recovery Programme - aimed at mitigating the immediate impacts of the pandemic while building back better - as well as other key initiatives, with focus on innovation, that can accelerate global hunger-fighting efforts. These include the establishment of an FAO office of innovation and the creation of an international platform for digital food and agriculture, as well as the Hand-in-Hand Initiative, which is supported by "state-of-the-art tools", namely the Hand-in-Hand Geospatial Platform and the FAO Data Lab for statistical innovation.
"The point of all these initiatives is to get the latest knowledge and tools into the hands of decision makers but also smallholder farmers, fishers, herders and foresters. This is the region where a vast majority of smallholders are producing the food and agricultural products that we rely upon," said QU.
"We need to take full advantage of the digital age through innovative partnerships with national governments, farmers, the private sector, academia, NGOs and many others," he urged.
Representing Pakistan at the Ministerial Session of the Regional Conference, Federal Minister for National Food Security & Research, Syed Fakhar Imam stated that “During these difficult times of COVID-19 and locust invasion, we are trying to sustain particularly those people living below the poverty line. With the efforts of the current government, there have been transformations in policies. He further stated that we need to upgrade and digitalize our agro-technology and carry out the best practices as being followed in the advanced countries.
Increase in agricultural productivity can happen when policies are framed, which will benefit the farming community. We want to bring a better balance between different sectors of the economy manufacturing agriculture and the service sectors, said Mr. Fakhar Imam.
“The FAO 35th Regional Conference has provided a valuable virtual platform for Members to exchange their views, knowledge and experience in addressing food security and nutrition challenges amidst COVID19 pandemic, to identify Regional priorities, new ways of working and collective actions to accelerate progress towards the eradication of poverty (SDG1) and hunger and all forms of malnutrition (SDG 2). The Government of Pakistan has actively contributed by sharing perspectives of its development strategy: Pakistan is targeting population below the national poverty line, and small holder farmers agriculture transformation by agro-ecological zones, in an effort to contain the combined impacts of COVID-19 on food systems, climate hazards and the recent Desert Locust national emergency in a slowing down economy”, said Mina Dowlatchahi, Country Representative in Pakistan.
Several participants, including representatives from Pakistan, conveyed interest in and support for the organization's current key initiatives such as Hand-in-Hand. Others acknowledged the important role innovation and technologies could play in improving food production and security.

COVID-19 will widen poverty gap between women and men, new UN Women and UNDP data shows
The pandemic will push 47 million more women and girls below the poverty line, reversing decades of progress to eradicate extreme poverty.
New York, 2 September, 2020— The COVID-19 crisis will dramatically increase the poverty rate for women and widen the gap between men and women who live in poverty, according to new data released today by UN Women and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The poverty rate for women was expected to decrease by 2.7 percent between 2019 and 2021, but projections now point to an increase of 9.1 percent due to the pandemic and its fallout.
The projections, commissioned by UN Women and UNDP, and carried out by the Pardee Centre for International Futures at the University of Denver, show that while the pandemic will impact global poverty generally, women will be disproportionately affected, especially women of reproductive age. By 2021, for every 100 men aged 25 to 34 living in extreme poverty (living on 1.90 USD a day or less), there will be 118 women, a gap that is expected to increase to 121 women per 100 men by 2030.
“The increases in women’s extreme poverty, in particular at these two stages of their lives, are a stark indictment of deep flaws in the ways we have constructed our societies and economies,” said UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. “We know that women take most of the responsibility for caring for the family; they earn less, save less and hold much less secure jobs – in fact, overall, women’s employment is 19% more at risk than men’s. The evidence we have here of multiple inequalities is critical to drive swift, restorative policy action that puts women at the heart of pandemic recovery,“ she added.
The data, summarized in a UN Women report From Insights to Action: Gender Equality in the wake of COVID-19, also show that the pandemic will push 96 million people into extreme poverty by 2021, 47 million of whom are women and girls. This will increase the total number of women and girls living in extreme poverty to 435 million, with projections showing that this number will not revert to pre-pandemic levels until 2030.
The pandemic has posed a serious threat to the prospects of eradicating extreme poverty by the end of this decade. And the reality might be even grimmer as these projections of increased poverty rates for women and girls only account for the downward revision of the gross domestic product (GDP), excluding other factors - such as women leaving the workforce due to childcare responsibilities - that may also affect the sex distribution of poverty.
“More than 100 million women and girls could be lifted out of poverty if governments implement a comprehensive strategy aimed at improving access to education and family planning, fair and equal wages, and expanding social transfers,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.
“Women are bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 crisis as they are more likely to lose their source of income and less likely to be covered by social protection measures. Investing in reducing gender inequality is not only smart and affordable, but also an urgent choice that governments can make to reverse the impact of the pandemic on poverty reduction,” he added.
The fallout of the pandemic will shift forecasts of extreme poverty across regions. With 59 per cent of the world’s poor women currently living in sub-Saharan Africa, the region will continue to host the highest number of the world’s extreme poor. Yet, after making significant gains in poverty reduction in the past few years, South Asia is projected to experience a resurgence in extreme poverty. By 2030, for every 100 men aged 25–34 living in poverty in Southern Asia there will be 129 poor women, an increase from 118 in 2021.
While these figures are alarming, the study estimates it would take just 0.14 percent of global GDP (USD 2 trillion) to lift the world out of extreme poverty by 2030; and US$48 billion to close the gender poverty gap. However, the real number could end up being much higher, especially if governments fail to act – or act too late.
The unabated rise of other pre-existing gender inequalities will also impact these figures. Women are employed in some of the most affected sectors, like accommodation, food services, and domestic work. They have been particularly vulnerable to layoffs and loss of livelihood. According to International Labour Organization (ILO), by June 2020, it is estimated that 72 percent of domestic workers globally had lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19. Women and men are both taking on more household chores and care for children and family members during lockdowns, but the majority of work still falls on the shoulders of women and girls.
Backtracking on progress is not inevitable. Recommendations to prevent women from falling behind permanently because of the pandemic range from addressing occupational segregation, gender pay gaps and inadequate access to affordable childcare to introducing economic support packages for vulnerable women to countries increasing social protection measures targeting women and girls and expanding research and data availability on the gendered impacts of COVID-19.

UNHCR Representative inaugurates skills development project for refugee and local women in Quetta
QUETTA, 3 September 2020: The UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Noriko Yoshida on Thursday inaugurated a skills development project aimed at improving the skills and income-generating capacity of local and Afghan refugee women in Quetta.
UNHCR Pakistan had signed its first-ever agreement with NAMA Women Advancement Establishment (NAMA), a private sector partner based in the United Arab Emirates, to conduct a project to support and empower marginalized Afghan refugee and local women through skill development and enhancement in Balochistan.
The project – being implemented by UNHCR’s partner Taraqee Foundation – will benefit 100 Afghan refugee and Pakistani women. These women will not only be trained but also be given monthly stipends to support their family while they are working.
NAMA’s affiliate, IRTHI Contemporary Crafts Council, and UNHCR will be working in partnership to provide artisanal training.
The project will be implemented in two skill centres including at Ghoasabad and Hazara Town. Some 100 skilled and semi-skilled women will receive the advanced trainings in the carpet weaving trade. Of the total 70 per cent are Afghan refugees while 30 per cent are Pakistani women.
The UNHCR Representative, Ms. Noriko Yoshida visited the skill training centre at Ghoasabad in Quetta and formally inaugurated the project where the female artisans will be trained and guided to produce Emirati-inspired designs. Other partner staff were also present on the occasion.
Ms. Yoshida interacted with refugee and Pakistani women and exchanged views on how this project will make a difference in their lives. The Representative assured that UNHCR will continue to implement such projects that empower women.
She commended the NAMA’s contribution and its role in empowering women socially and economically through such projects.
“The outcomes and impact of such initiatives are always beneficial. The project will enable these women to stand on their own two feet as well as support their families in a dignified manner,” she said adding the initiative will also enhance their future economic prospects upon return to Afghanistan.
Ms. Noriko further said that one of the main objectives of UNHCR’s livelihood strategy is to make women empowered and self-reliant. She reiterated UNHCR’s commitment to continue supporting and implementing projects that are beneficial for women.

Countries in Asia-Pacific convene virtual UN FAO conference to plan responses and recovery work on twin pandemics of COVID-19 and hunger
01/09/2020, Bangkok/Thimphu – As COVID-19 continues to threaten lives and livelihoods across many countries of the Asia-Pacific region, it has led to setbacks in the fight to end hunger and malnutrition, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) announced today.
The Asia-Pacific region is home to more than half of the world’s undernourished, and with COVID-19 the number of hungry people in Southern Asia is projected to rise by nearly a third to 330 million by 2030, the Sustainable Development Goal deadline set by the global community to eliminate hunger and malnutrition in all its forms.
In response, Government representatives from 46 FAO Member Nations in Asia and the Pacific have convened a four-day virtual conference to closely examine the present situation of the region’s food security, with a particular emphasis on implications linked to the spread of the coronavirus and its impact on food systems region-wide.
More than 400 delegates are participating in a virtual meeting of the 35th Session of the FAO Asia and Pacific Regional Conference (#APRC35), hosted by the Royal Government of Bhutan. Their numbers include Government Ministers, private sector, civil society, academia and technical experts in the food and agriculture sectors. All sessions of the conference can be followed live via Webcast. The Timetable can be found here and the Annotated Agenda is here.
Twin pandemics require new thinking and actions
From Afghanistan and Iran in the west, across populous South and East Asia, and far out into the Pacific Islands, new ways and approaches will be needed to battle back from these twin pandemics. Climate change is another aggravating factor menacing efforts to increase resilience across our food systems.
“We must come to terms with what is before us and recognize that the world and our region has changed. We must find new ways to move forward and ensure sustainable food security in the face of these twin pandemics, as well as prepare for threats that can and will evolve in the future,” said Jong-Jin Kim, Assistant Director-General and FAO Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific. “This virtual conference brings together the people and ideas to chart a true course of action for the benefit of all.”
The conference will highlight FAO’s recently launched comprehensive COVID-19 Response and Recovery Programme designed to provide a flexible and coordinated global response that aims to ensure access to nutritious food for everyone. The programme includes the mobilization of all forms of resources and partnerships at country, regional and global level. The main aim is to mitigate the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic while strengthening the longer-term resilience of food systems and livelihoods.
The conference will also consider new marketing channels (such as e-commerce) and new technologies (including better storage facilities) that will help reduce food losses, as these are critical to ensure the flow of nutritious foods and to generate improved incomes for those who work across the entire food and agriculture sectors.
Equally critical is enabling smallholder and family farmers – those who produce most of the food we consume – to become more dynamic, entrepreneurial and competitive through continual innovation. Smallholders will need much greater access to financial resources, technology and innovation.
Bringing all players together will be crucial to realizing these gains and FAO is in the process of implementing the Hand-in-Hand Initiative to enable that. The conference will have a special session to examine the progress made in the region through this initiative.
The conference (#APRC35) will continue until Friday 4 September.

Thousands of residents in Pakistan’s urban slums flock to UN-Habitat’s handwashing stations
Rawalpindi, Pakistan, 13 August 2020 - UN-Habitat Pakistan has joined forces with Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in urban slums and ease the economic impact on the vulnerable residents.
A pilot “Pakistan COVID-19 Urban Slums Response Programme” was launched in two urban slums, Dhok Hassu and Dhok Mangtal, in Rawalpindi, a city adjacent to Federal Capital Islamabad.
Hand washing stations  designed according to WHO guidelines, were installed and are being used by over 800 people a day including children, sanitary workers and the business community
Mr. Amjad, a local shopkeeper said: “We had no place to wash hands in the markets before the pilot.  We thank UN-Habitat for installing the handwashing stations in the markets. They help to protect us from COVID-19.”
To raise awareness on COVID-19 and disseminate information, a whatsapp group was created involving 10 percent of the target population. In addition disinfectant sprays are being used  in hotspots, streets and markets and there are frequent temperature checks, distribution of sanitizers, masks and gloves and environmentally safe collection and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.
The local community was engaged to to produce masks and gloves and other related activities providing employment.
Rukhsana Majeed who lives in Dhok Hassu, staid: “We are happy that this project has helped us to earn a living by introducing this source of income generation of stitching of masks.”
A rapid assessment of conditions in the pilot area looked at the socio-economic vulnerabilities, existing capacity and community concerns. It showed that residents have no access to adequate sanitation facilities or water for drinking or hand washing. In addition over a third of respondents -  37 per cent - said they had lost their jobs after a lockdown was imposed.
UN-Habitat is preparing to launch the Pakistan COVID-19 Urban Slums Response Programme (PCUSRP) at country level and invites other UN Agencies and  donors to participate.

Digital finance, a lifeline during COVID-19 crisis, can deliver long-term financing of the Sustainable Development Goals
Unleashing potential of digital finance could have transformational impact on sustainable development says group of financial, business, government and development leaders convened by the UN Secretary-General
New York City, 26 August - The unprecedented social and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the role of digital finance in providing relief for millions around the world, supporting businesses and protecting jobs and livelihoods.
While the pandemic demonstrates the immediate benefits of digital finance, the disruptive potential of digitalization in transforming finance is immense. Mobile payment technologies have transformed mobile phones into financial tools for more than a billion people. Digital is supporting big data and artificial intelligence in advancing cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding platforms, and online marketplaces. Banks have invested over US$1 trillion in developing, integrating and acquiring emerging technologies. In 2018, ‘fintech’ investment reached US$120 billion, one third of global venture capital funding.
Today a new report, “People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future”, by the UN Secretary-General’s Task Force on Digital Finance sets out an ambitious, practical Action Agenda. Centrally, it spells out how digital finance can be harnessed in ways that empower citizens as tax-payers and investors in envisaging a digital transformation at scale that better aligns people’s money with their needs, collectively expressed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The report highlights how billions of people around the world are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic using digital tools to work, spend and socialize. It argues there is an historic opportunity to harness digitalization in placing citizens, the ultimate owners of the world's financial resources, in control of finance to ensure that it meets their needs, today and in the future.
The Task Force identifies five catalytic opportunities for harnessing digitalization in aligning financing with the SDGs. Together they cover much of global finance:
·         Aligning the vast pools flowing through global capital markets with the SDGs.
·         Increasing the effectiveness and accountability of public finance that makes up a major part of the global economy.
·         Channeling digitally-aggregated domestic savings into long-term development finance.
·         Informing citizens how to link their consumer spending with the SDGs.
·         Accelerating the lifeblood financing for the employment and income-generating world of small and medium-sized businesses.
The Task Force’s Action Agenda is a call to action to businesses, policy-makers and those governing finance to do what it takes to deliver on these opportunities. It spells out not only the ‘what’ but also the ‘how’: investments, new capabilities and governance innovations can get the job done.
The Task Force concludes that harnessing digitalization for the good is a choice, not an inevitability driven by technology.  Its Action Agenda points to actions needed to overcome digital risks that, unmitigated, could deepen exclusion, discrimination and inequalities, and separate finance further from the needs of an inclusive, sustainable development.

Leadership Quotes
UN Secretary-General, António Guterres said: “Digital technologies, which are revolutionizing financial markets, can be a game-changer in meeting our shared objectives. The Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals provides leadership to harness the digital revolution.“
Maria Ramos, Co-Chair of the UN Secretary-General’s Task Force on Digital Finance said: “We have an historic opportunity to accelerate and expand the transformative impact of digitalization. In particular, digital finance, which in this crisis became the lifeline for millions across the world, extends the boundaries of financial inclusion by empowering citizens as savers, investors, borrowers, lenders and tax-payers in a way that gives them choice and power over their money.”
Achim Steiner, Administrator of UNDP and Co-Chair of the UN Secretary-General’s Task Force on Digital Finance said: “Digital finance's dramatic potential for transformative impact is being revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital transfers enable governments to get support to people in need, crowdfunding platforms have mobilized funds for medical supplies and emergency relief, and algorithmic lending means small businesses have quicker access to funds. The speed of the recent spread of these technologies is astonishing, but progress is not automatic. For digitalization to be a true force for delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals, technological advances must combine with sound policy that empowers citizens and enables our financial system to meet the urgent investment challenges that must be overcome to build forward better.”

COVID-19: At least a third of the world’s schoolchildren unable to access remote learning during school closures, new UNICEF report says
UNICEF’s Reimagine campaign calls for urgent investment to bridge the digital divide, reach every child with remote learning, and, most critically, prioritize the safe reopening of schools
NEW YORK, 27 August 2020 – At least a third of the world’s schoolchildren – 463 million children globally – were unable to access remote learning when COVID-19 shuttered their schools, according to a new UNICEF report released today as countries across the world grapple with their ‘back-to-school’ plans.
“For at least 463 million children whose schools closed due to COVID-19, there was no such a thing as remote learning,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “The sheer number of children whose education was completely disrupted for months on end is a global education emergency. The repercussions could be felt in economies and societies for decades to come.”
At the height of nationwide and local lockdowns, nearly 1.5 billion schoolchildren were affected by school closures. The Remote Learning Reachability report outlines the limitations of remote learning and exposes deep inequalities in access.
The report uses a globally representative analysis on the availability of home-based technology and tools needed for remote learning among pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary and upper-secondary schoolchildren, with data from 100 countries. Data include access to television, radio and internet, and the availability of curriculum delivered across these platforms during school closures.
Although the numbers in the report present a concerning picture on the lack of remote learning during school closures, UNICEF warns the situation is likely far worse. Even when children have the technology and tools at home, they may not be able to learn remotely through those platforms due to competing factors in the home including pressure to do chores, being forced to work, a poor environment for learning and lack of support in using the online or broadcast curriculum.
The report highlights significant inequality across regions. Schoolchildren in sub-Saharan Africa are the most affected, with half of all students cannot be reached with remote learning.

Schoolchildren from the poorest households and those living in rural areas are by far the most likely to miss out during closures, the report says. Globally, 72 per cent of schoolchildren unable to access remote learning live in their countries’ poorest households. In upper-middle-income countries, schoolchildren from the poorest households account for up to 86 per cent of students unable to access remote learning. Globally, three quarters of schoolchildren without access live in rural areas.
The report also notes varying rates of access across age groups, with the youngest students most likely to miss out on remote learning during their most critical years of learning and development:
· Around 70 per cent of schoolchildren of pre-primary-age – 120 million children – cannot be reached, largely due to challenges and limitations to online learning for young children, lack of remote learning programmes for this education category, and lack of home assets for remote learning.
· At least 29 per cent of primary schoolchildren – 217 million students – cannot be reached. At least around 24 per cent of lower-secondary schoolchildren – 78 million students – were not reached.
· Upper-secondary schoolchildren were the least likely to miss out on remote learning with at least around 18 per cent – 48 million schoolchildren– not having the technological assets to access remote learning.
UNICEF urges governments to prioritize the safe re-opening of schools when they begin easing lockdown restrictions. When reopening is not possible, UNICEF urges governments to incorporate compensatory learning for lost instructional time into school continuity and reopening plans. School opening policies and practices must include expanding access to education, including remote learning, especially for marginalized groups. Education systems must also be adapted and built to withstand future crises.
UNICEF’s Framework for Reopening Schools, issued jointly with UNESCO, UNHCR, WFP and the World Bank, offers practical advice for national and local authorities. The guidelines focus on policy reform; financing requirements; safe operations; compensatory learning; wellness and protection and reaching the most marginalized children.
As part of its Reimagine campaign aims to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from aggravating a lasting crisis for children, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, UNICEF is calling for urgent investment to bridge the digital divide, reach every child with remote learning, and, most critically, prioritize the safe reopening of schools.

###
Notes to editors:
The analysis uses findings from the UNESCO-UNICEF-World Bank Survey on National Education Responses to COVID-19 School Closures joint survey. The number of children potentially reached by broadcast media or internet solutions are based on the availability of related assets (TV, radio and internet) at home, not their actual use by children. Hence the number of children “potentially reached” are upper estimates of the reality of children “actually reached”. Paper-based coverage is not accounted for due to lack of reliable data.
The analysis does not focus on out-of-school children. For the latest data on out-of-school children visit: https://www.unicef.org/sites/default/files/2019-12/SOWC-2019.pdf

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
VIDEO REMARKS ON LAUNCH OF
POLICY BRIEF ON TOURISM AND COVID-19
25 August 2020

Tourism is one of the world’s most important economic sectors.
It employs one in every ten people on Earth and provides livelihoods to hundreds of millions more.
It boosts economies and enables countries to thrive.
It allows people to experience some of the world’s cultural and natural riches and brings people closer to each other, highlighting our common humanity.
Indeed, one might say that tourism is itself one of the wonders of the world.
That is why it has been so painful to see how tourism has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the first five months of this year, international tourist arrivals decreased by more than half and some $320 billion dollars in exports from tourism were lost.
Overall, some 120 million direct jobs in tourism are at risk.
Many are in the informal economy or in micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ a high proportion of women and young people.
The crisis is a major shock for developed economies, but for developing countries, it is an emergency, particularly for many small island developing states and African countries.
For women, rural communities, indigenous peoples and many other historically marginalized populations, tourism has been a vehicle for integration, empowerment and generating income.
Tourism is also a key pillar for the conservation of natural and cultural heritage.
The fall in revenues has led to increased poaching and habitat destruction in and around protected areas, and the closure of many World Heritage Sites has deprived communities of vital livelihoods.
It is imperative that we rebuild the tourism sector.
But it must be in a way that is safe, equitable and climate friendly.
Transport-related greenhouse gas emissions could rebound sharply if recovery is not aligned with climate goals.
Supporting the millions of livelihoods that depend on tourism means building a sustainable and responsible travel experience that is safe for host communities, workers and travellers.
To aid recovery, I have identified five priority areas.
First, mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the crisis.
Second, build resilience across the entire tourism value chain.
Third, maximize the use of technology in the tourism sector.
Fourth, promote sustainability and green growth.
And fifth, foster partnerships to enable tourism to further support the Sustainable Development Goals.
Let us ensure tourism regains its position as a provider of decent jobs, stable incomes and the protection of our cultural and natural heritage.
Thank you.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY
COMMEMORATING THE VICTIMS OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE BASED ON RELIGION OR BELIEF
22 August 2020
The right to freedom of religion or belief is firmly trenched in international human rights law and is a cornerstone for inclusive, prosperous and peaceful societies.
Yet across the world, we continue to witness deep-seated discrimination against religious minorities, attacks on people and religious sites, and hate crimes and atrocity crimes targeting populations simply because of their religion or belief.
While societies have shown resilience and strength in the face of COVID-19, the pandemic has also been accompanied by a surge in stigma and racist discourse vilifying communities, spreading vile stereotypes and assigning blame.
As we commemorate the victims, we must do more to address the root causes of intolerance and discrimination by promoting inclusion and respect for diversity. We must also ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are held accountable.
States have the primary responsibility to protect the right to freedom of religion and belief.  I have also made this a priority through initiatives such as a Call to Action for Human Rights, a Strategy on Hate Speech and a Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites.
This extraordinary moment calls on all of us to work together as one human family to defeat a disease and put an end to hate and discrimination.

Inception workshop held to launch the “Transforming the Indus Basin with Climate Resilient Agriculture and Water Management” Project in Sindh and Punjab
A two-day provincial inception workshop for the six-year ‘Transforming the Indus Basin with Climate Resilient Agriculture and Water Management’ project was held virtually in Sindh and Punjab provinces. The workshop provided a multi-stakeholder platform for an in-depth discussion on the proposed project implementation strategy, possible challenges and mechanisms for community engagement.
‘Transforming the Indus Basin with Climate Resilient Agriculture and Water Management’ project funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and co-financed by the provincial governments of Sindh and Punjab aims to increase resilience to climate change among the most vulnerable farmers in the Indus basin and to strengthen the Government of Pakistan’s capacity to support communities in adapting to climate change.
The project will help shift Pakistan and the Indus Basin agriculture from its current situation of high vulnerability towards an alternative paradigm wherein better information and farming practices will significantly increase resilience to climate change and economic improvements. To support this, the project will develop the country’s capacity to get and use the information it needs to cope with the impacts of climate change on agriculture and water management by putting in place state-of-the-art technology and innovation. About 1.3 million rural people (in 200 000 households) will directly benefit while another 16 million people (including 7.9 million women) may indirectly benefit from the project.
Jointly implemented by the federal Ministry of Climate Change, and the Governments of Sindh and Punjab and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the project will cover three district in Sindh including, Sanghar, Badin and Umerkot and five districts of Punjab including Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan, Khanewal, Lodhran and Multan.
The inception workshop brought together officials from the Governments of Sindh and Punjab, development partners, research and academia, public and private institutions, UN agencies representatives, government line department and the civil society.

UNDP Pakistan held the first ever virtual Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Incubation Liaison Conference 2020
21 August, 2020, Peshawar—Organised by UNDP Pakistan, the first ever virtual Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Incubation Liaison Conference (KP-ILC) 2020, concludes today. The main objective of the conference was to connect five public sector Business Incubation Centres (BICs) from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with each other, and with relevant stakeholders— for meaningful engagement, and cross-learning. As part of the initiative, Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) were signed between National Incubation Centre (NIC) Peshawar, and five public sector universities from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, namely— University of Haripur, Haripur; Institute of Management Sciences, Peshawar; University of Malakand, Malakand; UET, Peshawar and Abdul Wali Khan University of Mardan.
Along with young entrepreneurs from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,  Senior officials and representatives from the five public sector universities, NIC Peshawar, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Information Technology Board (KPITB) participated in the conference.
“Our focus is primarily on youth employment and empowerment. The NIC Peshawar, Durshals and incubators in universities are working closely on promoting entrepreneurship for youth”, said Mr Zia Ullah Khan Bangash, Advisor to Chief Minister on Science and Information Technology, while speaking on the occasion. “The Prime Minister’s Kamyab Jawan programme is playing a vital role in serving as a strong launchpad for start-ups and new ventures.”
“Pakistan is one of the youngest countries in the world today with over two-thirds of its population below the age of 30”, said Laura Sheridan, Programme Specialist, who is heading the Youth Empowerment Programme (YEP) at UNDP Pakistan. “Harnessing and catalyzing the excluded youth's potential is necessary through employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. The young entrepreneurs from different universities in Pakistan form an integral part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Their energy and their ideas need to be fostered as they will be the business leaders of tomorrow. Cross pollination of startups and of the incubators that host them is vital to the growth of the startup ecosystem.”
A panel discussion “Future and sustainability of incubators” was also organised in which representatives from KPITB, UNDP and NIC participated along with the Vice Chancellors of public universities present. The conversation focused on the role of incubators in the national economy, the culture of entrepreneurship in universities, best practices of incubators, and the impact and sustainability of this initiative. The role of incubators and their effectiveness was discussed in great detail. All of the members agreed that supporting and nurturing the budding incubation and entrepreneurial culture and ecosystem is essential for sustainable development.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE OF
AND TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS OF TERRORISM
21 August 2020

Today, we remember and honour all victims of terrorism.  We stand by those who grieve and those who continue to endure the physical and psychological wounds of terrorist atrocities.
The impact of terrorism on victims can last a lifetime and reverberate across generations.  Traumatic memories cannot be erased, but we can help victims and survivors
by seeking truth, justice and reparation, amplifying their voices and upholding their human rights.
This third International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism takes place while the world is in turmoil.  The COVID-19 crisis has changed the way we live and interact with each other.
Vital services for victims, such as criminal justice processes and psychosocial support, have been interrupted, delayed or ended while governments focus attention and resources on fighting the pandemic.
Many memorials and commemorations have been cancelled or moved online, hampering the ability of victims to find solace and comfort together.  And, due to current restrictions, the first-ever United Nations Global Congress of Victims of Terrorism has been postponed until next year.
Remembering the victims of terrorism and doing more to support them is essential
to help them rebuild their lives and heal.  This includes our efforts to work with parliamentarians and governments to draft and adopt legislation and national strategies
to help victims.
We must continue to support victims’ associations in their invaluable work.  We must ensure that those who have suffered are always heard and never forgotten.  The United Nations stands in solidarity with all victims of terrorism -- today and every day.

UNICEF - PRESS RELEASE : COVID-19 causes disruptions to child protection services in more than 100 countries, UNICEF survey finds


On World Humanitarian Day, we honour the work of humanitarians who overcome huge challenges to save and improve the lives of millions of people.
These real-life heroes are doing extraordinary things in extraordinary times to help women, men and children whose lives are upended by crises.
This year, humanitarian workers are stretched like never before.
They are responding to the global crisis of COVID-19, and with it the massive increase in humanitarian needs from the fallout of the pandemic.
The loss of jobs, education, food, water and safety is pushing millions more to the brink.
Movement restrictions to slow the spread of the virus have meant that communities, civil society and local organizations – as so often before – are the very first responders.
This year, we celebrate them: people who are often in need themselves, like refugees helping host communities, local health workers who care for the sick and vaccinate children, and humanitarians who negotiate access in areas of conflict to bring food, water and medicine.

They are the unsung heroes of the pandemic response – and they all too often risk their own lives to save the lives of others.
Today, join me in renewing our appreciation and support for the brave humanitarians, health workers and first responders who show solidarity and humanity in this time of unprecedented need.

COVID-19 causes disruptions to child protection services in more than 100 countries, UNICEF survey finds
NEW YORK, 19 August 2020 – Violence prevention and response services have been severely disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving children at increased risk of violence, exploitation and abuse, according to a global survey by UNICEF.
Of 136 countries that responded to UNICEF’s Socio-economic Impact Survey of COVID-19 Response, 104 countries reported a disruption in services related to violence against children. Around two thirds of countries reported that at least one service had been severely affected, including South Africa, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Serbia. South Asia, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia have the highest proportion of countries reporting disruptions in the availability of services.
“We are just beginning to fully understand the damage done to children because of their increased exposure to violence during pandemic lockdowns,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Ongoing school closures and movement restrictions have left some children stuck at home with increasingly stressed abusers. The subsequent impact on protection services and social workers means children have nowhere to turn for help.”
As countries adopted prevention and control measures to contain COVID-19, many vital violence prevention and response services were suspended or interrupted as a result. More than half of the countries reported disruptions in case management, referral services and home visits by child welfare and social workers to children and women at risk of abuse. Violence prevention programmes, children’s access to child welfare authorities, and national helpline services have also been affected in many countries, according to the responses.
Even before the pandemic, children’s exposure to violence was widespread, with about half of the world’s children experiencing corporal punishment at home; roughly 3 in 4 children aged 2 to 4 years regularly subjected to forms of violent discipline; and 1 in 3 adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 having been victimised by their intimate partner at some point in their lives.
Studies of past epidemics and crises show devastating impacts on the reporting of violence against children and delivery of related services. During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, for example, child welfare structures and community mechanisms were weakened, and child protection responses were delayed or otherwise affected. In addition, during health pandemics such as COVID-19, limited contact with informal support networks such as friends, teachers, childcare workers, extended family and community members leave children and families more vulnerable.
In response, UNICEF is supporting governments and partner organisations to maintain and adapt critical prevention and response services for children affected by violence during COVID-19. For example, in Bangladesh, UNICEF has provided personal hygiene items including masks, hand sanitizers and eye protectors for social service workers to safely support children living on the streets, in slums, and in climate-affected and hard-to-reach areas, as well as recruiting and training additional social workers for the national Child Helpline 1098.
“Child protection systems were already struggling to prevent and respond to violence against children, and now a global pandemic has both made the problem worse and tied the hands of those meant to protect those at risk,” added Fore. “Too many children rely on child protection systems to keep them safe. In times of crisis, governments must have immediate and long-term measures that protect children from violence, including designating and investing in social service workers as essential, strengthening child helplines and making positive parenting resources available.”

UN Women- PRESS RELEASE : Gap analysis report launched to identify and fix legislative gaps to end violence against women in KP

Gap analysis report launched to identify and fix legislative gaps to end violence against women in KP
PESHAWAR: Women Parliamentary Caucus Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (WPC-KP) and UN Women Pakistan today launched a report on “Gap Analysis of Legislation related to Ending Violence Against Women (EVAW)” to provide an in-depth analysis of the normative, implementation and monitoring gaps in the legislative framework of the province and to identify and document gaps in the existing provincial legal framework and implementation process.
The gap analysis report has been designed and commissioned by UN Women Pakistan in partnership with Women Parliamentary Caucus KP with the financial support of UK Aid. The virtual launch was attended by the provincial parliamentarians, members of WPC, government officials, representatives of civil society organizations, media, academia, legal community and people from all walks of life.

The starting point for this analysis has been contextualizing EVAW laws within the framework of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and Pakistan’s other international commitments. The document substantiates and builds on previous bodies of work and adopts a holistic approach in identifying gaps and proposing recommendations for EVAW related legislation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In her welcome address, General Secretary WPC-KP Ayesha Bano said, “The commitment of the KP government to the cause of women’s rights is evident by the initiatives undertaken to implement Pakistan’s international commitments at the provincial level. In order to eliminate gender-based discrimination and safeguard the interests of women and girls, WPC-KP, in partnership with UN Women Pakistan, is working for enactment and implementation of women-related legislation – aligned with Pakistan’s national and international commitments – in the province.”
“The Gap Analysis Report of Laws relating to EVAW will create a better understanding of the legislative framework which will in turn support the enactment and implementation of effective and inclusive legislation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” she remarked.
In his message, Provincial Minister for Law Sultan Mohammad Khan recounted the achievements of the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa related to pro-women legislative reforms over the years. He specifically highlighted government’s success in the amendment and implementation of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Protection of Women against Harassment at Workplace Act 2010, and the appointment of renowned social activist Rukhshanda Naz as the Provincial Ombudsperson for Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace. “We are currently trying to build consensus for the enactment of Domestic Violence Bill and Child Marriage Restraint Bill, which will be two landmark laws in the history of the province,” the Minister underlined.
Chairperson Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Commission on the Status of Women (KPCSW) Dr. Riffat Sardar appreciated the concerted efforts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s women machinery and the commitment of WPC and UN Women to end discrimination and violence against women in the province. She said that KPCSW was committed to connect all stakeholders including government, civil society, women parliamentarians, entrepreneurs, civil society and communities in efforts to improve the status of women in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Saman Ahsan, Portfolio Manager EVAW, Governance & Human Rights UN Women Pakistan, said, “UN Women is proud to be working with WPC on CEDAW-compliant legislation as part of our broader partnership to promote the gender equality agenda at the provincial level. The government of KP has put in place several laws to protect and promote women’s rights, and this report will help in taking forward the legislative reform agenda of the province. I would like to commend WPC and our partners for supporting amendments in child marriage legislation as top priority. We look forward to continuing this important work with the WPC to eliminate the harmful practice of child marriage in the province.”

Forty-Six FAO Member Nations in Asia and the Pacific to chart a course for securing food systems and mitigating the effects of COVID-19 and climate change on agricultural sectors
13/08/2020, Bangkok/Thimphu – The arrival of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has had a great impact on agriculture and food systems in Asia and the Pacific, a region already beset by climate and weather related challenges, such as droughts and flooding.
Supply chains have been disrupted, demand has dropped for certain foods, resulting in damage to nutrition, health and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people in this, the world’s most populous region.
In response, 46 Member Nations, along with private sector and civil society organizations, will discuss a way forward during the 35th Session of the FAO Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific (#APRC35) in virtual mode, from 1 – 4 September 2020.
The Royal Government of Bhutan is hosting and chairing the biennial event.
The stakes are high
While some parts of East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific have experienced, relatively, less of an impact, the COVID-19 contagion continues to ravage many countries in the region. In addition to the threats on life, the impact of lockdowns and restricted movements have devastated the livelihoods of millions, increased acute hunger and set back progress toward achieving the world’s Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG-1 and SDG-2 (ending poverty and ending malnutrition).
More than ever, innovation and increased use of existing and new technology will be needed to respond to the risks and challenges to food systems posed by the spread of the coronavirus and the need to better manage natural resources sustainably in the face of climate change. A new approach to partnerships will also be required.
Media welcome
While participation in this FAO Regional Governing Body Session is by invitation only, representatives of news organizations are welcome to follow the proceedings live via Webcast and all conference documents are available online at the APRC-35 Website

2 in 5 schools around the world lacked basic handwashing facilities prior to COVID-19 pandemic — UNICEF, WHO
NEW YORK/GENEVA, 13 August 2020 – As schools worldwide struggle with reopening, the latest data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) reveal that 43 per cent of schools around the world lacked access to basic handwashing with soap and water in 2019 – a key condition for schools to be able to operate safely in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Global school closures since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have presented an unprecedented challenge to children’s education and wellbeing,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “We must prioritize children’s learning. This means making sure that schools are safe to reopen – including with access to hand hygiene, clean drinking water and safe sanitation.”
According to the report, around 818 million children lack basic handwashing facilities at their schools, which puts them at increased risk of COVID-19 and other transmittable diseases. More than one third of these children (295 million) are from sub-Saharan Africa. In the least developed countries, 7 out of 10 schools lack basic handwashing facilities and half of schools lack basic sanitation and water services.
The report stresses that governments seeking to control the spread of COVID-19 must balance the need for implementation of public health measures versus the associated social and economic impacts of lockdown measures. Evidence of the negative impacts of prolonged school closures on children’s safety, wellbeing and learning are well-documented, the report says.
“Access to water, sanitation and hygiene services is essential for effective infection prevention and control in all settings, including schools," said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "It must be a major focus of government strategies for the safe reopening and operation of schools during the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic.”
Other key findings from the report include:
· Of the 818 million children who lacked a basic handwashing service at their school, 355 million went to schools which had facilities with water but no soap, and 462 million to schools which had no facilities or water available for handwashing.
· In the 60 countries at highest risk of health and humanitarian crises due to COVID-19, 3 in 4 children lacked basic handwashing service at their school at the start of the outbreak; half of all children lacked basic water service; and more than half lacked basic sanitation service.
· 1 in 3 schools worldwide had either limited drinking water service or no drinking water service at all.
· 698 million children lacked basic sanitation service at their school.
The report identifies several resources necessary for COVID-19 prevention and control in schools, including 10 immediate actions and safety checklists. It builds on guidelines on the safe reopening of schools issued by UNESCO, UNICEF, WFP and the World Bank with practical advice for national and local authorities on how to prepare for safe school reopening and keep children safe when they return to school. The guidelines include several WASH-related protocols on hygiene measures, use of personal protective equipment, cleaning and disinfection, as well as providing access to clean water, handwashing stations with soap, and safe toilets.
UNICEF and WHO are committed to achieving equitable access to adequate WASH services worldwide. The agencies recently launched a joint initiative, Hand Hygiene for All, to support the most vulnerable communities with the means to protect their health and environment. It brings together international partners, national governments, public and private sectors, and civil society to ensure affordable products and services are available, especially in disadvantaged areas.

August 13, 2020, Quetta— While various sectors of governance have worked remotely earlier during the pandemic or managed to maintain social and physical distancing, doing so is particularly challenging for police officers as they are often brought into close proximity with citizens. This makes it even more important for them to have the appropriate protective equipment and gear to guard themselves as they perform their duties. In order to facilitate them, United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) donated PPEs to the Balochistan Police at a ceremony held at the Central Police Office, Quetta today.
During the ceremony, Head of UNDP Sub-office Quetta Mr. Zulfiqar Durrani presented washable and reusable PPEs, protective goggles  masks including N95 and KN95, hand sanitisers, and gloves, to the Balochistan Police.

At the occasion, Mr. Zulfiqar Durrani stressed on the significance of protection for police. “The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the challenges Pakistani police face and has also shown their role during a health emergency and crisis, marking a need to develop strategies of how police can play a more effective role in unprecedented situations like these”, he said.
Secretary Sports and Youth Affairs, Head Balochistan Command and Operation Center (BCOC) Mr. Imran Gichki who is responsible for all Covid-19 related coordination in Balochistan applauded UNDP’s efforts. “UNDP’s support for Balochistan police will not only ensure their health and safety but will also enable them to play a crucial role in violence prevention, protection of citizens and additional support to healthcare workers during the pandemic”, he added.
Inspector General of Police Balochistan Mr. Mohsin Butt thanked UNDP for the support and showed commitment towards working together for stronger a rule of law in Balochistan. He also appreciated UNDP’s support to the expansion of Police Training College Quetta with the support of Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.
“The nature of job puts police officials at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19. Therefore, we highly appreciate UNDP for this PPE that will protect Balochistan police and play an incremental role in ensuring their safety and well-being as they perform their duties. This support is extremely helpful particularly because the lockdown has been eased or lifted and duty spaces are being crowded once again”, he mentioned.
UNDP staff and police officials from Balochistan Police attended the ceremony. This effort is one of the many ways in which UNDP is supporting police and rule of law in Balochistan.

COVID-19 disrupts education of more than 70 per cent of youth
The disproportionate effect of the pandemic on young people has exacerbated inequalities and risks reducing the productive potential of an entire generation, according to the International Labour Organization.
GENEVA (ILO News) – The COVID-19 crisis is having a devastating effect on the education and training of young people.

Since the outset of the pandemic more than 70 per cent of youth who study or combine study with work have been adversely affected by the closing of schools, universities and training centres, according to an analysis by the International Labour Organization (ILO).

According to the report, Youth and COVID-19: impacts on jobs, education, rights and mental well-being, 65 per cent of young people reported having learned less since the beginning of the pandemic because of the transition from classroom to online and distance learning during lockdown. Despite their efforts to continue studying and training, half of them believed their studies would be delayed and nine per cent thought that they might fail.

The situation has been even worse for youth living in lower-income countries, who have less access to the internet, a lack of equipment and sometimes a lack of space at home.

This highlights large ’digital divides’ between regions; while 65 per cent of youth in high-income countries were taught classes via video-lectures only 18 per cent in low-income countries were able to keep studying online.

“The pandemic is inflicting multiple shocks on young people. It is not only destroying their jobs and employment prospects, but also disrupting their education and training and having a serious impact on their mental well-being. We cannot let this happen,” said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.
According to the report 38 per cent of young people are uncertain of their future career prospects, with the crisis expected to create more obstacles in the labour market and to lengthen the transition from school to work.

Some have already felt a direct impact, with one in six youth having to stop work since the onset of the pandemic. Many younger workers are more likely to be employed in highly affected occupations, such as support, services and sales-related work, making them more vulnerable to the economic consequences of the pandemic. Forty-two per cent of those who have continued to work have seen their incomes reduced.

This has had an impact on their mental well-being. The survey found that 50 per cent of young people are possibly subject to anxiety or depression, while a further 17 per cent are probably affected by it.
Despite the extreme circumstances young people are using their energy to mobilize and speak out in the fight against the crisis. According to the survey one in four have done some volunteer work during the pandemic.

Ensuring that youth voices are heard is critical to delivering a more inclusive response to the COVID-19 crisis. Giving young people a say in decision-making to articulate their needs and ideas improves the effectiveness of policies and programmes and gives youth the chance to participate in their delivery, says the report.

The report also calls for urgent, large-scale and targeted policy responses to protect a whole generation of young people from having their employment prospects permanently scarred by the crisis.

This includes, among other measures, re-integrating into the labour market those who have lost their jobs or who have experienced a reduction in working hours, ensuring youth access to unemployment insurance benefits, and measures to boost their mental health - from psychosocial support to sports activities.

Islamabad, 12 August 2020:  Today the United Nations in Pakistan commemorated International Youth Day by hosting an online seminar focusing on “Breaking Barriers for Meaningful Youth Engagement”. The event was attended by representatives of youth, the Government and development partners.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Youth Affairs, Mr. Usman Dar, said: ‘Youth form the biggest asset of the country and given the ongoing pandemic, they can play a crucial role in COVID response and recovery. To ensure their meaningful engagement, the Government has established Tiger Force to involve young people across Pakistan to fight against the coronavirus. Through their participation and hard work, we have been able to spread and reiterate SOPs across the country.’ He further added, ‘Our young people possess the energy and ability to contribute positively to the development of the nation. We just need to keep giving them the opportunities and right platforms.’
This year’s theme, ‘Youth Engagement for Global Action’ highlights the ways in which the engagement of young people at the local, national and global levels can enrich national and multilateral institutions and processes.
Ignacio Artaza, Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan, said, ‘I am extremely happy to open today’s session on behalf of the UN agencies in Pakistan who are working jointly to support the empowerment of youth and adolescents. It’s indeed a pleasure to see several UN agencies, who have been working closely to support a joint UN engagement of youth and adolescents in the COVID response, coming together today to advocate for greater youth engagement.’
The United Nation’s Youth 2030 strategy, which places young people at the center of the Development Agenda, is especially relevant in Pakistan, where more than two-thirds of the population is under the age of 30. With a decade remaining to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the participants stressed that it is a critical time to build momentum and invest in young people so that they can realize their capabilities to pursue gainful and decent employment, education opportunities, health and wellbeing, as well as civic and political empowerment. Meaningful youth engagement remains instrumental for development, in particular in view of the current COVID-19 crisis.
Recognizing the importance of meaningfully engaging with this demographic, several UN agencies in Pakistan including UNICEF, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNESCO and UNDP have combined efforts to draft a Youth Engagement Strategy, which aims to educate and engage Pakistan’s adolescents and young people to play a positive role in response to the coronavirus COVID-19.
The key highlights of the panel discussion were taken as action points by Government and the development organizations representatives. They will help address some of the barriers to meaningful youth engagement so that young people in Pakistan can have a greater say in their future.
The UN General Assembly designated 12 August as International Youth Day in 1999. It is an annual celebration of the role young women and men play as essential partners in promoting human rights and development.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
VIDEO MESSAGE ON INTERNATIONAL YOUTH DAY
12 August 2020
The theme of this year’s International Youth Day – “Youth Engagement for Global Action” -- spotlights the ways in which the voices and activism of young people are making a difference and moving our world closer to the values and vision of the United Nations Charter.
This year’s Youth Day occurs as the lives and aspirations of young people continue to be upended by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Some have lost their lives, and many have seen family members and other loved ones perish.
The vulnerabilities of young refugees, displaced persons, young women and girls and others caught up in conflict or disaster have grown more acute.
A generation’s very formation has been jeopardized, their steps towards adulthood, identity and self-sufficiency thrown off course.
Some have taken on care burdens or are suffering from increased risks of hunger, violence in the home or the prospect of never being able to resume their education.
But this generation is also resilient, resourceful and engaged.
They are the young people who have risen up to demand climate action.
They are mobilizing for racial justice and gender equality and are the champions of a more sustainable world.
They are peacebuilders promoting social cohesion at a time of social distancing, advancing an end to violence globally and advocating harmony at a time of rising hatred.
Many are young women who have been on the frontlines in mobilizing for justice and climate action — while also serving on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response.
Realizing the promise of this generation means investing far more in young people’s inclusion, participation, organizations and initiatives.
I call on leaders and adults everywhere to do everything possible to enable the world’s youth to enjoy lives of safety, dignity and opportunity and contribute to the fullest of their great potential.
Thank you.

Polio vaccination campaigns resume in Pakistan and Afghanistan after COVID-19 disruptions leave 50 million children unimmunized
KATHMANDU/ISLAMABAD, 11 August 2020 – Polio immunization campaigns have resumed in Pakistan and Afghanistan – the last two polio-endemic countries in the world – months after COVID-19 left 50 million children without their polio vaccine.
In Pakistan, the initial round of vaccinations took place at the end of July, covering about 780,000 children. A nationwide vaccination campaign is slated to start later this month. In Afghanistan, polio immunization programmes restarted in three provinces in July. A second campaign covering almost half of the country will start this month.
“These life-saving vaccinations are critical if children are to avoid yet another health emergency,” said Jean Gough, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia. “As the world has come to see only too well, viruses know no borders and no child is safe from polio until every child is safe.”
Polio is a highly-infectious, crippling and sometimes fatal disease that can be avoided with a vaccine. Children under the age of five are particularly vulnerable.
Child vaccination drives, including polio campaigns, were halted in both Pakistan and Afghanistan in March 2020 to avoid the risk of COVID-19 transmission to children, caregivers and vaccinators themselves. As a result, reported polio cases have reached 34 in Afghanistan and 63 in Pakistan, including in some previously polio-free parts of the country.
The application of new vaccination guidelines and the use of protective equipment by frontline health workers will help ensure that vaccination campaigns resume safely.
However, while every effort will be made to reach children nationwide in both countries, UNICEF is concerned that that up to 1 million children in Afghanistan could miss out as door-to-door vaccinations are not possible in some areas and parents will have to make their way to health clinics to have their child vaccinated. In Pakistan, the suspension of vaccination drives has also resulted in the expansion and introduction of the disease into new areas of the country.
“Although we have experienced new challenges and a set-back in the fight against polio because of COVID-19, the eradication of this contagious disease will get back on track and is firmly within our reach,” said Jean Gough. “Together with the respective Governments and other partners including the WHO, Rotary, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and with the dedicated work by frontline health workers, we are committed to reaching every child.”

This year’s World Day Against Trafficking in Persons honours the first responders helping to end the crime of human trafficking: law enforcement officers, social workers, healthcare professionals, NGO staff and many others working around the world to protect the vulnerable.
Like the frontline heroes saving lives and sustaining our societies in the COVID-19 pandemic, these providers are keeping vital services going throughout the crisis -- identifying victims, ensuring their access to justice, health, social assistance and protection, and preventing further abuse and exploitation.
I thank these first responders and urge all governments and societies to join their cause, including through the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated many global inequalities, created new obstacles on the path to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and left millions of people at greater risk of being trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labour, forced marriage and other crimes.
Women and girls already account for more than 70 per cent of detected human trafficking victims, and today are among the hardest hit by the pandemic.  With previous downturns showing that women face a harder time getting paid jobs back in the aftermath of crisis, vigilance is especially important at this time.
If the world is to put human dignity and human rights at the centre of the COVID-19 response and recovery, we need to do more to protect trafficking victims and prevent vulnerable people from being exploited by criminals. On this World Day against Trafficking in Persons, let us pledge to work for inclusive societies and economies that leave no one behind.
***

30 July 2020
Every day, in every country in the world, human traffickers exploit people for profit. The poor and the vulnerable are most at risk. Over 70 per cent of detected trafficking victims are women and girls, while nearly one third are children.
COVID-19 has amplified trafficking dangers. Loss of jobs, growing poverty, school closures and a rise in online interactions are increasing vulnerabilities and opening up opportunities for organized crime groups.
The crisis has overwhelmed social and public services, impacted the work of law enforcement and criminal justice systems, and made it harder for victims to seek help.
And yet in these difficult times, we see the best of humanity: frontline heroes, men and women risking their lives and going above and beyond to provide essential support for human trafficking victims.
The theme of this year’s World Day Against Trafficking in Persons focuses on the first responders  - the social workers, labour inspectors, law enforcement officers and prosecutors, health workers and NGO staff who identify victims, help them on their path to justice and with rebuilding their lives.
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime supports the first responders’ mission by channelling funding to help victims; providing protective equipment to anti-trafficking units and shelters; and assisting Member States to mitigate the pandemic’s impact on anti-trafficking responses.
UNODC also manages the UN Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, which supports NGOs to provide direct assistance to 3,500 victims a year in more than 40 countries.
I invite governments and the private sector to donate to the Trust Fund, and I call on all people to show their support by joining UNODC’s Blue Heart campaign against human trafficking.
On the 2020 World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, and in the COVID response and recovery, I salute and support the first responders who provide a lifeline to trafficking victims. By reaffirming the rights and dignity of all people, we can recover better, more inclusively and more sustainably.

The Government of Pakistan, UNICEF and WHO encourage people to adhere to SoPs and reinforce preventive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19
ISLAMABAD, 28 July 2020 – Today the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MoNHSRC), UNICEF and WHO called on the public to reinforce adherence to COVID-19 Standard Operating Procedures and strictly enforce key preventive behaviours against the coronavirus.
Chaired by Dr. Zafar Mirza, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister on Health, the public online event highlighted that everyone in Pakistan has a role to play to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. The goal is to avoid a repetition of the spike in coronavirus transmission which followed Eid ul Fitr in May by strictly observing the standard operating procedures against the pandemic, as flagged by Prime Minister Imran Khan yesterday.
“We are at a critical juncture of the current pandemic, witnessing a significant decrease in the number of cases, and no way can afford slackness or complacence, as was observed during Eidul-Fitr days”, said Dr. Zafar Mirza.
Not only has the COVID-19 outbreak impacted people’s lives and health across the country, but it has also adversely impacted the delivery of essential public services including heath, nutrition, education, water and sanitation.
“We are now at a crucial stage of our joint fight against the coronavirus, which Prime Minister Imran Khan and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Dr. Zafar Mirza have been leading since March, together with partners and dedicated front-line health workers” said Ms. Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “It is crucial that we all implement the few behaviours that are key to save lives and prevent the spread of the virus among our families and communities. The more we adhere to these behaviours, the sooner we will be able to resume a normal life and provide children and families with the essential services which they need, such as immunization against preventable diseases,  nutrition to keep at bay lifelong problems such as stunting and wasting, and education to help children and adolescents build their future and that of their communities.”
The Government of Pakistan is working to resume and sustain the provision of essential services with support from UNICEF and WHO across the country. Immunization against polio has already resumed in a number of high-risk districts.
“WHO appreciates the efforts of the Government of Pakistan to resume the provision of essential health care services in the context of COVID-19 with the support of all the partners, particularly WHO and UNICEF,” said Dr. Palitha Gunarathna Mahipala, WHO Representative in Pakistan. “Immunization against polio and vaccine preventable diseases has already resumed in many districts successfully. WHO greatly admires the leadership of the Prime Minister Imran Khan and the Minister of Health Dr Zafar Mirza in fighting against COVID-19 epidemic in Pakistan.”
Dr. Qibla Ayaz, Chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology; Muhammad Rizwan, international cricketeer; Dr. Naseem Akhtar, Focal person for COVID-19 at PIMS in Islamabad; and 15-year-old Areesha Fatima had recorded video messages played during the event, in which they called on people to mobilize against the virus and help save lives.
To protect themselves from the coronavirus, people need to:
· Avoid public gatherings
· Wear a mask when they leave their house, including when shopping at the market and if praying at the mosque
· Wash their hands with soap for 20 seconds, or with a sanitizer, regularly
· Refrain from touching their eyes, nose, mouth and ears with unwashed hands
· Stay at least six feet away from other people
· Stay at home in case they develop COVID-19 symptoms.

حکومتِ پاکستان، یونیسف اور عالمی ادارہ صحت  کی پاکستانی عوام سے عید الاضحیٰ منانے کے دوران کورونا وائرس کا پھیلاؤ روکنے میں معاون رویوں پر سختی سے عمل درآمد  کرنے کی درخواست

اسلام آباد، 28 جولائی 2020 – آج کے روز قومی وزارتِ صحت، یونیسف اور عالمی ادارہ صحت نے ایک اہم آن لائن اجلاس کے دوران لوگوں پر زور دیا کہ وہ عید الا ضحیٰ مناتے ہوئے کورونا وائرس کا پھیلاؤ روکنے کے لئے تجویز کردہ رویوں پر سختی سے عمل کریں تاکہ آنے والی عید محفوظ انداز میں منائی جاسکے۔
اجلاس کی صدارت وزیرِ اعظم پاکستان کے معاونِ خصوصی برائے صحت ڈاکٹر ظفر مرزا نے کی۔ اس آن لائن اجلاس میں اس بات پر زور دیا گیا کہ یہ پاکستان کے ہر فرد کا فرض ہے کہ وہ خود کو اور اپنے پیاروں کو کورونا وائرس سے بچانے کے لئے اپنا کردار ادا کرے۔ عید الاضحیٰ کے دنوں میں کورونا وائرس سے بچاؤ کا باعث بننے والے رویے اپنانے کا مقصد وزیر اعظم عمران کی طرف سے پیش کئے گئے معیاری عملی اقدامات (ایس او پیز) پر عمل درآمد کرتے ہوئے  وائرس کے پھیلاؤ کو ایک بار پھر اس نکتہ عروج تک پہنچنے سے روکنا ہے جس تک وہ عید الفطر کے بعد پہنچ گیا تھا۔
اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے ڈاکٹر ظفر مرزا نے کہا’’  ہم اس وقت اس وبائی صورتِ حال سے جنگ کے ایک اہم مرحلے پر ہیں۔ اس وقت کیسز کی تعداد میں بہت حد تک کمی واقع ہوچکی ہے اور اس مرحلے پر ہم اُس غفلت اور کاہلی کے متحمل نہیں ہوسکتے جس کا تجربہ ہمیں عید الفطر کے دنوں میں ہوا تھا۔
نہ صرف کووڈ 19 کی وبا سے پیدا ہونے والے حالات نے ملک بھر میں لوگوں کی زندگیوں اور صحت کو بُری طرح متاثر کیا ہے بلکہ اس کی وجہ سے اہم خدمات کی فراہمی کے سلسلے پر بھی تباہ کن اثرات مرتب ہوئے ہیں۔  ان خدمات  میں صحت، غذا، تعلیم ، پانی اور صحت و صفائی جیسی بنیادی خدمات شامل ہیں۔
اس موقع پر بات کرتے ہوئے پاکستان میں یونیسف کی نمائندہ مس عائدہ گرما نے کہا، ’’ ہم اس وقت کورونا وائرس کے خلاف جنگ کے اہم ترین مرحلے میں داخل ہوچکے ہیں۔ اس جنگ میں مارچ کے مہینے سے ہماری قیادت وزیرِ اعظم پاکستان کے    معاون خصوصی برائے صحت ڈاکٹر ظفر مرزا اور ان کے اہم شراکت دار کررہے ہیں ۔ ان کے علاوہ خدمت کے لئے وقف ہیلتھ ورکرز کا ہراول دستہ بھی کلیدی کردار ادا کرنے میں مصروفِ عمل ہے‘‘۔
انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ ’’ اس وقت جب ہم میں سے ہر ایک اپنے پیاروں کے ساتھ عید الاضحیٰ منانے کی تیاریوں میں مصروف ہے ہم پر وہ رویے اپنانا لازم ہوجاتا ہے جن کی مدد سے ہم اپنے خاندان اور قرب و جوار کے لوگوں کی زندگیاں کورونا وائرس کا پھیلاؤ روک کر محفوظ بنا سکتے ہیں۔ ہم ان رویوں پر جس
قدر سختی سے عمل کریں گے ، اتنی ہی جلدی ہم معمول کی زندگی گذارنے کے قابل ہوکر اپنے بچوں اور خاندانوں کو وہ تمام ضروری خدمات فراہم کرسکیں گے جن کی انہیں بے حد ضرورت ہے۔ ان خدمات
میں قابلِ انسداد بیماریوں سے بچاؤ کے لئے ویکسین دینا، غذائی خدمات کے ذریعے نشو و نما کی کمی کا شکار ہونے والے بچوں کو بچانا اور بچوں و نو بالغوں کو تعلیم کی مدد سے اپنا مستقبل تشکیل دینے کے قابل بناکر لوگوں کا معیارِ زندگی بہتر بنانا شامل ہیں‘‘۔
حکومتِ پاکستان یونیسف اور عالمی ادارہ صحت کے تعاون سے ملک بھر میں ان ضروری خدمات کے فراہمی کے آغاز اور ان کا تسلسل برقرار رکھنے کے عمل کو یقینی بنانے کے سلسلے میں مصروفِ عمل ہے۔ پولیو کے زیادہ خطرات کا سامنا کرنے والے اضلاع میں پولیو کے خاتمے کے لئے ویکسین پلانے کے سلسلے کا آغاز پہلے ہی ہوچکا ہے۔
پاکستان میں عالمی ادارہ صحت کی نمائندہ ڈاکٹر پالیثا گورنارتھنا ماہیپالا نے اس موقع پر  حکومتِ پاکستان کی کاوشوں کو سراہتے ہوئے کہا کہ عالمی ادارہ صحت پاکستان کی کوششوں کو سراہتا ہے کہ کووڈ 19 کے تناظر میں حکومتِ پاکستان نے اپنے شراکت داروں خاص طور پر عالمی ادارہ صحت اور یونیسف کے ساتھ مل کر ملک بھر میں صحت کی ضروری خدمات کی فراہمی کا آغاز کردیا ہے۔  پاکستان کے کئی اضلاع میں پولیو سے بچاؤ کی ویکسین پلانے کا سلسلہ ایک بار پھر کامیابی سے شروع ہوچکا ہے۔ عالمی ادارہ صحت وزیر اعظم پاکستان اور ڈاکٹر ظفر مرزا کی قیادت کو کووڈ 19 کی وبا کے دنوں میں کورونا وائرس سے جنگ کے عمل کو سراہتا ہے‘‘۔
اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل کے چئیرمین ڈاکٹر قبلہ ایاز، بین الاقوامی کرکٹ کے کھلاڑی محمد رضوان، پمز اسلام آباد میں کووڈ 19 کے فوکل پرسن ڈاکٹر نسیم اور 15 سالہ عریشہ فاطمہ نے اس موقع پر ویڈیو پیغامات ریکارڈ کئے۔ یہ پیغامات اس دوران چلائے گئے جن میں لوگوں سے درخواست کی گئی کہ وہ وائرس کے خلاف متحرک ہوکر لوگوں کی زندگیاں بچانے میں اپنا کردار ادا کریں۔
اپنے آپ کو کورونا وائرس سے بچانے کے لئے لوگوں کو چاہیے کہ وہ:
· عوامی اجتماعات سے دُور رہیں
· خریداری اور حتیٰ کہ مسجد کے لئے گھر سے نکلتے وقت ماسک پہن کر نکلیں

Young leaders tapped to invigorate UN’s climate action plans, hold leaders to account
Seven young climate activists to take formal seat at UN table in Secretary-General’s new Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change
NEW YORK, 27 July— The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres announced the names of seven young climate leaders – between the ages of 18 and 28 years old – who will advise him regularly on accelerating global action and ambition to tackle the worsening climate crisis.
The announcement marks a new effort by the United Nations to bring more young leaders into decision-making and planning processes, as the UN works to mobilize climate action as part of the COVID-19 recovery efforts.
“We are in a climate emergency. We do not have the luxury of time,” the Secretary-General said in a video announcing the establishment of the Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change. “We need urgent action now -- to recover better from COVID-19, to confront injustice and inequality and address climate disruption.”
“We have seen young people on the front lines of climate action, showing us what bold leadership looks like,” he added. “That is why I am launching my Youth Advisory Group on climate change today -- to provide perspectives, ideas and solutions that will help us scale up climate action.”
The members of the Secretary-General’s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change represent the diverse voices of young people from all regions as well as small island states.  They will offer perspectives and solutions on climate change, from science to community mobilization, from entrepreneurship to politics, and from industry to conservation.
The newly selected members of the Group, ranging from 18-28 years old, are:
Nisreen Elsaim (Sudan) is a climate activist and junior negotiator at intergovernmental climate change platforms  with experience across a range of environmental topics, and she was part of the social movement that brought about democratic change in Sudan.
Ernest Gibson (Fiji) is the co-coordinator for 350 Fiji, a regional youth-led climate change network, driven by young climate leaders.
Vladislav Kaim, (Moldova) is a young economist committed to ensuring green and decent jobs for youth, and he brings deep expertise in international trade and migration.
Sophia Kianni (United States) has helped organize nationwide strikes and has built a network of non-profits as part of the Zero Hour National Partnerships Team.
Nathan Metenier (France) is the political director at the ‘Jeunes Ambassadeurs pour le Climat’, where he helped develop the French youth climate coalition.
Paloma Costa Oliveira (Brazil) is a lawyer and human rights defender who has coordinated the youth delegations to several climate conferences.
Archana Soreng (India) is experienced in advocacy and research, and she is working to document, preserve, and promote traditional knowledge and cultural practices of indigenous communities.
The initial seven members of the Group have been chosen to give frank and fearless advice to the Secretary-General, at a time of growing urgency to hold government and corporate leaders to account on climate action.
“Our ancestors have been protecting the forest and nature over the ages through their traditional knowledge and practices. Now it is on us to be the front runners in combating the climate crisis,” Ms Soreng said.
“The climate emergency is a threat to life, and taking climate action is the only way to free our future,” Ms Oliveira said.
“Climate action is not just about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is also about: creating green jobs in a post-COVID world, preserving our health and biodiversity and protecting the poorest and most marginalised communities,” Mr Metenier said.
“As an Iranian-American, I have witnessed first hand the devastating effect climate change is having on the Middle East. It is crucial for world leaders to stand as a united front as we work to combat the climate crisis and racial injustice,” Ms Kianni said.
“Taking climate action means contributing in the most direct way possible to the great reset of global economic order, an order in which nature will reconquer its rightful place as the main safe tangible asset that will never become stranded,” Mr Kaim said.
“Climate action matters because the story I want to tell my children is of how we took on the biggest challenge the world has ever seen and we won! We won for them,” Mr Gibson said.
“Taking the right action is the greatest motivation. Keeping up our work is the only solution, and doesn't need a second thought.  With every challenge there are many opportunities, but we must do it together,” Ms Elsaim said.
The establishment of the Group builds on last year’s successful Youth Climate Summit – the first time a Secretary-General has convened a summit for young people entirely devoted to climate action. The Summit brought over 1,000 young climate champions together from more than 140 countries to share their solutions on the global stage and deliver a clear message to world leaders: we must act now to confront the climate crisis. The initiative is also aligned with the Secretary-General’s vision for the UN Youth Strategy, launched in September 2018.

VIDEO MESSAGE FOR THE LAUNCH OF THE POLICY BRIEF
“COVID-19 IN AN URBAN WORLD”
28 July 2020

Urban areas are ground zero of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 90 per cent of reported cases.
Cities are bearing the brunt of the crisis – many with strained health systems, inadequate water and sanitation services, and other challenges.
This is especially the case in poorer areas, where the pandemic has exposed deeply rooted inequalities.
But cities are also home to extraordinary solidarity and resilience.
Strangers helping each other, streets cheering in support of essential workers, local businesses donating life-saving supplies.
We have seen the best of the human spirit on display.
As we respond to the pandemic and work towards recovery, we look to our cities as hubs of community, human innovation and ingenuity.
Today, we have an opportunity to reflect and reset how we live, interact and rebuild our cities.
That is why we are launching a “Policy Brief on COVID-19 in the Urban World”.
It offers three key recommendations.
First, we need to ensure that all phases of the pandemic response tackle inequalities and long-term development deficits and safeguard social cohesion.
We must prioritise those who are the most vulnerable in our cities, including guaranteeing safe shelter for all and emergency housing to those without homes.
Access to water and sanitation is also vital.
The inadequate state of public services in many cities requires urgent attention, particularly in informal settlements.
Nearly one-quarter of the world’s urban population lives in slums.
Local governments are already taking action – from prohibiting evictions during the crisis to putting in place new clean water stations in the most vulnerable areas.
Second, we must strengthen the capacities of local governments.
This requires decisive action – and deeper cooperation between local and national authorities.
Stimulus packages and other relief should support tailored responses and boost local government capacity.
Third, we must pursue a green, resilient and inclusive economic recovery.
Many cities have created new bike lanes and pedestrian zones, reclaiming public spaces and improving mobility, safety and air quality.
By focusing on high ecological transformation and job creation, stimulus packages can steer growth towards a low-carbon, resilient pathway and advance the Sustainable Development Goals.
The rapid adoption of telecommuting illustrates how societies can transform seemingly overnight to confront urgent threats.
We must act with the same urgency and resolve to transform cities and address the climate and pollution crises.
Now is the time to rethink and reshape the urban world.
Now is the moment to adapt to the reality of this and future pandemics.
And now is our chance to recover better, by building more resilient, inclusive and sustainable cities.
Thank you.

UNICEF: An additional 6.7 million children under 5 could suffer from wasting this year due to COVID-19
As part of its Reimagine campaign, UNICEF calls for accelerated action to prevent and treat malnutrition caused by pandemic as humanitarian community appeals for $2.4 billion to improve maternal and child nutrition

NEW YORK/ISLAMABAD, 27 JULY 2020 – An additional 6.7 million children under the age of five could suffer from wasting – and therefore become dangerously undernourished – in 2020 as a result of the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF warned today.
According to an analysis published in The Lancet, 80 per cent of these children would be from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Over half would be from South Asia alone.
In Pakistan, burden of wasting (acute malnutrition) in children under five years remain very high, at 17.7% (GoP and UNICEF, 2018) above the internationally agreed-upon emergency threshold (15%). The annual burden of wasting is estimated at 5 million children.
“It’s been seven months since the first COVID-19 cases were reported and it is increasingly clear that the repercussions of the pandemic are causing more harm to children than the disease itself,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Household poverty and food insecurity rates have increased. Essential nutrition services and supply chains have been disrupted. Food prices have soared. As a result, the quality of children’s diets has gone down and malnutrition rates will go up.”
Wasting is a life-threatening form of malnutrition, which makes children too thin and weak, and puts them at greater risk of dying, poor growth, development and learning. According to UNICEF, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, 47 million children were already wasted in 2019. Without urgent action, the global number of children suffering from wasting could reach almost 54 million over the course of the year. This would bring global wasting to levels not seen this millennium.
COVID-19 will also increase other forms of malnutrition in children and women, including stunting, micronutrient deficiencies and overweight and obesity as a result of poorer diets and the disruption of nutrition services.
Pakistan is already facing triple burden of malnutrition. It has the highest numbers of stunted children in the world after India and Nigeria. Approximately 12 million children are stunted (40.2%) countrywide. Infant and Young Child Feeding practices are suboptimal with only half of the children aged under 6 months are exclusively breastfed, and only less than one in 20 children (3.6%) receive complementary feeding. Beside high undernutrition rates, overweight (9.5%) is emerging as a serious health hazard among young children, increasing from 5% in 2011 to 9.5% in 2018. Also, micronutrient deficiencies are highly prevalent among children. More than half of Pakistani children (53.7%) are anemic.
UNICEF reports from the early months of the pandemic suggest a 30 per cent overall reduction in the coverage of essential – and often life-saving – nutrition services. Pakistan too faced some challenges in the continuation of nutrition service during early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. Partial lockdowns have led to the disruption of essential health and nutrition services.
Over 250 million children globally are missing the full benefits of vitamin A supplementation due to COVID-19.  Pakistan also missed its first round of Vitamin A supplementation campaign in April 2020 due to COVID 19 outbreak leaving approximately 36 million children (6 months to 59 months) without vitamin A supplementation for first half of the year 2020.
Humanitarian agencies immediately need USD $2.4 billion to protect maternal and child nutrition in the most vulnerable countries from now until the end of the year. The heads of the four United Nations agencies appeal to governments, the public, donors and the private sector to protect children’s right to nutrition by:
· Safeguarding access to nutritious, safe and affordable diets as a cornerstone of the response to COVID-19 by protecting food producers, processors and retailers; discouraging trade bans; and designating food markets as essential services;
· Investing decisively in support for maternal and child nutrition by protecting breastfeeding, preventing the inappropriate marketing of infant formula, and securing children and women’s access to nutritious and diverse foods;
· Re-activating and scaling up services for the early detection and treatment of child wasting while expanding other life-protecting nutrition services;
· Maintaining the provision of nutritious and safe school meals by reaching vulnerable children through home delivery, take-home rations, cash or vouchers when schools are closed; and
· Expanding social protection to safeguard access to nutritious diets and essential services among the poorest and most affected households, including access to fortified foods.
UNICEF’s Reimagine campaign aims to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from becoming a lasting crisis for children, especially the most vulnerable children. Through the campaign, UNICEF is issuing an urgent appeal to parents, governments, the public, donors and the private sector to join UNICEF as we seek to respond, recover and reimagine a world currently besieged by the coronavirus:
· Respond. We must act now to stop the disease from spreading, help the sick, and protect first responders on the frontlines risking their own lives to save others.
· Recover. Even when the pandemic slows, each country will have to continue to work to mitigate the knock-on effects on children, and address the damage inflicted. Communities will also have to work together, and across borders to rebuild and prevent a return of the disease.
· Reimagine. If we have learned anything from COVID-19, it’s that our systems and policies must protect people, all the time, not just in the event of a crisis. As the world recovers from the pandemic, now is the time to lay the groundwork for building back better.
“We cannot allow children to be the overlooked victims of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Fore. “We must simultaneously think both short and long term, so that we not only address the challenges posed by the pandemic and its secondary impacts on children, but also chart a brighter future for children and young people.”

UN Women, NCSW launch Young Women in Pakistan: Status Report 2020
Empowering young women key to Pakistan’s sustainable social and economic development: Usman Dar
ISLAMABAD (July 27, 2020): “Empowering young women is key to Pakistan’s sustainable social and economic development," said Usman Dar, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Youth Affairs, while addressing at the virtual launch of Young Women in Pakistan: Status Report 2020 as the chief guest here on Monday.
The report has been launched by UN Women Pakistan and the National Commission on the Status of Women with support from the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Pakistan. Center of Gender and Policy Studies (CGaPS) provided technical support in conducting research and compiling the report. The report seeks to address knowledge gaps by identifying needs, priorities and action for empowerment of young women, and support advocacy for increased investment in young women. It looks at the status of young women in Pakistan and shows how strategic investment will accelerate progress and actions to empower them.
“The report is a great initiative for all of us to understand the challenges young women face and seek advice for informed policies and actions to address those challenges. Our government is committed to empower youth, with special focus on young women, so that the targets of Sustainable Development Goals are achieved,” said SAPM Dar while highlighting how government was determined to empower young women through a range of initiatives including Kamyab Jawan Programme, Youth Councils and Hunarmand Pakistan.
“We look forward to working in close collaboration with UN Women to ensure young women have equal access to skill development opportunities and resources,” Usman Dar said.
Khawar Mumtaz, Senior Researcher and Activist and former Chair NCSW, said, “Female youth in Pakistan has not received much policy attention and as citizens of tomorrow merit due place in policy discourse — a nation cannot hope to achieve its objectives by leaving large segment of its population behind. This report seeks to see where the issues are, as we need to have an analysis of issues first to find befitting solutions and develop frameworks to ensure young women unleash their full potential.”
Secretary NCSW Humera Azam Khan, in her remarks, said, “It is indeed a quintessential research report relevant to the present-day context, analytical in profile and insightful in its recommendations.” She thanked UN Women for supporting this very important initiative.
Earlier, Aisha Mukhtar, Country Representative a.i., UN Women Pakistan, in her opening remarks, said that Pakistan is a country with a youthful demographic profile. As a signatory to several international gender equality commitments including CEDAW and SDGs, Pakistan has a huge opportunity as well as an obligation to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment agenda and for that targeted investment in young women is critical to fully capitalize on Pakistan’s youth bulge. “In a world where youth leadership and activism are gaining importance, UN Women’s Generation Equality campaign provides a unique opportunity to youth activists and advocates in promoting a gender equal world,” Aisha Mukhtar said.
Country Representative a.i. UNDP Pakistan Aliona Niculita said, “The socioeconomic benefits of educated, healthy and empowered women are well documented but women in Pakistan are consistently at a disadvantage compared to men. The National Human Development Report of 2017 reveals that young women have very limited access to open spaces, engagement opportunities and have low labour force participation rate. Young women are in fact untapped potential of the country and we need to empower them to reduce deep-rooted inequalities which not only limit their participation in the society but also keep the country from prospering.”
Aida Orgocka, Technical Adviser UNFPA Pakistan, said, “Educating girls and getting women into the labour force will not translate into goals being met unless attention is paid to women’s reproductive health and rights and ending harmful practices, especially child marriage.” She added that UNFPA is looking forward to making use of this report for evidence-based programming.

Report Findings:
The analysis in this status report is done along three components, i.e., a) enabling environment that supports young women's economic empowerment, security, and rights through laws and policies and their reinforcement through institutions; b) enhanced economic opportunities that support young women's access to decent work, increased incomes, financial inclusion and entrepreneurship; and c) strengthening women’s agency by supporting their access to decision making and their ability to address discriminatory social and cultural norms.
· According to the report, 48 percent of young women aged 15-24 are not in education, employment or training as compared to 7 percent men. Less than 2 percent young women own physical assets. Of all young women (married or unmarried), only 3 percent own agricultural land and 2 percent own a house.
· On decision making and empowerment, 24 percent young women made decisions about their education and employment, only 1 percent could decide on their marriage alone, while 16 percent are being consulted by the family. One fourth of young women need permission to seek healthcare, while another 71 percent do not want to visit a health facility alone. Less than one-third can decide about purchasing food and clothing. 49 percent of ever married employed women reported control over their cash earning, while only 9 percent have a say in how earning of spouse is used.
· 29 percent young women experience controlling behaviors by husbands, while 44 percent of young married women and men see no harm in wife beating. 15 percent of young women experienced physical and 4 percent experienced sexual non-spousal violence, while 14 percent of currently married young women reported physical and 4 percent reported sexual spousal violence in last 12 months.
· Only 23 percent survivors sought help and 16 percent just informed close friend or family but did not seek help. 3 percent of survivors informed the police, lawyer or other help mechanisms.
· The report highlights alarming figures on child marriage. Overall more than one-fourth (28 percent) girls are married before 18 years of age. 16 percent of the young women became mothers before the age of 18 years.
· The employment status of young women tells that only 6 percent own-account workers, work in agriculture and 9 percent in non-agriculture sectors, 32 percent are paid worker, and 52 percent young women are unpaid family workers.
· 61 percent young women work in agriculture forestry and fishing, 21 percent in manufacturing industry, and 16 percent in community, social and personal services. When we talk about employment by occupations, 11 percent work as professionals, 2 percent are services and sales workers, 52 percent skilled agricultural and fishery workers, 19 percent in craft and related trades, and 13 percent young women work in unskilled occupations. 68 percent young women – 2 in 3 – are part of vulnerable employments.
· 80 percent women work without contracts.
· 75 percent of young paid female workers are earning less than minimum wage. The median wages per month are PKR 7,000 for young women, and PKR 14,000 for young men.
· Wage gap between the wages of men and women is 80 percent, one of the highest, for skilled agriculture workers, 65 percent in manufacturing industry, and 17 percent for those with BA and above education.
The report findings suggest that there is overall limited access to knowledge and skill development opportunities for youth, especially young women. Youth concerns have not been translated into comprehensive policies as most of the policies are gender blind, lacking a clear strategy to address various issues around equal economic opportunities, social development, and political participation.
The report recommends integration of sectoral policies and programmes  and removal of barriers in implementation of laws and policies on women rights; recognition and registration of agricultural workers, daily wagers and domestic workers, home based workers and self-employed females; inclusion of women’s productive and reproductive work in labour force statistics; to ensure higher completion rates for secondary and tertiary education; support girls and women to acquire non-conventional skills; focus on STEM fields; 33 percent women’s seats in local government to promote entry of young leadership from the grassroots; 33 percent women on all public and private sector boards and women’s quotas; and recognition of women 18 years and above as adults with full citizenship rights.

40 million children miss out on early education in critical pre-school year due to COVID-19
NEW YORK, 22 July 2020 – At least 40 million children worldwide have missed out on early childhood education in their critical pre-school year as COVID-19 shuttered childcare and early education facilities, according to a new research brief published today by UNICEF.
Produced by UNICEF’s Office of Research – Innocenti, the research brief looks at the state of childcare and early childhood education globally and includes an analysis of the impact of widespread COVID-19 closures of these vital family services.
“Education disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are preventing children from getting their education off to the best possible start,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Childcare and early childhood education build a foundation upon which every aspect of children’s development relies. The pandemic is putting that foundation under serious threat.”
Childcare in a global crisis: The impact of COVID-19 on work and family life notes that lockdowns have left many parents struggling to balance childcare and paid employment, with a disproportionate burden placed on women who, on average, spend more than three times longer on care and housework than men.
The closures have also exposed a deeper crisis for families of young children especially in low- and middle-income countries, many of whom were already unable to access social protection services. Childcare is essential in providing children with integrated services, affection, protection, stimulation and nutrition and, at the same time, enable them to develop social, emotional and cognitive skills.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, unaffordable, poor-quality or inaccessible childcare and early childhood education facilities forced many parents to leave young children in unsafe and unstimulating environments at a critical point in their development, with more than 35 million children under the age of five globally sometimes left without adult supervision.
Out of 166 countries, less than half provide tuition-free pre-primary programmes of at least one year, dropping to just 15 per cent among low-income countries.
Many young children who remain at home do not get the play and early learning support they need for healthy development. In 54 low- and middle-income countries with recent data, around 40 per cent of children aged between 3 and 5 years old were not receiving social-emotional and cognitive stimulation from any adult in their household.
Lack of childcare and early education options also leaves many parents, particularly mothers working in the informal sector, with no choice but to bring their young children to work. More than 9 in 10 women in Africa and nearly 7 in 10 in Asia and the Pacific work in the informal sector and have limited to no access to any form of social protection. Many parents become trapped in this unreliable, poorly paid employment, contributing to intergenerational cycles of poverty, the report says.
Access to affordable, quality childcare and early childhood education are critical for the development of families and socially cohesive societies. UNICEF advocates for accessible, affordable and quality childcare from birth to children’s entry into the first grade of school.
The research brief offers guidance on how governments and employers can improve their childcare and early childhood education policies including by enabling all children to access high-quality, age-appropriate, affordable and accessible childcare centres irrespective of family circumstances.
The guidance also outlines additional family-friendly policies including:
· Paid parental leave for all parents  so that there is no gap between the end of parental leave and the start of affordable childcare;
· Flexible work arrangements that address the needs of working parents;
· Investment in the non-family childcare workforce including training;
· Social protection systems including cash transfers that reach families working in non-formal employment.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is making a global childcare crisis even worse,” Fore said. “Families need support from their governments and their employers to weather this storm and safeguard their children’s learning and development.”

Strengthening LEAs response to COVID-19 in Pakistan
Islamabad – 23 Jul 2020: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Country Office Pakistan, in collaboration with the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) under the framework of Pakistan’s Action to Counter Terrorism (PACT) project handed over 25,000 Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).  These kits were procured with the generous financial support of the European Union. A ceremony was held at NDMA in which representatives from UNODC, EU and NACTA attended. Each kit includes a protective suite, KN-95 mask, latex gloves, face shield and a hand sanitizer in addition to a guideline note for its use.
With restrictions being eased across the country, there has been an increase in COVID-19 cases in the last few months which is posing challenges for the front-line responders including law enforcement agencies as they remain involved in both prevention and response through law and order duties, data collection, testing, tracing, and enforcing quarantine measures. Due to limited preventive gear and lack of awareness amongst Police officials in provinces we are witnessing an increase in number of confirmed cases and deaths amongst them.
As a response to COVID-19, UNODC prioritized support to the law enforcement agencies in the two provinces in agreement with NACTA and the EU. With the delivery these kits, UNODC would simultaneously launch a targeted awareness campaign to sensitize the law enforcement and criminal justice stakeholders on the risks and prevention measures against COVID-19 through printing of posters, delivery of information, education material for police stations, general public and courts, short animated videos and public service messages on social media platforms and radio stations.
In his opening remarks of the handover ceremony, Dr. Jeremy Milsom, UNODC Country Representative said that with the emergence of COVID-19 the law enforcement agencies in the country are facing unique health related challenges unlike ever before and we are pleased to have partnered with the EU and NACTA for delivering this meaningful support at this critical juncture. He also highlighted that UNODC has developed a comprehensive COVID-19 support policy document for Pakistan based on principles of partnership, inclusiveness, gender mainstreaming and promotion of human rights to ensure “no-one is left behind”.
Ms. Anne Marchal, European Union Chargé d’Affaires a.i., added that this action illustrates the EU support to Pakistan in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and its agility in repurposing on-going projects to meet the needs of the hour. In total, the EU has mobilized some 150 million Euros (26 billion PKR)  to address the short and medium term response to the Pandemic in Pakistan, by strengthening the preparedness of Pakistan’s people for its social and economic impact, with a specific focus on the most vulnerable.
As a longstanding friend and partner of Pakistan, the European Union stands side by side with Pakistan as the country faces the extraordinary challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. The EU is convinced that the global pandemic requires global solidarity and cooperation.
Mr. Asif Saifullah Paracha, Member Policy, NACTA in his remarks acknowledged the value of today’s contribution and reiterated NACTA’s commitment in facilitating such support for law enforcement agencies in the future. He also lauded the efforts of NDMA in coordinating and delivering support across the country to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19.
At the end of the handing over ceremony, Lieutenant General Muhammad Afzal, Chairman NDMA appreciated the support of EU and UNODC and highlighted upon the steps which NDMA is taking to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the country in partnership with federal and provincial stakeholders. We are glad to receive the kits here today and without any delay NDMA would ensure delivery of these kits to identified recipients in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh.
In consultation with NACTA it was agreed to distribute 10,000 kits Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police, 7500 kits to Sindh Police, 2500 kits for the prosecution and judicial officials in Sindh while the remaining 5000 to NDMA.

Sustainable Natural Resource Management is important to prevent pandemics in future, say experts
Islamabad, 21 July 2020 – The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in partnership with World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) hosted a webinar on COVID-19 and its relationship with nature – Build Back Better. More than 130 participants including experts, members from industry, academia and students attended the event. It highlighted the challenges and criticality in sustainable natural resource management. The webinar also discussed the opportunities and way forward for effective, sustainable development in Pakistan.
Speaking on the occasion, Patricia McPhillips, UNESCO Representative to Pakistan said that scientists have warned of the link between the mismanagement of biodiversity and ecosystems and the risks of transmission of infectious diseases to humans, including the risk of a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates this in a dramatic way. Voices at the global level are calling for transformations and alternatives to current environmental practices that are destroying the living fabric of the planet, creating unacceptable inequalities, and threatening our common future. She also said that during lock down in the last few months, it is observed that Co2 levels  significantly decreased. However, it was temporary. As businesses and industries are now functional again, we need to strategize and implement how we can keep the carbon emissions as low as possible.
Hammad Naqi Khan, Director General, WWF-Pakistan said that the COVID-19 pandemic is causing huge loss of life and increasing untold suffering of families due the global economic shock that is destroying jobs and livelihoods. The longer the crisis continues, the greater the threat will be to global peace, security and stability. The COVID-19 health crisis reconfirms how people and nature are interlinked, and how our negative impact on the natural world increases the risk of future pandemics. He was of the view that we must urgently recognize the links between the destruction of nature and human health, or we will soon see the next pandemic. We must curb the high risk trade and consumption of wildlife, halt deforestation and land conversion as well as manage food production sustainably. All these actions will help prevent the spillover of pathogens to humans, and also address other global risks to our society like biodiversity loss and climate change.
The panelists emphasized on the importance of natural resource management for sustainable development. Whenever natural ecosystems and biodiversity are disturbed, it creates problems.  Due to population pressure and rapid unplanned urbanization, the natural resources are under immense stress. Many epidemics started when natural ecology was disturbed by humans. Humans have to change their behavior while interacting with natural resources. Youth can play an important role and they are the next generation of conservationists. Government should be giving incentives to the construction companies on green and eco-friendly initiatives. We should be careful when dealing with scientific information as misinformation and infodemic during the last few months proved to be very misleading for the general public. Community participation in conservation with economic benefits for sustainable livelihood has proven to be a reliable and successful model. As businesses and industries are opening again, they need to focus on reducing their carbon footprint and minimize the damage to ecology. From grass root to policy level, a build back better strategy should be adopted.
Dr. Ejaz Ahmed, Director ECO Logical Ltd., Dr. Bilquees Gul, Director, Institute of Sustainable Halophyte Utilization, University of Karachi, Prof. Zabta Shinwari, Vice Chair, World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) and Dr. Babar Khan, Director (Wildlife) WWF Pakistan were panelists who spoke on the importance of sustainable environmental management. The event was moderated by Ms. Nazifa Butt, Manager Climate and Energy Program, WWF-Pakistan.
There were many questions from a highly active and interested group of online participants. From the discussion, action areas for partners’ future interventions were identified.

COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan
UN issues $10.3 billion coronavirus appeal and warns of the price of inaction
The UN’s Humanitarian Chief, Mark Lowcock, has called on G20 nations to act now or face a series of human tragedies more brutal and destructive than the direct health impacts of the virus as he released an updated US$10.3 billion appeal to fight the coronavirus in low-income and fragile countries.
Without mitigating action, the pandemic and associated global recession are set to trigger the first increase in global poverty since 1990 and push 265 million people to the point of starvation by the end of the year. Recent estimates suggest up to 6,000 children could die every day from preventable causes as a result of direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19. Meanwhile, diverted health resources could mean the annual death toll from HIV, tuberculosis and malaria doubling.
COVID-19 is now present across the globe, with more than 13 million confirmed cases and more than 580,000 deaths worldwide. Last week the first confirmed case was reported in Idlib, Syria, sparking fears of a devastating outbreak in crowded camps holding displaced people. In Yemen people’s immune systems are struggling to fight back after years of war and deprivation and about a quarter of Yemenis confirmed to have COVID-19 have died – five times the rate globally.
UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said:
“The pandemic and associated global recession are about to wreak havoc in fragile and low-income countries. The response of wealthy nations so far has been grossly inadequate and dangerously short-sighted. Failure to act now will leave the virus free to circle round the globe, undo decades of development and create a generation’s worth of tragic and exportable problems.
“It doesn’t have to be like this – this is a problem that can be fixed with money from wealthy nations and fresh thinking from the shareholders of international financial institutions and supporters of UN agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, and NGOs.
“Rich countries have thrown out the rulebook when it comes to protecting their own economies. They must apply the same exceptional measures to countries that need help. The prospect of cascading crises more brutal and destructive than anything the virus alone can do must jolt us all out of our comfort zone.”
The COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan is the international community’s primary fundraising vehicle to respond to the humanitarian impacts of the virus in low- and middle-income countries and support their efforts to fight it. It brings together appeals from WHO and other UN humanitarian agencies. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and NGO consortiums have been instrumental in helping shape the plan and deliver it, and they can access funding through it. The plan provides help and protection that prioritize the most vulnerable. This includes older people, people with disabilities, displaced people, and women and girls, given pandemics heighten existing levels of discrimination, inequality and gender-based violence.
Since the plan was first launched on 25 March, $1.7 billion in generous donor funding has been raised.
The updated plan released today includes a supplementary $300 million to bolster rapid response from NGOs, on top of their specific requirements in each country; a new famine prevention envelope of $500 million; and a sharper focus on preventing gender-based violence. With funding of $10 billion, the plan will support 63 vulnerable countries and cover the global transport system necessary to deliver the relief.
The COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan operates alongside other complementary initiatives to protect the most vulnerable people. The initiatives include the Red Cross and Red Crescent appeals; the Global Fund’s programme to safeguard a decade of work to combat malaria, tuberculosis and HIV; the Vaccine Alliance’s (Gavi) work to keep future generations free from measles, polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases; and the UN Women’s Gender in Humanitarian Action programme. All require urgent funding.

National Guidelines for Management of COVID-19 in Children Launched during National Training of Trainers
July 16, 2020 – Islamabad: The National Guidelines for Management of COVID-19 in Children, developed through collaborative efforts of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Pakistan Paediatric Association (PPA), under the leadership of Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MoNHSR&C), were launched here today, during a three-day National Training of Trainers.
The National Training of Trainers, attended by eminent doctors and professors, is the first of a series of trainings for Paediatricians, Family Practitioners and General Physicians from across the country. Further trainings will be held in various cities over the next few months.
“Continued isolation poses a real risk to our children not only in terms of their mental and physical health but also to their educational development,” said Dr. Atiya Aabroo, Deputy Director Programmes MoNHSR&C. “With ongoing discussions around opening of schools over next few months, it is pivotal to make all necessary arrangements and equip the physicians with adequate knowledge on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of CoVID 19 in children aged 0-18 years.”
The Guidelines which have been uploaded on the websites of the MoNHSR&C and the PPA, aim to help health practitioners caring for children, to acquire required knowledge and skills on the management of COVID-19. Display boards with the algorithms of treatment are being disseminated to all Paediatricians across the country.
“COVID 19 has emerged as a health crisis across the globe and Pakistan is no exception,” said Mr. Tajudeen Oyewale, UNICEF Deputy Representative in Pakistan. “We need to address this challenge as a priority in addition to several other already existing challenges our health system is facing. These include fast growing population, stagnant newborn mortality, other communicable diseases, growing burden of the non-communicable illnesses, effects of climate change and natural disasters.”
“It is amazing to see that such a large group of eminent Pediatricians from across the country have gathered here to avail this opportunity of interactive learning. UNICEF remains committed to continuing its support to the Ministry of Health and work closely with professional associations for betterment of mothers and children. I extend my deepest appreciation to all the partners for their support in keeping maternal and child health issues high at the national health agenda.”
Speaking on the occasion, Professor Dr. Gohar Rehman, President Pakistan Paediatric Association, highly appreciated the quality of the training conducted and termed it to be of international standards.

The main contributors for development of the Guidelines include Aga Khan University; Infectious Disease subgroup of Pakistan Paediatric Association; King Edward Medical University; The Children’s Hospital and Institute of Child Health and UNICEF.

WHO and UNICEF warn of a decline in vaccinations during COVID-19
WHO and UNICEF call for immediate efforts to vaccinate all children as new data shows that, before the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine coverage stalled at 85 per cent for nearly a decade, with 14 million unvaccinated infants yearly

GENEVA/NEW YORK, 16 July 2020 – The World Health Organization and UNICEF warned today of an alarming decline in the number of children receiving life-saving vaccines around the world. This is due to disruptions in the delivery and uptake of immunization services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to new data by WHO and UNICEF, these disruptions threaten to reverse hard-won progress to reach more children and adolescents with a wider range of vaccines, which has already been hampered by a decade of stalling coverage.
The latest data on vaccine coverage estimates from WHO and UNICEF for 2019 shows that improvements such as the expansion of the HPV vaccine to 106 countries and greater protection for children against more diseases are in danger of lapsing. For example, preliminary data for the first four months of 2020 points to a substantial drop in the number of children completing three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3). This is the first time in 28 years that the world could see a reduction in DTP3 coverage – the marker for immunization coverage within and across countries.
“Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools in the history of public health, and more children are now being immunized than ever before,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “But the pandemic has put those gains at risk. The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunizations could be far greater than COVID-19 itself. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Vaccines can be delivered safely even during the pandemic, and we are calling on countries to ensure these essential life-saving programmes continue.”
COVID-19 disruptions
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns were or are at risk of being cancelled, which could result in further outbreaks in 2020 and beyond. According to a new UNICEF, WHO and Gavi pulse survey,  conducted in collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, three quarters of the 82 countries that responded reported COVID-19 related disruptions in their immunization programmes as of May 2020.
The reasons for disrupted services vary. Even when services are offered, people are either unable to access them because of reluctance to leave home, transport interruptions, economic hardships, restrictions on movement, or fear of being exposed to people with COVID-19. Many health workers are also unavailable because of restrictions on travel or redeployment to COVID response duties as well as a lack of protective equipment.
“COVID-19 has made previously routine vaccination a daunting challenge,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “We must prevent a further deterioration in vaccine coverage and urgently resume vaccination programs before children’s lives are threatened by other diseases. We cannot trade one health crisis for another.”
Stagnating global coverage rate
Progress on immunization coverage was stalling before COVID-19 hit, at 85 per cent for DTP3 and measles vaccines. The likelihood that a child born today will be fully vaccinated with all the globally recommended vaccines by the time she reaches the age of 5 is less than 20 per cent.
In 2019, nearly 14 million children missed out on life-saving vaccines such as measles and DTP3. Most of these children live in Africa and are likely to lack access to other health services. Two-thirds of them are concentrated in 10 middle- and low-income countries: Angola, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Philippines. Children in middle-income countries account for an increasing share of the burden.
Progress and challenges, by country and region
There has been some progress. Regional coverage for the third dose of DTP in South Asia has increased by 12 percentage points over the last 10 years, notably across India, Nepal and Pakistan. However, that hard-won progress could be undone by COVID-19 related disruptions. Countries that had recorded significant progress, such as Ethiopia and Pakistan, are now also at risk of backsliding if immunization services are not restored as soon as feasible.
The situation is especially concerning for Latin America and the Caribbean, where historically high coverage has slipped over the last decade. In Brazil, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela, immunization coverage plummeted by at least 14 percentage points since 2010. These countries are now also confronting moderate to severe COVID19-related disruptions.
As the global health community attempts to recover lost ground due to COVID-19 related disruptions, UNICEF and WHO are supporting countries in their efforts to reimagine immunization and build back better by:
· Restoring services so countries can safely deliver routine immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic, by adhering to hygiene and physical distancing recommendations and providing protective equipment to health workers;
· Helping health workers communicate actively with caregivers to explain how services have been reconfigured to ensure safety;
· Rectifying coverage and immunity gaps;
· Expanding routine services to reach missed communities, where some of the most vulnerable children live.

About the data
2019 IMMUNIZATION COVERAGE ESTIMATES
Every year, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) produce a new round of immunization coverage estimates for 195 countries, enabling a critical assessment of how well we are doing in reaching every child with life-saving vaccines.  In addition to producing the immunization coverage estimates for 2019, the WHO and UNICEF estimation process revises the entire historical series of immunization data with the latest available information. The 2019 revision covers 39 years of coverage estimates, from 1980 to 2019. DTP3 coverage is used as an indicator to assess the proportion of children vaccinated and is calculated for children under one year of age. The estimated number of vaccinated children are calculated using population data provided by the 2019 World Population Prospects (WPP) from the UN. Fact sheet.
IMMUNIZATION PULSE SURVEY, JUNE 2020
The new UNICEF, WHO and Gavi pulse survey was conducted in collaboration with US Centers for Disease Control, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in June 2020. Respondents from 82 countries, including 14 with lower than 80 per cent vaccination coverage rates in 2019, reported on disruptions in immunization services due to COVID-19 as of May 2020.  The online immunization pulse survey received responses from 260 immunization experts, including representatives of Ministries of Health, academia and global health organizations across 82 countries. A previous pulse poll, conducted in April received 801 responses from 107 countries, showed that disruption to the routine immunization programs were already widespread and affected all regions. 64 per cent of countries represented in that poll indicated that routine immunizations had been disrupted or even suspended.

The World Health Organization provides global leadership in public health within the United Nations system. Founded in 1948, WHO works with 194 Member States, across six regions and from more than 150 offices, to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. Our goal for 2019-2023 is to ensure that a billion more people have universal health coverage, to protect a billion more people from health emergencies, and provide a further billion people with better health and wellbeing.

Regional Consultative Technical Meeting on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on agriculture and food security
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations today convened a virtual meeting to discuss resilience building to multiple shocks and addressing COVID-19 in fragile contexts. The virtual dialogue, which brought together over 300 participants from 29 countries, was held as part of a series of Virtual Regional Consultative Technical Meetings (RCTM) to discuss the response to the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on agriculture and food security in the Near East and North African Region.
Federal Minister for National Food Security & Research, Government of Pakistan presented Pakistan’s perspective on building resilience to crises. “In order to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on Pakistan’s economy, the Government of Pakistan has announced economic relief and stimulus package of PKR 1.24 trillion as part of its immediate response to COVID-19, which will also contribute to agriculture sector and agriculture value chains through its linkages with other sectors,” said Syed Fakhar Imam, Federal Minister for National Food Security & Research, Government of Pakistan while delivering the keynote speech. “Measures taken by the Government are expected to protect and enhance agriculture and value chains with attention on building resilience to future shocks in a country prone to natural hazards. The Government of Pakistan is thankful to FAO for its continued support and collaboration on strengthening the agriculture sector and improving food security in Pakistan,” he further added.
“FAO has a long-standing partnership with the Government of Pakistan, and continues to play its role in helping communities of Pakistan find food systems-based solutions to cope with disasters. FAO is also working together with the Ministry of National Food Security & Research to introduce a range of initiatives to strengthen resilience to shocks,” said Minà Dowlatchahi, FAO Representative in Pakistan.
Mr. Aamer Irshad, Assistant FAO Representative for Programme highlighted that, “regional platforms provided by FAO such as the Regional Consultative Technical Meetings allow countries and regions to benefit from each other experience sharing to improve their response to compounded shocks and resilience building,”
In recent years, a sequence of disasters have imposed harsh consequences on agriculture, food security and the livelihoods of millions of vulnerable rural communities, farmers and pastoralists, in Pakistan. The dual threat of COVID-19 and the current locust upsurge has further intensified the existing food and nutrition insecurity.
Early assessment and action to support the food system and vulnerable livelihoods of Pakistan is necessary to avoid the deep impacts of COVID-19 on food security, livelihoods, markets and the economy within the country. FAO is working closely with the Ministry of National Food Security and Research to support the Government of Pakistan in coping with the series of challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and the current locust upsurge.

As more go hungry and malnutrition persists, achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 in doubt, UN report warns  
Securing healthy diets for the billions who cannot afford them would save trillions in costs
Rome, 13 July 2020 – More people are going hungry, an annual study by the United Nations has found. Tens of millions have joined the ranks of the chronically undernourished over the past five years, and countries around the world continue to struggle with multiple forms of malnutrition.
The latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, published today, estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019 – up by 10 million from 2018, and by nearly 60 million in five years. High costs and low affordability also mean billions cannot eat healthily or nutritiously. The hungry are most numerous in Asia, but expanding fastest in Africa. Across the planet, the report forecasts, the COVID-19 pandemic could tip over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020. (Flare-ups of acute hunger in the pandemic context may see this number escalate further at times.)
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World is the most authoritative global study tracking progress towards ending hunger and malnutrition. It is produced jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Writing in the Foreword, the heads of the five agencies[i] warn that “five years after the world committed to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, we are still off track to achieve this objective by 2030.”
The hunger numbers explained
In this edition, critical data updates for China and other populous countries[ii] have led to a substantial cut in estimates of the global number of hungry people, to the current 690 million. Nevertheless, there has been no change in the trend. Revising the entire hunger series back to the year 2000 yields the same conclusion: after steadily diminishing for decades, chronic hunger slowly began to rise in 2014 and continues to do so.
Asia remains home to the greatest number of undernourished (381 million). Africa is second (250 million), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million). The global prevalence of undernourishment – or overall percentage of hungry people – has changed little at 8.9 percent, but the absolute numbers have been rising since 2014. This means that over the last five years, hunger has grown in step with the global population.
This, in turn, hides great regional disparities: in percentage terms, Africa is the hardest hit region and becoming more so, with 19.1 percent of its people undernourished. This is more than double the rate in Asia (8.3 percent) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (7.4 percent). On current trends, by 2030, Africa will be home to more than half of the world’s chronically hungry.
The pandemic’s toll
As progress in fighting hunger stalls, the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems – understood as all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution and consumption of food. While it is too soon to assess the full impact of the lockdowns and other containment measures, the report estimates that at a minimum, another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, may go hungry in 2020 as a result of the economic recession triggered by COVID-19.[iii] The setback throws into further doubt the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger).
Unhealthy diets, food insecurity and malnutrition
Overcoming hunger and malnutrition in all its forms (including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity) is about more than securing enough food to survive: what people eat – and especially what children eat – must also be nutritious.  Yet a key obstacle is the high cost of nutritious foods and the low affordability of healthy diets for vast numbers of families.
The report presents evidence that a healthy diet costs far more than US$ 1.90/day, the international poverty threshold. It puts the price of even the least expensive healthy diet at five times the price of filling stomachs with starch only. Nutrient-rich dairy, fruits, vegetables and protein-rich foods (plant and animal-sourced) are the most expensive food groups globally.
The latest estimates are that a staggering 3 billion people or more cannot afford a healthy diet. In sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, this is the case for 57 percent of the population – though no region, including North America and Europe, is spared. Partly as a result, the race to end malnutrition appears compromised. According to the report, in 2019, between a quarter and a third of children under five (191 million) were stunted or wasted – too short or too thin. Another 38 million under-fives were overweight. Among adults, meanwhile, obesity has become a global pandemic in its own right.
A call to action
The report argues that once sustainability considerations are factored in, a global switch to healthy diets would help check the backslide into hunger while delivering enormous savings. It calculates that such a shift would allow the health costs associated with unhealthy diets, estimated to reach US$ 1.3 trillion a year in 2030, to be almost entirely offset; while the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, estimated at US$ 1.7 trillion, could be cut by up to three-quarters.[iv]
The report urges a transformation of food systems to reduce the cost of nutritious foods and increase the affordability of healthy diets. While the specific solutions will differ from country to country, and even within them, the overall answers lie with interventions along the entire food supply chain, in the food environment, and in the political economy that shapes trade, public expenditure and investment policies. The study calls on governments to mainstream nutrition in their approaches to agriculture; work to cut cost-escalating factors in the production, storage, transport, distribution and marketing of food – including by reducing inefficiencies and food loss and waste; support local small-scale producers to grow and sell more nutritious foods, and secure their access to markets; prioritize children’s nutrition as the category in greatest need; foster behaviour change through education and communication; and embed nutrition in national social protection systems and investment strategies.
The heads of the five UN agencies behind the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World declare their commitment to support this momentous shift, ensuring that it unfolds “in a sustainable way, for people and the planet.”

FAO distributes Kharif crop packages in the newly merged Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Peshawar: The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, with support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), is distributing Kharif crop packages to 16 000 vulnerable households to strengthen agriculture-based livelihoods in the tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Under a similar intervention, the United States Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (US-INL) is supporting distribution of Kharif crop packages amongst 2 000 people to help these communities resume agricultural production.
The packages consist of 25 kilograms of certified maize seeds, 1.5 kilograms of sunflower seeds, 5 kilograms of red beans and 10 kilograms of French beans for each household. The distribution is being conducted in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and District Administration and in strict compliance with the COVID-19 prevention protocols.
With the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affecting the farming community, FAO is stepping up efforts to protect livelihoods of food producers and all food chain workers by providing quality agri-input packages to beneficiaries so that the season bound agriculture activities are not disrupted. Through its interventions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s newly merged districts, FAO has introduced high value crops and agriculture value chains to create sustainable livelihoods for the farmers.
“This intervention has been timely in providing support to smallholder farmers in these vulnerable areas, helping build sustainable food system and ensuring food security to mitigate the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on agriculture. Providing farmers with a mix of high quality certified seeds such as maize, sunflower and beans for the Kharif season crop will also contribute to ensuring some dietary diversification as well as supply to keep markets and food supply chains going,” said Mina Dowlatchahi, FAO Representative in Pakistan.
Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, FAO projects are playing a vital role in ensuring food security, reducing poverty and bringing economic stabilization in the newly merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In addition to distribution of various agriculture packages to vulnerable smallholder farmers, FAO through its farmer field schools and field training activities is also arranging regular sessions for local farmer communities to raise awareness on safety and hygiene measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The Ministry of Climate Change and UNDP celebrate Pakistan’s achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action
July 13, 2020, Islamabad— The Ministry of Climate Change and UNDP hosted a media briefing today to celebrate Pakistan’s achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action, well before the 2030 deadline. The recent release of the 2020 Sustainable Development Report shows that out of 17 goals, Pakistan has achieved the Climate Action goal under which countries are required to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
The event was attended by the Prime Minister’s Advisor on Climate Change, Malik Amin Aslam, Additional Secretary Ministry of Climate Change, Joudat Ayaz, Deputy Resident Representative UNDP Pakistan, Aliona Niculita, Assistant Resident Representative Environment & Climate Change Unit UNDP, Amanullah Khan and additional UNDP and Ministry of Climate Change representatives.
The Prime Minister’s Advisor on Climate Change, Mr. Malik Amin Aslam said at the occasion,“ I would like to highlight that the SDGs are not 17 individual goals, but are rather interconnected. Progress in one goal can both depend on and unlock progress in another – and interconnected goals require an interconnected approach. Our efforts in the realm of climate action can surely help create a positive impact on other goals and countries. Pakistan is the 5th most vulnerable country in the world to climate change. We are committed to this, and have started a number of projects over the past two years, an example being GLOF-II (Glacial Lake Outburst Floods II), where we are working to establish early warning systems and train communities to deal with glacial lake outburst floods.”
“UNDP Pakistan and the Ministry of Climate Change has a long-standing strategic partnership and we are happy to say that our continued collaboration has borne fruit for the people of Pakistan,” said Ms. Aliona Niculita, Deputy Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan, at the media briefing. “With strong political will, increased investment, use of technology and mutual collaboration, it is evident that we can limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius or less, above the pre-industrial level. This will require collective action, continuous efforts, and meaningful and effective partnerships.”
Across the globe, UNDP has a clear mandate to support countries that are vulnerable to the effects of Climate Change and to help them in achieving the desired goals. In Pakistan, UNDP provided technical support to the Ministry of Climate Change in the achievement of this goal. UNDP has supported the implementation of various national level projects under multiple international environmental protocols thus ensuring that the targets were met as per the government’s commitments. One of the flagship outputs of this partnership is Pakistan’s first National Climate Change Policy, which was developed by the Ministry of Climate Change with the support of UNDP in 2012 followed by a number of flagship projects in the arena of Climate Action.
The Sustainable Development Goals were adopted to address risks across economic, social, and environmental domains. These include poverty, widening inequalities in income and access to decent lives, continued high disease burdens, and massive environmental disasters. UNDP stands committed to work together with the Government of Pakistan, civil society, national partners, and the people of Pakistan to help find solutions to persistent development challenges, including those related to Climate Change.

UNESCO ResiliArt Debate on Impact of Covid-19 on Creative Arts & Crafts in Pakistan
ResiliArt is a global movement, initiated by UNESCO at the  beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The movement is built around a series of virtual debates with experienced professionals in the creative and cultural industries, to raise awareness of the devastating impact of this global health crisis on arts and culture around the world.
The second session of ResiliArt Pakistan was held on 8 July 2020, and focused on the impact of COVID-19 on creative arts, crafts, publishing, cultural events, and tourism in Pakistan. Moderated by Moneeza Hashmi, the panel included professionals from both public and private institutions, including Salima Hashmi – Artist, Educationist and Chairperson Faiz Foundation Trust; Kamran Lashari – Director General, Walled City Lahore Authority; Zulfiqar Ali Zulfi – Director Arts & Culture, Lahore Arts Council; Waqas Malik – Program Manager, Punjab Tourism for Economic Growth Project; Tanya Sani – Director Art & Culture, Punjab Council of the Arts; Ayesha Noorani – Founder Member Daachi Foundation; and Ali Kamran from Sang-e-Meel Publications.
Director UNESCO Pakistan, Patricia McPhillips opened the discussion and spoke of how the diverse heritage of Pakistan provides a fertile base for cultural and creative industries, with great potential for sustainable and responsible tourism. She highlighted some of the work UNESCO is doing in Pakistan at present, and expressed her hope that the ResiliArt debates will help policymakers to better understand the needs of artists at this time, assess the viability of ongoing relief efforts, and also provide valuable guidance into devising the way forward.
The ensuing discussion highlighted how art educators need to rethink teaching methods in this era of online teaching, where collaborative studio work is not possible. Panelists outlined how art councils are making music and art classes available online, and offering platforms for young artists to sell their work online. It was emphasized that there is a need to establish mechanisms to empower artisans and craftspeople to use technology to bring their work to a wider audience. On a lighter note, the panelists shared how forced confinement has allowed many artists, musicians, and writers to push the limits of their creativity and explore their craft in new ways. The session concluded with the call to action to explore, innovate, and experiment with new ideas to support the vulnerable arts community in Pakistan.
The event was streamed live on the UNESCO Pakistan Facebook page.

UNHCR calls for additional investments in education, livelihoods for Afghan refugees
ISLAMABAD, 7 July 2020: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency convened a global high-level meeting to seek practical support and galvanize action in support of durable solutions for Afghan refugees.
The virtual high-level meeting was convened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Filippo Grandi, and was attended by ministerial-level officials from the Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. Representatives from key countries and multilateral organizations also participated.
The aim of the high-level meeting was to seek support for programmes and projects under the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees (SSAR). The Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, together with UNHCR, launched a portfolio of projects in education, health and livelihoods, as well as energy, water and community infrastructure.
At the Global Refugee Forum held in Geneva in December last year, the three governments, together with UNHCR, launched a “Support Platform” in order to generate additional resources for refugee-hosting countries and for sustainable return and successful reintegration inside Afghanistan.
Speaking during the virtual high-level meeting, the UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Noriko Yoshida, said that additional support through this platform aims to help ease pressure on refugee-hosting countries and support Afghanistan despite its challenges.
“The world must come forward and shoulder the burden, as Pakistan and Iran have done in hosting 90 per cent of Afghan refugees for over four decades,” said Ms. Yoshida. She added, “Education and livelihoods, in particular, give Afghan refugees real hope for the future”.
The initiative seeks strategic investments in education, health, training and youth empowerment as a priority as nearly half the Afghan population of 37 million are under 15 years of age. In Pakistan, some 64 per cent of registered Afghan refugees are below the age of 25.
On the occasion, the Federal Minister for States and Frontier Regions, Mr. Muhammad Mehboob Sultan, urged key humanitarian and development donors to invest in these important projects. He stressed, however, that this support should be additional and not substitute traditional funding.
He said that there has been a significant decline in funding for refugee-hosting countries. “The international community must play its role in shouldering the burden and responsibility,” he said.
He noted that Pakistan is committed to ensure the voluntary, safe and dignified nature of return to Afghanistan and added that there is dire need to support the Priority Areas of Return and Reintegration (PARRs) in Afghanistan, which will help the sustainable return and reintegration of Afghan refugees.
Pakistan continues to host 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees. Since 2002, some 4.4 million Afghan refugees have returned to Afghanistan under the UNHCR-facilitated voluntary repatriation operation.

UNAIDS report on the global AIDS epidemic shows that 2020 targets will not be met because of deeply unequal success; COVID-19 risks blowing HIV progress way off course
Missed targets have resulted in 3.5 million more HIV infections and 820 000 more AIDS-related deaths since 2015 than if the world was on track to meet the 2020 targets. In addition, the response could be set back further, by 10 years or more, if the COVID-19 pandemic results in severe disruptions to HIV services.
GENEVA, 6 July 2020—A new report by UNAIDS shows remarkable, but highly unequal, progress, notably in expanding access to antiretroviral therapy. Because the achievements have not been shared equally within and between countries, the global HIV targets set for 2020 will not be reached. The report, Seizing the moment, warns that even the gains made could be lost and progress further stalled if we fail to act. It highlights just how urgent it is for countries to double down and act with greater urgency to reach the millions still left behind.
“Every day in the next decade decisive action is needed to get the world back on track to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030,” said Winnie Byanyima, the Executive Director of UNAIDS. “Millions of lives have been saved, particularly the lives of women in Africa. The progress made by many needs to be shared by all communities in all countries. Stigma and discrimination and widespread inequalities are major barriers to ending AIDS. Countries need to listen to the evidence and step up to their human rights responsibilities.”
Fourteen countries have achieved the 90–90–90 HIV treatment targets (90% of people living with HIV know their HIV status, of whom 90% are on antiretroviral treatment and of whom 90% are virally supressed), including Eswatini, which has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world, at 27% in 2019, and which has now surpassed the targets to achieve 95–95–95.
Millions of lives and new infections have been saved by the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy. However, 690 000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses last year and 12.6 million of the 38 million people living with HIV were not accessing the life-saving treatment.
“We cannot rest on our successes, nor be discouraged by setbacks. We must ensure that no one is left behind. We must close the gaps. We are aiming for 100–100–100,” said Ambrose Dlamini, the Prime Minister of Eswatini.
The world is far behind in preventing new HIV infections. Some 1.7 million people were newly infected with the virus, more than three times the global target. There has been progress in eastern and southern Africa, where new HIV infections have reduced by 38% since 2010. This is in stark contrast to eastern Europe and central Asia, which has seen a staggering 72% rise in new HIV infections since 2010. New HIV infections have also risen in the Middle East and North Africa, by 22%, and by 21% in Latin America.
Seizing the moment shows unequal progress, with too many vulnerable people and populations left behind. Around 62% of new HIV infections occurred among key populations and their sexual partners, including gay men and other men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs and people in prison, despite them constituting a very small proportion of the general population.
Stigma and discrimination, together with other social inequalities and exclusion, are proving to be key barriers. Marginalized populations who fear judgement, violence or arrest struggle to access sexual and reproductive health services, especially those related to contraception and HIV prevention. Stigma against people living with HIV is still commonplace. At least 82 countries criminalize some form of HIV transmission, exposure or non-disclosure, sex work is criminalized in at least 103 countries and at least 108 countries criminalize the consumption or possession of drugs for personal use.
Women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa continue to be the most affected and accounted for 59% of all new HIV infections in the region in 2019, with 4500 adolescent girls and young women between 15 and 24 years old becoming infected with HIV every week. Young women accounted for 24% of new HIV infections in 2019, despite making up only 10% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa.
However, where HIV services are comprehensively provided, HIV transmission levels are reduced significantly. In Eswatini, Lesotho and South Africa, a high coverage of combination prevention options, including social and economic support for young women and high levels of treatment coverage and viral suppression for previously unreached populations, have narrowed inequality gaps and driven down the incidence of new HIV infections.
The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously impacted the AIDS response and could disrupt it more. A six-month complete disruption in HIV treatment could cause more than 500 000 additional deaths in sub-Saharan Africa over the next year (2020–2021), bringing the region back to 2008 AIDS mortality levels. Even a 20% disruption could cause an additional 110 000 deaths.
“Those of us who survived HIV and fought for life and access to treatment and care cannot afford losing the gains that took so much effort to win. In some Latin American countries we are seeing how HIV resources, medicines, medical staff and equipment are being moved to the fight against COVID-19,” said Gracia Violeta Ross, President of the Bolivian Network of People Living with HIV. “Some good lessons and practices of the HIV response, such as meaningful participation and accountability, are being ignored. We will not allow HIV to be left behind.”
To fight the colliding epidemics of HIV and COVID-19, UNAIDS and partners are leading a global call for a People’s Vaccine for COVID-19, which has been signed by more than 150 world leaders and experts demanding that all vaccines, treatments and tests be patent-free, mass produced and distributed fairly and free for all.
UNAIDS is also urging countries to increase investments in both diseases. In 2019, funding for HIV fell by 7% from 2017, to US$ 18.6 billion. This setback means that funding is 30% short of the US$ 26.2 billion needed to effectively respond to HIV in 2020.
“We cannot have poor countries at the back of the queue. It should not depend on the money in your pocket or the colour of your skin to be protected against these deadly viruses,” said Ms Byanyima. “We cannot take money from one disease to treat another. Both HIV and COVID-19 must be fully funded if we are to avoid massive loss of life.”

The International Day of Parliamentarism is a timely occasion to honour the pivotal role of Parliaments in giving people a voice and influence to shape policy.
As a former Parliamentarian, I am deeply conscious of the responsibility and privilege of representing people and delivering on their aspirations.
Parliaments have a special duty to advance human rights and promote sustainable development.
More than ever, the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us of these vital tasks.
As the world responds to the pandemic, we see the critical importance of adequate health systems, robust social safety networks, and equitable economic growth that generates decent jobs.
We also see the most vulnerable in our societies, especially women, bearing the greatest burden.
Inequalities, stigmas, divisions and the fragilities of our world have multiplied before our eyes.
We must act together to rebuild a more equal, resilient and greener future for all.  I urge national parliaments everywhere to play their full part in advancing sustainable, inclusive responses. This should include, in collaboration with civil society, national action plans against racial discrimination.
At the same time, let’s remember that no nation can succeed on its own.
Let us seize every opportunity to reshape and secure our common future, take ambitious climate action and place human rights and human dignity at the core of our work.
Thank you.

This year’s message for the International Day for Biological Diversity is clear.
Our solutions are in nature.
Preserving and sustainably managing biodiversity is necessary for mitigating climate disruption, guaranteeing water and food security and even preventing pandemics.
COVID-19 –which emanated from the wild -- has shown how human health is intimately connected with our relationship to the natural world.
As we encroach on nature and deplete vital habitats, increasing numbers of species are at risk.
That includes humanity and the future we want.
As we seek to build back better from the current crisis, let us work together to preserve biodiversity so we can achieve our Sustainable Development Goals.
That is how we will protect health and well-being for generations to come.

COVID-19: Human development on course to decline this year for the first time since 1990
Concerted action with a focus on equity could still limit the impacts of this unprecedented crisis: closing the digital divide would reduce by more than two-thirds the number of children currently not learning because of school closures.
New York, 20 May 2020 – Global human development – which can be measured as a combination of the world’s education, health and living standards – could decline this year for the first time since the concept was introduced in 1990, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) warned today.
“The world has seen many crises over the past 30 years, including the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-09. Each has hit human development hard but, overall, development gains accrued globally year-on-year,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. “COVID-19 – with its triple hit to health, education, and income – may change this trend.”
Declines in fundamental areas of human development are being felt across most countries - rich and poor - in every region.
COVID-19’s global death toll has exceeded 300,000 people, while the global per capita income this year is expected to fall by four per cent.
With school closures, UNDP estimates of the “effective out-of-school rate”—the percentage of primary school-age children, adjusted to reflect those without Internet access—indicate that 60 per cent of children are not getting an education, leading to global levels not seen since the 1980s.
The combined impact of these shocks could signify the largest reversal in human development on record.
This is not counting other significant effects, for instance, in the progress towards gender equality. The negative impacts on women and girls span economic - earning and saving less and greater job insecurity -, reproductive health, unpaid care work and gender-based violence.
COVID-19: a magnifying glass for inequalities
The drop in human development is expected to be much higher in developing countries that are less able to cope with the pandemic’s social and economic fallout than richer nations.
In education, with schools closed and stark divides in access to online learning, UNDP estimates show that 86 percent of children in primary education are now effectively out-of-school in countries with low human development—compared with just 20 percent in countries with very high human development.
But with more equitable Internet access, - where countries close the gap with leaders in their development group, something feasible – the current gaps in education could close.
Determined, equity-focused interventions can help economies and societies rally, mitigating the far-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“This crisis shows that if we fail to bring equity into the policy toolkit, many will fall further behind. This is particularly important for the ‘new necessities’ of the 21st century, such as access to the Internet, which is helping us to benefit from tele-education, tele-medicine, and to work from home,” says Pedro Conceição, Director of the Human Development Report Office at UNDP.
Implementing equity-focused approaches would be affordable. For instance, closing the gap in access to the Internet for low- and middle-income countries is estimated to cost just one per cent of the extraordinary fiscal support packages the world has so far committed to respond to COVID-19.
The importance of equity is emphasized in the United Nations’ framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19 crisis, which sets out a green, gender-equal, good governance baseline from which to build a ‘new normal”. It recommends five priority steps to tackle the complexity of this crisis: protecting health systems and services; ramping up social protection; protecting jobs, small- and medium-sized businesses and informal sector workers; making macroeconomic policies work for everyone; and promoting peace, good governance and trust to build social cohesion. UNDP calls on the international community to rapidly invest in the ability of developing countries to follow these steps.

PRESS RELEASE
UNITED NATIONS LAUNCHES GLOBAL INITIATIVE TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION
NEW YORK, 21 MAY 2020—Today the United Nations is launching ‘Verified’, an initiative to combat the growing scourge of COVID-19 misinformation by increasing the volume and reach of trusted, accurate information.
“We cannot cede our virtual spaces to those who traffic in lies, fear and hate,” said UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, who announced the initiative. “Misinformation spreads online, in messaging apps and person to person. Its creators use savvy production and distribution methods. To counter it, scientists and institutions like the United Nations need to reach people with accurate information they can trust.”
Verified, led by the UN Department for Global Communications (DGC), will provide information around three themes: science – to save lives; solidarity – to promote local and global cooperation; and solutions – to advocate for support to impacted populations. It will also promote recovery packages that tackle the climate crisis and address the root causes of poverty, inequality and hunger.
The initiative is calling on people around the world to sign up to become “information volunteers” to share trusted content to keep their families and communities safe and connected. Described as digital first responders, the
volunteers will receive a daily feed of verified content optimized for social sharing with simple, compelling messaging that either directly counters misinformation or fills an information void.
DGC will partner with UN agencies and UN country teams, influencers, civil society, business and media organizations to distribute trusted, accurate content and work with social media platforms to root out hate and harmful assertions about COVID-19.
“In many countries the misinformation surging across digital channels is impeding the public health response and stirring unrest. There are disturbing efforts to exploit the crisis to advance nativism or to target minority groups, which could worsen as the strain on societies grows and the economic and social fallout kicks in,” Melissa Fleming, UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, said. “The Verified initiative will also work to address this trend with hopeful content that celebrates local acts of humanity, the contributions of refugees and migrants, and makes the case for global cooperation.”
The initiative is a collaboration with Purpose, one of the world’s leading social mobilization organizations. It is supported by the IKEA Foundation and Luminate.

Patricia Atkinson, the IKEA Foundation’s Chief Programmes Officer, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis. The IKEA Foundation is proud to be supporting Verified -- an initiative aiming to make sure everyone has access to the trusted science and advice they need to keep their family and loved ones safe.”
Nishant Lalwani, Managing Director of Luminate, added: “COVID-19 has provided a stark reminder that access to accurate, trusted information can be the difference between fear and resilience, division and unity, and even life
and death. We are proud to be supporting Verified and its work to tackle the coronavirus ‘infodemic’ by rapidly spreading reliable, science-based information to protect people and communities around the world.”

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
As COVID-19 spreads across the continent, Africa has responded swiftly to the pandemic, and as of now reported cases are lower than feared.  Even so, much hangs in the balance.
In recent years Africans have done much to advance the well-being of the continent’s people.  Economic growth has been strong.  The digital revolution has taken hold.  A free trade area has been agreed.
But the pandemic threatens African progress.  It will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.  Already, demand for Africa’s commodities, tourism and remittances are declining.  The opening of the trade zone has been pushed back – and millions could be pushed into extreme poverty.
The virus has taken more than 2500 African lives.  Vigilance and preparedness are critical.
I commend what African countries have done already, together with the African Union.
Most have moved rapidly to deepen regional coordination, deploy health workers, and enforce quarantines, lockdowns and border closures.
They are also drawing on the experience of HIV/AIDS and Ebola to debunk rumours and overcome mistrust of government, security forces and health workers.
I express my total solidarity with the people and governments of Africa in tackling COVID-19.
United Nations agencies, country teams, peacekeeping operations and humanitarian workers are providing support.
United Nations solidarity flights have delivered millions of test kits, respirators and other supplies, reaching almost the entire continent.
The policy brief we are issuing today highlights a spectrum of urgent challenges.
We are calling for international action to strengthen Africa’s health systems, maintain food supplies, avoid a financial crisis, support education, protect jobs, keep households and businesses afloat, and cushion the continent against lost income and export earnings.
African countries should also have quick, equal and affordable access to any eventual vaccine and treatment, that must be considered global public goods
I have been calling for a global response package amounting to at least 10 per cent of the world’s Gross Domestic Product.  For Africa, that means more than $200 billion as additional support from the international community.
I also continue to advocate a comprehensive debt framework -- starting with an across-the-board debt standstill for countries unable to service their debt, followed by targeted debt relief and a comprehensive approach to structural issues in the international debt architecture to prevent defaults.
It will also be essential for African countries to sustain their efforts to silence the guns and address violent extremism – and I welcome African support for my call for a global ceasefire.  Political processes and elections in the coming months offer potential milestones for stability and peace.
Women will be central to every aspect of the response.  Stimulus packages must prioritize putting cash in the hands of women and increasing social protection.
We must empower African youth.  The human rights of all must be respected.
Many difficult decisions will need to be taken as the pandemic unfolds, and it will be essential to retain the trust and participation of citizens throughout.
These are still early days for the pandemic in Africa, and disruption could escalate quickly.  Global solidarity with Africa is an imperative – now and for recovering better.
Ending the pandemic in Africa is essential for ending it across the world.
Thank you.

18/05/2020, Rome – The informal briefing, chaired by QU Dongyu, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), brought together the Rome-based Permanent Representatives of FAO member countries. The briefing focused on FAO’s humanitarian response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and examined best practices and country examples of FAO’s work to help mitigate the pandemic’s damage to people’s lives and livelihoods.
In Pakistan, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is spearheading action to keep the food chains running in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the policy and technical support being provided to the Ministry of National Food Security & Research and provincial governments, FAO is working with the government and other partners to help strengthen resilience by contributing to national efforts to curb the transmission of the virus.
FAO, in particular, is raising awareness amongst rural farming communities in some of the most remote areas across the country where the organization has wide networks and is running parallel campaigns, both online and at the field level, to harness broader networks.
With over 60 percent of the population residing in rural areas, the number of households who derive food and livelihoods from farming make up a significant majority of the population. Together with UN partners and the Government of Pakistan, FAO is helping fill the information gap in rural areas by taking action to ensure effective dissemination of information to those communities that are most vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19.
FAO Representative in Pakistan, Minà Dowlatchahi presented Pakistan’s case on how FAO is managing to continue essential operations in the face of the pandemic focusing on social messaging to farmers, pastoralists and COVID19 risk mitigation.
“FAO in Pakistan has worked closely with the government to assist their delivery of services to vulnerable people in some of the most challenging areas of the country,” said Dowlatchahi.  “We will continue to do our utmost to help the people of Pakistan face down the challenges of COVID-19,” she added.
As part of its work in rural communities, FAO is raising awareness regarding the potential impacts of the virus’ spread on food and agriculture, value and supply chains, food prices and food security through various means of communication to support the Government of Pakistan in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Finding new ways to deliver knowledge-based facts to local communities
Various digital campaigns are being run across all provinces in Pakistan where FAO is sharing important information with different farmer groups and local communities in an effort to sensitize local communities on the measures that can help protect against COVID-19. FAO teams are conducting regular online awareness sessions with local farmers, agriculture and livestock workers and technicians to help them understand how farmers can help curtail the spread of the virus by adopting practices such as handwashing, physical distancing and other precautions.
Stepping up efforts to support vulnerable communities
The impacts of the outbreak resulted in the disruption of food supply chains, gaps in farming inputs and unemployment. FAO implementation and operations continue in the field, with the organization reaching out to farmers and those most vulnerable to these shocks. Safety of vulnerable populations, careful planning and social safeguarding measures while delivering the support remains the utmost priority.
FAO with support from Government and UN partners is also promoting greater hygiene in the field to prevent the spread of COVID-19. More than 80 000 UN and Government of Pakistan approved Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials, including posters and brochures, were distributed amongst local communities in FAO’s intervention districts. These posters with prevention guidelines in local languages have been displayed at fruit and vegetable shops, supermarkets, meat and dairy shops and other public places which were still operating.
Supporting stronger agriculture and food systems through FAO’s farmer field schools
Farmer Field Schools are a major tool for transferring knowledge to rural smallholder farmers where these local farmers learn about climate resilient and more modern agricultural practices, innovation, basic entrepreneurship skills and develop their linkages with markets. FAO is redesigning the curricula of these Farmer Field Schools to educate the rural communities on the precautionary measures to combat spread of COVID-19, and safety in agricultural practices such as pesticides handling. Special topics relevant to fighting COVID-19 spread have been included in the farmer field school sessions, including on healthy diets.
Through the farmer field schools FAO has continued to raise awareness about preventive health and hygiene practices. During these activities hands-on, participatory learning was applied to demonstrate the best practices which would help these local communities protect themselves against COVID-19 infections. Practical demonstrations have helped local communities who otherwise lack access to information understand various preventive measures such as hand washing, physical distancing and other health and hygiene practices.
Over 81,000 most vulnerable people, both men and women, have been directly engaged through frontline workers to help these communities protect against COVID-19.
The latest edition of the Global Report on Food Crises has issued a clear warning. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 135 million people experienced crisis level of acute food insecurity. COVID-19 and related restrictions risk pushing many more into acute hunger. . In Pakistan, it is estimated that 21 million people were already severely food insecure before the onset of COVID-19. Preventing new or worsening food crises requires urgent action.

UNAIDS urges governments to ensure that HIV service providers from community-led organizations are recognized as essential service providers in the context of COVID-19
GENEVA, 18 May 2020—A cornerstone of the response to HIV, community-led health service delivery has become even more critical in the context of COVID-19, as the needs of marginalized community members and the burden on the health sector are increasing, making it vital that continued provision of HIV, tuberculosis and other health services is secured. Community-led organizations are providing a lifeline to underserved, marginalized and hard-to-reach populations around the world.
Physical distancing restrictions have created significant challenges for those needing to access essential services, creating an increased burden on community organizations, which are at the centre of service delivery.
UNAIDS recognizes that community organizations have an unparalleled depth of experience in creating and delivering responses to health and human rights crises within their communities. The many community-led networks and groups that emerged to respond to HIV possess immense practical experience, organizational strength and unparalleled community access for facilitating the delivery of life-saving support, and for influencing people’s real-life practices to better protect their health.
Community-led networks and organizations have also developed important working relationships and roles within health and community systems, including in coordination and task-shifting functions. As evidenced in many countries, these capacities can, with proper support, be deployed to facilitate the provision of COVID-19 information, prevention, testing and linkages to care. Yet without formal recognition of the essential nature of their work, they face significant barriers to continuing to provide services. It is the view of UNAIDS that it is critical to the COVID-19 response and to mitigating broader health impacts of the pandemic that community-led organizations be supported to continue to provide essential services and have the protective equipment and safe policy environment necessary to do so.
The role of community-led organizations must be appropriately recognized and supported in the context of COVID-19. They must be factored into all aspects of planning, design and implementation of interventions to combat both COVID-19 and the efforts required to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on other health areas, including HIV and tuberculosis. In particular, and as first steps in this effort, UNAIDS urges COVID-19 crisis committees at the national and district levels to:
· Include the workforce of community-led health care services into the lists of essential service providers and treat them as equivalent to health-care providers.
· Design physical distancing restrictions and policies in ways that allow community-led services to continue operating safely. Essential services include, but are not limited to, the physical provision of HIV, tuberculosis and COVID-19 and other health services that include prevention commodities, including condoms, lubricants, clean needles and opioid substitution therapy, contraceptives, hygiene kits, test kits, medication, triage and linkage to care, adherence support, packages of food and other essentials, the provision of legal services and protection for survivors of gender-based violence and other forms of violence and discrimination. Particular attention needs to be paid to people with physical disabilities.
· Provide special authorization to relevant community-led service providers to move freely, with appropriate personal protective equipment, to deliver the services when and where needed.
· Ensure that community-led organizations, networks and groups be provided with personal protective equipment and training in order to protect themselves and their clients in the course of service delivery.
· Take urgent measures to ensure the security, and expansion, of existing funding for community-led organizations, so that those organizations can continue to provide services.
· Ensure inclusive and transparent governance of COVID-19 responses, with decision-making bodies that include representatives of community-led organizations, including those focused on gender, equity and human rights, to ensure that COVID-19 policies are designed to support the range of service providers and activities necessary for an effective and equitable response.

REMARKS AT LAUNCH OF POLICY BRIEF
ON PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND COVID-19
New York, 5 May 2020
The COVID-19 crisis is affecting every aspect of our societies.
Today, I am highlighting how the pandemic is affecting the world’s 1 billion people with disabilities.
Even under normal circumstances, persons with disabilities are less likely to access education, healthcare and income opportunities or participate in the community.
The pandemic is intensifying these inequalities -- and producing new threats.
Persons with disabilities are among the hardest hit in this crisis in terms of fatalities.
We must guarantee the equal rights of people with disabilities to access healthcare and lifesaving procedures during the pandemic.
I urge governments to place people with disabilities at the center of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts and to consult and engage them.
When we secure the rights of people with disabilities, we are investing in our common future.

REMARKS AT LAUNCH OF POLICY BRIEF
ON PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND COVID-19
New York, 5 May 2020 (Long Version)
The COVID-19 crisis is affecting every aspect of our societies, revealing the extent of exclusion that the most marginalized members of society experience.
Today, I would like to highlight how the pandemic is affecting the world’s 1 billion people with disabilities.
Even under normal circumstances, persons with disabilities are less likely to access education, healthcare and income opportunities or participate in the community.
This is exacerbated for those in humanitarian and fragile contexts.
People with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty, and they experience higher rates of violence, neglect and abuse.
The pandemic is intensifying these inequalities -- and producing new threats.
Today we are launching a report that recommends a disability-inclusive response and recovery for everyone.
People with disabilities are among the hardest hit by COVID-19.
They face a lack of accessible public health information, significant barriers to implement basic hygiene measures, and inaccessible health facilities.
If they contract COVID-19, many are more likely to develop severe health conditions, which may result in death.
The share of COVID-19 related deaths in care homes -- where older people with disabilities are overrepresented -- ranges from 19 per cent to an astonishing 72 per cent.
In some countries, healthcare rationing decisions are based on discriminatory criteria, such as age or assumptions about quality or value of life, based on disability.
We cannot let this continue.
We must guarantee the equal rights of people with disabilities to access healthcare and lifesaving procedures during the pandemic.
Persons with disabilities who faced exclusion in employment before this crisis, are now more likely to lose their job and will experience greater difficulties in returning to work.
Yet, only 28 per cent of people with significant disabilities have access to benefits -- and only 1 per cent in low-income countries.
People with disabilities -- particularly, women and girls -- face a greater risk of domestic violence, which has surged during the pandemic.
I urge governments to place people with disabilities at the center of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts and to consult and engage people with disabilities.
Persons with disabilities have valuable experience to offer of thriving in situations of isolation and alternate working arrangements.
Looking to the future, we have a unique opportunity to design and implement more inclusive and accessible societies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
Last year, I launched the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy to ensure the UN system is doing its part.
The Strategy represents the UN’s commitment to achieve transformative and lasting change.
When we secure the rights of people with disabilities, we are investing in our common future.

As we honour the birth, enlightenment and passing of Lord Buddha, we can all be inspired by his teachings.
And as the human family suffers the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are reminded of the sutra: “Because all living beings are subject to illness, I am ill as well.”
This timeless message of unity and service to others is more important than ever. It is only together that we will stop the spread of the coronavirus and recover.
On the Day of Vesak, let us celebrate Lord Buddha’s wisdom by taking action for others with compassion and solidarity, and by renewing our commitment to build a peaceful world.

New UN initiative to reduce plastic pollution from ASEAN cities
Bangkok (ESCAP News) – The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), in partnership with the Government of Japan, today launched a new project which aims to reduce the environmental impact of cities in South East Asia by addressing plastic waste pollution in rivers and oceans.
The ‘Closing the Loop’ project will support governments by addressing plastic waste pollution and leakages into the marine environment. To do this, the project will leverage innovative technologies such as remote sensing, satellite and crowdsourced data applications to detect and monitor the sources and pathways of plastic waste entering rivers in urban catchment areas. Four ASEAN cities will pilot the project: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Surabaya, Indonesia; Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand and Da Nang, Viet Nam.
“Cities are on the front line in addressing plastic waste in ASEAN, which is the world’s most polluting region when it comes to ocean plastics. The proliferation of plastic pollution in our oceans is a serious climate change hazard, and thanks to the strong support of the Government of Japan, this innovative new project comes at a timely moment to accelerate action on the issue,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana.
Fast growing cities in South East Asia are responsible for as much as 60 per cent of plastic waste leakage into the environment. 75 per cent of land-based sources of marine plastic pollution in the region originates from uncollected waste and 25 per cent from leakages in the municipal waste management systems. Plastic pollution is also transboundary - up to 95 per cent of plastic in our ocean is transported by ten major rivers, eight of which are in Asia.
The project will produce plastic waste maps and simulations for each pilot city and will train officials and stakeholders in ASEAN cities to use smart technologies to monitor, assess, report on and sustainably manage plastic waste as well as further strengthen municipal solid waste management systems. Urban policy makers will also be provided the tools and knowhow to develop policy and investment strategies which apply a circular economy approach in managing their plastic waste streams.
The need for regional cooperation to address this critical issue was recognized by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in his statement following the G20 Osaka Summit: “Marine plastic litter is another issue which cannot be resolved by some countries alone. Under such circumstances, the fact that the G20 was able to unite and share the Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, which aims to reduce additional pollution by marine plastic litter to zero by 2050, represents a major step forward towards resolving this issue.”
The ‘Closing the Loop’ project supports local implementation of the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris and the G20 Osaka Blue Vision to tackle the proliferation of plastic litter, both of which accelerate action towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and 14 (Life Below Water).
This ESCAP - Japan initiative is implemented in close collaboration with local and national governments in South East Asia, ASEAN, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) and other partners.

UNESCO, EU Partners and Media Matter for Democracy mark World Press Freedom Day with Webinar on “Press Freedom and Journalism During (Covid19) Crisis”
The webinar on “Press Freedom and Journalism During Crisis” was held on May 5, 2020, in partnership with the European Union Delegation to Pakistan, Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Embassy of Sweden in Pakistan and Media Matters for Democracy. The webinar was attended by more than 50 participants from civil society, media professionals, academia, international organizations and diplomatic missions.
During the Covid19 pandemic, as well as other situations of crisis, it is critical for people to be informed with facts to make well-informed decisions, to avoid patterns of paranoia, fear, and negatively stigmatising others.  Noting this, the UN Secretary General António Guterres has called for “countering the scourge of misinformation - a poison putting more lives at risk.”[1] Taking stock of the situation the webinar explored the crucial role of media in providing credible information, addressing misinformation, and the subsequent emerging challenges faced by journalists in fulfilling their tasks.
Patricia McPhillips, UNESCO Representative Pakistan, welcomed the participants and emphasised that, “A free and independent press is essential at all times, but is particularly important during a health and economic crisis such as the one we are currently experiencing”. Ambassador of the European Union Delegation to Pakistan Ms. Androulla Kaminara reiterated that, “Journalists are essential workers, especially during the Covid19 crisis: They provide the information that people need to act responsibly and appropriately to stay safe. They stimulate the public debate about the best way to address challenges and provide accountability that is crucial for any democratic society”.
Mr. Asad Hashim from Al Jazeera discussed the factors impeding press freedom in Pakistan especially in light of the current health crisis. He also stressed upon the need to provide safeguards to journalists facing multifarious threats due to the corona virus. While discussing the ‘misinfodemic’, Ms. Ramsha Jahangir (DAWN) highlighted the vital need for providing credible and fact based information by news media to counter misinformation. Mr. Tayyab Afridi representing Tribal News Network analysed the coverage of COVID-19 related news in remote and far flung areas. Mr. Shabbir Anwar (Pakistan Peace Collection, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting) described various initiatives launched to gauge the perception of citizens about corona virus and shared the lessons learnt.
In his concluding remarks, Ambassador of Netherlands to Pakistan Mr. Wouter Plomp stated, “In these times of COVID-19 crisis, journalists have the vital task of disseminating reliable information, keeping people informed and holding governments accountable. To recognise the importance of a free press, I would like to say to journalists that you are here to protect our freedoms. It’s our duty to protect yours”.

19 million children internally displaced by conflict and violence in 2019, highest number ever – UNICEF 

Internally displaced children among the world’s most vulnerable to COVID-19
Download the full report here

NEW YORK, 5 May 2020 – An estimated 19 million children, more than ever before, were living in displacement within their own countries due to conflict and violence in 2019 – some of them for years, UNICEF said in a new report today.
The report, ‘Lost at Home’, looks at the risks and challenges internally displaced children face, and the urgent actions needed to protect them. As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, these children are among the most vulnerable to its direct and indirect impacts.
“Millions of displaced children around the world are already going without proper care and protection,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “When new crises emerge, like the COVID-19 pandemic, these children are especially vulnerable. It is essential that governments and humanitarian partners work together to keep them safe, healthy, learning and protected.”

Internally displaced children lack access to basic services and are at risk of exposure to violence, exploitation, abuse and trafficking, the report says. They are also at risk of child labour, child marriage and family separation which all pose direct threats to their health and safety.

The COVID-19 pandemic is making a critical situation for displaced children and families even worse. They often live in overcrowded camps or informal settlements, where access to basic hygiene and health services is limited, and where physical distancing is not possible. These conditions are highly conducive to the spread of diseases like COVID-19.
According to the report, there were 12 million new displacements of children in 2019, 3.8 million of them were caused by conflict and violence, and 8.2 million by disasters linked mostly to weather-related events like flooding and storms.

Through the report, UNICEF calls for strategic investments and a united effort from governments, civil society, private sector, humanitarian actors and children themselves to address the child-specific drivers of displacement, especially all forms of violence, exploitation and abuse.
UNICEF also calls on governments convening under the High-Level Panel on Internal Displacement, established by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, to take concrete action and investment that will help provide protection and equitable access to services for all internally displaced children and their families.
Critical to delivering on this agenda is better, timely and accessible data and evidence, disaggregated by age and gender, to improve collective understanding of how internal displacement affects children and their families. Internally displaced children and youth themselves must have a seat at the table, be taken seriously and offered the opportunity to be part of the solution, the report says.

VIDEO MESSAGE ON WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY 2020
“Journalism Without Fear or Favour”
New York, 3 May 2020
Journalists and media workers are crucial to helping us make informed decisions. As the world fights the COVID-19 pandemic, those decisions can make the difference between life and death.
On World Press Freedom Day, we call on governments -- and others -- to guarantee that journalists can do their jobs throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
As the pandemic spreads, it has also given rise to a second pandemic of misinformation, from harmful health advice to wild conspiracy theories.
The press provides the antidote: verified, scientific, fact-based news and analysis.
But since the pandemic began, many journalists are being subjected to increased restrictions and punishments simply for doing their jobs.
Temporary constraints on freedom of movement are essential to beat COVID-19. But they must not be abused as an excuse to crack down on journalists’ ability to do their work.
Today, we thank the media for providing facts and analysis; for holding leaders – in every sector – accountable; and for speaking truth to power.
We particularly recognize those who are playing a life-saving role reporting on public health.
And we call on governments to protect media workers, and to strengthen and maintain press freedom, which is essential for a future of peace, justice and human rights for all.

FAO and OCHA join hands on Humanitarian Affairs in Balochistan
Quetta – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarians Affairs (OCHA) have strengthened their collaboration by signing an exchange of letters as the UN continues to help Government respond to challenges posed by COVID-19 in Balochistan and all over Pakistan.
In the light of the current increase in humanitarian needs, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, FAO jointly with OCHA have deployed a Humanitarian Affairs Officer to strengthen humanitarian coordination activities in Balochistan. This will further reinforce coordination mechanisms between the Government of Balochistan, the UN, NGOs and development partners.
The Humanitarian Affairs Officer is funded by Australian aid. The officer will be responsible to monitor the humanitarian risks, collect and communicate relevant data and information and liaise with humanitarian partners and government officials.  This collaboration will help strengthen system-wide preparedness and technical capacities to respond to humanitarian complex emergencies.
“The current humanitarian crisis due to COVID19 has severe health and socio-economic consequences, is affecting food availability and access and is impacting livelihoods. The preparation for the recovery phase, in an environment that has also recently suffered from drought then cold, which is also facing a locust threat, requires strong coordination to ensure well designed, integrated and timely delivered interventions for the benefit of the most vulnerable population. It is a responsibility to share the limited resources for maximum impact. We are all together in this. FAO is thankful for the support of Australian aid.” said Mina Dowlatchahi, FAO Representative in Pakistan.
“The world will get through this crisis, but only if we act together, in solidarity. This virus is a threat to all of humanity, regardless of nationality, ethnicity or faith. OCHA values the generous contribution from Australian aid and FAO, It will enable the UN to provide a coordinated multi-agency, multi-sectoral response to provincial actions in order to address the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and enable rapid recovery,” said Tanvir Ahmed Khan, Head of Office a.i., OCHA.

VIDEO MESSAGE TO LAUNCH POLICY BRIEF ON OLDER PERSONS
New York, 1 May 2020
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing untold fear and suffering for older people across the world.
The fatality rate for older people is higher overall, and for those over 80, it is five times the global average.
Beyond its immediate health impact, the pandemic is putting older people at greater risk of poverty, discrimination and isolation. It is likely to have a particularly devastating impact on older people in developing countries.
As an older person myself, with responsibility for an even older mother, I am deeply concerned about the pandemic on a personal level, and about its effects on our communities and societies.
Today we are launching a policy brief that provides analysis and recommendations to address these challenges. Our response to COVID-19 must respect the rights and dignity of older people.
There are four main messages.
First, no person, young or old, is expendable. Older people have the same rights to life and health as everyone else.
Difficult decisions around life-saving medical care must respect the human rights and dignity of all.
Second, while physical distancing is crucial, let’s not forget we are one community and we all belong to each other. We need improved social support and smarter efforts to reach older people through digital technology.
That is vital to older people who may face great suffering and isolation under lockdowns and other restrictions.
Third, all social, economic and humanitarian responses must take the needs of older people fully into account, from universal health coverage to social protection, decent work and pensions.
The majority of older people are women, who are more likely to enter this period of their lives in poverty and without access to healthcare. Policies must be targeted at meeting their needs.
And fourth, let’s not treat older people as invisible or powerless.
Many older people depend on an income and are fully engaged in work, in family life, in teaching and learning, and in looking after others. Their voices and leadership count.
To get through this pandemic together, we need a surge in global and national solidarity and the contributions of all members of society, including older people.
As we look to recover better, we will need ambition and vision to build more inclusive, sustainable and age-friendly societies that are fit for the future.

FAO introduces Walk-in Tunnels for off-season vegetable production in Tribal Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Peshawar– The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has introduced tunnel-farming in the tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with support from USAID as part of its efforts to promote effective-modern ways of agricultural production in the wide-range climate of the region. Seventy-five walk-in tunnels are installed in Khyber, South Waziristan, North Waziristan and Orakzai District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The activities were initiated before the onset of COVID-19, and as such provided a welcome and timely relief to local farmers who can now enjoy the harvest at a time when their lives and livelihoods are disrupted due to the lockdown.
These farmers were provided walk-in tunnel structures and high quality certified vegetable seeds that were cultivated and are now ready to be harvested. This activity is part of a restoring subsistence and promoting modern commercial agriculture program in the tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which aims to promote sustainable agriculture enterprise development by establishing market structures and services, developing value chains, expanding markets, and building capacity of both men and women farmers.
Before the onset of COVID-19, FAO steered extensive off and on-job trainings for the farmers and arranged external exposure visits to introduce them to tunnel farming. The familiarization with modern technology targets capacity-building and increased profitability from agricultural activities.
Now during the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown, producing and harvesting vegetables under tunnels will enable farmers to have enough agri produce for a diversified diet for self-consumption as well as for selling in their neighborhoods and local markets.  FAO is also supporting these tunnel farmers in developing linkages with local and national markets.
“The poorest and most vulnerable groups have higher likelihood to experience higher negative effects of the current pandemic and related lock down. This includes subsistence farmers as well as smallholder farmers’ enterprises. Modernization of Agriculture practices and digital technology to provide real-time information to farmers on prices or to support the supply chain can be effective resilience and mitigation measures in time of shocks such as COVID19,” said Minà Dowlatchahi, FAO Representative in Pakistan.
FAO will continue to support farmers with modernization and agro-technology in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Merged Districts to boost higher value production, food security and agro-livelihood opportunities. Walk-in tunnels help increase productivity – reducing the yield gaps and also help achieve sustainable increases of agro-food through improved agriculture practices.

FAO Continues to Support Farmers in Balochistan to Rebuild their Agriculture Livelihoods during the COVID-19 Pandemic
Quetta – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is upscaling its efforts to contain the impact of lockdown due to COVID19 on food security and nutrition - in Balochistan province by ensuring that the local communities have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives during the COVID-19 emergency.
FAO in close collaboration with relevant Government of Balochistan line departments and with the support of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, Plant Protection Department and various other stakeholders has been supporting the local authorities in responding to complex emergencies, including the locust outbreak, floods, drought and most recently the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown.
As part of its COVID-19 response, FAO is playing an active role in assessing and responding to its potential impacts on lives and livelihoods of local communities. FAO is conducting field awareness sessions and is carrying out electronic and print media campaigns for the farmers to help slow the spread of COVID-19 while ensuring that agriculture production can continue under safety standard operating procedures. Awareness campaigns are underway in various districts of Balochistan in an effort to safeguard livelihoods, markets, food supply chains and livestock of the local communities. Field assessments and coordinating surveys are also a part of FAO’s communications strategy to strengthen provincial and national capacities to combat COVID-19.
“COVID-19 is disrupting livelihoods, food supply chain and people’s access to food and basic services. Rural livelihoods need a concerted effort from all actors to ensure emergency employment or social protection as well as keeping the food system and rural economy moving, particularly those segments driven by small, informal producers, service providers, rural institutions, and value chain participants,” said Minà Dowlatchahi, FAO Representative in Pakistan.
FAO urges civil society, relevant departments of government, academia and other stakeholders and partners to work together to ensure that the value chains that deliver our food are coordinated and functioning properly while minimizing the risks of contagion of those who work for it. FAO is responding to the challenges faced by the farmers, men and women, by raising awareness about food safety and health best practices and is also combining efforts with the government and local stakeholders identify and implement the good practice measures to ensure continuity of the food supply chain and food availability and access – including between rural, peri-urban and urban areas.

ILO: As job losses escalate, nearly half of global workforce at risk of losing livelihoods
The latest ILO data on the labour market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reveals the devastating effect on workers in the informal economy and on hundreds of millions of enterprises worldwide.
GENEVA (ILO News) – The continued sharp decline in working hours globally due to the COVID-19 outbreak means that 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy - that is nearly half of the global workforce - stand in immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed, warns the International Labour Organization.
According to the “ILO Monitor third edition: COVID-19 and the world of work”, the drop in working hours in the current (second) quarter of 2020 is expected to be significantly worse than previously estimated.
Compared to pre-crisis levels (Q4 2019), a 10.5 per cent deterioration is now expected, equivalent to 305 million full-time jobs (assuming a 48-hour working week). The previous estimate was for a 6.7 per cent drop, equivalent to 195 million full-time workers. This is due to the prolongation and extension of lockdown measures.
Regionally, the situation has worsened for all major regional groups. Estimates suggest a 12.4 per cent loss of working hours in Q2 for the Americas (compared to pre-crisis levels) and 11.8 per cent for Europe and Central Asia. The estimates for the rest of the regional groups follow closely and are all above 9.5 per cent.
Informal economy impact
As a result of the economic crisis created by the pandemic, almost 1.6 billion informal economy workers (representing the most vulnerable in the labour market), out of a worldwide total of two billion and a global workforce of 3.3 billion, have suffered massive damage to their capacity to earn a living. This is due to lockdown measures and/or because they work in the hardest-hit sectors.
The first month of the crisis is estimated to have resulted in a drop of 60 per cent in the income of informal workers globally. This translates into a drop of 81 per cent in Africa and the Americas, 21.6 per cent in Asia and the Pacific, and 70 per cent in Europe and Central Asia.
Without alternative income sources, these workers and their families will have no means to survive.
Enterprises at risk
The proportion of workers living in countries under recommended or required workplace closures has decreased from 81 to 68 per cent over the last two weeks. The decline from the Embargoed information from the ILO previous estimate of 81 per cent in the second edition of the monitor (published April 7) is primarily a result of changes in China; elsewhere workplace closure measures have increased.
Worldwide, more than 436 million enterprises face highrisks of serious disruption. These enterprises are operating in the hardest-hit economic sectors, including some 232 million in wholesale and retail, 111 million in manufacturing, 51 million in accommodation and food services, and 42 million in real estate and other business activities.
Urgent policy measures needed
The ILO calls for urgent, targeted and flexible measures to support workers and businesses, particularly smaller enterprises, those in the informal economy and others who are vulnerable.
Measures for economic reactivation should follow a job-rich approach, backed by stronger employment policies and institutions, better-resourced and comprehensive social protection systems. International co-ordination on stimulus packages and debt relief measures will also be critical to making recovery effective and sustainable. International labour standards, which already enjoy tripartite consensus, can provide a framework.
“As the pandemic and the jobs crisis evolve, the need to protect the most vulnerable becomes even more urgent,” said ILO-Director General Guy Ryder. “For millions of workers, no income means no food, no security and no future. Millions of businesses around the world are barely breathing. They have no savings or access to credit. These are the real faces of the world of work. If we don’t help them now, they will simply perish”.

UNHCR donates medical equipment to Children Hospital Quetta
QUETTA, 30 April 2020 – UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency provided state-of-the-art medical equipment to Children Hospital Quetta as part of its ongoing work to support the Provincial Government and improve public health care services in hospitals in Balochistan.
The equipment valued at Rs.7 million includes a fully automated chemistry analyzer, an instrument used for the biochemical testing of total bilirubin, urea, creatinine, liver function, cholesterol, uric acid, triglyceride and calcium in patients.
With this new instrument, the hospital will offer free testing to the most needy Pakistanis and Afghans. Biochemical testing in private laboratories would otherwise cost around Rs.2,000.
“This is the fastest testing machine in Balochistan, with the capacity of testing 60 patients per hour. This machine is very productive which eases the ever-increasing pressures on time,” said the Medical Superintendent of the Children Hospital, Dr. Sher Ahmed Satakzai.
The Head of UNHCR’s Sub-Office in Quetta, Mr. Zephania Amuiri, said, “UNHCR not only aims to strengthen the public health care system but also to support the refugee and Pakistani community at this difficult time.”
He added that although the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted some activities, UNHCR in Pakistan is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic while also continuing its core programme in support of the Provincial Government Health Department, and the refugee and host communities.

New guidelines provide roadmap for safe reopening of schools
NEW YORK/PARIS/ROME, 30 April 2020 – UNESCO, UNICEF, WFP and World Bank today issued new guidelines on the safe reopening of schools amidst ongoing closures affecting nearly 1.3 billion students worldwide.
The agencies also warned that the widespread closures of educational facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic present an unprecedented risk to children’s education and wellbeing, particularly for the most marginalized children who rely on school for their education, health, safety and nutrition. The guidelines offer practical advice for national and local authorities on how to keep children safe when they return to school.
“Rising inequality, poor health outcomes, violence, child labour and child marriage are just some of the long-term threats for children who miss out on school,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “We know the longer children stay out of school, the less likely they are to ever return. Unless we prioritize the reopening of schools – when it is safe to do so – we will likely see a devastating reversal in education gains.”
The new guidelines note that while there is not yet enough evidence to measure the impact of school closures on disease transmission rates, the adverse effects of school closures on children’s safety and learning are well documented. Gains made in increasing access to children’s education in recent decades risk being lost and, in the worse cases, reversed completely.
“In the poorest countries, children often rely on schools for their only meal of the day. But with many schools now closed because of COVID, 370 million children are missing out on these nutritious meals which are a lifeline for poor families. They are also being denied the health support they normally get through school. This could do lasting damage, so when schools reopen it is critical that these meal programmes and health services are restored, which can also help to draw the most vulnerable children back to school,” said David Beasley, WFP Executive Director.
The best interests of children and overall public health considerations – based on an assessment of the associated benefits and risks to education, public health and socio-economic factors – must be central to national and local authorities’ decisions to reopen schools, the guidelines say.
Schools must look at how they can reopen better – with improved learning and more comprehensive support for children at the school including health, nutrition, psychosocial support and water, sanitation and hygiene facilities.
As countries grapple with when to reopen schools, UNESCO, UNICEF, WFP and World Bank – as part of the Global Education Coalition – urge governments to assess the benefits of classroom-based instruction compared to remote learning, and the risk factors related to reopening of schools, noting the inconclusive evidence around the infection risks related to school attendance.

Cont.
“While many students are falling behind in their learning journey because of prolonged school closures, the decision of when and how to reopen schools, while far from straightforward, should be a priority. Once there is a green light on the health front, a whole set of measures will need to be in place to ensure that no student is left behind. These guidelines provide all-round guidance for governments and partners to facilitate the reopening of schools for students, teachers and families. We share one goal: to protect and advance the right to education for every learner,” said UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay.

The guidelines include:
· Policy reform: Policy implications address all dimensions of the guidelines, including clear policies for school opening and closure during public health emergencies, reforms needed to expand equitable access for marginalised and out of school children as well as strengthen and standardize remote learning practices.
· Financing requirements: Address the impact of COVID-19 on education and invest in strengthening education systems for recovery and resilience.
· Safe operations: Ensure conditions that reduce disease transmission, safeguard essential services and supplies and promote healthy behaviour. This includes access to soap and clean water for safe handwashing, procedures on when staff or students feel unwell, protocols on social distancing and good hygiene practices.
· Compensating learning: Focus on practices that compensate for lost instructional time, strengthen pedagogy and build on hybrid learning models such as integrating approaches in remote and distance education. This must include knowledge on disease transmission and prevention.
· Wellness and protection: Expand the focus on students’ well-being and reinforce the protection of children through enhanced referral mechanisms and the provision of essential school-based services including healthcare and school feeding.
· Reaching the most marginalised: Adapt school opening policies and practices to expand access to marginalised groups such as previously out-of-school children, displaced and migrant children and minorities. Diversify critical communications and outreach by making them available in relevant languages and in accessible formats.

"Once schools begin to reopen, the priority becomes reintegrating students into school settings safely and in ways that allow learning to pick up again, especially for those who suffered the biggest learning losses. This is a critical moment as it is the launching pad for a new normal that should be more effective and equitable. To manage reopenings, schools will need to be logistically prepared with the teaching workforce ready. And they will need to have plans specifically for supporting learning recovery of the most disadvantaged students. The guidelines offer a framework for moving forward that the major UN agencies are aligned around," said Jaime Saavedra, World Bank Global Director for Education.

UNICEF - Zong 4G : JOINT PRESS RELEASE : Zong 4G and UNICEF Pakistan Partner to Create Awareness around COVID-19
Zong 4G and UNICEF Pakistan Partner to Create Awareness around COVID-19
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, 26 March 2019: Today Zong 4G and UNICEF joined hands to help inform the general public in Pakistan on COVID-19.
As part of the partnership, Zong 4G will use all its digital channels to disseminate accurate and reliable information on the coronavirus COVID-19. The campaign aims at reaching Zong 4G’s over 37 Million customers through multiple platforms and channels, including Zong 4G’s official Facebook Page, Zong 4G’s official Twitter Handle, Official Website and MyZong app.
“Amid the Coronavirus pandemic, we have also seen a major outbreak of mis- and disinformation surrounding the topic on social media. In these challenging times, it is imperative that reliable, accurate and authentic information reach every corner of the country. Zong 4G and UNICEF Pakistan have partnered to augment the efforts of the health authorities in relaying authenticated messages to the public. These are testing times for the entire world and we must stay united in battling this pandemic by following guidelines being promoted by the health authorities.” Said Mr. Wang Hua, Chairman and CEO, Zong 4G.

A new normal: UN lays out roadmap to lift economies and save jobs after COVID-19
There will be no return to the “old normal”, governments must act to create a new economy and more jobs.
New York, 27 April 2020 – The urgent health crisis that is COVID-19 has created a historic recession with record levels of deprivation and unemployment, creating an unprecedented human crisis that is hitting the poorest hardest, especially women and children. In a new framework released today as a roadmap to support countries’ path to social and economic recovery, the United Nations calls for an extraordinary scale-up of international support and political commitment to ensure that people everywhere have access to essential services and social protection.
The “United Nations Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19: Shared responsibility, global solidarity and urgent action for people in need”  calls for protecting jobs, businesses and livelihoods to set in motion a safe recovery of societies and economies as soon as possible for a more sustainable, gender-equal, and carbon-neutral path—better than the “old normal”.
“This is not only a health crisis but a human crisis; a jobs crisis; a humanitarian crisis and a development crisis. And it is not just about the most vulnerable. This pandemic shows that we are all at risk because we are only as strong as the weakest health system. Its unprecedented scale demands an unprecedented response,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who presented his report on the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 “Shared Responsibility, Global Solidarity” in March.
“Everything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change and the many other global challenges we face,” he said. This new framework released today sets the way United Nations entities will deliver this vision on the ground.
Decisions made in the next few months will be crucial for the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UN’s framework for social and economic recovery stresses.
Noting that during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, more people died from the interruption of social services and the economic breakdown than from the virus itself, the framework focuses on protecting the needs and rights of those most affected by the pandemic, starting with the most vulnerable countries, groups, and those who risk being left behind.
Drawing lessons from the 2008-2009 global economic and financial crisis, the framework notes that countries with strong social protection systems and basic services suffered the least and recovered the fastest. To prevent billions of people from sliding into poverty, governments around the world will need to rapidly adapt, extend and scale-up safety ‘cushions’, such as cash transfers, food assistance, social insurance schemes and child benefits to support families.
For the impacts of COVID-19 to be reduced, the UN calls for an extraordinary scale-up of support to cope with the challenges ahead, including immediate social protection responses that consider differentiated impacts on vulnerable groups, children, women, men, and those in the informal sector. This is particularly urgent considering that 4 billion people, more than half of the world population—including two out of three children—have no or inadequate social protection.
NOTES FOR THE EDITORS
The UN will focus on five key streams in its response, which places communities at the centre of recovery efforts: 1.protecting existing health services and strengthening health systems’ capacity to respond to COVID-19; 2. helping people cope with adversity, through social protection and basic services; 3. protecting jobs, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and informal sector workers through economic recovery programmes; 4. guiding the necessary surge in fiscal and financial stimulus to make macroeconomic policies work for the most vulnerable and strengthening multilateral and regional responses; and 5. promoting social cohesion and investing in community-led resilience and response systems. These five streams are connected by action to meet the need for environmental sustainability, if countries are to recover and “build back better”, and be better prepared to address future shocks, including pandemics.
UN teams covering 162 countries and territories will rollout this recovery plan in the next 12 to 18 months, under the leadership of UN Resident Coordinators (RC), supported by a network of global and regional expertise. As the technical lead in the socio-economic recovery efforts, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) will support RCs, with UN teams working as one across all aspects of the response.
While a significant proportion of the existing US$17.8 billion portfolio of sustainable development programmes across UN entities will be adjusted towards COVID-19 needs, given the scale and scope of the socio-economic impact of the pandemic, additional funds will be required. To support these efforts, the Secretary-General launched the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, a UN inter-agency fund mechanism to help support low- and middle-income programme countries overcome the health and development crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and support people most vulnerable to economic hardship and social disruption. The financial requirements of the Fund are projected at $1billion in the first nine months and will be subsequently reviewed. The Secretary-General also called for a multilateral response that amounts to at least 10 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) to mount the most effective response to crisis the world has ever seen.
There will be no return to the “old normal”, the framework document states. The pandemic is a blow to developing and emerging economies that already face binding constraints of debt and limited fiscal space, with several developing countries needing urgent debt relief. Its impacts will be especially devastating for the most vulnerable countries – those in humanitarian or conflict settings. The UN also calls for a massive fiscal and financial repurposing in the next weeks and months, including the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies to aid the response. The UN stresses that the status quo and business-as-usual are policy choices, and they are not inevitable. For a sustainable development that benefits more people, the choice must be for a recovery from COVID-19 that is fast, fair, green and inclusive.
About the framework document : The “United Nations Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19: Shared responsibility, global solidarity and urgent action for people in need”, released today puts in practice the UN Secretary-General’s Shared Responsibility, Global Solidarity report on the same subject. It is one of three critical components of the UN’s efforts to save lives, protect people, and rebuild better, alongside the health response, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the humanitarian response, as detailed in the UN-led COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan. Three funding mechanisms support the comprehensive response pillars: The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, managed by the UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation for the immediate health needs; the  “Global Humanitarian Response Plan” for the humanitarian appeal; and the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund for the socio-economic recovery.
About the UN Development System: The United Nations development system is the world’s largest international actor on social protection and basic services. The UN System is present in 162 countries and territories and reaches tens of millions of people through basic services, social transfers and other forms of social protection. The UN Development System has extensive experience in supporting governments in developing social protection systems including social protection floors and delivery of quality social services and to support such services across humanitarian and development contexts. unsdg.un.org

Women leaders rise in solidarity to save lives and protect livelihoods
“Rise for All” calls on all leaders to meet the human crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic
and fully fund the UN Response and Recovery Trust Fund
New York, 27 April 2020 – Supporting the UN Secretary-General’s call for solidarity and urgent action in response to the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, an initial group of prominent women today joined a global advocacy effort to save lives and protect livelihoods, urging leaders in all countries, across all sectors, to address the human crisis of the pandemic.
Convened by UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, Rise for All brings together women leaders to mobilize support for the UN roadmap to tackle the development emergency, as laid out in the United Nations Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19: Shared responsibility, global solidarity and urgent action for people in need, issued today.
“Like no other time in recent history, women are on the frontlines of COVID-19 and bearing the brunt of this human crisis,” said the UN Deputy Secretary-General. “It is time for us to rise as women leaders, taking action to conquer the pandemic and come out stronger so as to keep the world on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.”
The first to join this cohort today are the President of Ethiopia, Sahle-Work Zewde, the Prime Minister of Norway and Sustainable Development Goals Advocate of the Secretary-General, Erna Solberg, Sustainable Development Goals Advocate of the Secretary-General Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, Sustainable Development Goals Advocate of the Secretary-General Dia Mirza, UN Women Goodwill Ambassador of Pakistan Muniba Mazari, along with the Executive Directors of UNICEF, Henrietta Fore, of UN Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, and of UNFPA, Natalia Kanem.
Together, the women are supporting the United Nations’ call for an extraordinary scale-up of international support and political commitment to “build back better” and ensure that people everywhere have access to essential services and social protection. This includes support for the UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, an inter-agency mechanism designed to help those countries and people most exposed to the economic hardship and social disruption the pandemic has caused.
The Fund aims to mobilize US$1 billion over the first nine months, and US$2 billion over two years, to support low- and middle-income countries, including Small Island Developing States and vulnerable groups such as women and children who are disproportionately bearing the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic.
The Netherlands today announced an initial contribution 15 million Euros (US$16.6 million) to the Fund, following in the footsteps of Norway and Denmark, who have thus far pledged 150 million Norwegian Krone (US$14.1 million) and 50 million Danish Krone (US$7.3 million), respectively.
Over the coming weeks, more women leaders, including from the political, multilateral and business sectors, are expected to join Rise for All, adding their voices in support of the United Nations roadmap for social and economic recovery, and to advocate a fully funded COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund.

Protect workers both now and after lockdowns ease, says ILO
The International Labour Organization warns that without adequate safeguards for returning
workers there could be a second wave of the virus.
GENEVA (ILO News) – As the pressure mounts on countries to ease their lockdown restrictions, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has urged Governments to take action to prevent and control COVID-19 in the workplace, with active involvement and dialogue with employers’ and workers’ organizations.
All employers need to carry out risk assessments and ensure their workplaces meet strict occupational safety and health criteria beforehand, to minimize the risk to workers of exposure to COVID-19, says the ILO.
Without such controls, countries face the very real risk of a resurgence of the virus. Putting in place the necessary measures will minimize the risk of a second wave of contagion contracted at the workplace.
“The safety and health of our entire workforce is paramount today. In the face of an infectious disease outbreak, how we protect our workers now clearly dictates how safe our communities are, and how resilient our businesses will be, as this pandemic evolves,” said the Director-General of the ILO, Guy Ryder.
“It is only by implementing occupational safety and health measures that we can protect the lives of workers, their families and the larger communities, ensure work continuity and economic survival,” Ryder added.
In particular, risk control measures should be specifically adapted to the needs of workers at the frontline of the pandemic. These include health workers, nurses, doctors and emergency workers, as well as those in food retail and cleaning services.
The ILO also highlighted the needs of the most vulnerable workers and businesses, in particular those in the informal economy, migrant and domestic workers. Measures to protect these workers should include - among others - education and training on safe and healthy work practices, free provision of PPE as needed, access to public health services and livelihood alternatives.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for strong national programmes to protect the health and safety of health workers, medical professionals, emergency responders, and the many other workers risking their lives on our behalf,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “On World Day for Safety and Health at Work, I call on all countries to assure well-defined, decent and safe working conditions for
all health workers."
To ensure a safe return to work and to avoid further work disruptions, the ILO
recommends:
· Mapping hazards and assessing risks of contagion in relation to all work operations, and continuing to assess them following a return to work.
· Adopting risk control measures adapted to each sector and the specifics of each
workplace and workforce. These may include:
· Reducing physical interactions between workers, contractors, customers and visitors and respecting physical distancing when any interactions occur.
· Improving ventilation in the work place.
· Regularly cleaning surfaces, ensuring workplaces are clean and hygienic, and providing adequate facilities for handwashing and sanitization.
· Providing Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to workers where necessary and at no cost.
· Providing arrangements for isolating suspected cases and tracing every contact.
· Providing mental health support for staff.
· Providing training, education and informational material about health and safety at work, including proper hygiene practices and the use of any workplace controls (including PPE).

Title: Pakistan launches initial US$ 595 million Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19
Content: 23 April 2020
Islamabad- Today, the Government of Pakistan launched Pakistan’s Preparedness and Response Plan (PPRP) in a bid to suppress and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The initial Response Plan, worth US $ 595 million, is intended to strengthen Pakistan’s capacity in emergency prevention, preparedness, response and relief and build health systems for a period of 9 months from April to December 2020.
Launching the plan, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi acknowledged and appreciated the efforts of all stakeholders involved in the preparation of the PPRP. He especially paid tribute to the fearless health workers, doctors, nurses and paramedic staff for their services to the people of Pakistan. He shared that saving people both from the pandemic and hunger were top most priorities of the Government. He hailed Pakistan’s inclusive approach and collective response from our leadership towards COVID-19.
Referring to the PPRP as the “blueprint” for Pakistan to fill the gaps to combat COVID19 in Pakistan, he stated that COVID-19 was a “wakeup call for the world” and global solidarity was needed more than ever. He urged the global leaders to come together against a “common enemy”. He underscored that the socio-economic impact of the virus cannot be separated from the health response. While referring to the Prime Minister’s ‘Global initiative on Debt Relief’, he said that Government of Pakistan was reaching out to all relevant stakeholders to craft a comprehensive response to the financial impacts of COVID-19.  He thanked the international partners for the zeal and readiness to respond to the needs of the people of Pakistan amidst COVID-19.

A large number of representatives of UN agencies, international organizations, INGOs and media joined the launch virtually as well.
Minister Bakhtyar welcomed the G20 announcement on debt relief as well as programs and support of IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions (IFIs). While referring to the Government’s package of around US $ 8 billion to combat COVID-19, he added that adequate and meaningful engagement” of multilateral development banks (MDBs) to support the debt relief efforts and risk management to the economies of the developing countries like Pakistan is essential.
Lieutenant General Muhammad Afzal, Chairman, National Disaster Management Authority underlined the exceptional humanitarian circumstances due to this global crisis demanded immediate global attention. He added “support must be given to developing countries like Pakistan to enable them to reduce risk to the population and provide optimal response, recovery and rehabilitation against COVID-19 pandemic”.
As the COVID-19 outbreak ravages the world, Pakistan is also witnessing an increase in the cases over the past few weeks. World can only defeat the pandemic by acting together with exceptional global solidarity and shared responsibility. Stopping the spread of COVID19 in Pakistan is extremely important as it is the fifth-most populous country in the world, with movement of large number of people across the national borders.
The response plan calls on all partners to act together and utilize their resources and expertise to help implement a coordinated response across the country at federal and provincial levels.  More specifically, all partners will work towards:
Dr. Tedros Adhanom, Director General of the World Health Organization, speaking on behalf of the partners highlighted that, “The COVID-19 outbreak is creating significant additional pressure on an already overburdened health system, exacerbating the vulnerabilities of affected populations. With the fast-moving spread of the pandemic, Pakistan requires, now, more than ever, flexible and timely funding, so that it can be allocated quickly to where it is most needed.”
To kick-start the response plan, the World Bank has immediately made available a US$ 240 million package to help Pakistan take effective and timely action to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our support to Pakistan will help the country enhance its healthcare system to better respond to COVID-19, especially as the outbreak continues to evolve rapidly and affects the vulnerable Pakistanis the most” said Mr. Hartwig Schafer, World Bank Regional Vice President for South Asia.  He also emphasized the importance of support to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the crisis, which the World Bank is also providing.
Talking at the occasion, Mr. Bambang Susantono, Vice President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development of the Asian Development Bank said: “We are fully committed to helping Pakistan manage this crisis in close coordination with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the UN system and the global community. We will mobilize flexible and timely financing for the public health response, expand social support and help to bring about the gradual recovery of the economy.” Asian Development Bank has already approved more than US $ 52 million in support for Pakistan’s COVID-19 pandemic response.
All participants shared their common aspiration that acting together in solidarity, these efforts will help to reduce the social and financial impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable people in society during these difficult times and support economic resilience and recovery. They collectively called on everyone to commit to stemming the impact of COVID-19 in Pakistan and containing the virus by providing the strongest possible support to the response plan.  ***

27 January 2020, Islamabad— UNDP Pakistan, along with Ministry of Planning Development and Reform and Swiss Development Cooperation launched the 22nd issue of the Development Advocate Pakistan (DAP) under the theme ‘Nudging for Development’. DAP is a quarterly policy magazine of UNDP Pakistan and Swiss Development Cooperation.

Nudges are small ‘push’ in the direction that leads people to imperceptibly opt for choices that benefit them. The issue introduces a variety of thematic areas where nudges have been employed globally and the tremendous positive impact they have had.
“Nudges are based largely on non-economic incentives; they are relatively easy to use and effective in influencing behaviours,” said Mr. Ignacio Artaza, Resident Representative a.i., UNDP Pakistan at the occasion. “For this reason, the potential in Pakistan is tremendous. Pakistan can benefit by infusing nudges in policy making.”
Dr. Jehanzeb Khan, Deputy Chairman Planning Commission, thanked UNDP Pakistan and Swiss Development Cooperation for their efforts in bringing a new concept to the forefront, bearing potential to influencing behaviours as low-cost solutions for addressing problems.
