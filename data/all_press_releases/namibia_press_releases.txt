Title: Labour Migration Governance Key to Protecting Migrant Workers in Southern Africa
Content: 25 November 2022
Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe - The governance of labour migration as an instrument for development in Southern Africa will be put under the spotlight at a high-level tripartite two day dialogue titled: “Labour Migration Governance in the SADC region,” to be held in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe 29th and 30th November.

The President of Zimbabwe, Dr Emmerson Mnagwanga will officially open the high-level conference which seeks to find ways to foster fair and effective labour migration governance and the protection of migrant workers in Southern Africa. Led by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the High-Level Tripartite Dialogue is a culmination of activities and research organised by the Southern African Migration Management (SAMM) Project to identify priorities at the national level and advance in the implementation of country-level labour migration policies and action plans in the SADC region.
It is designed to improve migration management in the Southern African and Indian Ocean region guided by, and contributing to the realisation of, the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda goal 8 on decent work and economic growth and goal 10 on reducing inequality and Objective 6 of the Global Compact for Migration (GCM) to Facilitate fair and ethical recruitment and safeguard conditions that ensure decent work.
Since almost half of all migrant workers in the SADC region are women, the conference will spotlight the importance of labour migration policies to be gender-responsive and evidence-based. For many women, as for men, migration can represent a positive experience and have important emancipating and empowering impacts.
According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA, year ), the feminization of migration has reached significant levels in the Southern African region with 47 per cent of all migrants being female.
But often female migrants are confronted with gender specific disadvantages and vulnerability in the migration process and in their employment. Women workers, especially young female migrants, often end up in situations of double or even triple discrimination, disadvantage, marginalization and vulnerability (including violence and harassment as well as forced labour.
“Maximizing the benefits of labour migration and minimizing the risks and social costs requires sound and effective labour migration governance,” said Ms. Hopalong Phororo, ILO Director for ILO Country Office for Zimbabwe and Namibia. “Expert studies and data show that migration, particularly labour migration, is an important enabler and beneficiary of regional integration and economic development in Africa.”
Across the world, migration is largely linked to the search for a job and better wages, and even if employment is not the primary driver, it usually features in the migration process at some point. In Southern Africa, as in many parts of the world, migrants face prejudice, intolerance and stigmatization in their workplaces and communities.
“It is necessary to advocate for improved migration management in Southern Africa, as a pivotal approach to addressing the challenges of migration, and ensuring that migration has a positive outcome for the country, migrants, and the members of their families”, said Mr. Ashraf El Nour, IOM Regional Director for Southern Africa.
The Southern African region has had a long history of intra-regional migration. All Member States of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) are involved in labour migration flows as countries of origin, transit, or destination and often they play the three roles at the same time.
In the SADC region, migrant workers are present in agriculture, fishing, mining, construction, food processing, domestic work, caregiving, cleaning, restaurants-hotels, transportation and retail trade.
The two day conference will promote fair, ethical and effective labour migration governance through tripartism that brings Ministries of Labour/Employment, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs, as well as workers’ and employers’ organisations and social dialogue particularly in the development of rights-based, gender-sensitive and evidence-based labour migration legislation and policies, taking account of labour market needs.
The conference will assess labour migration governance progress so far, gaps and challenges as well as main opportunities to consider in the SADC region. It will also identify tripartite constituents’ labour migration governance priority areas of collaboration, share existing and proposed good practices and recommendations and mention current roles and contributions. It will also provide a platform to tripartite partners to re-organise and re-strategize on labour migration governance in Southern Africa

Title: Message for the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women
Content: 25 November 2022
Violence against women and girls is the most pervasive human rights violation in the
world.
Every 11 minutes, a woman or girl is killed by an intimate partner or family member — and we know that other stresses, from the COVID-19 pandemic to economic turmoil, inevitably lead to even more physical and verbal abuse.
Women and girls also face rampant online violence, from misogynistic hate speech, to sexual harassment, image abuse and grooming by predators.
This discrimination, violence and abuse targeting half of humanity comes at a steep cost. It limits women’s and girls’ participation in all walks of life, denies their basic rights and freedoms, and blocks the equal economic recovery and sustainable growth our world needs.
Now is the time for transformative action that ends violence against women and girls.
This means governments designing, funding and implementing national action plans to tackle this scourge.
It means involving grassroots and civil society groups at every stage of decision-making.
It means ensuring that laws are implemented and respected, so survivors see their rights to justice and support upheld.
It means supporting public campaigns that challenge patriarchal norms and reject misogyny and violence.
And as this year’s theme — “UNITE: Activism to End Violence Against Women and Girls” — reminds us, it means standing with activists around the world who are calling for change and supporting survivors of violence. I call on governments to increase funding by 50 per cent to women’s rights organizations and movements by 2026.
Let’s take a stand and raise our voices in support of women’s rights.
Let’s proudly declare: We are all feminists.
Let’s consign violence against women and girls to the history books.

Title: WFP calls for action following World Food Day to avoid another year of global record hunger
Content: 20 October 2022
The world is at risk of yet another year of record hunger as the global food crisis continues to drive yet more people into worsening levels of acute food insecurity, warns the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in call for urgent action to address the root causes of hunger on World Food Day which was celebrated on the 16th of October.

“We are facing an unprecedented global food crisis, and all signs suggest we have not yet seen the worst. For the last three years, hunger numbers have repeatedly hit new peaks,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley.
"Let me be clear: things can and will get worse unless there is a large-scale and coordinated effort to address the root causes of this crisis. We cannot have another year of record hunger".
The global food crisis is a confluence of competing crises – caused by climate shocks, conflict, the prolonged impact of COVID-19 and economic pressures – that has continued to push up the number of severely food insecure people all around the world, including in Namibia, where out of a population of 2.3M, there are 0.3M (13%) who are consuming food insufficiently.
In WFP Namibia, we strive to achieve a better life for all through 32 sustainable food systems projects across the country with 1,457 direct beneficiaries. Additionally, 29 schools are piloting Home-Grown School Feeding (HGSF) projects with 11,730 beneficiaries. Finally, for cash-based transfers through the
Japanese government, 17,712 vulnerable people have been selected in Omaheke, Kunene and Oshikoto regions, including nearly 3,700 malnourished children under the age of five. Each family will receive a value voucher equivalent to US$ 38 per month for three months (October 2022- December 2022) to cope with the inflation in the price of food and commodities secondary to the Ukraine-Russia war.
Building on this year’s theme for World Food Day – “No one left behind” – WFP calls for coordinated effort across governments, financial institutions (IFIs), the private sector, and partners to mitigate an even more severe food crisis in 2023. This includes reinforcing national economies, social protection
systems, and regional and domestic food systems – at speed and scale.
"It is the business of each of us to practice the theme of this day by planting one fruit tree together with a crop wherever we live,’’ said Ms Ericah Shafudah, Deputy Country Representative of WFP Namibia.
This year’s World Food Day (WFD) celebration took place in Uukwiyuushona village on the premises of Uukwiyuushona Combined School on Saturday, 15th October 2022. The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform (MAWLR) spearheaded the preparation of WFD, and WFP participated as a sponsor.
The role of WFP was to support one beneficiary (a 55-year-old female farmer in Oshana) in setting up a shade-netted garden of 0.5 ha for the planting of spinach, carrots, cabbage and beetroot among other vegetables, for a diversified diet including income generation. The farmer will use the vegetables to
support a kindergarten with 19 children and a household of 7 people (26 beneficiaries in total). The total support cost for this activity was N$60,000 (US$ 3,500).
Another activity for this event was capturing a video as part of the FAO-WFP Namibia school meals Campaign (SMC) in the Mphe Thuto Primary School, Omaheke region. The video was selected for showcasing during the Junior World Food Day on the 14th of October 2022. While these efforts provide succour to some of the severely vulnerable, it is against a challenging global backdrop in which the number of acutely hungry people continues to increase requiring a concerted global action for peace, economic stability and continued humanitarian support to ensure food security around the world.
Other sponsors participating in the celebration by implementing various activities were the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), GIZ Namibia, Namibia Agronomic Board, Agri Gro, Coca Cola, NamWater, MeatCo, Namport, Choppies Namibia, Marco Fishing Charitable Trust, Namibia Agricultural Mechanization and Seed Improvement Programme (NAMSIP), Agro Marketing and Trading Agency (AMTA), Shivute Family Trust, Oshakati Town Council, Kaap Agri, Uukwambi Traditional Authority and the Ombandja Traditional Authority.
The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

Title: Connected African Girls Coding Camp Brings ICT skills to Namibian girls
Content: 16 August 2022
The opening ceremony to mark the ‘Connected African Girls Coding Camp’ is back this year with its 5th edition and for the first time it is in Namibia.

The coding camp is commissioned by ECA (United Nations Economic Commission for Africa) in partnership with the government of The Republic of Namibia (MICT), UN Namibia, UN WOMEN, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and Telecom Namibia.
The hybrid training brings together African women and girls between 12 to 25 years of age, with 100 from Namibia physically attending while hundreds more join virtually from around the African continent. The coding camp runs from 16 - 24 August 2022 and is hosted at the Windhoek Palm Hotel.
“The Government of the Republic of Namibia continues to support projects like the Connected African Girls Coding Camp as they directly benefit and uplift our citizens. The Government through the Ministry of ICT is committed to implementing effective legislation that provides easy access to ICTS with the aim of creating a knowledge-based society. Over the years, the Government has made significant strides to integrate digital technology with the national development objectives,” says Hon. Dr. Peya Mushelenga, Minister of Information and Communication Technology during his keynote address during the official opening.
“In our endeavors to ‘leave no one behind’ to harness ICTs in education will go a long way in contributing to achieving Goal 17 of Agenda 2063’s aspiration 6 which seeks to eliminate all barriers to quality education, health and social services for women and girls on the African continent,” says Sen Pang, UN Resident Coordinator, UN Namibia.
The African Connected Girls initiative aims to narrow the digital gap by empowering young African women and girls with the necessary foundational building-block skills to find long-term success in education, employment, and entrepreneurship, while creating a conducive environment for collaborative efforts.
The Namibian Connected African Girls Coding camp features four main workshops on animation, web development & gaming, IoT & robotics, and 3D printing. Graphic design is included as a common course in line with artificial intelligence, design thinking, and computational thinking. This camp will also feature master classes on Gender-Based Violence, UN SDGs, and Agenda 2063 including personal development skills.
“To prepare our young women to lead the fourth industrial revolution, we must champion initiatives such as the Connected African Girl initiative. Coding has become the new literacy! Girls and young Namibian women need to become digitally savvy and active participants in shaping Namibia's digital future,” says Jean Paul Adam, Director, Technology, Climate Change and Natural resources Division, UNECA.
On the final day of the camp, an innovation fair will be held enabling the girls to showcase their projects developed during the coding camp by targeting solution-oriented ideas in response to the continent’s socio-economic challenges. In the last four editions of the coding camp, trainees
have developed 198 innovative projects, of which 40 were recognized for their contributions to the community.
Some attendees from the Connected African Girls Coding Camp shared what they hoped to achieve with this initiative:
"I want to learn more skills to train others and start up computer classes at our school. I would like to learn more about ethical hacking."  - Ndapandula Hango, Grootfontein, Grade 10
"People are using technology more in this modern age, children must learn to use technology. I use technology for research and play games. I really want to learn to create my own games." - Caren Sue Kahmann, Hardap Region, Grade 9.
"I am obsessed with gaming. I want to gain more skills on how to design games and code. I am here for the skills that I can learn." - Theresia Ndilimeke, Grade 10 Khomas Region
"My younger brother introduced me to coding initially. In grade 10 I realised how important it is in relation to my subjects. I am very interested to learn how to use my subjects ( in the workshop) in a way that will help me develop new ways of entrepreneurship and help me improve the living standards in rural areas. - Latoya Bernard, Otjikoto Region, Grade 12

Title: World leaders are failing us on education, say young people
Content: 04 August 2022
Global youth poll shows more than two-thirds feel leaders are betraying their promise to provide quality education


Today’s education systems are failing a generation of young people and leaving them unprepared for the future, according to a global poll of 10,000 young people.
In rich and poor countries alike, a lack of support for teachers, outdated curriculum and a lack of digital connectivity are just some of the reasons leaving students without the skills to navigate today’s fast-changing world, the poll across 10 countries found.
The results reflect what experts are calling "a crisis of equity, quality and relevance" in global education.
The poll paints an alarming picture of the state of education all over the world. Nearly four out of five (77%) young people are “worried” about the prospect of poor education leaving millions of children without basic reading or writing skills by 2030. 69% say world leaders are not doing enough to ensure all children receive a quality education, while 88% think world leaders need to take urgent action to fund education.
Commissioned by the global children’s charity Theirworld, it comes a month before world leaders meet at the Transforming Education Summit at the United Nations in New York to make crucial decisions about children’s education.

Gordon Brown, the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, describes the historic summit as “global education’s COP26 moment – a last chance for action to avert an education catastrophe”.
World leaders will decide what action needs to be taken to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 of “inclusive and quality education for all” children by 2030 - but campaigners warn that education around the world has become “a privilege, not a right”.
Even before the pandemic, 260 million children were not in school, most of them girls. Covid-19 has deepened the crisis. Today, it is estimated that 70% of 10-year-olds in low- and middle-income countries are unable to understand a simple written text.  By 2030, experts predict that 825 million children – more than half the world’s children - will leave the classroom without even the most basic qualifications they need to get a job.
Nearly half of the young people surveyed who said they were disappointed with their education did not feel equipped for the future (43%); a third of those young people (33%) felt they were not learning or did not learn useful skills; and more than a quarter (27%) of students did not feel valued.

António Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General, said:
“Across the globe, education is in crisis. This is a slow burning and often unseen crisis, but it has profound consequences for individuals, societies, and our collective future. Reeling from the disruption caused by the pandemic, hundreds of millions of children and young people are still out of school.
“Many of those who are in school are not learning the basic skills they need, as citizens and participants in society. Many more are questioning the relevance of their education systems and curricula for today’s world.”
Despite the crisis in global education, three quarters (76%) of young people remain optimistic for the future, with more than four in five (83%) believing that youth can change the world through campaigning and making their voice heard.
That is why today (August 1), Theirworld and education campaigners around the world are launching a new campaign to mobilise young people all to call on world leaders to put in place the plans and finance required to provide a quality education for every child, no matter who they are or where they are born.
The #LetMeLearn campaign – backed by the United Nations Secretary-General – is calling for the experiences and voices of young people to be heard by leaders so that the right decisions are made to transform education for every child, not just the few.

Gordon Brown, the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, said:
"I have been listening to young people and they have one single message: Let Me Learn. It is it time that we take this seriously and bring their message to the halls of the United Nations and say to one another that we can be the first generation in history where every child goes to school.
“This historic Summit is global education’s COP26 moment – a last chance for action to avert an education catastrophe”.

Justin van Fleet, President of Theirworld, said: “The decisions world leaders make at the Transforming Education Summit will affect the lives of hundreds of millions of children around the world and reverberate through every community on the planet.
“Global education is facing a crisis of equity, quality and relevance. Currently, education is a privilege, not a right, and denied to children based on factors beyond their control at birth. It’s time for world leaders to listen to young people and take action today. Time is running out and inaction is not an option.”

Nhial Deng, 23, was born in Ethiopia where his father settled after fleeing the first Sudanese civil war more than five decades ago. In 2010 his village in Ethiopia was attacked by an armed militia and he fled to Kenya where he spent 11 years in the Kakuma refugee camp.
Last August, he moved to Canada after securing a four-year scholarship to pursue a bachelor's degree in global studies and digital communications at Huron University College.
He said: “When I fled my home 11 years ago, the first thing that came to my mind after arriving in the Kakuma refugee camp was school. I knew that school was the only way where I could make my childhood dream of becoming a journalist a reality.
“Although I was traumatized by the brutal images of war I witnessed while fleeing my country, the school gave me a safe space where I could heal from my trauma and think about a glowing future again.”

Title: Amidst global crises, UN High-Level Forum ready to advance action on Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 05 July 2022
Press Release



Amidst a world challenged by geopolitical tensions, a persistent COVID-19 pandemic, a burgeoning climate crisis and rising poverty, world leaders are coming together at the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) from today to 15 July to chart the best way forward to bring  the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) back on track. 

The eight-day Forum convened under the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) takes place as multiple crises around the world are putting the very viability of achieving the SDGs by 2030 at risk. The poorest and most vulnerable are being hit the hardest. An urgent rescue effort and collective actions are needed to rapidly change course and set the world on track towards a sustainable future, guided by a renewed commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation.

“We are facing continued vaccine inequity, rising inflation, major supply-chain disruptions, and crippling geopolitical uncertainties,” said United Nations Economic and Social Council President Collen Vixen Kelapile. “We are on a dangerous path to harming future generations, if we do not act now. It is within our power to turn the tide.”

Acting now critical to secure the global goals
Thousands of participants, including Heads of State, over 100 ministers, and leaders and representatives of the UN system, business and civil society will convene in person to respond to the impacts of the lingering pandemic and war in Ukarine, including  global economic inflation, rising inequalities and closely interrelate crises in food security, energy supplies and finance. Member states will discuss what action to take to build back better to secure accelerated implementation of the 2030 Agenda during the Decade of Action for sustainable development. 
 
This year, the Forum will review in depth Goal 4 on education, Goal 5 on gender equality, Goal 14 on life below water and Goal 15 on life on land as well as Goal 17 on partnerships for the Goals, which is considered each year.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, in his remarks at the recent second briefing by the Global Crisis Response Group, stressed that “we need to make resources available immediately to help the poorest countries and communities.” He called on the global financial system to recognize the opportunities in new technology and renewable energy and to “rise above its shortcomings and use all the instruments at its disposal, with flexibility and understanding, to provide support to vulnerable countries and people.” 

The HLPF will demonstrate the continuing commitment of the international community to step up international solidarity and to launch ambitious recovery policies that advance the SDGs. Both are indispensable in tackling  conflicts around the world.

“The urgent need for international solidarity and multilateral cooperation cannot be stressed enough,” said UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs LIU Zhenmin. “We need to act swiftly to drive transformative change. We must remain committed to the people-centered and planet focused path to prosperity that we set out in the 2030 Agenda. This can only happen if we all act together.”

44 countries to assess their progress
This year, 44 countries, both developed and developing, will present their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) of national implementation of the SDGs.

The VNR countries are: Andorra, Argentina, Belarus, Botswana, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, El Salvador, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Italy, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lesotho, Liberia, Luxembourg, Malawi, Mali, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Pakistan, The Philippines, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Switzerland, Togo, Tuvalu, United Arab Emirates and Uruguay.

The Forum will also mark  the official launch of The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022 (7 July). This annual progress report provides a global overview of progress towards the SDGs based on the most recent data. The 2022 report is expected to demonstrate the devastating impacts of the multiple and interlinked global crises – the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis and the conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere –  across the SDGs. 

The Forum will culminate in the adoption of a ministerial declaration. It will also kick off preparations for the Sustainable Development Goals Summit to be held in 2023.

Title: Launch of UN Energy Compact Action Network
Content: 23 May 2022
The UN Energy Compact Action Network launches with coalitions drawing on $600 billion in commitments to support energy access and transition, starting with Nigeria, Santiago, Namibia and others.
New York, 4 May 2022 – Against the backdrop of a global energy crisis and worsening climate emergency, today the UN took a major step to catalyse the large-scale action and support needed for the transition to clean, affordable energy for all and net-zero emissions, with the launch of a Plan of Action by some thirty leading organizations comprising “UN-Energy”.
Speaking of the interlinked triple crises of energy, food and finance arising from the war in Ukraine, UN Secretary-General António Guterres recently stated that “we can maximize this moment to push for the transformational change our world needs.” He added that “now is the time to turn this crisis into an opportunity,” to work towards progressively phasing out coal and other fossil fuels, and accelerating the deployment of renewable energy and a just energy transition, to address our worsening climate emergency.
An Energy Compact Action Network was also launched to match those governments seeking support for their clean energy goals with those governments and businesses that have pledged over $600 billion to support these commitments. Coalitions were announced to support energy access and transition in Nigeria and the city of Santiago, Chile, showcasing the Network’s potential, as well as to advance or expand coalitions supporting green hydrogen and a stronger role for women in leading and benefiting from the energy transition.
Mr. Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs and Secretary-General of the 2021 High-level Dialogue on Energy, stated: “The Global Roadmap that emerged from the High-level Dialogue calls for strengthened efforts by the UN system supported by UN-Energy, including the creation of a global multi-stakeholder Energy Compact Action Network. I welcome today’s launch of the UN-Energy Plan of Action and the Network. This will help us sustain the momentum by generating concrete action towards clean and affordable energy and net-zero emissions.”

UN-Energy Plan lays foundation for collective work

"Especially at this crucial time, I am pleased to launch the UN-Energy Plan of Action. The current context has led to a wider understanding of how energy underpins the entire 2030 Agenda. It is paramount that the commitments taken at the 2021 High-Level Dialogue on Energy and COP26 are translated into actions on the ground -- especially in support of the most vulnerable," said Mr. Achim Steiner, Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and Co-Chair of UN-Energy. "The UN-Energy Plan of Action is our collective response to today’s global energy and climate challenges. As part of this, UNDP is stepping up its energy work to support countries in achieving a just energy transition, helping them advance progress on the Sustainable Development Goals while tackling the climate crisis."
The UN-Energy Plan of Action Towards 2025 rolled out today sets out a framework for collective action by nearly thirty UN and international organizations -- in order to achieve the massive pledge they made at the time of the High-level Dialogue. In line with the milestones set out in the Global Roadmap, by 2025, UN-Energy committed to support, facilitate and catalyse, inter alia, 500 million more people to gain access to electricity, and 1 billion more people to gain access to clean cooking solutions, as well as a 100 per cent increase in renewables capacity globally, no new coal power plans in the pipeline after 2021, 30 million jobs in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and doubling annual clean energy investment globally.
To tackle these large-scale challenges, the Plan identifies seven work areas: 1) scaling  up collective UN-Energy action to close the energy access gap and ensure just, inclusive energy transitions that leave no one behind; 2) catalysing multi-stakeholder partnerships by scaling up Energy Compacts, including through the Action Network; 3) growing the momentum, by spearheading a global campaign for SDG 7 action; 4) leading by example, by greening UN-Energy organizations’ operations; 5)  convening an annual Global SDG 7 Action Forum on the margins of the UN General Assembly High-level Week in September; 6) informing global agenda-setting by providing analytical inputs and policy guidance to key intergovernmental processes; and 7) leveraging the power of data, digitalisation and visualisation for strengthening monitoring, tracking, accountability and the communication of results.
The Plan acknowledges that UN-Energy must tap deep into the capacities of its member organizations and build on their activities and networks that will be essential to operationalize the agenda set out, and that UN-Energy organizations will need to mobilize transformative actions by a huge network of diverse stakeholders in order to achieve the level of impact required on the ground.
Action Network harnesses the power of partnerships
The Energy Compact Action Network launched today, which will be supported by UN-Energy, brings together nearly 200 governments, businesses and other civil society partners who have made voluntary commitments to Energy Compacts, in order to direct investment, know-how and resources to help achieve the commitments made
Ms. Damilola Ogunbiyi, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All and UN-Energy Co-Chair, said: “The Energy Compact Action Network will play an important role as the only global platform that brings together offers of support and requests for support on SDG7 from all stakeholders, and across different areas of the energy transition – such as energy access, efficiency and technology. By creating opportunities for collaboration, the Network will transform the billions of dollars in finance and investment committed in the Energy Compacts into on-the-ground action towards the sustainable energy future that we urgently need.”
Today’s launch featured announcements by several new or expanded coalitions to demonstrate how countries, cities, businesses, foundations and other partners can join forces through the Action Network.

Title: Peer-to-peer learning workshop on policies for creativity
Content: 15 March 2022
Monitoring and Implementing the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions
UNESCO, in partnership with the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture of Namibia, is organizing a “Peer-to-peer learning workshop on policies for creativity: Monitoring and implementing the 2005 Convention for the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions” from 29 March to 1 April 2022 in Swakopmund, Namibia.
Originally planned in 2021 and postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this workshop, proposes to reflect on strategic orientations for future participatory policy monitoring and policy making for creativity in light of the upcoming “UNESCO World Conference on Cultural Policies and Sustainable Development Mondiacult 2022”.
This workshop builds on the results and achievements of a series of sub-regional training of trainers on participatory policy monitoring held in 2019, and of the implementation of the EU/UNESCO project “Supporting new regulatory frameworks to strengthen the cultural and creative industries and promote South-South cooperation” on participatory policy making and peer-to-peer learning.
Gathering representatives from fifteen countries from around the world, it is expected that the workshop serves as a policy lab on creativity, sustainable development and thinking the future post-COVID-19. Through focus group sessions, the peer-to-peer exchanges aim to provide opportunities to exchange knowledge and experiences leading to mutual learning on the future of policies for creativity. Moreover, these exchanges are equally organized with a view to create a community of practice around policy monitoring and formulation for creativity as well as to build local expertise and capacities.
To this end, the workshop will count on the presence of the 15 partner countries from the EU/UNESCO project as well as several African partner countries from the UNESCO-Sida project “Reshaping cultural policies”, and representatives from the sub-region that have engaged in the Quadrennial Periodic Reporting (QPR) exercise and in the EU/UNESCO project during the first phase. Representatives from Botswana, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Gabon, Georgia, Jamaica, Kenya, Mauritius, Mexico, Namibia, Palestine, South Sudan, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, and Zimbabwe, as well as members of the 2005 Convention Expert Facility, selected national experts and representatives from UNESCO field offices will thus be present.
The workshop is supported by the European Union and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.

Title: ‘Playing’ into Sustainable Development
Content: 12 May 2021
UN Namibia launched their latest youth engagement tool, Swift 30: SDG Edition.  This locally made board game brings the SDGs into the hands of the youth, to educate them on Namibia and how they can positively impact our future.
Our planet is at a critical point.  From global health crises to economic disparities to climate change, there has never been a more crucial time for our young leaders to step up and help come up with solutions to these existential challenges.  The United Nations (UN) is committed to tackling these issues by achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, and UN Namibia has come up with a unique and clever way to get Namibian youth to create changes within our communities and throughout the world.
UN Namibia launched their latest youth engagement tool, Swift 30: SDG Edition.  This locally made board game brings the SDGs into the hands of the youth, to educate them on Namibia and how they can positively impact our future. During the launch, UN Resident Coordinator Sen Pang, recalled playing games growing up and emphasised the knowledge building exercise as having the potential to teach young and old alike. “Even I learnt something new today”, he noted. The UNRC along with the Deputy Minister of Education and other stakeholders played the game to get a feel for the content and interaction it encourages.
Swift 30: SDG Edition was produced in collaboration with Ms. Ndeshi Fikameni and her company, Afroprintline.  This iteration follows the success of her first game, Swift 30, a game that drew its inspiration from the popular board game, 30 Seconds, but exclusively focused on Namibian topics – a game for Namibians by Namibians. Similarly, Swift 30: SDG Edition, which includes a colourful hand-sewn game board, appeals to Namibian youth with the aim to empower them to take their future into their own hands.
Speaking at the officially launch Swift 30: SDG Edition, Deputy Minister of Education, Arts, and Culture, Hon. Faustina Caley recognizes that initiatives such as this are of paramount importance to the development of Namibian youth. She commended this effort saying, “the Ministry welcomes the strategic partnership support in establishing non-school based opportunities for the Namibian child to relate to the SDGs and for catering to the diverse interest and talents of learners across regions.”
Twenty youth from various schools and organizations around Windhoek attended the event.  Together they learnt how to play the game, which came with a lot of friendly competition amongst each other. Orban Primary School learner Jasmine Schmidt, 12, spoke with excitement for Swift 30: SDG Edition explaining that she “learned a lot and it was super fun!  I hope others enjoy it as much as I did.” Claudios Rervelso, 19, from the Namibia Institute for Democracy (NID) described his experience as, “awesome and educational, everyone engaged in the game.  I personally want my peers to know about Swift 30: SDG Edition.”
Following its official launch, the team behind Swift 30: SDG Edition will continue to build awareness by engaging with schools, youth groups and other organizations through game activations and programming.  The SDGs are only attainable through a collaborative effort from all, and this game is a major way for the UN to reach a whole new audience.

Title: Namibia’s human rights record to be examined by Universal Periodic Review
Content: 29 April 2021
Namibia is one of the 14 States to be reviewed by the UPR Working Group during its upcoming session taking place from 3 to 14 May *.  Namibia’s first and second UPR reviews took place in January 2011 and January 2016, respectively.
Namibia’s human rights record will be examined by the UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Working Group for the third time on Monday, 3 May 2021 in a meeting that will be webcast live.
The documents on which the reviews are based are:
1) national report - information provided by the State under review; 2) information contained in the reports of independent human rights experts and groups, known as the Special Procedures, human rights treaty bodies, and other UN entities; 3) information provided by other stakeholders including national human rights institutions, regional organizations and civil society groups.
The three reports serving as the basis for the review of Namibia on 3 May can be found here.
Location: Assembly Hall, Palais des Nations, Geneva [NB: Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the meeting will be held using a combination of in-person and remote participation, and media representatives are encouraged to follow the proceedings on webcast].
Time and date: 09.00 – 12.30, Monday, 3 May (Geneva time, GMT +1 hour)
The UPR is a unique process which involves a periodic review of the human rights records of all 193 UN Member States.  Since its first meeting was held in April 2008, all 193 UN member States have been reviewed twice within the first and second UPR cycles.  During the third UPR cycle, States are again expected to spell out steps they have taken to implement recommendations posed during their previous reviews which they committed to follow-up on, as well as to highlight recent human rights developments in the country.
The delegation of Namibia will be led by Yvonne Dausab, Minister of Justice.
The three country representatives serving as rapporteurs (“troika”) for the review of Namibia are: Fiji, Sudan and Venezuela.
The webcast of the session will be at http://webtv.un.org
The list of speakers and all available statements to be delivered during the review of Namibia will be posted on the UPR Extranet
The UPR Working Group is scheduled to adopt the recommendations made to Namibia at 15.00 on 7 May.  The State under review may wish to express its positions on recommendations posed to it during their review.
* The UPR 38th session was originally scheduled to be held in January 2021, although was postponed due to COVID-19 measures.

Title: Human Development Report 2020 and  Namibia National Human Development Report 2019 Launch
Content: 24 February 2021
The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest crisis facing the world, but unless humans release their grip on nature, it won’t be the last, according to a new report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) entitled “The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene.”
This Human Development Report (HDR) 2020, lays out a stark choice for world leaders - take bold steps to reduce the immense pressure that is being exerted on the environment and the natural world, or humanity’s progress will stall. The publication of the 2020 HDR 2020 GHDR marks 30 years of Human Development Reports by UNDP.  It refreshes the construct of human development (HD) for a new geologic era and focuses on how HD can be expanded in balance with the planet. The 2020 report includes a new experimental index on human progress that takes into account countries’ carbon emissions and material footprint.
“Humans wield more power over the planet than ever before. In the wake of COVID-19, record-breaking temperatures, and spiralling inequality, it is time to use that power to redefine what we mean by progress, where our carbon and consumption footprints are no longer hidden,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.
Impressive progress, elusive SDGs
The report argues that as people and planet enter an entirely new geological epoch, the Anthropocene or the Age of Humans, it is time for all countries to redesign their paths to progress by fully accounting for the dangerous pressures humans put on the planet, and dismantle the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that prevent change.
The Human Development Report 2020 shows that, inequalities within and between countries, with deep roots in colonialism and racism, mean that people who have more capture the benefits of nature and export the costs. This chokes opportunities for people who have less and minimizes their ability to do anything about it.
According to the report’s accompanying Human Development Index (HDI), Africa has experienced one of the most significant improvements in human development. Namibia’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.646, which puts the country in the medium human development category, positioning it at 130 out of 189 countries and territories. From Sub-Saharan Africa, Namibia is compared with Botswana and South Africa, which have HDIs ranked 100 and 114 in 2019, respectively.
Between 1990 and 2019, Namibia’s HDI value increased from 0.581 to 0.646, an increase of 11.2 percent. Specifically, Namibia’s life expectancy at birth increased by 2.1 years, this means years of schooling increased by 1.4 years and expected years of schooling increased by 1.5 years. Namibia’s GNI per capita increased by about 57.0 percent between 1990 and 2019.
Although Namibia’s Inequality-adjusted HDI for 2019 is 0.646, when the value is discounted for inequality, the HDI falls to 0.418, a loss of 35.3% due to inequality in the distribution of the HDI dimension indices. And the Human inequality coefficient for Namibia is equal to 33.6 %. In comparison, South Africa shows a loss due to inequality of 34.0 %. The average loss due to inequality for medium HDI countries is 26.3 % and for Sub-Saharan Africa it is 30.5%.
The Namibia National Human Development Report (NNHDR) 2019 titled, “Addressing Inequality and Disparities: Towards a New Dignified Life for All Namibians”, introduces a multidimensional lens to analysing the drivers of inequality in Namibia. The report confirms that Inequalities exist in Namibia in terms of income, wealth distribution and the available opportunities, between women and men, urban and rural areas, and different groups within the population. When individuals do not have the same opportunities as others, they are hindered from achieving individual goals and reaching their full potential. The historical biases that have skewed the provision of opportunities have negatively affected various segments of society.
It notes that there is an unequal distribution of income within the Namibian population, despite the country’s classification as an Upper – Middle-Income economy.
The NNHDR found that, 65.5% of labour force in Namibia are in employment, while only 14% of the Namibian population earn a monthly wage income in excess of N$1353 – the minimum wage of private households as per Labour Commissioner And Domestic Workers Union Agreement 2017.
Further disparities in access to land or housing pose a major challenge; while women remain at a disadvantage in income, health, and protection. Moreover, education disparities in Namibia are defined by the urban/rural divide, regional variations, and income/wealth differences.
Women and men in urban areas (96% and 95%, respectively) are more likely to be literate than those in rural areas (90% and 85%, respectively).17.9% of households in Namibia have to travel a distance longer than 10 kilometres to the nearest health facility. Of those living in rural areas, 36.5% lived more than 10 kilometres from the nearest health facility.
Towards a new dignified life for all: An agenda to reduce inequalities in Namibia
This report draws conclusions from the trends and status of inequality in its multiple dimensions in Namibia, and proposes the following recommendations:
•Structural economic transformation and an efficient and effective financing mechanism;
•Integrated gender-responsive policies and programmes, as well as an effective and efficient social protection system for all;
•Investment in better research and development, measurement, and data collection and analysis, to deepen the understanding of inequality in Namibia.
In Namibia, the launch of both reports will take place on Wednesday, 24 February 2021 at the United Nations House in Windhoek.

Title: Despite progress, COVID-19 threatens to cause irreversible harm to children’s education, nutrition and well-being - says UNICEF
Content: 20 November 2020
World Children’s Day activities are held in over 130 countries to provide a platform for children to speak out about their concerns and advocate for children being left behind.
Gobabis, Namibia, 20 November 2020 – Data from 87 countries reveals that 1 in 9 known COVID-19 infections are among children and young people under the age of 20, according to a UNICEF analysis report called “Averting a Lost COVID Generation”, released yesterday ahead of today’s World Children’s Day.
The report comprehensively dispels the myth that children are spared the worst of COVID-19. Children – especially the poorest and most marginalized – are amongst the hardest hit from disrupted services and increases in poverty.
Speaking at an event on behalf of the President of Namibia H.E. Hage Geingob, the Ministry of Gender Equality, Poverty Eradication and Social Welfare, Hon. Doreen Sioka said
“ We have achieved many milestones which we are proud of and it is this progress that encourages us to recognise and address the emerging challenges brought forth by COVID-19 to ensure that no child is left behind.”
According to recent government reports, as of 10th November 2020, 15% of the COVID-19 confirmed cases in Namibia are in the 0-19 age groups – this means 1 in 7 of the total confirmed cases are children.
The reports further states that despite the overall decrease in the total confirmed cases since the lifting of the Covid-19 State of emergency, the casing continue to flare up in close settings such as schools and hostels.
“This is just the ‘tip of the pandemic iceberg’. Not only are children suffering the direct consequences of this disease, the longer this crisis continues, the worse it gets for children. Missed education, worsening malnutrition, and rapidly rising poverty all threaten a lost generation” said Rachel Odede, UNICEF Representative to Namibia.
Averting a Lost COVID Generation is the first UNICEF report to comprehensively outline the dire and growing consequences for children as the pandemic drags on. It shows that while symptoms among infected children remain mild, infections are rising and the longer-term impact on the education, nutrition and well-being of an entire generation of children and young people can be life-altering.
Using new data from UNICEF surveys across 140 countries, the report notes that:
• Around one-third of the countries analyzed witnessed a drop of at least 10 per cent in coverage for health services such as routine vaccinations, outpatient care for childhood infectious diseases, and maternal health services. Fear of infection is a prominent reason.
• There is a 40 per cent decline in the coverage of nutrition services for women and children across 135 countries. As of October 2020, 265 million children were still missing out on school meals globally. More than 250 million children under 5 could miss the life-protecting benefits of vitamin A supplementation programmes.
• 65 countries reported a decrease in home visits by social workers in September 2020, compared to the same time last year.
More alarming data from the report include:
• As of November 2020, 572 million students are affected across 30 country-wide school closures – 33 per cent of the enrolled students worldwide.
• An estimated 2 million additional child deaths and 200,000 additional stillbirths could occur over a 12-month period with severe interruptions to services and rising malnutrition.
• An additional 6 to 7 million children under the age of 5 will suffer from wasting or acute malnutrition in 2020, a 14 per cent rise that will translate into more than 10,000 additional child deaths per month – mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
• Globally, the number of children living in multidimensional poverty – without access to education, health, housing, nutrition, sanitation or water – is estimated to have soared by 15 per cent, or an additional 150 million children by mid-2020.
To respond to this crisis, UNICEF is committed to continue working with the Government of Namibia and development partners and the Private Sector – to seek solution to:
1. Ensure all children continue to learn, including by closing the digital divide.
2. Guarantee access to nutrition and health services and make vaccines affordable and available to every child.
3. Support and protect the mental health of children and young people and bring an end to abuse, gender-based violence and neglect in childhood.
4. Increase access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene and address environmental degradation and climate change.
5. Mitigate the rise in child poverty and ensure an inclusive recovery for all.
Namibia celebrated the day in Gobabis, Omaheke Region under the theme, “Kids Take Over” as part of the global “Reimagine” campaign which is focused on engaging children and young people. About 30 girls and boys out of school and children on the street aged 12-18, directed the programme and showcased their vision of the world they want to build amidst COVID-19 and beyond through song, dance and creative arts and crafts. During the week the children also participated in discussions and interviewed key political and government decision makers in Omaheke.
“As we are gathered here today, we are reminded of the impact of COVID-19 on the most vulnerable members of our society – children. We in Omaheke re-commit ourselves to work together with children – to reimagine their world where every child is safe, healthy, prosperous, has access to all services that will allow him/her to grow and develop to his/her full potential” said Hon. Pijoo Nganate, Governor Omaheke Region;

Title: UN Namibia releases “A Day in the Life of a Namibian Child” to commemorate UN75
Content: 10 November 2020
November 10,  2020: For the celebrations of the 75th Anniversary of United Nations, UN Namibia launched a special UN75 video with the title: “A Day in the Life of a Namibian Child”. Starring three school-age Namibian children from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, the video briefly crosses into their daily lives.
The video takes viewers into their world of hope, dreams, enthusiasm, and motivation to learn and improve oneself.  It portrays the rights of the child  to imagine their future and  the support available to help them  reach their full potential and achieve their goals.
The video provides a glimpse into the inequalities which exist in education as well as the economic impacts whether direct or indirect in supporting children to make important life decisions. It also takes the audience on an extended path to achieve equality, quality education, and better life conditions for all children, which are crucial in achieving of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The role players in this short video showcase the Namibian child as protagonists in the life story of many children, aspiring to achieve their hopes and dreams.
The changing world of work and the skills children need  to succeed are key areas of concern and calls for international collaboration for development in economic and social sector.
Being aware of the difficulties and economic and social inequalities that came to light even stronger during the Covid-19 pandemic, the United Nations acknowledges that more children are in need to be supported and the system will continue to work with Governments, businesses and the international community to develop inclusive programmes to address the inequalities that still exist.
The video is a reflection of the work spirit and the ideals of the UN in Namibia and intends to spread the word to urge each member of the society to go beyond the daily call to ensure access and quality education to all children, especially those left behind in these extraordinary times.

Delegates and participants from Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe representing Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce, Economic Development, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Industry and Trade, participated in the 26th ICSOE.   - The 26th Meeting of the Inter-Governmental Committee of Senior Officials and Experts (ICSOE) of Southern Africa elected Lesotho as Chair, Malawi as Vice-Chair and South Africa as Rapporteur to lead the Bureau. Delegates and participants from Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe representing Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce, Economic Development, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Industry and Trade, participated in the 26th ICSOE.
The Minister of Finance, Kingdom of Lesotho, Honourable Thabo Sofonea, officially opened the ICSOE. The Hon Minister noted that the new Bureau was assuming responsibilities in a COVID-19 environment which had impacted negatively on socio economic issues in Southern Africa. He noted that, although the current response to the pandemic was through emergency health and economic mitigation measures, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms were required to restore external balance, preserve debt sustainability and stimulate inclusive growth over the medium-term.
The Hon Minister emphasized that to this end, the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho acknowledged the pivotal role the private sector, especially micro, small and medium enterprises played in the recovery process geared towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In line with the theme of the meeting, “Policies and strategies towards effective private sector led growth and job creation in Southern Africa,” Lesotho had over the years placed the private sector at the centre of economic development programmes and strategies in the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP). On international, continental and regional aspirations, the Hon Minister noted that, "The theme is also consistent with the global and regional development frameworks which include the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), African Union Agenda 2063, SADC Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) 2020-2030 and the SADC Vision 2050.”
In his capacity as a Special Guest, the Minister of Finance, Zimbabwe, Hon Prof. Mthuli Ncube,  noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had forced many countries to swiftly expand social safety nets to protect the vulnerable from the negative impacts of the pandemic. He advised that the Government of Zimbabwe had introduced, a food grant of ZWL$2.4 billion to cater for food needs of at least 1 million vulnerable individuals for a period of eight months. This included 200,000 micro-enterprise owners whose businesses had been disrupted by the lockdown. He further noted that the pandemic had forced the Government to look more seriously at domestic solutions to addressing the requirements to deal with the fallout.
Some of the domestic initiatives include: the launch on 2nd April 2020 of the Domestic and International Humanitarian Appeal for assistance with a budget of US$1.8 billion for COVID-19 support in conjunction with the United Nations; implementation of the Vulnerable Farmers Input Support Programme, which provides free agricultural inputs to its beneficiaries; last but not the least, assistance to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to quickly resuscitate their businesses and recover from the effects of COVID-19 through the SME Development Corporation, the Women’s Bank, and the Empower Bank to enable them support small businesses to access working capital.
On behalf of the out-going Chair, Eswatini, Mr. Sibonginkhosi Christopher Mavuso, Promotional Officer, Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Trade commended ECA SRO-SA for providing technical assistance to member States on accelerating the domestication of regional industrialization despite the exigencies of the COVID-19 pandemic which reduced physical engagements with member States. He further applauded the Secretariat for facilitating the ICSOE for member States to dialogue on private sector issues, including micro, small and medium enterprises.
Prior to the opening, Mr. Sizo Mhlanga, Director, ECA Sub-Regional Office for Southern Africa (SRO-SA) in his welcoming remarks, noted that the pandemic had affected the capacity of some countries to meet debt-servicing obligations and thus accelerated the onset of debt unsustainability. He noted that the COVID-19 crisis had indeed highlighted the need for accelerating the building of productive capacities and the implementation of national and regional industrialization strategies as well as improving and strengthening the business environment to unleash opportunities for the Southern African private sector in the sub region and the rest of the continent.
While echoing the observations of the adverse impacts of the pandemic on the local economy including on employment, government finances and other socio-economic development parameters, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in the Kingdom of Lesotho, Mr. Salvator Niyonzima, acknowledged the sterling efforts by the Government as well as by the development partners community in addressing the fallout from the pandemic. He assured Delegates of continued technical support to member States from the United Nations Family.
The representative of the COMESA Secretary General, Ms. Providence Mavubi, Director, Industry and Agriculture called for continued strengthening of collaboration amongst member States, Regional Economic Commissions (RECs), and development partners towards   ongoing regional efforts to implement inclusive industrialization policies placing the private sector at the citadel of regional economic growth and job creation. She underlined the support provided by both the COMESA industrialization policy, the local content policy and the micro, small and medium enterprises framework in anchoring private sector growth.
The representative of African Union-SARO, Ms. Myranda Lutempo, Senior Policy Officer alluded to the need for all regional activities to be implemented on a continental level to ensure sustainability. Ms. Lutempo advised that the African Union Commission was promoting economic integration and private sector development through several key flagship projects under Agenda 2063.  She also acknowledged the “critical role that the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector played in inclusive economic growth and sustainable job creation”.
The meeting concluded with an outcome document which proffered recommendations and appealed to member States, United Nations and development partners to pull together resources to strengthen the national and regional macroeconomic environment, create a platform for the implementation of the AfCFTA in Southern Africa, enhance the role of the private sector and build back better post-COVID-19.

Title: UN Namibia launches “Better Tomorrow” to commemorate UN75
Content: 24 October 2020
Okahandja, 24 October 2020: To commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, UN Namibia released a special UN75 song titled, “Better Tomorrow.” The song features various Namibian artists including: Harry Rheeder, Suzy Eises, Lioness, Professy, Sean K, SheCantGo, KP Illest, Professy, DJ Shoza and Jeiyo.
The song is the culmination of art and music to promote the founding mission of the United Nations, which is more critical than ever. Co-written by the artists, “Better Tomorrow” underpins the ethos of the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs) that can bring us together, the inspiring blueprint for recovering better.
“The song is a reminder to Namibia and the world that to realize our shared visión of a better world for all, we must come together, for a #bettertomorrow,” said Mr. Sen Pang, UN Namibia Resident Coordinator.
The song was officially launched by Hon. Jenelly Matundu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation at the UN Day commemoration held in Okahandja’s Vyf Rand Community at the Ileni Tulikwafeni Centre.
The artists responsible for the beautiful song of hope for Namibia and the world, comprise of rappers, vocalists, producers and musicians with an instrumental flair. From the moment the artists heard the beat, it ignited the creative spark required. What followed were studio sessions to record each artist’s contribution. The flow was organic and the energy was authentic – elements which have equally contributed to this inspiring track.
“Better Tomorrow” speaks to positivity and solidarity within local and global communities that would spur a unified front in tackling socio-economic issues. The artists aim to reinforce the hope that we can all play our part in shaping our future together, for a better tomorrow.
UN Namibia in its endeavour to engage young people and provide a platform for youth to share their ideas, solutions and art have also provided upcoming artists with a platform to share their talent and showcase the strength of Namibia’s talent and resolve among youth to inspire solidarity.
UN Day was marked under the theme; “The future we want, the UN we need,” and the song is well aligned to this premise.

Title: UN Namibia commemorates 75th Anniversary
Content: 24 October 2020
Okahandja, Saturday,October 24, 2020: On United Nations Day, the UN Secretary General, Antonio Gutteres asked people everywhere to join together. “The United Nations not only stands with you…The United Nations belongs to you and is you: “we the peoples,” were the words expressed by the SG during his message to the world.
UN Namibia commemorated the organisation’s 75th Anniversary in Okahandja’s ‘Five Rand Community’ at the Ileni Tulikwafeni Centre. The commemoration was marked under the theme: “The Future We Want, the UN we need.”
Delivering the keynote address on behalf of the Hon. Nandi-Ndaitwah, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Hon. Jenelly Matundu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation, stated that
“The Government of the Republic of Namibia remains committed to the realisation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and will continue to invest resources to ensure that targets, as set for the specific goals are achieved.”

Mr. Sen Pang, UN Namibia Resident Coordinator reiterated the importance of achieving the SDGs,
“If we are to uphold our pledge to “leave no one behind,” we must redouble our efforts, in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular attention to the needs of the most vulnerable and that of women and children.”
Ms. Kaunapawa Hangula, Project Manager of the Ileni Tulikwafeni Centre received the UN’s donation of over 100 copies of the children’s story book “Frieda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)” specifically to nurture a culture of reading among children in the community and to learn more about the SDGs. Youngsters from the Vyf Rand Primary School entertained guests with local dances and song, which was a highlight for the participants.

Title: Buy Local Grow Namibia campaign continues to gain momentum
Content: 12 October 2020
Officially set in motion on 1 October 2020, the Buy Local Grow Namibia campaign continues to gain momentum as it runs for the duration of the month.The campaign is a joint effort between the United Nations Namibia, Team Namibia, the Namibia Trade Forum, The Namibian Newspaper and Weathermen & Co., and aims to encourage the consumption of Namibian products and services.
Upon delivering the keynote address at the launch of the campaign, Minister of Industrialisation and Trade, Hon. Lucia Iipumbu, elaborated on the part local businesses play in underpinning the nation’s economy and explained the need to promote this timely, home-grown initiative. Iipumbu:
“The [Buy Local Grow Namibia] campaign will highlight the vital role of local businesses in our nation’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.”
She further appealed to every Namibian to support the campaign and help stimulate Namibia’s economy.
It was precisely this collective call to action that the creative agency behind the campaign artwork, Weathermen & Co., sought to communicate. According to Vanessa Mengerssen, Senior Art Director at Weathermen & Co., “After receiving the brief, we wanted to create imagery for the campaign that would elicit a feeling of togetherness, following the example set by the organising partners who joined forces to launch this movement. We wanted to inspire that shared purpose among the Namibian people. Being a Team Namibia member ourselvesunder our holding company, the Ohlthaver & List (O&L) Group, we wanted to contribute to what we believe will be an impactful movement and did so by creating the campaign artwork at no cost.
“The look and feel of the campaign needed to celebrate the Namibian identity as well as illustrate the collective power we all have in owning that identity. The design components were aligned to the main objective of the campaign: encouraging growth at home through increased consumption of local goods and services. Using stylistic elements from the Namibian flag and the Team Namibia logo, we created the location tag as the central feature of the design, because our location – our home – is at the heart of the campaign. The hands around the location tag depict two key messages. Firstly, it is in our hands to nurture and uplift our economy and country as a whole; and secondly, the only way we will realise that progress is by taking hands and working together. Then there was colouring it all in – naturally with our Namibian colours.”
Acting Managing Director of Weathermen & Co., Patricia Hoeksema, who represented Team Namibia as a board member at the campaign launch, expressed her admiration for the collaboration between the organisers and emphasised the need for the nation to come together in support of this campaign. Hoeksema:
“We all need to own and champion our local products and services, becauseit’s only in our numbers that we will truly mobilize this movement and make a significant, far-reaching impact. I encourage everyone to make their dollar count for their fellow Namibian by spending that dollar locally.”

Title: UNAIDS issues guidance on reducing stigma and discrimination during COVID-19 responses
Content: 08 October 2020
GENEVA—Drawing on 40 years of experience from the AIDS response, UNAIDS is issuing new guidance on how to reduce stigma and discrimination in the context of COVID-19. The guidance is based on the latest evidence on what works to reduce HIV-related stigma and discrimination and applies it to COVID-19.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous forms of stigma and discrimination have been reported, including xenophobia directed at people thought to be responsible for bringing COVID-19 into countries, attacks on health-care workers and verbal and physical abuse towards people who have recovered from COVID-19. Attacks on populations facing pre-existing stigma and discrimination, including people living with HIV, people from gender and sexual minorities, sex workers and migrants, have also been reported.
“In the wake of the fear and uncertainty that emerge during a pandemic, stigma and discrimination quickly follows,” said Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS.

“Stigma and discrimination is counterproductive. It exposes people to violence, harassment and isolation, stops people from accessing health services and prevents public health measures from effectively controlling pandemics.”
Addressing stigma and discrimination in the COVID-19 response provides countries with rights- based guidance through education, support, referrals and other interventions.
It offers solutions across six specific areas: community, workplace, education, health care, justice and emergency/humanitarian settings.
As with the HIV epidemic, stigma and discrimination can significantly undermine responses to COVID-19.
People who have internalized stigma or anticipate stigmatizing attitudes are more likely to avoid health-care services and are less likely to get tested or admit to symptoms, ultimately sending the pandemic underground.
“We know what works and what doesn’t, we know how to change beliefs and behaviour. For the last 30 years we have been successfully leading the HIV response, building valuable experience, knowledge and wisdom along the way,” said Alexandra Volgina, Programme Coordinator, Global Network of People Living with HIV.

“We want to share these to change people’s lives for the better, and to make our distinctive contribution to overcoming the COVID- 19 pandemic.”
Some countries have used existing criminal laws or new, COVID-19-specific laws, to criminalize alleged exposure or transmission of COVID-19, putting more people in overcrowded prisons, detention centres and other closed settings where COVID-19 is easily transmitted.
“There is no greater manifestation of stigma than when it is enshrined in law. The use of the criminal law or other unjustified and disproportionate repressive measures in relation to COVID- 19 is having a devastating impact on the most vulnerable in society, including many people living with HIV, exacerbating inequalities and perpetuating stigma,” said Edwin J. Bernard, Executive Director of the HIV Justice Network.

“Measures that are respectful of human rights and empowering of communities will be infinitely more effective than punishment and imprisonment. We hope that these evidence-based recommendations on reducing COVID- related stigma and discrimination will make a difference to those who need it most.”
Reports in the early days of COVID-19 include discrimination related to gender and gender- based violence, targeting of key populations, including sex workers, and arrests and beatings of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. In April 2020, following a number of reports of violence and stigma and discrimination arising from the implementation of COVID-19 measures, UNAIDS began to identify the actions needed to respond, and in August UNAIDS issued a report, Rights in a pandemic, that highlights many of the human rights abuses that took place early in the response to COVID-19.
The new guidance, Addressing stigma and discrimination in the COVID-19 response: applying the evidence of what works from HIV-related stigma and discrimination in six settings to the COVID-19 response, is part of efforts by UNAIDS and the Global Partnership to Eliminate All Forms of HIV-Related Stigma and Discrimination to accelerate progress on the goal of zero discrimination, in line with the political commitments that United Nations Member States made in the 2016 Political Declaration on Ending AIDS and in Sustainable Development Goal 3, ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.

Title: Global Shapers Upskill Namibians and Support the UN’s Youth Strategy
Content: 07 October 2020
The aim of the United Nations Youth Strategy is to scale up global, regional and national actions to meet young people’s needs, realize their rights and tap into their possibilities as agents of change. In line with this strategy, the United Nations Information Centre  in Namibia welcomes and supports initiatives targeted at young people, such as Shape Skills, a pilot project designed and implemented by the Global Shapers Windhoek Hub.
The project aims to upskill 15 youth in Namibia to improve their chances of employment and career growth through a series of skills building workshops. The program is divided in four thematic areas:
The first workshop of the Shape Skills project took place on September 26, and it will be followed by weekly sessions until the end of October. The workshops will be delivered by the Global Shapers team in Windhoek, and, adhering to social distancing measures, all the sessions will be done virtually. Global Shapers’ vision and goal is for this pilot to be the first of numerous upskill projects.
Shape Skills responds to the high youth unemployment rate in Namibia, which was of 46% in 2018, according to the Namibia Statistics Agency. It also addresses the weakening economic conditions for employment aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. By implementing this project, Global Shapers and UN Namibia aim to contribute to Sustainable Development Goals such as No Poverty (Goal 1), Zero Hunger (Goal 2), Gender Equality (Goal 5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (Goal 8), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (Goal 9), and Reduced Inequalities (Goal 10).
This pilot project has already confirmed the relevance of initiatives that target youth development, that ensure young people are empowered to achieve their full potential, and that recognize young people’s agency, resilience and their positive contributions.
About the Global Shapers Windhoek Hub The Windhoek Hub is a Hub filled with young, dynamic individuals who are making an impact in their surrounding society. The Hub brings together young people who are willing to share their time and efforts in social projects to enhance and brighten the lives of the communities in and around Windhoek. We focus on projects that will have a sustainable impact. Together with our partners we aim to interact with stakeholders at various levels, share insights, make impact and inspire others to do the same.

Title: Africa’s Sovereign Wealth Funds are a Source of Development Finance
Content: 24 September 2020
SWFs will continue to be an influential and important source of financing for the SDGs. Many of their activities directly map onto the seventeen core targets of the SDGs, and there remains great potential for African SWFs to lead the way in facilitating long-term, inclusive, and sustainable development.
Windhoek, 24 September 2020 - COVID-19 is forcing policy makers to think innovatively about all available sources and options of development finance. In June 2020, Namibia announced the decision to set-up a sov­ereign wealth fund (SWF). If im­plemented, the country will join a select group of African countries already using this mechanism to fund and finance development.
SWFs are special purpose investment funds owned by state governments, which can be shielded from liabilities and can expand investment due to their lack of dependence on short-term liquidity. They comprise the gamut of domestic sources of public finance, in addition to tax revenues, non-tax revenues, public domestic borrow­ing, and public-private partnerships. The implementation of a SWF would help Namibia catalyse addi­tional and non-traditional finance.
There are various types of SWFs that countries have set up depending on their goals. They are classified as stabilisa­tion funds, saving funds, reserve funds, devel­opment funds and pension reserve funds without explicit pension liabilities.
Concerning development financing, SWFs can fund long-term projects, such as infrastructure, clean technology, real estate and agri­culture. For example, the allocation of about 1.3% of total SWFs assets to Africa would close the continent’s infrastructure financing gap.
Current African SWFs support local infrastructure develop­ment and align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including elimination of poverty (Goal 1), good health (Goal 3), quality education (Goal 4), clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), affordable and clean energy (Goal 7), stronger innovation and infrastructure (Goal 9), and sustainable cities (Goal 11).

Title: UN75: The Future We Want, The UN We Need
Content: 21 September 2020
Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN’s worldwide consultation reveals a strong call for action on inequalities and climate change, as well as more solidarity.
In January 2020, the United Nations launched the global consultation to mark its 75th anniversary. Through surveys and dialogues, it asked people about their hopes and fears for the future – representing the UN’s most ambitious effort to date to understand expectations of international cooperation and of the UN in particular.
It is also the largest survey to date on priorities for recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of 21 September 2020, over a million people from all countries and all walks of life had taken part. Their answers provide unique insights into what the public wants at this challenging time for the world. They are released today to coincide with the UN General Assembly’s official commemoration of the 75th anniversary, held under the banner: the future we want, the UN we need. Key findings include:
Priorities for action
Perceptions of the UN
“Across this anniversary year, we have engaged in a global conversation. And the results are striking.
People are thinking big – they are also expressing an intense yearning for international cooperation and global solidarity. Now is the time to respond to these aspirations and realize these aims. In this 75th anniversary year, we face our own 1945 moment. We must meet that moment. We must show unity like never before to overcome today’s emergency, get the world moving and working and prospering again, and uphold the vision of the Charter.” - United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres

Title: Responding to COVID-19 in Africa: Using Data to Find a Balance
Content: 21 September 2020
These findings are based on a new survey of over 24,000 adults in 18 African Union Member States, conducted by the Partnership for Evidence-Based COVID-19 Response (PERC).
New York, USA - 21 September 2020 : Six months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the secondary impacts of the virus on the African continent are undeniable: more than 40% of survey participants in need of health care services reported skipping or delaying care, 70% reported earning less money compared to the same time last year, and 70% reported problems accessing food in the past week. While most respondents favored reopening the economy, adherence to the “3 W’s”—wearing a mask, washing hands, and watching distance from others—remained high, pointing to a way forward for policymakers.
These findings are based on a new survey of over 24,000 adults in 18 African Union Member States, conducted by the Partnership for Evidence-Based COVID-19 Response (PERC). In its new regional report—the second in a series on “Using Data to Find a Balance”—PERC analyzes public opinion survey responses along with social, economic, and epidemiological data, and offers recommendations for governments as they navigate the ongoing pandemic.
Join high-level panelists from PERC members Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), Ipsos, Vital Strategies’ Resolve to Save Lives initiative and the World Economic Forum, to discuss key findings and how organizations can identify potential threats, coordinate responses and effectively communicate as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. A Q&A will follow the discussion.

Title: HIV and COVID-19: a unique moment in time to learn, leverage and build resilient systems for health
Content: 09 September 2020
On the opening day of the Virtual
Fast-Track Cities 2020 conference on urban HIV and COVID-19 responses, UNAIDS has released a new report on how to strengthen responses to health emergencies

GENEVA, 9 September 2020—A new report from UNAIDS shows how countries grappling with COVID-19 are using the experience and infrastructure from the AIDS response to ensure a more robust response to both pandemics. COVID-19 and HIV: 1 moment, 2 epidemics, 3 opportunities—how to seize the moment to learn, leverage and build a new way forward for everyone’s health and rights shows that by identifying the dynamic changes needed, systems can be found that are effective, inclusive, equitable and sufficiently resourced.
“Given the epic dimensions of the emergency, the world needs unity and solidarity,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. “Our decades-long fight against HIV offers essential lessons. By heeding those lessons and working together, we can ensure that national health responses deliver on the promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the health and well-being of all.”
The three opportunities highlighted in the report are: (1) that key lessons learned from the HIV response should inform COVID-19 responses; (2) how the HIV infrastructure is already driving COVID-19 responses and has the potential to catalyse accelerated progress; and (3) how the COVID-19 and HIV responses offer a historic opportunity to build a bridge to adaptable, results-driven systems for health that work for people.

“This is a unique opportunity to reimagine systems for health,” said Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “All eyes are on health, health systems and health care, with countries wanting to be better equipped to deal not only with COVID-19 but also to create healthier, more resilient societies. We can seize this opportunity by learning from HIV and from COVID-19 to make important changes to develop rights-based, equitable, people-centred systems for health.”
The report highlights how the HIV response can help to jump-start an accelerated response to COVID-19 in ways that can help to ensure that such efforts do not come at the expense of the HIV response or other essential health priorities. At the same time that the world undertakes focused efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, it must also redouble efforts to limit any interruption and promote rapid recovery of HIV-related services, including ensuring uninterrupted supplies of essential commodities and technologies for HIV and other global health priorities.
“COVID-19 has caused significant loss of life in many communities, but notably in those where inequities make people more vulnerable to ill health.

Leveraging of the HIV infrastructure and workforce has helped to mitigate what might have been a far worse situation,” said José M. Zuniga, President/Chief Executive Officer of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care and co-organizer of the Virtual Fast-Track Cities 2020 event with UNAIDS. “However, with current HIV spending substantially off-track, the world urgently needs to increase investments in the responses to both HIV and COVID-19 and not siphon off one to respond to the other.”
The extensive, dynamic and agile infrastructure that has been built up around the HIV response is being leveraged in many ways to assist the response to COVID-19 and includes innovative, community-led service delivery. For example, 280 000 new health-care workers trained by the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief are currently assisting as first responders to COVID-19 in many low- and middle-income countries.

In addition, 17 HIV treatment reference centres in Morocco are now functioning as the first line for COVID-19 treatment services. The HIV nongovernmental organization Housing Works in New York City opened two shelters specifically for homeless people who have tested positive for COVID-19.
The report highlights that although different in many respects, COVID-19 and HIV share important characteristics and that by incorporating key lessons learned from HIV, the response to COVID-19 can avoid many errors. One essential element is the buy-in and leadership of communities. Community activism has sped up the delivery of life-saving HIV medicines, community surveillance has alerted officials to dangerous medicine stock-outs and communities have delivered essential door-to-door HIV testing and treatment services and are leading efforts to strike down punitive laws that drive populations such as gay men and other men who have sex with men, sex workers and people who use drugs away from critical health services.
The report also shows the importance of firmly grounding health responses in human rights and the need for gender-transformative responses. Other actions include strengthening strategic information systems capable of delivering timely, accurate data on the pandemic to identify new outbreaks and global coordination, sustained political will and a multisectoral response.
“The emergence of COVID-19 has exposed the underlying weaknesses in health systems, which have proved to be under-resourced, unprepared and unsustainable,” said Ms Byanyima. “UNAIDS is urging that systems for health be reimagined to ensure that they are inclusive, just and equitable.”
Systems for health in the future must be prepared to address any new major health crisis by being agile, results-driven, inclusive and people-centred. COVID-19 and the response to HIV should be used as an opportunity to reimagine systems for health that work for people, maximize efficiency and effectiveness, attract sufficient resources and engage communities as essential partners for health.
The VirtualFast-Track Cities 2020 conference is taking place on 9 and 10 September, bringing together around 1500 representatives of more than 300 cities and municipalities around the world to discuss urban responses to COVID-19 and HIV. Anthony Fauci, Director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will give the keynote speech and UNAIDS will be presenting on the importance of the continuity of HIV services during COVID-19 and discussing mitigation strategies to protect gains made in the response to HIV.

Title: COVID-19: At least a third of the world’s schoolchildren unable to access remote learning during school closures, new UNICEF report says
Content: 28 August 2020
UNICEF’s Reimagine campaign calls for urgent investment to bridge the digital divide, reach every child with remote learning, and, most critically, prioritize the safe reopening of schools.

UNICEF’s Reimagine campaign calls for urgent investment to bridge the digital divide, reach every child with remote learning, and, most critically, prioritize the safe reopening of schools.
At least a third of the world’s schoolchildren – 463 million children globally – were unable to access remote learning when COVID-19 shuttered their schools, according to a new UNICEF report released yesterday in New York, as countries across the world grapple with their ‘back-to-school’ plans.
“For at least 463 million children whose schools closed due to COVID-19, there was no such a thing as remote learning,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “The sheer number of children whose education was completely disrupted for months on end is a global education emergency. The repercussions could be felt in economies and societies for decades to come.”
At the height of nationwide and local lockdowns, nearly 1.5 billion schoolchildren were affected by school closures. The Remote Learning Reachability report outlines the limitations of remote learning and exposes deep inequalities in access.
The report uses a globally representative analysis on the availability of home-based technology and tools needed for remote learning among pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary and upper-secondary schoolchildren, with data from 100 countries. Data include access to television, radio and internet, and the availability of curriculum delivered across these platforms during school closures.
Although the numbers in the report present a concerning picture on the lack of remote learning during school closures, UNICEF warns the situation is likely far worse. Even when children have the technology and tools at home, they may not be able to learn remotely through those platforms due to competing factors in the home including pressure to do chores, being forced to work, a poor environment for learning and lack of support in using the online or broadcast curriculum.
The report highlights significant inequality across regions. Schoolchildren in sub-Saharan Africa are the most affected, where half of all students cannot be reached with remote learning.
Schoolchildren from the poorest households and those living in rural areas are by far the most likely to miss out during closures, the report says. Globally, 72 per cent of schoolchildren
unable to access remote learning live in their countries’ poorest households. In upper-middle-income countries, schoolchildren from the poorest households account for up to 86 per cent of students unable to access remote learning. Globally, three quarters of schoolchildren without access live in rural areas.
The report also notes varying rates of access across age groups, with the youngest students most likely to miss out on remote learning during their most critical years of learning and development:
• Around 70 per cent of schoolchildren of pre-primary-age – 120 million children – cannot be reached, largely due to challenges and limitations to online learning for young children, lack of remote learning programmes for this education category, and lack of home assets for remote learning.
• At least 29 per cent of primary schoolchildren – 217 million students – cannot be reached. At least around 24 per cent of lower-secondary schoolchildren – 78 million students – were not reached.
• Upper-secondary schoolchildren were the least likely to miss out on remote learning with at least around 18 per cent – 48 million schoolchildren– not having the technological assets to access remote learning.
UNICEF urges governments to prioritize the safe re-opening of schools when they begin easing lockdown restrictions. When reopening is not possible, UNICEF urges governments to incorporate compensatory learning for lost instructional time into school continuity and reopening plans. School opening policies and practices must include expanding access to education, including remote learning, especially for marginalized groups. Education systems must also be adapted and built to withstand future crises.
In Namibia UNICEF has been working with the Government of Namibia through the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture to prioritized getting children back into school. When reopening is not possible, especially in regions that experiences a surge in infection, The Ministry together with UNICEF and WHO are developing standard operation procedures, that would ensure that the Ministry incorporates compensatory learning for lost instructional time into school continuity and reopening plans.
UNICEF’s Framework for Reopening Schools, issued jointly with UNESCO, UNHCR, WFP and the World Bank, offers practical advice for national and local authorities. The guidelines focus on policy reform; financing requirements; safe operations; compensatory learning; wellness and protection and reaching the most marginalized children.
As part of its Reimagine campaign aims to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from aggravating a lasting crisis for children, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, UNICEF is calling for urgent investment to bridge the digital divide, reach every child with remote learning, and, most critically, prioritize the safe reopening of schools.
###
Notes to editors:
The analysis uses findings from the UNESCO-UNICEF-World Bank Survey on National Education Responses to COVID-19 School Closures joint survey. The number of children potentially reached by broadcast media or internet solutions are based on the availability of related assets (TV, radio and internet) at home, not their actual use by children. Hence the number of children “potentially reached” are upper estimates of the reality of children “actually reached”. Paper-based coverage is not accounted for due to lack of reliable data.
The analysis does not focus on out-of-school children. For the latest data on out-of-school children visit: https://www.unicef.org/sites/default/files/2019-12/SOWC-2019.pdf

Title: UN Namibia confirms first case
Content: 17 August 2020
The United Nations in Namibia is sad to confirm the first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among its staff. The United Nations is working closely with the Government of Namibia (GRN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on prevention, preparedness and response of the pandemic in the country.
The Ministry of Health and Social Services (MOHSS) has initiated contact tracing, affected staff and contacts will be supported in line with global and national guidelines.
UN staff will telework from 17-19 August 2020 while the UN House is closed for cleaning and disinfection. The affected staff and contacts will be prudently supported in line with UN and national guidelines.

Title: Ministry of Health and Social Services, the Embassy of Japan and the World Health Organization (WHO) renew effort to address the Hepatitis E Virus Outbreak in Namibia
Content: 13 August 2020
The Namibian government renewed its efforts in containing the Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), which was declared as an outbreak since 14 December 2017. To this end,  the “Improving the national preparedness and response capacity to contain infectious disease outbreaks and other drought related public heath events in Namibia”  project worth close to four million Namibian dollars was launched by the Embassy of Japan,  the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS) at a ceremony held at the Namibian COVID-19 Communication Centre.
The project will be implemented in the  Khomas, Erongo, Omusati, Ohangwena, Kavango East and Kavango West regions by WHO in partnership with MoHSS for a duration of 12 months.
Furthermore, the funding will strengthen the national and regional capacity, which are essential components required to implement effective response intervention (ERI). ERI is central when containing infectious diseases particularly, with the ongoing HEV.
As of 28 June 2020, over seven-thousand (7,000) HEV cases have been reported, with the majority still from informal settlements in Windhoek (62%) and Swakopmund (21%).  Sixty-five (65) deaths were reported, of which twenty - six (26) are maternal deaths.
In accepting the gesture, Minister of Health and Social Services, Dr Kalumbi Shangula, described the project as having a “spin-off” effect for the COVID-19 response.  Dr Shangula further stated that over the past three years, MoHSS has been fronting and dealing with various disease outbreaks, making reference to the ongoing COVID-19 alongside HEV, as well as Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Anthrax.
Dr Shangula said: “When we are faced with a pandemic of this magnitude, the workforce, financial, infrastructure and other resources can feel the strain and previous gains can easily be lost in the process”.
The support will also go towards addressing drought-related health events, including severe acute malnutrition in response to the protracted drought of 2018-2019. Records from MoHSS reveal that for a period of eleven months, from April 2018 to March 2019, 50% and 11% of the total children weighed were moderately and severely malnourished respectively.  Moreover, of the total two - thousand - eight - hundred and sixty (2, 860) children admitted at health facilities due to severe acute malnutrition, two -hundred and eight - six (286), which is equivalent to 10% have died during the same period.
Also speaking at the same occasion, Namibia’s WHO Representative, Dr Charles Sagoe-Moses, emphasized the need to sustain investment in essential health services while attending to the urgency of the current COVID-19 pandemic.  Dr Sagoe-Moses mentioned that the project provides an opportunity to intensify efforts towards the HEV outbreak.
Specifically the project will:
In his speech, Ambassador of Japan to Namibia, His Excellency Hideaki Harada, explained that Japan plays a proactive role in international cooperation within in the global community.  Hence, Japan’s support to Namibia’s development policies such as Vision 2030, National Development Plan 5 and the Harambee Prosperity Plan aims to contribute to economic and social development together with improving welfare in the country.
Ambassador Harada stated that “the government of Japan decided this time to support the Namibian government’s leadership and efforts in partnership with WHO, as a trusted partner of Namibia and Japan in health, in order to ensure that all the members of the community can live a fulfilling life, through strengthening the health system”.

Title: Children’s story book released to help children and young people cope with COVID-19
Content: 09 April 2020
With the help of a fantasy creature, Ario, “My Hero is You, How kids can fight COVID-19!” explains how children can protect themselves, their families and friends from coronavirus and how to manage difficult emotions when confronted with a new and rapidly changing reality.
The book – aimed primarily at children aged 6-11 years old – is a project of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings, a unique collaboration of United Nations agencies, national and international nongovernmental organizations and international agencies providing mental health and psychosocial support in emergency settings.
During the early stages of the project, more than 1700 children, parents, caregivers and teachers from around the world shared how they were coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The input was invaluable to script writer and illustrator Helen Patuck and the project team in making sure that the story and its messages resonated with children from different backgrounds and continents.
In order to reach as many children as possible, the book will be widely translated, with six language versions released today and more than 30 others in the pipeline. It is being released as both an online product and audio book.

World Health Organization
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General
“Previous humanitarian emergencies have shown us how vital it is to address the fears and anxiety of young people when life as they know it gets turned upside down. We hope that this beautifully-illustrated book, which takes children on a journey across time zones and continents, will help them to understand what they can do to stay positive and keep safe during the coronavirus outbreak.”
UNICEF
Henrietta Fore, Executive Director
“All over the world, children’s lives have been completely upended – the majority of them living in countries with some form of restricted movement or lockdown. This wonderful book helps children understand and navigate this new landscape and learn how they can take small actions to become the heroes in their own stories.”
UNHCR
Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
“This is an important resource for children around the world with a strong message of inclusion at its heart – that this pandemic can only be beaten if everyone is included in its prevention and response. Children, including those who are refugees, displaced and stateless, can help too. No-one is protected unless we are all protected”.
UNESCO
Audrey Azoulay, Director General
“Sharing facts and reliable information is vital to respond to COVID-19, and I wish to commend the creativity and passion of all artists, writers and publishers who find compelling ways to translate and craft stories and artwork so they can reach children and families to comfort and guide them through a distressing situation.  UNESCO is proud to support this initiative and we see this as an example of the contribution of the artistic community to the well-being and resilience of all."

Title: COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan
Content: 25 March 2020
A global approach is the only way to fight COVID-19, the UN says as it launches humanitarian response plan
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres today [Wednesday, 25 March] launched a US $2 billion coordinated global humanitarian response plan to fight COVID-19 in some of the world’s most vulnerable countries in a bid to protect millions of people and stop the virus from circling back around the globe.
COVID-19 has killed more than 16,000 people worldwide and there are nearly 400,000 reported cases. It has a foothold across the globe and is now reaching countries that were already facing humanitarian crisis because of conflict, natural disasters and climate change.
The response plan will be implemented by UN agencies, with international NGOs and NGO consortia playing a direct role in the response. It will:
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said:
“COVID-19 is menacing the whole of humanity – and so the whole of humanity must fight back. Individual country responses are not going to be enough.
“We must come to the aid of the ultra-vulnerable – millions upon millions of people who are least able to protect themselves.  This is a matter of basic human solidarity. It is also crucial for combating the virus. This is the moment to step up for the vulnerable.”
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said:
“COVID-19 has already upended life in some of the world’s wealthiest countries. It is now reaching places where people live in warzones, cannot easily access clean water and soap, and have no hope of a hospital bed if they fall critically ill.
“To leave the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries to their fate would be both cruel and unwise. If we leave coronavirus to spread freely in these places, we would be placing millions at high risk, whole regions will be tipped into chaos and the virus will have the opportunity to circle back around the globe.
“Countries battling the pandemic at home are rightly prioritizing people living in their own communities. But the hard truth is they will be failing to protect their own people if they do not act now to help the poorest countries protect themselves.
“Our priority is to help these countries prepare and continue helping the millions who rely on humanitarian assistance from the UN to survive. Properly funded, our global response effort will equip humanitarian organizations with the tools to fight the virus, save lives, and help contain the spread of COVID-19 worldwide.”
WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:
“The virus is now spreading in countries with weak health systems, including some which are already facing humanitarian crises. These countries need our support – out of solidarity but also to protect us all and help suppress this pandemic. At the same time, we must not fight the pandemic at the expense of the other humanitarian health emergencies.”
UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta H. Fore said:
“Children are the hidden victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and school closures are affecting their education, mental health and access to basic health services. The risks of exploitation and abuse are higher than ever, for boys and girls alike. For children on the move or living through conflicts, the consequences will be unlike any we have ever seen. We must not let them down.”
At the virtual launch of the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan, the UN Secretary-General was joined via video link by Mr. Lowcock, Dr Tedros and Ms. Fore.
Together they called on UN Member States to commit to stemming the impact of COVID-19 in vulnerable countries and containing the virus globally by giving the strongest possible support to the plan, while also sustaining core support to existing humanitarian appeals that help the more than 100 million people who already rely on humanitarian assistance from the UN just to survive.
Member States were warned that any diversion of funding from existing humanitarian operations would create an environment in which cholera, measles and meningitis can thrive, in which even more children become malnourished, and in which extremists can take control – an environment that would be the perfect breeding ground for the coronavirus.
To kick-start the response plan, Mr. Lowcock released an additional $60 million from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). This brings CERF’s support to humanitarian action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to $75 million. In addition, country-based pooled funds have allocated more than $3 million so far.
This new CERF allocation – one of the largest ever made – will support: WFP to ensure the continuity of supply chains and transport of aid workers and relief goods; WHO to contain the spread of the pandemic; and other agencies to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to those most affected by the pandemic, including women and girls, refugees and internally displaced people. Support will include efforts around food security, physical and mental health, water and sanitation, nutrition and protection.

Title: UN NAMIBIA support Correctional Service through rehabilitation projects
Content: 04 February 2020
UN Namibia, through the United Nations Office on Drugs (UNODC), this week hands over a series of new facilities to the Namibia Correctional Service (NCS) to promote skills training and reduce re-offending of prisoners upon their release.
At the Windhoek Correctional Facility, new soap manufacturing machinery has been installed to afford prisoners the opportunity to develop expertise in a business area they can carry on post-release, while at the female centre, sewing and basket making training has been established. Elsewhere, at the Gobabis Correctional Facility, a hydroponics project has been set up to train inmates in sustainable farming practices. Additionally, at the Walvis Bay Correctional Facility, a system has been installed where prisoners are able to create greeting cards to generate income.
The equipment handover forms part of UNODC’s prison-based rehabilitation projects under the Global Programme for the Implementation of the Doha Declaration, which is aimed at helping countries achieve a positive and sustainable impact on crime prevention, criminal justice and promoting the rule of law. In Namibia, the programme focus rests on the component aimed at fostering prisoner rehabilitation and social integration.
During an official ceremony to mark the opening of the soap manufacturing facility in Windhoek, Mr. Alejandro Matta, Programme Management Officer, UNODC spoke on the benefit of this training approach, “We know that reoffending rates are highest among those who leave correctional facilities without any income generating skills. The soap and detergent making project that we launch today is one of the innovations not only introduced to equip inmates with useful skills to earn a living, but also to mitigate the high costs of supplying soap and detergents to the prisoners as well as improving the hygiene among the prison population.”
The soap manufacturing facility handover includes machinery and raw materials as well as the training of Correctional Officers and prisoners on how to operate the machinery to produce soap and related products. The project will benefit all prisoners in the 13 correctional facilities, positively impacting thousands of inmates.
The self-sustaining soap manufacturing project will produce soap to be used by the inmates, with the surplus to be sold to generate income to invest back into the project. Inmates working on the project will gain valuable vocational skills as well as gratuity to support their families. The equipment is already fully operational, with the first batch of soap produced in late-January.
Through this multi-location partnership between the UN and the NCS – which exemplifies the One UN approach through building synergies between organizations in support of national efforts – inmates at the various facilities are building skills which will foster their employability upon release, successfully integrate into society, and reduce recidivism.
Speaking to this, Correctional Officers at the Gobabis Correctional Facility responsible for the rehabilitation programme have reported improved behaviour, cooperation and team work among inmates spending time in the hydroponic greenhouse. In addition to these aspects, the project is also geared towards challenges being presented in the face of climate change and water scarcity.
Honourable Daniel V. Kashikola, MP, Deputy Minister of Safety and Security expressed gratitude to the United Nations in Namibia for their continued support to the NCS in projects implementation, drawing attention to the advantage the project brings to the country as a whole. “This project aims at conducting mass production of soap bars, washing powder and liquid detergents with adequate supply to all offenders across the NCS, providing enough to sell for an income to sustain the project.” He further added, “I am therefore, urging all Government Offices, Ministries, Agencies (OMAs) and private entities to engage the NCS for supply of their cleaning detergents, dish washing liquid, washing powder and bathing soap. I do not doubt the ability of this Soap making project to become the main supply of detergents in the country, especially to the Government OMAS.”
UNODC Namibia called on partners and the private sector to support the Namibia Correctional Services to complement the projects and provide support to expand and replicate to other correctional facilities.

Title: Partnership framework between GRN and UN for 2019-2023 launched
Content: 04 December 2019
The Director General of the National Planning Commission and Minister of Economic Planning, Hon. Obeth Kandjoze and the United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator (RC) in Namibia, Kiki Gbeho jointly launched the UN Partnership Framework (UNPAF) 2019-2023 on Friday, 27 April at the UN House in Windhoek.
Under the theme, “A Partnership for Eradication of Poverty and Increased Equality”, the framework provides an overview of the UN System’s engagement and functions in Namibia for the period 2019-2023. Through this framework, the UN system will support the Government of the Republic of Namibia (GRN) to achieve national and international development agendas.
Highlighting the linkage between the new framework and Namibia’s development agenda, Hon. Kandjoze said, “Our new partnership is fully aligned to Namibia’s needs and aspirations as expressed in our national development plans and policies such as Vision 2030, the Fifth National Development Plan (NDP5), the Harambee Prosperity Plan (HPP), the Blue Print for Wealth Redistribution and Poverty Eradication and also to the Global Agenda 2030 and the continents’ Agenda 2063, which, as a country we have fully taken-up as our very own.”
Aligned with NDP 5, the UNPAF 2019-2023 contributes to four main results areas: economic progression, social transformation, environmental sustainability and good governance.
The UNPAF 2019-2023 was developed through an intricate and long process to ensure that it is aligned to the shifting development dynamics in Namibia. This included a Mid-Term Review of the previous UNPAF 2014-2018, in 2016, a Common Country Assessment in 2017, and a Joint Partnership and Resource Mobilization Strategy in 2017. The framework’s outcomes and the UN’s interventions towards achieving Namibia’s long-term vision, Vision 2030, were determined through a strategic prioritization process. The GRN and the UN consulted with the private sector, academia, civil society, young people as well as bilateral and multilateral partners throughout the process.
Expressing delight with the extensive consultations that were done for the development of the UNPAF, Hon. Kandjoze said, “This ties in well with the old adage that finds its meaning in NDP 5 that ‘if you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go with the people’. This is a signal of the emphasis and importance we put on our people within the spirit of the Harambee and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ‘leave no one behind’.”
With the recent classification of Namibia as an Upper Middle-Income Country, the UN’s engagement with Namibia has shifted from one based on development assistance to one of development partnership, meaning that in addition to programming, the UN has shifted to providing technical expertise and building GRN’s capacity to deliver services, rather than taking the lead on implementing programmes.
Specifically, through the framework, the UN will focus on developing capacities of national institutions, fostering multi-disciplinary approaches to development, strengthening knowledge generation and management, as well as providing technical expertise, policy analysis and advisory support. UN Agencies, who are not based in Namibia, but are supporting programmes and projects, can also be found in the framework and are fully aligned to Namibia’s agenda.
“Winning the ‘War on Poverty’ and reaching our ‘last mile challenge’ will require a tremendous amount of hard work by all of us. Harambee will have to be a verb and not a noun. On my last day as the Resident Coordinator in Namibia, I am excited about the framework we are launching today. It recognizes the challenges and builds on Namibia’s solid development foundation towards ensuring that no one feels left out,” Gbeho stated.
Implementation of UNPAF 2019-2023 will commence in 2019, following the completion of UNPAF 2014-2018.

Title: Outgoing UN Resident Coordinator Gbeho leaves behind legacy of partnership
Content: 30 April 2018
Anita Kiki Gbeho, the United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator (RC) in Namibia, will take up the position of Deputy Joint Special Representative for the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation (UNAMID) in Darfur, starting in May 2018. UNAMID protects civilians, facilitates the delivery of humanitarian assistance, mediates between the Government of Sudan and non-signatory armed movements on the basis of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD), and provides support to the mediation of community conflict.
Since arriving in Namibia in August 2015, Gbeho has actively worked to strengthen cooperation between the UN and the Government of the Republic of Namibia (GRN). Her leadership in establishing the Development Partners Forum (DPF) and institutionalization of the Development Partners Dialogue (DPD), not only strengthened development support towards the GRN, but enhanced development cooperation in Namibia.
Under her stewardship, the UN achieved several milestones and earned the sobriquet ‘Partner of Choice’. Some highlights of successful interventions:
She leaves behind her legacy in the next partnership framework with the GRN, UNPAF 2019- 2023, which was launched on Friday, 27 April 2018. This framework is fully aligned to the HPP, NDP5 and the Blue Print on Wealth Redistribution and Poverty Eradication and outlines the UN and GRN’s partnership for the next four years to realize the aspirations of Namibians.
To address Namibia’s ‘last mile challenges’ and to reach those ‘furthest behind’, Gbeho encourages Namibia to continue focusing on improving data collection, efficiency of programming and coordination. At the same time, Gbeho encourages Namibia to continue empowering the youth, both women and men, Namibia’s largest demographic, to be the force for positive change.
Gbeho remains optimistic for Namibia’s future, stating, “It is important to keep building on Namibia’s ‘good stories’ to address the very real challenges that the country faces”. She believes Namibia can be an example of best practice on the continent.
Rachel Odede, UNICEF Namibia Representative, is the UN Resident Coordinator ad interim. Izumi Morota-Alakija, UNDP Deputy Representative, is the UNDP Resident Representative ad interim.
Ends.

Title: UN Day 2017: Youth encouraged to champion sustainable development
Content: 24 October 2017
In celebration of the 72nd anniversary of the United Nations (UN), the UN System in Namibia (UN Namibia) hosted an exhibition for learners aimed at encouraging the youth to use their voices to bring about positive change in line with national, regional and international development agendas. The exhibition, held under the theme, “United with UN Namibia for sustainable development” took place on 24 October 2017 at the UN House in Klein Windhoek.
Kicking off the exhibition, the UN Resident Coordinator to Namibia, Kiki Gbeho said that partnerships, not only with development partners, stakeholders and academia, but also with the youth, are crucial to eradicate poverty, save the planet and ensure prosperity for all.
“We challenge [the youth] to be the generation that creates a fairer world; a world with a health and educated population and where poverty is a thing of the past. We challenge you to unite for development,” the UNRC said.
Youth make up a large percentage of Namibia’s population, and according to UNESA, Africa’s youth population is expected to more than double by 2055. Demonstrating the innovation and drive of the younger generation, learners from the Sunshine Private School marimba band performed an original piece about the SDGs as part of the proceedings, encouraging the audience to use their voices to be the change they want to see and to achieve the 17 global goals.
The Deputy Minister of Economic Planning Hon. Lucia Iipumbu echoed the integral role of partnership in the achieving development agendas, specifically the Fifth National Development Plan (NDP5).
“Together we have put in place some solid foundations for shared progress, which I am convinced we will continue to build on. We will continue to empower women, engage the youth, uphold human rights for all, eradicate poverty and provide technical support and expertise to push the development agenda forward in Namibia,” Hon. Iipumbu said.
Following the event, learners and invited guests, including Deputy Ministers from Land, Fisheries and the Office of the Prime Minister, representatives from Namibia’s line ministries, representatives of the diplomatic corps and development partners, had the opportunity to learn
more about the UN’s work in Namibia and interact with various programme staff members. The dynamic exhibition also raised awareness of the United Nations Partnership Framework (UNPAF), the partnership framework between the UN Namibia and the Namibian government.
UN Day, an observance celebrated globally, marks the anniversary of the entry into force in 1945 of the UN Charter. With the ratification of this founding document by the majority of its signatories, including the five permanent members of the Security Council, the UN officially came into being. In Namibia, over 170 staff members make up the UN System in Namibia.
