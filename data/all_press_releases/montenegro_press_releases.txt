Title: UN Montenegro and governments of Montenegro and Switzerland signed a 2.5 million EUR contribution to the Montenegro SDG Acceleration Fund
Content: 07 February 2023
The Fund has been designed as a powerful catalyst for accelerating SDGs implementation in the country.

Podgorica, 7 February 2023
The Prime Minister of Montenegro Dritan Abazović, the UN Resident Coordinator Peter Lundberg and the Ambassador of Switzerland to Montenegro Urs Schmid signed an agreement today on the allocation of 2,5 million EUR for the Montenegro SDG Acceleration Fund. The Fund is a new generation financial tool established by the UN team in the country, which seeks to pool donor funds that will be directed towards development initiatives.
The Government of Montenegro allocated EUR 1 million for the Montenegro SDG Acceleration Fund, while the Government of Switzerland supported this initiative with EUR 1.5 million. Previously, the contribution to the Fund was determined by the Government of Luxembourg.
"The idea and vision of this Government is to make Montenegro a white and green destination. It is not an easy job, because we have to change a lot, and we have to have sustainable projects. I am more than sure that this Fund will give us a chance to find a good project and that after its implementation we will have a much better situation in terms of sustainable development,“ said Montenegrin Prime Minister Dritan Abazović.
Montenegro's contribution to sustainable development through this funding modality is particularly significant from the perspective of the country's size and economy. Montenegro hereby invests €1.3 per capita in sustainable development through the Montenegro SDG Acceleration Fund, which is more than all countries in the region. This also stands as clear indicator of Montenegro's strategic orientation towards sustainable development and cooperation with the United Nations.
UN Resident Coordinator Peter Lundberg pointed out that the Fund has been designed as a powerful catalyst for accelerating SDGs implementation in the country.
"The Montenegro SDG Acceleration Fund is a common vision of accelerated achievement of Agenda 2030. Considering the enormous development potential, the Fund can be an important tool for country’s development and achievement of national priorities, primarely country's accession to the European Union," said Lundberg, adding that the Fund is the result of a true development partnership.
Urs Schmid, ambassador of Switzerland, which is currently the largest donor to the Fund, pointed out that bilateral relations between Switzerland and Montenegro are very dynamic and that Switzerland is among the five largest foreign investors in Montenegro with around 800 million euros invested since 2003.
"Switzerland's participation in the Montenegro SDG Acceleration Fund will further improve relations between our two countries and I believe that our contribution will encourage other countries and development partners to join this innovative financial mechanism and to contribute that way to acceleration of reforms in Montenegro," said Schmid.
By consolidating and directing funds towards targeted development interventions, the Fund will be catalyzing not only SDGs but also acceleration of Montenegro's accession to the EU, given the high level of alignment between the Agenda 2030 and the EU accession process.
The Fund is designed to support strategic initiatives in three priority areas of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2023-2027: 1) inclusive economic development and environmental sustainability, 2) human capital development, reducing vulnerability, social inclusion and 3) social cohesion, people-centred governance, rule of law and human rights.

Title: Fighting hate speech is everyone's job
Content: 08 December 2022
Fighting hate speech does not represent limiting freedom of expression in an arbitrary or illegal way, but preventing hatred from escalating into discrimination, hostility and violence.
Podgorica, 8 december 2022
Dealing with hate speech was the central theme of the panel discussion "Silencing Hate" organized by the United Nations system ahead of International Human Rights Day, 10 December.
People who were targeted by hate speech because of who they are, what they do or because of the perception that they are different shared their experiences. Panelists and audience discussed possibille joint actions in facing the challenges that hate speech brings.
The UN Resident Coordinator in Montenegro Peter Lundberg, pointed out that Montenegro is experiencing an increase in hate speech and added that it is not the only country facing this problem.
“Unfortunately, we are witnessing the global growth of misinformation, fake news and divisive narratives that lead directly to discrimination, hate speech and even hate crimes. The scale and impact today, especially with social media as a global platform for spreading hate, is greater and growing faster than ever. This is why the United Nations adopted the Global Strategy and Action Plan on Hate Speech in 2019, within which we strive to, in cooperation with partners, take actions aimed at combating hate speech. Because the fight against hate speech is the job of all of us," said Lundberg, stating that fighting hate speech does not represent limiting freedom of expression in an arbitrary or illegal way, but preventing hatred from escalating into discrimination, hostility and violence.
The Minister of Human and Minority Rights, Fatmir Đeka, pointed out that Montenegro strives to maintain its European path and to improve respect for human rights as well as to persevere in strengthening tolerance and acceptance of diversity.
"Hate speech should be reduced every day, by turning to content which can contribute to our further education, general culture, raising awareness of essential things. By repeating what has been said, we give additional importance to negative streams.We need to continuously suppress negative phenomena in society. The catalysts of every change, good or bad, are we, ourselves," Đeka said.
The audience heard  testimonies of panelists who were exposed to various forms of hate speech, among which were members of the Roma community, the LGBT community, persons with disabilities, women and others who were targeted by the hate speech.
"I'm afraid we're normalizing hate speech and that's what worries me a lot. Hate speech is, above all, humiliation and persecution of those who are different, and it is high time for this topic to be opened seriously," said Sabina Talović from Pljevlja, who was a victim of hate speech.
Human Rights Day is commemorated every year on 10 December 1948, when the UN General Assemblyadopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since then, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been the basis for a growing system that promotes and protects the rights of all people in the world.

Title: Government and UN signed UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2023-2027
Content: 20 July 2022
Krivokapić and Lundberg signed the Cooperation Framework 2023-2027, setting the foundation of cooperation between Government and UN in the next five years.
Podgorica, 20 July 2022
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Montenegro Ranko Krivokapić and the UN Resident Coordinator Peter Lundberg signed today the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework UNSDCF 2023-2027, to pave the way for UN-Montenegro collaboration in the next five years.
Minister Krivokapić said that the next five years are crucial for Montenegro's cooperation with the UN and the EU, and that it would be useful to turn two parallel roads into a single path, which will end in 2027 with membership in the European Union.
Montenegrin Foreign Minister pointed out that the main benefit of all engagements of Montenegro with the United Nations, as well as with Euro-Atlantic partners, is full understanding.
“We feel like a country that has full understanding on its path to European integration, dignified membership in the UN, as well as belonging to the Euro-Atlantic community,” - said Krivokapić, emphasizing that this understanding is no less important than the multiple assistance we receive in areas that modernize our society, adding that the number of countries and agencies that support Montenegro is beyond any expectation.
Emphasizing that social inclusion is the way how small communities function and exist, Krivokapić said that they survive on solidarity and connection, which is not only economic and social, but also has an emotional note that gives the full feeling of living in one society.
Speaking about the parallel process of European integration, he said that there is no more time to delay, and that every wind is good for a ship that knows where it is going, while there is no good wind for a ship that does not know where it is going.
“Our path is the EU, but that path cannot be limitless, that path must have its own time frames set for Montenegro, through constant reforms that are achievable in the next five-year period, but also shorter than that,” said Krivokapić.
The UN Resident Coordinator in Montenegro Peter Lundberg said that the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, jointly adopted today, represents the foundations of cooperation between Montenegro and the United Nations in the next five years.
“This common vision of development, based on jointly identified development priorities, will help accelerate our journey towards the Agenda 2030, but also the EU accession of Montenegro," said Lundberg, emphasizing that one of major drivers of the process will be the Montenegro Acceleration Fund, a new generation of pooled funds to help solve development challenges.
Before signing the UNSDCF, the Government and UN team held the Joint Country Steering Committee meeting, to review implementation of the Integrated UN Programme (UNDAF) 2017-2022, including joint results in 2021 and plans for 2022.

Title: Closing conference of the Joint UN Programme "Activate!"
Content: 01 July 2022
Dešić: "The program opened a significant space for the transformation of social policies."
Podgorica, 1 July 2022
Developed tools and new insights for the implementation of better social policy and new services tailored to the needs of beneficiaries are the main achievements of the UN project "Activate! Integrated social protection and employment in order to accelerate progress for young people in Montenegro ", which was concluded today at the final conference that took place in Podgorica.
The initiative, abbreviated as "Activate!", aims at activating young people who thrive on the margins of society – the unemployed, those outside the education system, as well as those who do not possess the skills necessary for employment in the 21st century. Its goal is to foster the creation of opportunities for this population by means of efficient social policies and improved social services.
Peter Lundberg, the UN Resident Coordinator in Montenegro, pointed out that initiatives like this are especially important in times of instability and crisis, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.
"A key to accelerating development is through innovation, at all levels – in policies and service design. We hope that these new models will respond to the need and help decentralize cost-planning at all levels, so social protection systems can serve all people in need everywhere," Lundberg said.
Edina Dešić, State Secretary at the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, assessed that the program opened a significant space for the transformation of social policies.
"The results obtained from this project will be a significant input for the creation of social and child protection policies based on empirical evidence, in such a way that the support of the system is directed to those who really need it." Dešić emphasized.
Acting UNICEF Representative to Montenegro, Sabina Žunić, said that only through joint and cross-sectoral efforts and the establishment of a wide network of cooperation can we fight for every young person's right to live a dignified life.
"New approaches to empowering young people must include their greater participation in decision-making. Through this program, adolescents and young people are empowered, first of all, through socio-emotional skills workshops and support for their mental health. We will soon launch a web portal that will address these topics, because mental health is key to reaching all other goals in the lives of children and young people," Žunić said.
The project aimed at strengthening the social protection system has been implemented since November 2019 by UN agencies in Montenegro in cooperation with national partners – the Ministry of Finance and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Employment Agency of Montenegro, centers for social work and civil society organizations. The initiative is funded by the Joint SDG Fund, whose donors are member states of the United Nations, the European Union, international agencies, the private sector and individuals.

The President expressed satisfaction and gratitude to Mr. Lundberg for initiating the meeting, expressing hope that the cooperation with institutions in Montenegro is going well in times of emergency, both externally and internally.

The President emphasized that Montenegro is very keen on cooperation with the UN Office and agencies in the country, emphasizing that we are in a very important period of defining the 5-year framework for cooperation for the period 2023-2027, which requires competencies and functional institutions in Montenegro capable to responsibly and efficiently respond to the needs of further cooperation.

Title: Free speech: cornerstone of democracy, but not excuse for spreading hate speech
Content: 10 December 2021
We call for speech that shows full respect for the humanity and dignity of the other.
“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” Although seemingly simple and straightforward, article 1 of the Universal Human Rights Declaration remains a far cry for many. Discrimination but also other violations of fundamental human rights remain a reality for too many people around the world today.
Respect for the human rights of all is fundamental for sustainable peace and inclusive development. This was so the case in 1948, when the Universal Declaration was adopted, and it remains so today. In his Call to Action for Human Rights last year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated that human rights are essential to addressing the causes and impact of today's complex crises, and to building sustainable, safe, and peaceful societies.
In tackling the challenges we face, everyone’s opinion and criticism count. Everyone deserves space to express views freely and without fear, though – as international human rights law states – with respect for the special duties and responsibilities this freedom carries, one of which is respect for the rights of others. Here we have noted a challenge, one that is not unique to Montenegro: hate speech. We have observed hate speech based on ethnicity, national identity, gender, disability, sexual orientation, political or religious affiliation. It denigrates, dehumanizes, discriminates and excludes. It has led to a few hate crimes. Hate speech can threaten  peaceful societies as the Special Adviser on the Prevention Genocide, who leads the UN in tackling the phenomenon and who visited Montenegro in November, often warns about.
On the occasion of International Human Rights Day, the UN Country Team in Montenegro calls for more rather than less speech to counter the challenge that hate speech presents to our societies. We call for speech that shows full respect for the humanity and dignity of the other. And we ask leaders, may they be political, religious or otherwise, but also those who have influence, like traditional and the online media, to serve as examples. Let us all use this essential freedom for what it is meant – to create free, open, respectful societies in which everyone has an opportunity to take part, makes their voice heard and to ultimately contribute to a better life for all.

Title: OHCHR: Symbols glorifying convicted war criminals should have no place in the public space
Content: 12 November 2021
We call on the authorities in the region to abide by their international human rights obligations to ensure the rights to truth, justice and reparation.
Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Liz Throssell
Location: Geneva
Date: 12 November 2021
We are concerned at events this week in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, where police stepped in to protect a mural of the convicted war criminal Ratko Mladic painted on a building in the city centre.
The mural in Belgrade is not an isolated incident. Posters, graffiti, other materials and statements praising war criminals are found in other parts of  Serbia, as well as in various towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and elsewhere in the region.
Symbols glorifying convicted war criminals should have no place in the public space. Such symbols are all the more concerning given the recent rise in hate speech and denial of genocide and other atrocity crimes in the Western Balkans – developments that highlight the failure to address the past.
The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is particularly worrying, where such trends are deepening divisions.
We call on the authorities in the region to abide by their international human rights obligations to ensure the rights to truth, justice and reparation, as well as to adopt measures to prevent recurrence and to promote further reconciliation efforts. We call on them to condemn and refrain from all forms of hate speech and incitement to violence and to ensure the perpetrators of such acts are held accountable.
The UN Human Rights Office stands ready to continue offering its guidance on human rights issues to help people in the Western Balkans move forward with the transitional justice processes that are so crucial for the region’s future.

Title: The European Commission and the ILO join forces to support young people
Content: 20 July 2021
A new EC/ILO Technical Assistance Facility set up to pursue youth employment in the Western Balkans.
BUDAPEST (ILO News) – The European Commission (EC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have joined forces to support the institutions responsible for youth employment policy in the Western Balkans in introducing a youth guarantee (YG). The European Training Foundation (ETF) is also a partner in the realization of interventions. Inspired by similar schemes in the EU Member States, a youth guarantee is a commitment to support every young person under the age of 30 who is not employed, in education or training (so-called NEETs). This commitment entitles young people to receive a good quality offer of employment, traineeship, apprenticeship, or continued education within four months of leaving school or becoming unemployed.
The EC/ILO support includes the adaptation of the youth guarantee to the Western Balkans through policy, programming and monitoring support, advanced training, and peer-learning across Western Balkans and EU.
This EC/ILO Technical Assistance Facility (TAF) comes after the second EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Meeting on Employment and Social Affairs on 8 July, at which ministers and representatives responsible for employment endorsed a Declaration on ensuring sustainable labour market integration of young people . The Declaration recognises the disproportionate negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the labour market situation of young people and spells out a commitment to gradually implement youth guarantees in the region. The Declaration takes inspiration from the EU Council Recommendation of 30 October 2020 on A Bridge to Jobs – Reinforcing the Youth Guarantee .
Young people are bearing the brunt of the massive economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, youth employment fell by 8.7 per cent in 2020 compared with 3.7 per cent for adults. An examination of the share of young people who are not in employment, education, or training (NEET) provides a snapshot of young people’s overall vulnerability to the economic situation. Simply stated, if the employment rate goes down, either the NEET rate or the educational participation rate (or both) must increase. Clearly, a reduction of employment compensated by an increase in education is, in principle, more desirable than an increase in NEET rates. However, in the Western Balkans, the loss of employment and the rise in inactivity has not – in general – been offset by a return to education. In Montenegro, for instance, four out of five young people who lost their job became inactive rather than unemployed, but did not go back to education. NEET rates in the Western Balkan economies remained above the pre-crisis level throughout 2020, although in some cases they declined from their peak in 2020Q2, thanks to the measures implemented. In Serbia, one out of five young people fall within the NEET category, but it can be as high as one out of three in other parts of the region.
The ILO has called on  governments for action to prevent short-term exit of youth from the labour market turning into long-term exclusion for a generation of young people. The implementation of a youth guarantee could help in avoiding long-term scarring effects, i.e. the increased likelihood of more spells of unemployment or inactivity, lower earning prospects, and lower chances of obtaining a good quality job.
The ILO is a specialised technical agency that leads the action of the United Nations system on employment and the world of work. This partnership with the European Commission to facilitate the establishment of youth guarantees in the Western Balkans builds on the previous EC/ILO Joint Action on the Youth Guarantee  targeted at EU member states. It contributes to achieving the objectives set out in the EC’s Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans (EIP)  in October 2020. The EIP promotes long-term economic recovery, a green and digital transition, regional integration, and convergence with the European Union; it includes a flagship initiative on the Youth Guarantee with a view to offering better perspectives to young people and mitigating the brain drain.

Title: UNODC World Drug Report 2021: pandemic effects ramp up drug risks, as youth underestimate cannabis dangers
Content: 24 June 2021
Vienna, 24 June 2021
Around 275 million people used drugs worldwide in the last year, while over 36 million people suffered from drug use disorders, according to the 2021 World Drug Report, released today by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
The Report further noted that in the last 24 years cannabis potency had increased by as much as four times in parts of the world, even as the percentage of adolescents who perceived the drug as harmful fell by as much as 40 per cent, despite evidence that cannabis use is associated with a variety of health and other harms, especially among regular long-term users.
"Lower perception of drug use risks has been linked to higher rates of drug use, and the findings of UNODC’s 2021 World Drug Report highlight the need to close the gap between perception and reality to educate young people and safeguard public health,” said UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly.
“The theme of this year’s International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking is “Share facts on drugs. Save lives”, emphasizing the importance of strengthening the evidence base and raising public awareness, so that the international community, governments, civil society, families and youth can make informed decisions, better target efforts to prevent and treat drug use, and tackle world drug challenges.”
According to the Report, the percentage of Δ9-THC —the main psychoactive component in cannabis— has risen from around six per cent to more than 11 per cent in Europe between 2002-2019, and around four per cent to 16 per cent in the United States between 1995-2019, while the percentage of adolescents that perceived cannabis as harmful declined by 40 per cent in the United States and by 25 per cent in Europe.
Moreover, most countries have reported a rise in the use of cannabis during the pandemic. In surveys of health professionals across 77 countries, 42 per cent asserted that cannabis use had increased. A rise in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical drugs has also been observed in the same period.
Drug Use Rising, but Science-Based Treatment More Available
Between 2010-2019 the number of people using drugs increased by 22 per cent, owing in part to global population growth. Based on demographic changes alone, current projections suggest an 11 per cent rise in the number of people who use drugs globally by 2030 -- and a marked increase of 40 per cent in Africa, due to its rapidly growing and young population.
According to the latest global estimates, about 5.5 per cent of the population aged between 15 and 64 years have used drugs at least once in the past year, while 36.3 million people, or 13 per cent of the total number of persons who use drugs, suffer from drug use disorders.
Globally, over 11 million people are estimated to inject drugs, half of whom are living with Hepatitis C. Opioids continue to account for the largest burden of disease attributed to drug use.
The two pharmaceutical opioids most commonly used to treat people with opioid use disorders, methadone and buprenorphine, have become increasingly accessible over the past two decades. The amount available for medical use has increased six-fold since 1999, from 557 million daily doses to 3,317 million by 2019, indicating that science-based pharmacological treatment is more available now than in the past.
The Dark Web
Drug markets on the dark web only emerged a decade ago but major ones are now worth at least US$ 315 million in annual sales. Although this is just a fraction of overall drug sales, the trend is upwards with a fourfold increase between 2011 to mid-2017 and mid-2017 to 2020.
Rapid technological innovation, combined with the agility and adaptability of those using new platforms to sell drugs and other substances, is likely to usher in a globalized market where all drugs are more available and accessible everywhere. This, in turn, could trigger accelerated changes in patterns of drug use and entail public health implications, according to the Report.
The Drug Market Rebounds and Shifts
The new report shows that drug markets have swiftly resumed operations after the initial disruption at the onset of the pandemic; a burst that has triggered or accelerated certain pre-existing trafficking dynamics across the global drug market. Among these are: increasingly larger shipments of illicit drugs, a rise in the frequency of overland and water-way routes used for trafficking, greater use of private planes for the purpose of drug trafficking, and an upsurge in the use of contactless methods to deliver drugs to end-consumers.
The resilience of drug markets during the pandemic has demonstrated once again traffickers’ ability to adapt quickly to changed environments and circumstances.
The Report also noted that cocaine supply chains to Europe are diversifying, pushing prices down and quality up and thereby threatening Europe with a further expansion of the cocaine market. This is likely to widen the potential harm caused by the drug in the region.
The number of new psychoactive substances (NPS) emerging on the global market fell from 163 in 2013 to 71 in 2019. This reflects trends in North America, Europe and Asia. The findings suggest national and international control systems have succeeded in limiting the spread of NPS in high income countries, where NPS first emerged a decade ago.
Drug Risks, New Developments Spurred by Pandemic
COVID-19 has triggered innovation and adaptation in drug prevention and treatment services through more flexible models of service delivery. Many countries have introduced or expanded telemedicine services due to the pandemic, which for drug users means that healthcare workers can now offer counselling or initial assessments over the telephone and use electronic systems to prescribe controlled substances.
While the impact of COVID-19 on drug challenges is not yet fully known, the analysis suggests that the pandemic has brought increasing economic hardship that is likely to make illicit drug cultivation more appealing to fragile rural communities. The social impact of the pandemic –driving a rise in inequality, poverty, and mental health conditions particularly among already vulnerable populations-- represent factors that could push more people into drug use.

Title: Statement of the Special Adviser of the UN Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide
Content: 29 March 2021
New York, USA – 29 March 2021
The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu is very concerned at pronouncements from officials in Montenegro questioning the commission of the crime of genocide in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1995. She also notes a series of concerning developments in that country that contribute to sowing fear, mistrust and hate.
Genocide and other atrocity crimes must not be a matter of any kind of arbitration, especially those legally processed based on evidence. The terrible events that occurred at Srebrenica in July 1995 have been adjudicated by the ICTY and ICJ. Both the ICTY and the International Court of Justice have concluded that the acts committed at Srebrenica constituted genocide. There is simply no space for denial or relativization of Srebrenica genocide and the legitimacy of the ICTY.
The Secretary-General, in his message on the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina last year, called on “everyone in the region and beyond to counter hate speech and the rhetoric of division and narratives of mistrust and fear”. He noted that acknowledging the past is a vital step towards rebuilding trust, and that reconciliation means rejecting denial of genocide and war crimes and of any effort to glorify convicted war criminals. It also means recognizing the suffering of all victims and not attributing collective guilt.
The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide would like to remind that genocide denial divides people, communities and states; it feeds on and strengthens contested narratives about the past, the present and the future. It also undermines the judicial decisions that have been made and therefore undermines justice.  Denying the genocide in Srebrenica constitutes an attack on human dignity, particularly to the victims and survivors. It is unacceptable and must be condemned.

Alice Wairimu Nderitu has been appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres as Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide on 10 November 2020.

Title: Izjava Specijalne savjetnice generalnog sekretara UN za sprečavanje genocida
Content: 29 March 2021
Njujork, SAD - 29. marta 2021.
Specijalna savjetnica UN za sprečavanje genocida, Alis Vairimu Nderitu, veoma je zabrinuta zbog izjava zvaničnika u Crnoj Gori koje dovode u pitanje izvršenje zločina genocida u Srebrenici, u Bosni i Hercegovini, 1995. godine. Savjetnica UN primjećuje niz zabrinjavajućih dešavanja u Crnoj Gori koja doprinose širenju straha, nepovjerenja i mržnje.
Genocid i drugi zločini ne smiju biti predmet bilo kakve arbitraže, posebno oni koji su zakonski do kraja procesuirani na osnovu dokaza. Međunarodni krivični sud za bivšu Jugoslaviju i Međunarodni sud pravde donijeli su presude o strašnim događajima koji su se dogodili u Srebrenici u julu 1995. godine. Oba suda presudila su da djela počinjena u Srebrenici predstavljaju genocid. Jednostavno nema prostora za poricanje ili relativizaciju genocida u Srebrenici, niti za dovođenje u pitanje legitimiteta Međunarodnog krivičnog suda za bivšu Jugoslaviju.
Generalni sekretar je u svojoj poruci povodom obilježavanja 25. godišnjice genocida u Srebrenici, prošle godine, pozvao „sve u regionu i šire da se suprotstave govoru mržnje i retorici podjela i narativima nepoverenja i straha". Naveo je da je priznavanje prošlosti vitalni korak ka ponovnoj izgradnji povjerenja, a da pomirenje znači odbacivanje negiranja genocida i ratnih zločina i svakog veličanja osuđenih ratnih zločinaca. To takođe znači i jasno prepoznavanje patnje svih žrtava i ne pripisivanje kolektivne krivice.
Specijalna savjetnica UN za sprečavanje genocida podsjeća da negiranje genocida dijeli ljude, zajednice i države; hrani i jača sporne narative o prošlosti, sadašnjosti i budućnosti. Takođe podriva donijete sudske odluke i stoga podriva pravdu. Poricanje genocida u Srebrenici predstavlja napad na ljudsko dostojanstvo, posebno na žrtve i preživjele. To je neprihvatljivo i mora se osuditi.

Generalni sekretar Ujedinjenih nacija Antonio Gutereš imenovao je Alis Vairimu Nderitu za Specijalnu savjetnicu UN za sprečavanje genocida 10. novembra 2020.

Title: UNHCR and EU support the Ministry of Interior with Personal Protective Equipment and hygiene items to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission
Content: 26 February 2021
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency and the European Union donated today tens of thousands of personal protective and hygiene items to Montenegro’s Ministry of Interior to protect refugees and asylum seekers as well as the Ministry’s front-line workers. In all 50,000 masks, 50,000 gloves, 4,000 bottles of hand gel and 1,500 liters of medical alcohol were provided, the aim being to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission.
The donation is provided through a regional project Addressing COVID-19 Challenges within the Migrant and Refugee Response in the Western Balkans, which is financed under the EU’s Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace. In Montenegro, the project contributes to mitigating the risk of transmission of COVID-19 among refugees and asylum seekers and front-line workers by upscaling the healthcare services (including medicines) provided in the asylum system, along with improved sanitary infrastructure and availability of hygiene items and protective equipment.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created extraordinary and unprecedented difficulties across the globe and has rendered refugees and asylum seekers particularly vulnerable, including in some instances at risk of being left out of national anti-COVID programmes. UNHCR Montenegro has worked throughout this crisis to ensure that refugees, asylum seekers and front-line workers of the Ministry of Interior are protected at all times. The availability and use of Personal Protective Equipment is also essential for UNHCR and its partners to remain active in the field and continue delivering.

Adrian Edwards, UNHCR’s Representative for Montenegro
The support of the European Union has also been critical in ensuring continual provision of community-based activities and unimpeded access to services for asylum seekers, particularly psychosocial support in the centres where asylum seekers arrive. Furthermore, understanding that information can be life-saving during the COVID-19 epidemic, UNHCR and EU worked with the Ministry of Interior to ensure that asylum seekers and refugees have access to clear and factual information, in languages they understand, to be able to protect themselves, their families and the communities in which they live.
This unprecedented health crisis has heavily affected everyone in the EU and all our partners, including Montenegro. But, it is our help and support for those who are less fortunate than ourselves, in these difficult times that truly tests and proves our commitment to solidarity, as a fundamental value of a united Europe. Today’s donation of personal protective equipment is yet another proof of the European Union’s commitment to stand by Montenegro and to support the country in protecting migrants, asylum seekers, refugees and other vulnerable persons amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Oana Cristina Popa, EU Ambassador to Montenegro
Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Ministry of Interior has recognized the importance of donations and has repeatedly coordinated, through available mechanisms, the assistance for institutions and frontline workers.
No country can cope alone with such a challenging situation as the pandemic of coronavirus. Our optimism when it comes to overcoming this problem is strengthened by the strong support and expressed solidarity from our international partners.

Sergej Sekulovic, Minister of Interior of Montenegro
Today, the Ministry of Interior received a valuable donation of equipment that protects our employees, but also asylum seekers and migrants. “The Ministry of Interior is very grateful to our friends from UNHCR and the EU Delegation in Montenegro’, said Minister Sekulovic on this occasion

Title: Making peace with nature is possible, if we start now
Content: 19 February 2021
Even amid a pandemic, 2021 can go down as the year we made peace with nature and set the planet to healing.
As COVID-19 upends our lives, a more persistent crisis demands urgent action on a global scale. Three environmental crises - climate change, nature loss, and the collapse of nature, and the pollution of air, soil and water add up to a planetary emergency that will cause far more pain than COVID-19 in the long-term.
For years, scientists have  detailed how humanity is degrading Earth and its natural systems. Yet the actions we are taking – from governments and financial institutions to businesses and individuals – fall far short of what is needed to protect current and future generations from a hothouse Earth, beset by mass species extinctions and poisonous air and water.
In 2020, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) announced that, despite a dip in greenhouse gas emissions caused by the pandemic, the world is still headed for global warming of more than 3°C this century.
This month, the Dasgupta review reminded us what UNEP has long warned: the per capita stock of natural capital – the resources and services nature provides to humanity – has fallen 40 per cent in just over two decades. And we know that a staggering 9 out of 10 people worldwide breathe polluted air.
Finding answers to such daunting problems is complex. It takes time. But experts have developed solutions. The economic rationale is clear. And the mechanisms and institutions to implement them are already in place. There are no more excuses.
This year, the UN will bring governments and other players together for crunch talks on climate action, biodiversity and land degradation. COVID-19 has delayed these summits and complicated their preparation. Again, this is no excuse for inaction. These summits must show that the world is finally serious about tackling our planetary emergency.
To guide decision-makers toward the action required, the UN has released the Making Peace with Nature report. The report pulls together all the evidence of environmental decline from major global scientific assessments, with the most advanced ideas on how to reverse it. The result is a blueprint for a sustainable future that can secure human well-being on a healthy planet.
Our environmental, social and economic challenges are interlinked. They must be tackled together. For example, we cannot achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including ending poverty, by 2030 if climate change and ecosystem collapse are undermining food and water supplies in the world’s poorest countries. We have no choice but to transform our economies and societies by valuing nature and putting its health at the heart of all our decisions.
If we did this, banks and investors would stop financing fossil fuels. Governments would shift trillions of dollars in subsidies to nature-positive farming and clean energy and water. People everywhere would prioritize health and well-being over consumption and shrink their environmental footprint.
There are signs of progress, but the problems are escalating faster than our responses. We all need to not step up, but leap up, in 2021.
The number of countries promising to work towards net-zero emissions stands at 126. The ask is for all countries to deliver stretched nationally determined contributions ahead of the climate COP and immediately kickstart the transitions to net-zero. At the climate COP, governments must also finally agree on the rules for a global carbon trading market. The USD 100 billion that developed countries promised to provide every year to help developing nations cope with the impacts of climate change must finally flow.
As we also seek to agree an ambitious post-2020 biodiversity framework that ends fragmentation of our ecosystems, the ask is for us is to feed the world without destroying nature, felling forests and emptying our oceans.
We can create an amazing economy by moving to circular economic systems that resuse resources, reduce emissions and weed out the chemicals and toxins that are causing millions of premature deaths – all while creating jobs.
Addressing our planetary emergency is a whole-of-society effort. But governments must take the lead, starting with a smart and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that invests in the right places. They must create opportunities for future industries that generate prosperity. They must ensure that transitions are fair and equitable, creating jobs for those who lose out. They must give citizens a voice in these far-reaching decisions, even if it is virtual.
We can do it. The pandemic has shown humanity’s incredible ability to innovate and respond to threats, guided by science. In the three planetary crises of climate change, nature loss and pollution, we face an even greater threat than COVID-19. This year, we must make peace with nature and, in every subsequent year, we must make sure that this peace lasts.

Title: COVID-19 drives wages down, new ILO report finds
Content: 08 December 2020
GENEVA (ILO News) – A new report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) has found that monthly wages fell or grew more slowly in the first six months of 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic , in two-thirds of countries for which official data was available, and that the crisis is likely to inflict massive downward pressure on wages in the near future.
The wages of women and low-paid workers have been disproportionately affected by the crisis.
Furthermore, while average wages in one-third of the countries that provided data appeared to increase, this was largely as a result of substantial numbers of lower-paid workers losing their jobs and therefore skewing the average, since they were no longer included in the data for wage-earners.
In countries where strong measures were taken to preserve employment, the effects of the crisis were felt primarily as falls in wages rather than massive job losses.
The Global Wage Report 2020/21  shows that not all workers have been equally affected by the crisis. The impact on women has been worse than on men. Estimates based on a sample of 28 European countries find that, without wage subsidies, women would have lost 8.1 per cent of their wages in the second quarter of 2020, compared to 5.4 per cent for men.

The crisis has also affected lower-paid workers severely. Those in lower-skilled occupations lost more working hours than higher-paying managerial and professional jobs. Using data from the group of 28 European countries the report shows that, without temporary subsidies, the lowest paid 50 per cent of workers would have lost an estimated 17.3 per cent of their wages.
Without subsidies, the average amount of wages lost across all groups would have been 6.5 per cent. However, wage subsidies compensated for 40 per cent of this amount.
“The growth in inequality created by the COVID-19 crisis threatens a legacy of poverty and social and economic instability that would be devastating,” said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder. “Our recovery strategy must be human-centred. We need adequate wage policies that take into account the sustainability of jobs and enterprises, and also address inequalities and the need to sustain demand. If we are going to build a better future we must also deal with some uncomfortable questions about why jobs with high social value, like carers and teachers, are very often linked to low pay.”
“The growth in inequality created by the COVID-19 crisis threatens a legacy of poverty and social and economic instability that would be devastating."

Guy Ryder, ILO Director-General
The report includes an analysis of minimum wage systems, which could play an important role in building a recovery that is sustainable and equitable. Minimum wages are currently in place in some form in 90 per cent of ILO Member States. But even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic the report finds that, globally, 266 million people – 15 per cent of all wage earners worldwide – were earning less than the hourly minimum wage, either because of non-compliance or because they were legally excluded from such schemes. Women are over-represented among workers earning the minimum wage or less.
“Adequate minimum wages can protect workers against low pay and reduce inequality,” said Rosalia Vazquez-Alvarez, one of the authors of the report. “But ensuring that minimum wage policies are effective requires a comprehensive and inclusive package of measures. It means better compliance, extending coverage to more workers, and setting minimum wages at an adequate, up-to-date level that allows people to build a better life for themselves and their families. In developing and emerging countries, better compliance will require moving people away from informal work and into the formal sector”.
The Global Wage Report 2020/21 also looks at wage trends in 136 countries in the four years preceding the pandemic. It found that global real wage growth fluctuated between 1.6 and 2.2 per cent. Real wages increased most rapidly in Asia and the Pacific and Eastern Europe and much more slowly in North America and northern, southern and western Europe.

Title: The COVID-19 epidemic in Montenegro has deepened existing vulnerabilities and led to the emergence of new ones
Content: 16 October 2020
Some social groups are particularly affected by the COVID-19 epidemic in Montenegro such as families with reduced incomes, Roma families, children and people with disabilities, the elderly, children in foster families, single-parent households and households in which the parent(s) have a history of psychoactive substance use.
These are some of the key findings of the Rapid Social Impact Assessment of the COVID-19 outbreak in Montenegro, conducted by the UN system in the country in the second quarter of 2020, under the leadership of UNDP and UNICEF, and with the support of UNHCR, IOM and the UN Human Rights Adviser. contribution of UNOPS and ILO.
Montenegro has taken timely and decisive steps aimed at curbing the COVID-19 epidemic. But the necessary measures, both globally and in Montenegro, have led to a significant reduction in economic activity, which has affected majority of people of Montenegro and exposed a number of households to an increased risk of poverty. The crisis has deepened the existing vulnerabilities in society, but also led to the emergence of new ones.

Daniela Gasparikova, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. in Montenegro
The assessment indicated that victims of gender-based violence have been particularly affected during the epidemic. Helplines recorded an increase of SOS calls for 32% compared to the same period last year. According to the findings, children in such families, who are most often "invisible" victims and witnesses, were faced with a lack of adequate support – a situation that can have long-term consequences on their development.
In regard to general population, one third of Montenegrin families with children aged 6-18 reported difficulties in buying clothes and shoes for children. The survey showed that 16% of households with children under the age of 18 do not have a laptop or computer with internet access, which makes it hard to learn from home. According to the findings, 14% of respondents confirmed that they lost their jobs in the observed period, and one fifth (20%) stated their income decreased. The research also showed that employees with lower educational status were affected the hardest.
When it comes to households resilience, almost three-quarters of respondents said they have stocks and enough money for up to a month. The findings showed that, as a result of the epidemic and related measures, the households can afford less basic needs such as food and medicine than before, and the most difficult to cover are costs such as loan instalments, utility bills, apartment rent and schooling costs.
Particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly and people with disabilities expressed urgent needs for food, hygiene products, groceries and medicines, while access to health services was difficult for some of them. Children struggled with fears related to the health of their parents, but also with negative consequences of restricted movement. Young people and adolescents generally indicated the need for psychosocial support due to the growth of anxiety due to constrained mobility and social interaction.
The findings showed that the domicile Roma population was particularly affected, with majority of that respondents from that group reported earning significantly reduced incomes, or loosing them completely. They pointed to the urgent need for provision of food, hygiene products, medicines, clothing and accommodation, as well as for support for paying bills and finding work, as well as assistance with distance learning.
The research also indicated increased vulnerability of refugees, asylum seekers and persons at risk of statelessness. As many as 77% of respondents from those groups confirmed that they lost their jobs, while an increasing number of migrants living in Montenegro are facing a decrease or loss of income. Many of them are at higher risk of infection due to deteriorated living conditions, with migrants engaged in construction work at particular risk.
The Social Impact Assessment of the epidemic offers valuable data for creating policies and strategies that will address the needs of the most vulnerable groups. The analysis also suggested recommendations for mitigating the most severe consequences of the epidemic on vulnerable segments of society, which will help us in the UN, and I believe our partners, for medium and long-term systemic response, which needs to be inclusive.

Daniela Gasparikova, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. in Montenegro
The set of recommendations includes, among other things: the need for monitoring the conditions of the groups most affected; inclusion of members of these groups into the development of socio-economic measures; prioritization of services on which depends the dignity of life of members of the most affected groups; consideration of providing food and hygiene packages, and the necessary clothing and footwear for the most vulnerable; ensuring continuity and availability of health services and psychological support; support for children in distance learning and the continuation of subsidies to vulnerable families, especially those with school-age children; improving employment policies through targeted interventions aimed at increasing the employment of those who lost their jobs due to the consequences of the epidemic, with special emphasis on young and seasonal workers; as well as support in terms of transport and mobility.

Title: World Food Programme awarded Nobel Peace Prize
Content: 09 October 2020
The need for international solidarity and multilateral cooperation is more conspicuous than ever. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2020 to the World Food Programme (WFP) for its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.
The World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organisation addressing hunger and promoting food security. In 2019, the WFP provided assistance to close to 100 million people in 88 countries who are victims of acute food insecurity and hunger. In 2015, eradicating hunger was adopted as one of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The WFP is the UN’s primary instrument for realising this goal. In recent years, the situation has taken a negative turn. In 2019, 135 million people suffered from acute hunger, the highest number in many years. Most of the increase was caused by war and armed conflict.
The coronavirus pandemic has contributed to a strong upsurge in the number of victims of hunger in the world. In countries such as Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Burkina Faso, the combination of violent conflict and the pandemic has led to a dramatic rise in the number of people living on the brink of starvation. In the face of the pandemic, the World Food Programme has demonstrated an impressive ability to intensify its efforts. As the organisation itself has stated, “Until the day we have a medical vaccine, food is the best vaccine against chaos.”
The world is in danger of experiencing a hunger crisis of inconceivable proportions if the World Food Programme and other food assistance organisations do not receive the financial support they have requested.
The link between hunger and armed conflict is a vicious circle: war and conflict can cause food insecurity and hunger, just as hunger and food insecurity can cause latent conflicts to flare up and trigger the use of violence. We will never achieve the goal of zero hunger unless we also put an end to war and armed conflict.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to emphasise that providing assistance to increase food security not only prevents hunger, but can also help to improve prospects for stability and peace. The World Food Programme has taken the lead in combining humanitarian work with peace efforts through pioneering projects in South America, Africa and Asia.
The World Food Programme was an active participant in the diplomatic process that culminated in May 2018 in the UN Security Council’s unanimous adoption of Resolution 2417, which for the first time explicitly addressed the link between conflict and hunger. The Security Council also underscored UN Member States’ obligation to help ensure that food assistance reaches those in need, and condemned the use of starvation as a method of warfare.
With this year’s award, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to turn the eyes of the world towards the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger. The World Food Programme plays a key role in multilateral cooperation on making food security an instrument of peace, and has made a strong contribution towards mobilising UN Member States to combat the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict. The organisation contributes daily to advancing the fraternity of nations referred to in Alfred Nobel’s will. As the UN’s largest specialised agency, the World Food Programme is a modern version of the peace congresses that the Nobel Peace Prize is intended to promote.
The work of the World Food Programme to the benefit of humankind is an endeavour that all the nations of the world should be able to endorse and support.

Title: New Mobile Translation App Helping IOM’s Work with COVID-19 in the Western Balkans
Content: 18 May 2020
Since the arrival of COVID-19, MiTA — IOM’s new Migration Translation App—has been given a rapid upgrade to take account of the added challenges facing migrants in the Western Balkans.
A new section is designed to help border management officials identify persons at risk and refer them for medical screening. It includes questions related to basic symptoms, recent travel history, and travel companions.
“Migrants face more than physical barriers on their journeys”, explained Donatella Bradic, programme manager with IOM in Serbia. “Effective communication in a language that both migrants and border officials understand is crucial in identifying the immediate needs of the migrant and ensuring an appropriate and protection-sensitive response. That’s why we designed this App, and it’s already proving a boon in a time of COVID-19”
IOM has been working closely with border management authorities in the Western Balkans to develop a bespoke solution since 2018, with EU funding.
“We had a number of key requirements,” added IOM’s Bradic. “Any system would have to be available at all times, be simple and reliable, operationally and financially sustainable and respect the rights and privacy of both migrants and border officials.”
Earlier this year, the Organization began trial on the MiTA, a mobile application, which facilitates basic communication between migration management officials and migrants during border procedures and situations of first contact.
MiTA is a free, custom-built offline application which contains 52 simple questions relating to the identity, mode of travel, health and immediate protection needs of the migrants. The questions and answer options are translated into 12 languages (English, Macedonian, Albanian, Bosnian/Montenegrin/Serbian, French, Turkish, Arabic, Pashto, Urdu, Kurdish, Somali and Farsi), and can be “read aloud” as sound recordings.
The languages included in MiTA are those spoken most frequently by migrants that encounter border officials in the Western Balkans. MiTA can also display a world map so that the migrants can easily communicate their travel routes and destination, as well as a calendar in two different formats (Gregorian and Hijri).
MiTA does not store any personal information about migrants or users, but it does allow users to export the answers provided by the migrant as an email message or to download them in a PDF format on the mobile device.
MiTA is available for:
MiTA – The Migration Translation Application was developed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) – The UN Migration Agency within the regional IPA 2 project “Regional Support to Protection Sensitive Migration Management in the Western Balkans and Turkey”, funded by the European Union.

Title: New normal? Better normal!
Content: 01 May 2020
In these times of COVID-19 , the big challenge for most of us is how to protect ourselves and our families from the virus and how to hold on to our jobs. For policy-makers that translates into beating the pandemic without doing irreversible damage to the economy in the process.
With over 3 million cases and some 250,000 deaths from the virus to date globally, and the expected loss of the equivalent of 305 million jobs worldwide by mid-year, the stakes have never been higher. Governments continue to “follow the science” in the search for the best solutions while foregoing the obvious benefits of much greater international cooperation in building the needed global response to the global challenge.
But with the war against COVID-19 still to be won, it has become commonplace that what awaits us after victory is a “new normal” in the way society is organized and the way we will work.
This is hardly reassuring.
Because nobody seems able to say what the new normal will be. Because the message is that it will be dictated by the constraints imposed by the pandemic rather than our choices and preferences. And because we’ve heard it before. The mantra which provided the mood music of the crash of 2008-2009 was that once the vaccine to the virus of financial excess had been developed and applied, the global economy would be safer, fairer, more sustainable. But that didn’t happen. The old normal was restored with a vengeance and those on the lower echelons of labour markets found themselves even further behind.
Now is the time to look more closely at this new normal, and start on the task of making it a better normal, not so much for those who already have much, but for those who so obviously have too little.
This pandemic has laid bare in the cruellest way, the extraordinary precariousness and injustices of our world of work. It is the decimation of livelihoods in the informal economy – where six out of ten workers make a living – which has ignited the warnings from our colleagues in the World Food Programme, of the coming pandemic of hunger. It is the gaping holes in the social protection systems of even the richest countries, which have left millions in situations of deprivation. It is the failure to guarantee workplace safety that condemns nearly 3 million to die each year because of the work they do. And it is the unchecked dynamic of growing inequality which means that if, in medical terms, the virus does not discriminate between its victims in its social and economic impact, it discriminates brutally against the poorest and the powerless.
The only thing that should surprise us in all this is that we are surprised. Before the pandemic, the manifest deficits in decent work were mostly played out in individual episodes of quiet desperation. It has taken the calamity of COVID-19 to aggregate them into the collective social cataclysm the world faces today. But we always knew: we simply chose not to care. By and large, policy choices by commission or omission accentuated rather than alleviated the problem.
Fifty-two years ago, Martin Luther King, in a speech to striking sanitation workers on the eve of his assassination reminded the world that there is dignity in all labour. Today, the virus has similarly highlighted the always essential role of the working heroes of this pandemic. People who are usually invisible, unconsidered, undervalued, even ignored. Health and care workers, cleaners, supermarket cashiers, transport staff – too often numbered among the ranks of the working poor and the insecure.
Today the denial of dignity to these, and to millions of others, stand as a symbol of past policy failures and our future responsibilities.
On May Day next year we trust that the pressing emergency of COVID-19 will be behind us. But we will have before us the task of building a future of work which tackles the injustices that the pandemic has highlighted, together with the permanent and no longer postponable challenges of climate, digital and demographic transition.
This is what defines the better normal that has to be the lasting legacy of the global health emergency of 2020.

Title: A new normal: UN lays out roadmap to lift economies and save jobs after COVID-19
Content: 27 April 2020
New York, 27 April 2020 – The urgent health crisis that is COVID-19 has created a historic recession with record levels of deprivation and unemployment, creating an unprecedented human crisis that is hitting the poorest hardest, especially women and children. In a new framework released today as a roadmap to support countries’ path to social and economic recovery, the United Nations calls for an extraordinary scale-up of international support and political commitment to ensure that people everywhere have access to essential services and social protection.
The “United Nations Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19: Shared responsibility, global solidarity and urgent action for people in need”  calls for protecting jobs, businesses and livelihoods to set in motion a safe recovery of societies and economies as soon as possible for a more sustainable, gender-equal, and carbon-neutral path—better than the “old normal”.
“This is not only a health crisis but a human crisis; a jobs crisis; a humanitarian crisis and a development crisis. And it is not just about the most vulnerable. This pandemic shows that we are all at risk because we are only as strong as the weakest health system. Its unprecedented scale demands an unprecedented response,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who presented his report on the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 “Shared Responsibility, Global Solidarity” in March.
“Everything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change and the many other global challenges we face,” he said. This new framework released today sets the way United Nations entities will deliver this vision on the ground.
Decisions made in the next few months will be crucial for the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UN’s framework for social and economic recovery stresses.
Noting that during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, more people died from the interruption of social services and the economic breakdown than from the virus itself, the framework focuses on protecting the needs and rights of those most affected by the pandemic, starting with the most vulnerable countries, groups, and those who risk being left behind.
Drawing lessons from the 2008-2009 global economic and financial crisis, the framework notes that countries with strong social protection systems and basic services suffered the least and recovered the fastest. To prevent billions of people from sliding into poverty, governments around the world will need to rapidly adapt, extend and scale-up safety ‘cushions’, such as cash transfers, food assistance, social insurance schemes and child benefits to support families.
For the impacts of COVID-19 to be reduced, the UN calls for an extraordinary scale-up of support to cope with the challenges ahead, including immediate social protection responses that consider differentiated impacts on vulnerable groups, children, women, men, and those in the informal sector. This is particularly urgent considering that 4 billion people, more than half of the world population—including two out of three children—have no or inadequate social protection.
- END -

Notes for the Editors
The UN will focus on five key streams in its response, which places communities at the centre of recovery efforts: 1.protecting existing health services and strengthening health systems’ capacity to respond to COVID-19; 2. helping people cope with adversity, through social protection and basic services; 3. protecting jobs, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and informal sector workers through economic recovery programmes; 4. guiding the necessary surge in fiscal and financial stimulus to make macroeconomic policies work for the most vulnerable and strengthening multilateral and regional responses; and 5. promoting social cohesion and investing in community-led resilience and response systems. These five streams are connected by action to meet the need for environmental sustainability, if countries are to recover and “build back better”, and be better prepared to address future shocks, including pandemics.
UN teams covering 162 countries and territories will rollout this recovery plan in the next 12 to 18 months, under the leadership of UN Resident Coordinators (RC), supported by a network of global and regional expertise. As the technical lead in the socio-economic recovery efforts, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) will support RCs, with UN teams working as one across all aspects of the response.
While a significant proportion of the existing US$17.8 billion portfolio of sustainable development programmes across UN entities will be adjusted towards COVID-19 needs, given the scale and scope of the socio-economic impact of the pandemic, additional funds will be required. To support these efforts, the Secretary-General launched the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, a UN inter-agency fund mechanism to help support low- and middle-income programme countries overcome the health and development crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and support people most vulnerable to economic hardship and social disruption. The financial requirements of the Fund are projected at $1billion in the first nine months and will be subsequently reviewed. The Secretary-General also called for a multilateral response that amounts to at least 10 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) to mount the most effective response to crisis the world has ever seen.
There will be no return to the “old normal”, the framework document states. The pandemic is a blow to developing and emerging economies that already face binding constraints of debt and limited fiscal space, with several developing countries needing urgent debt relief. Its impacts will be especially devastating for the most vulnerable countries – those in humanitarian or conflict settings. The UN also calls for a massive fiscal and financial repurposing in the next weeks and months, including the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies to aid the response. The UN stresses that the status quo and business-as-usual are policy choices, and they are not inevitable. For a sustainable development that benefits more people, the choice must be for a recovery from COVID-19 that is fast, fair, green and inclusive.
About the framework document : The “United Nations Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19: Shared responsibility, global solidarity and urgent action for people in need”, released today puts in practice the UN Secretary-General’s Shared Responsibility, Global Solidarity report on the same subject. It is one of three critical components of the UN’s efforts to save lives, protect people, and rebuild better, alongside the health response, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the humanitarian response, as detailed in the UN-led COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan. Three funding mechanisms support the comprehensive response pillars: The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, managed by the UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation for the immediate health needs; the  “Global Humanitarian Response Plan” for the humanitarian appeal; and the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund for the socio-economic recovery.
About the UN Development System: The United Nations development system is the world’s largest international actor on social protection and basic services. The UN System is present in 162 countries and territories and reaches tens of millions of people through basic services, social transfers and other forms of social protection. The UN Development System has extensive experience in supporting governments in developing social protection systems including social protection floors and delivery of quality social services and to support such services across humanitarian and development contexts. unsdg.un.org

Title: Public support for international cooperation surges amid global upheaval
Content: 24 April 2020
New York, April 20, 2020. As the whole UN system unites to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, the Organization is also scaling up its efforts to give voice to the global public through its 75th anniversary initiative (UN75). Launched in January, UN75 will run throughout 2020, to give all people the opportunity to shape global priorities by participating in a UN75 dialogue or completing a one-minute survey available at www.un75.online. [1]
Preliminary findings, based on data collected between 1 January 2020 and 24 March 2020, were published today [2] on www.un.org/en/un75/news-events:
“I look forward to our continued efforts to ensure a meaningful observance of the seventy-fifth anniversary of our Organization, and to use this milestone for reflection on the multilateral cooperation the world needs at this time, both in addressing the immediate pandemic and in achieving the longer-term goals for which the United Nations was founded.” – United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres

Notes
[1] Launched by the UN Secretary-General, the UN’s 75th anniversary initiative is markedly different from previous commemorations, with less emphasis on communicating the UN’s successes and a strong focus on listening to the global public, especially young people. Over the course of 2020, the UN75 team will gather public perspectives on global challenges and solutions on how to tackle them through a one-minute survey (in 53 languages) and dialogues – now overwhelmingly online – organised by partners across the world. This data will be complemented by representative polling; academic research; and media and social media analysis in some 70 countries. The results will be presented in September 2020, at the official commemoration of the UN’s 75th anniversary, after which UN75 will focus on how best to take them forward, with a final report to be published in January 2021.
[2] The data used was gathered between 1 January and 24 March 2020. During this period, 35,556 in 186 UN Member States took the one-minute survey online, in addition to 5,688 who participated through mobile applications. Over 330 dialogues took place in 87 UN Member States, with 56 summaries from 32 of them included in this preliminary analysis.

Title: We are all in this Together: Human Rights and COVID-19 Response and Recovery
Content: 23 April 2020
The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency — but it is far more.
It is an economic crisis.  A social crisis.  And a human crisis that is fast becoming a human rights crisis.
In February, I launched a Call to Action to put human dignity and the promise of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the core of our work.
As I said then, human rights cannot be an afterthought in times of crisis — and we now face the biggest international crisis in generations.
Today, I am releasing a report highlighting how human rights can and must guide COVID-19 response and recovery.
The message is clear:  People — and their rights — must be front and centre.
A human rights lens puts everyone in the picture and ensures that no one is left behind.
Human rights responses can help beat the pandemic, putting a focus on the imperative of healthcare for everyone.
But they also serve as an essential warning system — highlighting who is suffering most, why, and what can be done about it.
We have seen how the virus does not discriminate, but its impacts do — exposing deep weaknesses in the delivery of public services and structural inequalities that impede access to them.  We must make sure they are properly addressed in the response.
We see the disproportionate effects on certain communities, the rise of hate speech, the targeting of vulnerable groups, and the risks of heavy-handed security responses undermining  the health response.
Against the background of rising ethno-nationalism, populism, authoritarianism and a pushback against human rights in some countries, the crisis can provide a pretext to adopt repressive measures for purposes unrelated to the pandemic.
This is unacceptable.
The best response is one that responds proportionately to immediate threats while protecting human rights and the rule of law.
More than ever, governments must be transparent, responsive and accountable.  Civic space and press freedom are critical.  Civil society organizations and the private sector have essential roles to play.
And in all we do, let’s never forget:  The threat is the virus, not people.
We must ensure that any emergency measures — including states of emergency — are legal, proportionate, necessary and non-discriminatory, have a specific focus and duration, and take the least intrusive approach possible to protect public health.
The best response is one that responds proportionately to immediate threats while protecting human rights and the rule of law.
Looking ahead, we need to build back better.  The Sustainable Development Goals — which are underpinned by human rights — provide the framework for more inclusive and sustainable economies and societies.
Strengthening economic and social rights bolsters resilience for the long haul.
The recovery must also respect the rights of future generations, enhancing climate action aiming at carbon neutrality by 2050 and protecting biodiversity.
We are all in this together.
The virus threatens everyone.  Human rights uplift everyone.
By respecting human rights in this time of crisis, we will build more effective and inclusive solutions for the emergency of today and the recovery for tomorrow.

Title: On its 75th anniversary, the UN launched the biggest global conversation on the world's future
Content: 02 January 2020
Early 2020 saw the launch of the UN75 initiative - the largest, most inclusive conversation on the role of global cooperation in building a better future for all. The initiative will see the UN spark dialogues throughout 2020 in diverse settings across the world.
In a ‘global reality check’, four innovative data streams will build the first ever repository of crowd-sourced solutions to major global challenges. The UN75 dialogues together with a ‘One-minute Survey’ that anyone can take, opinion polling in 50 countries and artificial intelligence sentiment analysis of traditional and social media in 70 countries, will generate compelling data to inform national and international policies and debate.
In calling for participation, the Secretary-General said: “No country, no community, is able to solve the complex problems of our world alone. We need to come together, not only to talk, but to listen. It is absolutely essential that you all join the conversation. We need your opinion, your strategies and your ideas for us to be able to deliver better for the people of the world that we must serve.”
Intended to engage constituencies across borders, sectors and generations, the UN75 team is collaborating with a wide multi-sector network, including the UN Resident Coordinators, for a diverse and global reach, and for dialogues to be convened in every country of the world. In a global listening exercise, with an emphasis on youth and groups not already engaged with the UN, the UN75 initiative aims to better understand expectations of international cooperation in light of pressing global challenges.
The views and ideas that are generated will be presented, by the Secretary-General, to world leaders and senior UN officials on September 21, 2020, at a high-level event to mark the 75th anniversary.
To inspire and inform the dialogues the UN is also partnering with Vox Media’s brand studio, Vox Creative to create a video informed by interviews with 38 people from around the world, sharing their experiences and opinions related to important global issues, to be launched January 6, 2020.
Those who want to be a part of the conversation - physically or online – can see how to join through the website: www.un.org/UN75. For further information and/or to request an interview, please contact Lisa Laskaridis (lisa.laskaridis@un.org)

Title: Montenegro must improve support for victims and potential victims of trafficking, says UN expert
Content: 08 November 2019
PODGORICA / GENEVA (8 November 2019) – Montenegro must substantially improve its assistance for victims and potential victims of trafficking, said UN Special Rapporteur Maria Grazia Giammarinaro at the end of an eight-day visit to the country.
Many migrants using the so-called Balkan route were vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation, she said, urging Montenegro to cooperate with experienced NGOs to increase the number of people being identified as victims and supported.
“I am concerned about the low number of victims being identified and supported,” said Giammarinaro, Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, presenting a statement at the end of her mission.
“There are weaknesses to be addressed as a matter of priority regarding assistance and support for victims. The whole accommodation system should be prepared to operate on a regular basis for a higher number of potential victims. As things stand, the NGOs running shelters could not survive without the support of external and/or private donors.
“An effective assistance system, including specialised shelters for trafficking victims, needs to operate on a permanent basis and be adequately funded. This is also key to improving and increasing identification rates, as victims are more likely to come forward if assistance, especially adequate accommodation, is readily available.”
Giammarinaro also expressed concern about the low number of criminal proceedings, but noted that the Government of Montenegro had recently changed its operational structure, and said a team created in August to lead operational activities on criminal proceedings had already shown promising results.
The Special Rapporteur welcomed the adoption of new standard operating procedures to identify victims, developed in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration, as well as guidance on the implementation of the non-punishment of victims, developed in cooperation with OSCE, and the compensation fund for victims of violence, which however has not yet entered into force.
“Under the standard operating procedures, an innovative model will be established, in which decisions about victim support will be based on an assessment made by a multidisciplinary team, and not only by the police,” she said.
“This should imply that not only victims identified during criminal proceedings, but also potential victims identified on personal and social grounds, will receive assistance. Such a model, accompanied by a strong victim support system, can lead the country to achieve significant results. However, such innovative measures need to be implemented, and this will ultimately be the real challenge.”
The replacement of the National Coordination with an anti/trafficking unit within the Ministry of Interior could give the impression that trafficking was being made less of a priority, Giammarinaro called on the Government to show renewed political will to tackle trafficking.
“The new Government structures must now prove that preventing and countering trafficking, even more than in the past, is a strong commitment, and will produce concrete results in the near future,” she said.
She highlighted that Montenegro was a country of transit and destination for migrants, with internal trafficking also present, especially affecting Roma communities. Trafficking is particularly present in the coastal part of the country and primarily during summer, when people are probably trafficked for sexual or labour exploitation, domestic servitude and begging.
During her visit, Giammarinaro met representatives of Government agencies, as well as UN officials and members of civil society organisations. She also visited shelters.
She will present a detailed report of her findings and recommendations to the UN Human Rights Council in June 2020.

Title: UN Summit Delivers New Pathways to Shift Climate Action into Higher Gear
Content: 23 September 2019
New York, 23 September 2019 - Leaders from government, business and civil society have announced potentially far-reaching steps to confront climate change at the United Nations Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit in New York.
As carbon pollution, temperatures and climate destruction continue to rise, and public backlash mounts, the Summit has offered a turning point from inertia into momentum, action and global impact – if everyone gets on board.
The UN estimates that the world would need to increase its efforts between three- and five-fold to contain climate change to the levels dictated by science – a 1.5°C rise at most – and avoid escalating climate damage already taking place around the world.
However, the Paris Agreement provides an open-door framework for countries to continuously ratchet up their positive actions, and today’s Summit demonstrates how governments, businesses and civilians around the world are rising to the challenge.
“The best science, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, tells us that any temperature rise above 1.5 degrees will lead to major and irreversible damage to the ecosystems that support us,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. “Science tells us that on our current path, we face at least 3-degrees Celsius of global heating by the end of the century.”
“The climate emergency is a race we are losing, but it is a race we can win.”
“This is not a climate talk summit. We have had enough talk,” he added. “This is not a climate negotiation summit. You don’t negotiate with nature. This is a climate action summit.”
He said, “Governments are here to show you are serious about enhancing Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. Cities and businesses are here showing what leadership looks like, investing in a green future. Financial actors are here to scale-up action and deploy resources in fundamentally new and meaningful ways. Coalitions are here with partnerships and initiatives to move us closer to a resilient, carbon-neutral world by 2050.”
“And young people are here providing solutions, insisting on accountability, demanding urgent action.”

Title: Abuse of LGBTI rights and dignity is unacceptable
Content: 20 September 2019
The UN Resident Coordinator in Montenegro Fiona McCluney congratulated organisers and participants in the 7th Pride Parade march.
She stressed the courage of LGBT and Intersex people in standing up for their rights often in challenging circumstances. ”Being homosexual, bisexual, transgender or intersex often means facing many obstacles in a daily life, from being bullied at school, being discriminated against or physically and mentally abused,” McCluney underlined and reminded that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, as per the Article 1 of the Human Rights Declaration.
“Many were shocked to learn about the recent beating of a transgender person on the doorstep of their own home in Kolašin. Such an act is intolerable, and I would like to commend the efficient response of the state against the perpetrators in this case,“ said McCluney and extended support to the Government in their efforts to ensure LGBTI rights are respected.
In addition, the UN Resident Coordinator expressed deep concern over the recent use of homophobic language between political parties as an insult and personal slur, as well as the lack of consensus in the Montenegrin Parliament on the basic rights of LGBTI people.
“We regret that the Law on same sex marriages has not been passed in the Parliament and hope that this will be reconsidered. Moreover, abuse and humiliation of LGBTI people in the discourse between political parties in recent months is unacceptable. Such behaviour encourages new waves of homophobia and hate speech."
Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator in Montenegro
“That is why, we the United Nations, stand firm behind the slogan of this year’s LGBTI Pride – Not on our account! (Ne preko naših leđa)” McCluney underlined.
Montenegro decriminalized same-sex activity more than 40 years ago and has since adopted strong legal and other measures banning discrimination, hate speech and hate-motivated crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Despite these efforts, LGBT and Intersex people continue to face acts of harassment, intimidation and violence in their everyday lives.
“As long as people face exclusion, rejection, discrimination and violence based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics, we all must redouble our efforts to end these violations. The United Nations team in Montenegro stands firm with LGBTI people in demand for dignity, equal rights and fair treatment,” Ms. McCluney concluded.

Title: Hottest July on Record
Content: 01 August 2019
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres shared powerful new data from the World Meteorological Organization and Copernicus Climate Change Programme today, including that July at least equaled, if not surpassed, the hottest month in recorded history.
“According to the very latest data from the World Meteorological Organization and its climate centre—the month of July at least equaled if not surpassed the hottest month in recorded history. This follows the hottest June ever,” said the Secretary-General.
“If we do not take action on climate change now, these extreme weather events are just the tip of the iceberg. And that iceberg is also rapidly melting. […] The world’s leading scientists tell us we must limit temperature increases to 1.5°C if we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. We need to cut greenhouse emissions by 45% by 2030. We need carbon neutrality by 2050. And we need to mainstream climate change risks across all decisions to drive resilient growth, reduce vulnerability and avoid investments that could cause greater damage,” the Secretary-General added.
Today’s announcement comes in advance of the upcoming 2019 Climate Action Summit. The Secretary-General has called upon leaders from government, business, and civil society to come to the Summit with concrete plans—clear steps to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020—and strategies for carbon neutrality by 2050.
Already, bold strides forward have been made:

Title: Marginalization of LGBTI people must be ended
Content: 16 November 2018
The UN Resident Coordinator in Montenegro Fiona McCluney congratulated participants marching the 6th Pride Parade and welcomed continuous support of the Government of Montenegro.
She underlined the obligation of society to ensure decent life for LGBT and Intersex people and praised their courage for standing up for their rights in often hard circumstances. “Being homosexual, bisexual, transgender or intersex today can mean facing a myriad of obstacles in your daily live, from being bullied at school, being discriminated or risking your own physical and mental integrity, “ said Ms. McCluney.
Montenegro decriminalized same-sex activity more than 40 years ago and has since adopted strong legal and other measures banning discrimination, hate speech and hate-motivated crimes on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Despite these efforts, LGBT and Intersex people continue to face acts of harassment, intimidation and violence in their everyday lives.
“We must step up efforts to address the deeply entrenched patriarchal social attitudes that keep pushing the LGBT and Intersex community towards marginalization and exclusion. Impunity for attacks on people because of their sexual orientation or gender identity is unacceptable,“
Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator
McCluney said calling on all responsible parties to ensure that any assault or attack on a person’s  right to live free and equal is effectively addressed.
McCluney welcomed recent decision of the Constitutional Court which reaffirmed State responsibility to protect the right to peaceful assembly. The Court ruled in favor of organizers planning a Pride March in Nikšić in 2015, which was banned by State authorities due to threats of violence. Most notably the Constitutional Court did not find reasonable grounds to justify a ban on the basis of public order.
“As we celebrate this year the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we stand firm in respecting diversity,“ concluded Ms. McCluney.

Title: UN review reveals concrete progress on human rights, experts say
Content: 01 November 2018
GENEVA (1 November 2018) — There have been some improvements in the situation of human rights in Montenegro, Greece, Rwanda, Benin and the Republic of Korea, experts from the UN Human Rights Committee said after completing a follow-up review of those countries.
“In a world where much news about human rights is bleak, it’s heartening to see clear progress in specific areas the Committee helped states identify as priorities for improvement,” said Yuval Shany, Chair of the Human Rights Committee.
The 18-member Human Rights Committee monitors how states which have signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) are living up to their obligations, such as the right to life, freedom of expression and freedom of conscience.
The Committee performs its regular monitoring work by reviewing reports and holding meetings with state representatives, discussing the situation of human rights in their respective countries and also hearing from non-governmental organizations and other members of civil society. The Committee later issues detailed recommendations for how to improve the human rights situation in those countries. On 22 October, the Committee reviewed ‘follow up’ reports describing the implementation of specific ‘high-priority’ recommendations it issued in 2014-2016 to Montenegro, Greece, Rwanda, Benin and the Republic of Korea.
“All five states have adopted specific measures representing significant progress in the implementation of the Covenant,” said Shany. Those measures included the appointment of a special prosecutor for war crimes in Montenegro, the creation of the function of an ombudsperson in Greece to investigate claims of excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, the abolition of the death penalty in Benin, and the decriminalisation of defamation in Rwanda.
The Committee also noted with satisfaction recent information it received on the decision of the Constitutional Court in the Republic of Korea requiring that alternatives to military service be offered to conscientious objectors. All of these measures had been recommended to the respective states by the Committee.
“Although many of the Committee's recommendations for the five reviewed States and others remain unfulfilled or only partly fulfilled, the concrete progress made in the five States underscores the value of the ongoing dialogue between the Committee and member states to the ICCPR”, Shany said.

Title: Montenegro: UN expert calls for adequate social protection for older persons
Content: 30 April 2018
GENEVA / PODGORICA (30 April 2018) – An independent expert appointed by the United Nations visiting Montenegro has welcomed the significant efforts of the Government, but said “older persons in Montenegro need adequate social protection”.
The number of older persons in Montenegro has tripled over the last 50 years and it is expected that by 2050 more than one in five of the population will be aged 60 or over.
“With a stagnating population, the share of older persons will increase and persist. Ensuring the full respect of the rights of older persons in the social protection system has become one of the most pressing issues”, Rosa Kornfeld-Matte, the Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons, said.
Kornfeld-Matte welcomed the recently finalized strategy for the development of a new social protection system for the elderly. “The complexity of ageing requires a comprehensive approach to ensuring the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons,” the expert said.
“Montenegro has improved its legislative framework related to social protection, but it is necessary to continue the reform to ensure integrated social and health care services for older persons,” she added.
“I am concerned at the considerable percentage of older persons who still live in absolute poverty. Older persons, especially women, fall within one of the most disadvantaged groups in Montenegro; when they belong to minorities they face multiple challenges. I call on the Government to ensure that protection reaches this most vulnerable of groups,” she noted.
“I am also concerned at the high number of older persons, notably those with disabilities, who are deprived of their full legal capacity. I urge the Government to put in place a system of supported decision-making that fully respects the autonomy, integrity, dignity, will and preferences of the individual,” the expert stressed.
During her visit, Ms Kornfeld-Matte met with various representatives of Government authorities, academia and civil society as well as others working on the rights of older persons and older persons themselves.
The expert will present a comprehensive report of her findings and recommendations to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2018.

ENDS

Ms. Rosa Kornfeld-Matte (Chile) was appointed by the Human Rights Council as the first Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons in May 2014. Ms. Kornfeld-Matte served as the National Director of the Chilean National Service of Ageing where she designed and implemented the National Policy of Ageing. She has a long career as an academic and is the founder of the programme for older persons at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.

Title: Women in the Changing World: Let’s Start from Education
Content: 08 March 2018
Today, on the International Women’s Day, the UN System in Montenegro calls for the “gender mind-shift”.
Over the years, how we commemorate International Women’s Day seems to have lost its way. Instead of a day that marks a celebration of women’s gaining rights, rights to vote, in health care and education or in the workplace, it has become a celebration of motherhood.  A day when the caring role of women, particularly as mothers, grandmothers and wives is acknowledged with poems, and pictures, roses and perfume.
Of course, respect and appreciation for parents is an important thing, but in only celebrating ‘mothers’, don’t we undervalue the role of men? Men are often only seen as ‘breadwinners’, their important parenting role gets neglected. Gender equality means an equal role for both parents in raising children, shared parental leave, divided responsibilities for the work and caring in bringing up children.
A paradox that young women are better educated than young men, while men still being better paid for the same job than women, is an indicator that something needs to be changed.”
Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator in Montenegro
“Work for men and women in Montenegro is very different” said UN Resident Coordinator in Montenegro Fiona McCluney, quoting a UNDP’s survey from 2012 that, considering their caring roles, women on average work 3.5 hours longer than men every day in the family. “A paradox that young women are better educated than young men[1], while men still being better paid for the same job than women, is yet another argument that something needs to be changed.”
Education is an excellent place to start to make change. Introduction at an early age, of a gender-sensitive curriculum and teaching about gender roles, within-family and partner relations, recognising and responding to violence, promoting girls participation in sports and girls participation in areas which are predominantly occupied by boys, and often get linked to better paid jobs, such as engineering, IT, etc.
“Ideally, the education system should not perpetuate gender stereotypes, the unwritten conventions that may keep the girls from achieving their full potential, but focus from preschool onwards, on giving girls and boys equal opportunities to develop,” said Ms. McCluney.
On the International Women's Day, the UN System in Montenegro appeals for more investment in empowering women throughout the education system, so their full potentials could be realized, but also for the true meaning of the 8th March and women`s rights movement to be passed on to the children in the earliest stages of development. In doing so, Montenegro will also contribute to achieving the SDGs (in particular, goal number 5) and accelerating the EU accession.

Title: UN and the leading hip-hop band in Montenegro together against gender violence
Content: 27 November 2017
“My Mary” (Moja Mare) is the title of the latest song produced by the hip-hop band Who See, developed in partnership with the United Nations in Montenegro, within this year’s 16 Days Campaign Against Gender-Based Violence. The campaign aims to send a message to young people about the different types of “violence” against women, to help young people to recognize it and to have a constructive attitude to fighting all forms of violence as they grow up.
My Mary is the story a woman living with various types of violence, some visible and some more hidden or indirect. It is narrated from the perspective of a stereotypical husband, the story of Mary exposes different traditional and cultural dimension of violence against women that largely remain a taboo.
“Violence against women is a deeply rooted and a very complex problem. Its elimination takes time, and changes in ‘acceptable behaviour’ of succession of generations. And that’s why we focus on the youth in this campaign” – said Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator in Montenegro, while expressing honest gratitude for Who See band’s contribution to the campaign. “The band Who See are very popular and trusted by young people making them an excellent way to get this year’s campaign messages on Violence against Women to young people. We are very grateful and proud of our partnership with the band” – McCluney concluded.
Young people like and trust the band Who See, so they’re a priceless way to get out messages on Violence against Women.
Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator in Montenegro
Indeed, tailoring messages for young people and the large-scale outreach to youth were the main reasons for UN in Montenegro to initiate partnership with Who See in this campaign.
“Working on this song was very challenging for us, since violence against women is a wide-spread problem manifested in different forms, as we pointed out in the song. Mary portrays a woman that, I believe, many women can identify with nowadays in Montenegro” – said Dejan Dedovic – Deda from the Who See band, who expressed true pleasure with partnership with the UN in Montenegro.
"Mary portrays a woman that many women may identify with today in Montenegro”
Dejan Dedovic – Deda, Who See
Violence against women is one of the most prevailing forms of human rights violation. It can be physical, sexual, psychological and economic. According to UNDP’s latest research, one in two women was a victim of violence at least once in her lifetime. After reporting the violence, victims often remain unprotected and deprived of an adequate systematic support. Hence, most victims never report the violence: 2/3 of them fear the consequences, 1/4 of them are ashamed. To change these practices, it is necessary to have an open public dialogue on violence against women.
The song “My Mary”, which tackles various forms of violence against women, unveils it as a socially invisible issue that remains unaddressed.
Until when? – asks Who See.
