Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON THE OCCASION OF UN WORLD OCEANS DAY 2024
Content: 08 June 2024
--
The ocean sustains and enhances all life on Earth. But our ocean is in trouble. And we only have ourselves to blame. Climate change is triggering rising seas and threatening the very existence of small island developing states and coastal populations. Record sea temperatures are sparking extreme weather events that affect us all. Ocean acidification is destroying coral reefs, breaking a vital link in food chains and threatening tourism and local economies. And unsustainable coastal development, overfishing, deep-sea mining, unchecked pollution and plastic waste are wreaking havoc on marine ecosystems across the globe. Yet there are glimmers of hope. Last year, the UN General Assembly adopted the historic Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction — the most significant new treaty on ocean governance in decades. The process underway to develop a legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution provides another opportunity to advance our shared goal of protecting our ocean. The recent opinion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is another breakthrough, calling on nations to take measures to reduce, control and prevent marine pollution caused by greenhouse gas emissions. This year’s Summit of the Future and next year’s UN Oceans Conference in France are further opportunities to commit to action that can restore and protect our precious marine and coastal ecosystems. Now is the time for governments, businesses, investors, scientists and communities to come together in defense of our ocean. On World Oceans Day, let’s heed this year’s theme, and awaken new depths of action for our ocean. ***

Title: FAO Hands Over Seiyun Desert Locust Centre to Local Authorities
Content: 15 May 2024
Five Centres Constructed Under World Bank Funded Project
Seiyun/Aden
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) officially handed over a newly-constructed Desert Locust centre to local authorities in Seiyun, in Hadramout governorate in Yemen as efforts to control and manage the pest continue.
The Seiyun centre, constructed under the World Bank funded Desert Locust Response Project (DLRP), is one of the five centres aimed at improving Locust management in Yemen’s key breeding areas. This includes two main centres located in Sana’a and Aden, and three regional centres in Hodeida, Shabwah and Hadramout. The remaining four centres will be handed over to authorities in the coming weeks.
Out of the five, two are main centres located in Sana’a and Aden, and three regional centres in Hodeida, Shabwah and Hadramout governorates. These five locations are key desert locust breeding areas in Yemen, and the construction of the centres allows better management and distribution of locust management resources.
The centres include an administration block, resource warehouses, training centres, and Locust information offices. Locust management resources include survey tools and equipment, camping equipment, personal protective equipment, control equipment and accessories, as well as bio-pesticides.
The new centres in Sana’a and Hodeida replace those that had deteriorated and lacked the minimum needs to perform the locust management properly. Aden did not have a main locust centre. Shabwah and Hadramout governorates did not have desert locust regional centres, which curtailed the control and management of the pest.
Yemen is one of the most significant Desert Locust breeding reservoirs in the Near East region and the establishment of these Centres will mitigate pest outbreaks in the region and beyond.
His Excellence Salem Abdullah Issa Al-Soqotri, the Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Fisheries Wealth expressed gratitude the World Bank for the financial support and FAO for its cooperation with the government during the implementation of this project.
“The work of the World Bank and FAO to improve the institutional capacity by constructing the five desert locust centres as well as a raft of other resources, trainings and awareness sessions has raised the ministry’s capacity to monitor, control and manage the pest which causes huge damages to crops and pastures each time there is an outbreak,” said the Minister.
FAO Representative in Yemen, Dr Hussein Gadain, said that the Centres were a testimony of how collaborations with the World Bank and the Yemeni authorities help to enhance food and nutrition security in the country. “We need to build firm first lines of defence against pests and diseases as we continue the journey of agrifood systems transformation. These centres that we are handing over today will play an important role in this regard and I am grateful that the World Bank has supported us in making this a reality,” said Dr Gadain.
Dr Gadain added that FAO has worked with the authorities to make sure that the centres will be sustainably managed.
Desert locust centres personnel will be involved in surveillance and control operations. Data are collected from the field and transferred to the main locust information offices in the main centres in Aden and Sanaa where the data is analysed and forecasting of locust situation is made to support planning and decision making.
The data will also be shared from the main locust information centres to other countries in the region and to the desert locust information service in FAO. The information will be utilised for global locust analysis and forecasting, and this serves the global locust early warning.
Apart from the construction of the desert locust centres, the project provided support for early warning information through procurement and installation of six weather. Between 2021 and 2023, there was the execution of the field survey and control operations in Yemen.
Furthermore, the project conducted training on field survey and control operations, pesticide management, and applying environmental and health safety standards as well as awareness sessions with the community about locust impact on the agriculture and economy the risks of pesticides.

About the DLRP
There are three main components under DLRP. These components are survey and control measures, livelihood protection and rehabilitation, and improving the infrastructure and institutional capacity for locust control in Yemen.

Title: Joint Statement by Humanitarian Organisations in Yemen: Humanitarian partners urge donors to remain committed to the millions in need in Yemen
Content: 06 May 2024
--
6 May 2024— Ahead of the Sixth Senior Officials Meeting on 7 May in Brussels, the United Nations, international NGOs and Yemeni Civil Society Organisations urgently appeal for sustained support for the 18.2 million people in need in Yemen. Five months into 2024, just US $0.4 billion of the 2024 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan requirement of $2.7 billion has been received.
After nine years of conflict, over half the population in Yemen—18.2 million people, including 14 million women and children—requires humanitarian assistance and protection services.
The humanitarian community in Yemen, committed to serving populations in a principled manner, continues to deliver one of the world’s largest humanitarian responses in a challenging and complex operational environment. In 2023, 229 humanitarian actors—the majority of whom were local partners—supported an average of 8.4 million people each month with life-saving protection and humanitarian assistance. Aid is reaching those in need, despite constraints of access and funding.
Today, Yemen is at a crossroads. The country witnessed slight improvements in humanitarian conditions following the UN-brokered truce and its de facto continuation. With these gains, partners have moved towards resilience-building programming, promoting sustainable solutions by addressing the drivers of needs. However, we cannot ignore the significant humanitarian needs that remain and that cannot be addressed without adequate funding to respond.
Economic decline, deteriorating public services and infrastructure and displacement induced by conflict and climate-related disasters continue to drive the humanitarian crisis. Rising food insecurity, the risk of increasing malnutrition rates - particularly among pregnant and lactating women, older people and children - and the spread of cholera during the current rainy season, pose threats to communities across the country. Violations of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law continue, and the presence of explosive remnants of war results in death, injury and displacement, restricts access to agricultural land and resettlement and hinders post-conflict reconstruction and development efforts.
Funding for a focused and well-prioritized 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan must be ensured to sustain the gains made and prevent further deterioration of the humanitarian situation. To date, only $435 million of Yemen’s 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan requirement of $2.7 billion has been funded–leaving unmet requirements of $2.3 billion. Underfunding poses a challenge to the continuity of humanitarian programming, causing delays, reductions and suspensions of lifesaving assistance programmes. These challenges directly affect the lives of millions who depend on humanitarian assistance and protection services for survival.
Humanitarian partners are committed to transforming the response in Yemen and reducing humanitarian needs. As partners, together, we will continue to improve the quality of humanitarian assistance and maximize impact with targeted, quality programming based on need. Partners will expand collaboration with development actors and promote more Yemeni leadership for a locally-led and locally informed response, to help Yemenis rebuild their futures. To do so, however, humanitarian partners’ sustained support is required.
Inaction would have catastrophic consequences for the lives of Yemeni women, children and men. The Sixth Senior Officials Meeting is a critical moment to galvanize support and collective action to address the deteriorating crisis. The humanitarian community appeals to donors to urgently address existing funding gaps, and provide sustainable support to enhance resilience and reduce aid dependency.

Title: IOM and Local Authorities Kick Off New Water Initiative to Benefit 60,000 Ta’iz City Residents
Content: 02 May 2024
--
Ta’iz Governorate
This week, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) launched works on the Al Jamea’ah pumping station in Ta’iz, in the presence of the Governor of Ta’iz and local authorities. This priority project, supported by the KfW Development Bank, is poised to address the critical water needs of over 60,000 community members and internally displaced persons in an area where water accessibility is extremely limited.
During the inauguration, Governor Nabil Shamsan extended his gratitude towards IOM for the vital initiatives implemented within the governorate, including the recently established humanitarian hub. He pledged his office’s full support to facilitate IOM’s operations, particularly related to sustainable solutions and long-term initiatives.
“We are committed to ensuring that essential water infrastructure projects like the Al Jamea’ah pumping station are not only inaugurated but also sustainably serve the critical needs of communities and displaced individuals in Ta’iz,” declared IOM’s Acting Chief of Mission in Yemen, Matt Huber. “With the support of local authorities and committed partners, we aim to create lasting impact, ensuring access to clean water through the use of solar energy to pump water for households.”
With a population of 3 million, Ta’iz ranks as Yemen’s third most populated governorate as well as the third highest governorate in dire need of water, sanitation, and hygiene services. The water scarcity issue in Ta’iz dates back to the 1990s, stemming from environmental and geological changes, exacerbated by rapid population growth.
The water crisis in the city has had a profound impact on its economy, as many displaced households rely almost entirely on water trucking services and face limited access to water due to insufficient communal water points. Many of the boreholes identified as primary water sources for supplying the city are inactive due to their proximity to conflict frontlines.
These points, designed to serve the drinking water needs of both the local community and displaced population, remain disconnected from the main water supply network, which has made it challenging for businesses to operate and families to make ends meet.
Since the degradation of water supply networks in the city’s four districts, there has also been a significant surge in reported cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD). Without interventions to enhance the city’s water supply, it is anticipated that AWD cases, along with other water-borne diseases, will continue to escalate.
To address these challenges, IOM has been working closely with Yemen’s WASH Cluster, the Ta’iz WASH Taskforce, the Ministry of Water and Environment and the Local Water and Sanitation Corporation to assess the current water supply, identify gaps, and prioritize activities that sustainably enhance water supply services in the city.
After an assessment conducted by IOM last year and discussions with local authorities, the decision was made to rehabilitate the Al Jamea’ah pumping station. This station will facilitate the transmission of water from the collective water tank in Al Jamea’ah to distributing water tanks, ensuring water delivery to the population through existing distribution networks.
The assessment concluded that adopting renewable energy systems, especially solar power, was the best approach for achieving a sustainable water supply in Ta’iz to reduce dependency on costly and environmentally unfriendly diesel generators for pumping. As such, the new integrated solar pumping unit aims to ensure a reliable water supply for the city’s population for generations to come.

Title: IOM Equips Two Health Centres in Sana’a to Boost Essential Healthcare Support
Content: 30 April 2024
Sana’a, Yemen
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has recently provided crucial assistance to two major health facilities in Sana’a. Funded by USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), this intervention aims to improve access to healthcare for over 200,000 people residing near Hani Tawamr Hospital in Maeen District and Bani Hawat Health Centre in Bani Al-Harith District.
One of the two health facilities supported is Hani Tawamr Hospital, which was recently designated by the Ministry of Public Health as a Diarrhoea Treatment Centre (DTC) to address the cholera outbreak reported across several governorates, including Sana’a. Responding swiftly, IOM significantly expanded its support to the hospital, furnishing the DTC with essential medicines, medical supplies, staff support, and hygiene interventions, greatly enhancing the hospital’s outbreak management capacity.
“Reequipping these two health facilities in Sana’a represents a critical step towards addressing the urgent healthcare needs of communities in Yemen,” declared Matt Huber, IOM’s Acting Chief of Mission in Yemen. “By enhancing access to health care services, we aim to alleviate the strain on the healthcare system in conflict-affected areas, ensuring that even amidst adversity, essential medical care remains within reach for those who need it most.”
As Yemen enters its tenth year of conflict, the need for healthcare support has become increasingly urgent. Only half of the health facilities are operational, with many facing significant challenges such as staff shortages, insufficient supplies and equipment, financial constraints, and power disruptions due to fuel shortages.
An estimated 17.8 million people across the country require medical assistance and access to healthcare services. This dire situation places immense strain on the few functioning healthcare facilities that remain operational amidst the ongoing turmoil.
Situated in densely populated areas, the Bani Hawat Health Centre struggles to meet the healthcare needs of some of the most vulnerable populations in the district, including displaced individuals. Prior to IOM’s intervention, this health facility had not received aid from any other organization.
Meanwhile, Hani Tawamr Hospital benefited from crucial equipment upgrades and new furnishings, enhancing its capacity to accommodate more patients and deliver quality healthcare services. Earlier this year, a fire broke out at the hospital due to an electrical short circuit, causing damage to the on-site generator and nearby structures. In light of this emergency, IOM promptly provided a replacement power generator, ensuring the hospital’s continued access to electricity.
Through the project, both facilities received a comprehensive package including medicines, medical supplies, equipment, furniture, capacity-building for healthcare workers, maintenance support, and staff incentives. These provisions will enable the facilities to deliver essential primary healthcare services to local communities, including medical consultations, free medication, mental health and psychosocial support, and health awareness programmes.
This assistance serves as a lifeline, enabling the health facilities to operate fully during two shifts and offer a comprehensive range of services. With the addition of newly recruited medical staff, specialized consultations for childhood and maternal healthcare needs became available, alleviating the strain on public hospitals due to overcrowding.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MOTHER EARTH DAY
Content: 22 April 2024
--
Humanity is acting like Mother Earth’s delinquent child.
We depend on nature for the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we drink. Yet, we have brought chaos to the natural world: poisoning our planet with pollution, wiping out species and ecosystems with abandon, and destabilising our climate with greenhouse gas emissions.
These actions harm nature, and they harm humanity. We are imperilling food production, polluting our ocean and air, creating a more dangerous, less stable environment, and holding back sustainable development.
Together, we must restore harmony with nature, embrace sustainable production and consumption, and protect ourselves from harm – creating jobs, reducing poverty and driving sustainable development as we do so.
That means slamming the brakes on biodiversity loss, putting a stop to pollution, and slashing greenhouse gas emissions globally. It means supporting Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and others being hit hardest by the pollution, climate and biodiversity crises. It means delivering climate justice to countries on the frontline of climate chaos, and swiftly mobilising the finance and support countries need to act on climate, protect nature and promote sustainable development.
Countries must produce new national climate plans that align with limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. These can double as national transition plans and national investment plans, underpinning sustainable development for generations to come. And the G20 must lead a fast, fair and funded global phaseout of fossil fuels, and put a stop to nature-wrecking subsidies, such as those that underwrite runaway production of planet-choking plastics.
Repairing relations with Mother Earth is the mother of all of humanity’s challenges.  We must act – and act now – to create a better future for us all.

Title: WHO Yemen: The right to health: WHO works to bridge health divide in Yemen
Content: 07 April 2024
Sana’a, Yemen
All people have the right to health. And no matter where they live, they should be able to access and afford quality health care when they need it. The prolonged conflict in Yemen has left half of the population in need of health aid .
Vulnerable groups continue to bear the brunt of the crisis. Such groups include internally displaced people, children, women, elderly people, people with disabilities and mental health conditions, marginalized communities, and people affected by conflict-related injuries.
“The challenges that people in Yemen have to face cannot be described. Children who are referred to nutrition wards are only there because of prolonged starvation. The health system is fragile and faces difficulty in meeting the increasing demands,” said Dr Arturo Pesigan, WHO Representative in Yemen. “I feel for all the parents and caregivers who have to see their children getting ill in front of their eyes.”
Yemen faces a double burden of disease and armed conflict, and 17.8 million people in the country require health assistance. Of this number, 24% are women, who need access to diverse medical and reproductive health services. Children account for 50% of those in need, including 540 000 children aged under 5 years who require life-saving treatment for severe wasting – 10% of whom have severe acute malnutrition with medical complications and need highly specialized inpatient care. Inequalities are revealed in the high levels of malnutrition among mothers and children. Undernutrition remains a major public health crisis .
The multihazard risk profile for Yemen, the development of which WHO has supported, identifies 6 priority hazards with a high likelihood and potentially high public health impact: armed conflict, cholera, dengue, floods and cyclones, malaria and measles.
As the world marks the 76th World Health Day, WHO continues to support the health authorities to address the gaps, all the while working to strengthen the health system amid the conflict.
Through strong partnerships in 2023, WHO supported 245 health facilities to remain functional, providing 6.4 million outpatient consultations and reaching about 2.5 million people. Some 1.2 million children aged under 5 years were vaccinated against polio and another 1.1 million children (aged 6 months–4 years) were vaccinated against measles.
In addition, 4000 tonnes of medicines, equipment, medical furniture, information technology devices and other health technologies worth US$ 42.63 million in total were distributed to 470 health facilities across Yemen.
“Every number reflects a positive impact on people’s lives. These are men, women and children who were provided with life-saving services and were not turned away,” said Dr Pesigan. “A multisectoral approach is needed today to promote health and well-being while addressing determinants of health and risk factors. But if this is not combined with peace, true development may be difficult to achieve. Through peace, Yemen can start to heal.”

Title: Six months on, the war in Gaza is a betrayal of humanity
Content: 06 April 2024
Statement by Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator
(New York, 6 April 2024)
We have arrived at a terrible milestone.

For the people of Gaza, the past six months of war have brought death, devastation and now the immediate prospect of a shameful man-made famine.

For the people affected by the lasting horror of the 7 October attacks, it has been six months of grief and torment.

Each day, this war claims more civilian victims. Every second that it continues sows the seeds of a future so deeply obscured by this relentless conflict.

As I and many others have said repeatedly, the end of this war is so long overdue.

Instead, we face the unconscionable prospect of further escalation in Gaza, where no one is safe and there is nowhere safe to go. An already fragile aid operation continues to be undermined by bombardments, insecurity and denials of access.

Rarely has there been such global outrage at the toll of conflict, with seemingly so little done to end it and instead so much impunity.

On this day, my heart goes out to the families of those killed, injured or taken hostage, and to those who face the particular suffering of not knowing the plight of their loved ones.

It is not enough for six months of war to be a moment of remembrance and mourning – it must also spur a collective determination that there be a reckoning for this betrayal of humanity.

Content: 04 April 2024
--
Landmines and explosive ordnance and remnants of war directly threaten millions of people caught up in armed conflicts around the world — from Afghanistan to Myanmar to Sudan to Ukraine to Colombia to Gaza.
Even after the fighting ends, these deadly devices can contaminate communities for decades to come, posing a daily and deadly danger to women, men and children alike, and blocking vital humanitarian and development assistance.
The brave mine action personnel of the United Nations work with partners to remove these deadly weapons, ensure that people can travel safely in their communities, and provide education and threat assessments to keep people and humanitarian workers safe.
This year’s theme — Protecting Lives, Building Peace — reminds us of the need to safeguard those at particular risk, including people living with disabilities.
I also call on Member States to support the United Nations Mine Action Strategy, and ratify and fully implement the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, the Convention on Cluster Munitions, and the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.
Country by country, community by community, let’s rid the world of these weapons, once and for all.

Title: WHO Yemen: Yemen launches a Pandemic Fund project to protect the most vulnerable communities from epidemic disease threats
Content: 02 April 2024
2 April 2024, Aden, Yemen
To better protect one of the most vulnerable populations in the world from pandemic threats, Yemen has today launched the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project (PPRP).
The virtual launch event was complemented by satellite in-person events in Aden and Sana’a, Republic of Yemen; Amman, Jordan; and Washington, D.C., United States of America. The event was attended by His Excellency Dr Qasem Buhaibeh, Minister of Public Health and Population; His Excellency Major General Salem Abdullah Al Soqatri, Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Fisheries; and Priya Basu, Executive Head of the Pandemic Fund Secretariat.
Also present were representatives of the PPRP implementing agencies: the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Bank. Senior government officials, Health Cluster partners, and members of civil society and the public also joined the event.
The new PPRP will run for 3 years. Its goal is to protect and improve the health and well-being of Yemen’s people, livestock and ecosystems by strengthening the country’s ability to prevent, detect and rapidly respond to endemic and pandemic threats.
This goal will be achieved by pursuing the following 4 objectives:
Delivery of these objectives will be supported by a US$ 26 million grant from the Pandemic Fund, and complementary action under other World Bank grants. These other grants include the Emergency Human Capital Project (2021–2024), implemented by UNICEF, WHO and UNOPS, with funding to date of US$ 448 million.
The Pandemic Fund grant also builds on the legacy of past successful investments that have strengthened outbreak preparedness and response, including the Yemen COVID-19 Response Project (2020–2022), implemented by WHO and the World Bank, and the Emergency Health and Nutrition Project (2017–2022), implemented by UNICEF and WHO with World Bank support.
Speaking at the launch, H.E. Dr Qasem Buhaibeh, Minister of Public Health and Population, reflected on Yemen’s commitment to improve pandemic preparedness and response: “Guided by WHO’s International Health Regulations, we are striving to raise our defences against persistent disease threats. This requires all-of-society action, and I hope everyone here today will join us in this effort.”
In recent years, building on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, Yemen has started to routinely deliver on the International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacities, such as IHR State Parties Self-Assessment Annual Report (SPAR). The country also conducted its first WHO joint external evaluation of IHR capacities in 2023 and is developing the first Yemen National Action Plan for Health Security, building on the findings and recommendations of these assessments.
H.E. Major General Salem Abdullah Al Soqatri, Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Fisheries, emphasized the importance of multisectoral collaboration: “We know a whole host of threats exist at the animal–human interface – using a One Health approach, with strong coordination at all levels, we can mitigate this risk and better protect ourselves and other countries.”
Priya Basu, Executive Head of the Pandemic Fund Secretariat, who joined virtually from the USA, said: "In partnership with the Government of Yemen, the WHO, FAO, and UNICEF, the Pandemic Fund is proud to launch this innovative project aimed at fortifying Yemen against future major health threats.  By enhancing digital surveillance capabilities and ensuring timely and effective response mechanisms are in place, alongside efforts to bolster laboratory systems and build a highly skilled health workforce, our project will significantly advance the country's pandemic preparedness and response capacities.”
WHO Representative to Yemen Dr Arturo Pesigan confirmed the need for broad-based action for pandemic preparedness and response, stating: “At WHO, we often say health systems strengthening is everybody’s business. I’d like to expand on this to say pandemic preparedness and response is everybody’s business.”
UNICEF Representative to Yemen Peter Hawkins stressed that "In a world still vulnerable to the impact of pandemics, our resilience will be measured by our ability to prepare diligently and respond swiftly. Every child must be protected from the threat of emerging diseases.”
PPRP is expected to make valuable contributions to Yemen’s preparedness and response capacities. Efforts will include, with WHO support, expanding and enhancing integrated disease surveillance and response. This will be done by leveraging and improving existing platforms such as the electronic Integrated Disease Early Warning System (eIDEWS) and rapid response teams positioned in each of the country’s 333 districts. The support will also help to sustain Yemen’s 12 central public health laboratories and enhance sample transportation systems.
FAO will support action to enhance surveillance for zoonotic diseases and agricultural laboratories and UNICEF will enhance community-based surveillance across the country. This work will be done in collaboration with WHO and the health authorities. At every step of the way, civil society will be engaged – to mobilize communities for pandemic action, and to ensure project accountability for the delivery of effective results.
The launch served as a crucial moment to showcase Yemen’s commitment to – and the support of local and international partners for – pandemic preparedness and response, and to mobilize broad action to protect communities from pandemic threats.
So far, the project has set up routine coordination meetings as well as a One Health coordination platform, bringing together the Ministry of Public Health and Population, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Fisheries, WHO, FAO and other key stakeholders. PPRP focal points have been assigned at each implementing agency and the relevant ministries. Granular technical plans are under development, along with a civil society network for pandemic action.
A joint coordination committee, made up of representatives of government entities and partner organizations, is also being set up. This will regularly review progress, discuss challenges, and provide guidance on the project’s overall strategic direction.

The Fund is an innovative addition to the international health financing toolkit, a first-of-its-kind multilateral platform dedicated to making investments in pandemic prevention and preparedness in low- and middle-income countries. It has the flexibility to work through a variety of institutions, complementing efforts, drawing in co-financing, and promoting coordination on the ground; most importantly, it incentivizes countries to prioritize this agenda and increase their own efforts. The Fund’s operating model involves collaboration with governments, WHO, other United Nations agencies, multilateral development banks, global health initiatives, the private sector, philanthropic institutions, and civil society.

Title: IOM Supports Vital Mass Polio Immunization Campaign in Yemen
Content: 02 April 2024
Yemen
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has successfully concluded its participation in Yemen’s National Polio Campaign, led by the Ministry of Public Health and Population, thanks to the dedicated efforts of IOM-supported healthcare workers who administered vaccines to children across six governorates.
This critical initiative aims to protect Yemeni children from the devastating impacts of polio amidst the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in the country. Targeting children under the age of 5, the campaign sought to bolster population immunity and curb the transmission of poliovirus type 2.
In Yemen, where conflict, economic crisis, and limited public health infrastructure exacerbate health challenges, immunization is essential. Through the collaborative efforts of local authorities, healthcare workers, community volunteers, and partners, the national campaign successfully reached 1.2 million children in both host communities and sites for internally displaced persons.
“In the face of Yemen’s ongoing crisis, the polio vaccination campaign represents a critical lifeline for children,” declared IOM’s Acting Chief of Mission in Yemen, Matt Huber. “Amidst the challenges of conflict and chronic funding shortages, ensuring access to vaccinations is paramount to protecting our youngest and most vulnerable population.”
Throughout the campaign, 18 mobile medical teams (MMTs) and 80 community health volunteers (CHVs) engaged in extensive awareness-raising initiatives aimed to combat vaccine hesitancy and misinformation within communities. These efforts reached over 31,000 people across the governorates of Aden, Al Hodeidah, Lahj, Ma’rib, Shabwah, and Taiz.
“As part of the vaccination team, I’m committed to raising awareness about polio and promoting vaccination to protect our children’s health,” explained Saeed, a CHV in Ma’rib. “We visit families door-to-door, informing them about the importance of immunization in preventing this disease. Our goal is to ensure everyone understands how crucial vaccination is for safeguarding the health of our children and future generations.”
Yusra, a mother of four from a remote village in Ta’iz, first learned about polio when a CHV visited her home. Concerned for her children’s health, Yusra decided to vaccinate them after understanding the risks. “I never realized how vulnerable my children were,” she said, emphasizing the importance of the volunteers in disseminating vital health information.
MMTs and CHVs play a pivotal role for families like Yusra’s in providing essential healthcare services in areas where access to healthcare facilities is limited. Through their efforts, they facilitate the provision of urgent medical care, referrals, and support, ultimately contributing to the overall health and well-being of displaced populations and host communities.
Despite the daunting challenges posed by the conflict and humanitarian crisis, IOM remains committed to supporting public health initiatives in Yemen and advocates for access to essential healthcare services for those most vulnerable.
IOM’s participation in Yemen’s National Polio Campaign was made possible thanks to the support of EU Humanitarian Aid, USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, the Government of Japan, Yemen Humanitarian Fund, and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE FOR THE WORLD WATER DAY
Content: 22 March 2024
--
Action for water is action for peace. And today it is needed more than ever.

Our world is in turbulent waters. Conflicts are raging, inequality is rife, pollution and biodiversity loss are rampant, and, as humanity continues to burn fossil fuels, the climate crisis is accelerating with a deadly force – further threatening peace.

Our planet is heating up – seas are rising, rains patterns are changing, and river flows are shrinking. That is resulting in droughts in some regions, and floods and coastal erosion in others. Meanwhile, pollution and overconsumption are imperiling the availability of fresh, clean, accessible water on which all life depends. Dwindling supplies can increase competition and inflame tensions between people, communities, and countries. That is increasing the risk of conflict.

Water for peace is the theme of this year’s World Water Day. Achieving it relies on far greater cooperation. Today, 153 countries share water resources. Yet only twenty-four have reported cooperation agreements for all their shared water. We must accelerate efforts to work together across borders, and I urge all countries to join and implement the United Nations Water Convention – which promotes managing shared water resources sustainably.

Cooperating to safeguard water can power and sustain peace. Water stewardship can strengthen multilateralism and ties between communities, and build resilience to climate disasters. It can also drive progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals – which are the foundation of peaceful societies – including by improving health, reducing poverty and inequality, and boosting food and water security.

Let’s commit to work together, to make water a force for cooperation, harmony and stability, and so help to create a world of peace and prosperity for all.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  -- MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR DISARMAMENT AND  NON-PROLIFERATION AWARENESS
Content: 05 March 2024
--
This second International Day for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Awareness comes at a perilous moment, marked by rising levels of military spending, deepening geopolitical tensions and growing violent conflicts across the globe.
Meanwhile, some leaders are using apocalyptic rhetoric on the use of nuclear weapons.  The proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons, the use of explosive devices in populated areas, and the growing military application of new and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, are also serious concerns.
Today reminds us that disarmament and non-proliferation are critical not only to a peaceful future, but to our very existence.
Global leaders must invest in peace by strengthening the systems and tools that prevent the proliferation and use of deadly weapons — including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — and by developing disarmament solutions.
The proposed New Agenda for Peace includes new strategies and approaches to eliminate the threats posed by nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and other emerging dangers, such as autonomous weapons systems.
On this important day, let us speak with one loud, clear and united voice.
It’s time to stop the madness. We need disarmament now.

Title: UNICEF/WHO : More than 1.29 million children in Yemen protected from polio after door-to-door immunization campaign | 05 March 2024
Content: 05 March 2024
Aden, Yemen
In just 4 days, a polio immunization campaign in Yemen has reached more than 1.29 million children aged under 5 years. Overall, the campaign achieved 101% coverage, with a range of 89% to over 100%. Yemen’s Ministry of Public Health and Population collaborated with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to deliver this successful campaign.
“This is an important step to protect children from deadly childhood diseases. With confirmed cases of polio among Yemeni children, an imminent threat persists. This is an ongoing risk to the life of every unvaccinated child. Health authorities and donors must continue to work together to ensure universal immunization coverage for all children across Yemen,” said Peter Hawkins, UNICEF Representative in Yemen.
“This is a major achievement in advancing the health outcomes and well-being of children in Yemen. Poliovirus and other childhood diseases can cause permanent disabilities and, in many cases, death. But a small dose of vaccine can provide the necessary protection. There is no reason for children to die of vaccine-preventable diseases. Children are the future, and all investment in their health is an investment in the development of the country,” said Dr Arturo Pesigan, WHO Representative in Yemen.
The campaign was implemented with the generous support of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Through this campaign, Yemen joined more than 35 countries in using the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2), which has been granted WHO prequalification. The success of the campaign also resulted from joining forces with health providers who worked hard to reach unvaccinated and zero-dose children to reduce the spread of the disease.
Notes to editors
From 2021 to 2023, Yemen reported 237 variant poliovirus type 2 cases – both circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). These are known to emerge in contexts of chronic underimmunization. The cases came from 117 districts, and 90% of the affected children were aged under 5 years, while 10% of cases were older children.
Low vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy leave children vulnerable to outbreaks of potentially fatal diseases that can easily be prevented. Organized and widespread antivaccination campaigns that misinform the public have also prevented the effective control of disease outbreaks in many communities.

Title: UNEP: Rich countries use six times more resources, generate 10 times  the climate impacts than low-income ones,  far exceeding human needs and nature’s capacity
Content: 01 March 2024
Nairobi,
Extraction of the Earth’s natural resources tripled in the past five decades, related to the massive build-up of infrastructure in many parts of the world and the high levels of material consumption, especially in upper-middle and high-income countries. Material extraction is expected to rise by 60 per cent by 2060 and could derail efforts to achieve not only global climate, biodiversity, and pollution targets but also economic prosperity and human well-being, according to a report published today by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)-hosted International Resource Panel.
The 2024 Global Resource Outlook, developed by the International Resource Panel with authors from around the globe and launched during the sixth session of the UN Environment Assembly, calls for sweeping policy changes to bring humanity to live within its means and reduce this projected growth in resource use by one third, while growing the economy, improving well-being, and minimizing environmental impacts.
The report finds that growth in resource use since 1970 from 30 to 106 billion tonnes – or from 23 to 39 kilogrammes of materials used on average per person per day – has dramatic environmental impacts. Overall, resource extraction and processing account for over 60 per cent of planet-warming emissions and for 40 per cent of health-related impacts of air pollution.
The extraction and processing of biomass (e.g., agricultural crops and forestry) accounts for 90 per cent of land-related biodiversity loss and water stress, as well as one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, extraction and processing of fossil fuels, metals and non-metallic minerals (e.g., sand, gravel, clay) together account for 35 per cent of global emissions.
“The triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature loss and pollution is driven from a crisis of unsustainable consumption and production. We must work with nature, instead of merely exploiting it,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “Reducing the resource intensity of mobility, housing, food and energy systems is the only way we can achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and ultimately a just and liveable planet for all.”
At the heart of global resource use are fundamental inequalities: low-income countries consume six times less materials and generate 10 times less climate impacts than those living in high-income countries. Upper middle-income countries have more than doubled resource use in the past 50 years due to their own growth in infrastructure and the relocation of resource intensive processes from high-income countries. At the same time, per capita resource use and related environmental impacts in low-income countries has remained relatively low and almost unchanged since 1995.
Where consumption levels are very high, greater focus on lowering resource and material consumption levels to complement action on production and resource efficiency can reduce around 30 per cent of global resource use as compared to historical trends, while growing the global economy, improving lives, and staying within planetary boundaries.
Where resource use needs to grow, strategies can be put in place to maximise the value of each unit of resource used and meet human needs in ways that are not resource intensive, so that the benefits of resource use far outpace the rate of their extraction and the environmental and health impacts stay in line with international obligations on climate, biodiversity, and sustainability.
Incorporating environmental externalities in trade agreements, strengthening regulation of financial commodity markets, and putting in place impact related border adjustment policies are just some of the ways that countries can prevent a race to the bottom on environmental and social standards of resource extraction, and maximise and retain the value from extraction processes in country.
“We should not accept that meeting human needs must be resource intensive, and we must stop stimulating extraction-based economic success. With decisive action by politicians and the private sector, a decent life for all is possible without costing the earth,” said Janez Potočnik, the International Resource Panel’s Co-Chair.
“Last year’s climate conference agreed to transition away from fossil fuels. Now is the time to bring everyone to the table to phase up solutions to make that possible. Now is the time to phase up resource-based solutions for climate, biodiversity and equity so that everyone, everywhere can live a life in dignity,” said Izabella Teixeira, the International Resource Panel’s Co-Chair.
Specific recommendations include:
Implemented together, these policies can transform the built environment, mobility, food, and energy systems, resulting in an upsurge in renewable energies and energy efficiency, decarbonization of material production, more walkable and cyclable cities with better public transportation and remote work opportunities, as well as reduced food loss and waste. High- and upper-middle income countries would see a dietary shift away from animal protein and more compact cities, while lower-income economies would experience a rise in resource use to enable dignified living.
Such systemic shifts are projected to peak resource extraction by 2040 and then decrease use to only 20 per cent above 2020 levels by 2060. Greenhouse gas emissions would drop by over 80 per cent, stocks of transport-related materials and building materials would fall by 50 and 25 per cent respectively, and land-use for agriculture would fall by 5 per cent. Concurrently, food production would increase by 40 per cent, to support populations, even where there is growth and food security, the global economy would grow by 3 per cent, and the Human Development Index would improve by 7 per cent, boosting incomes and well-being.
Given the failure so far to deliver on many policy commitments in MEAs and the urgency of the triple planetary crisis, the report supports immediate actions, following the principle of ‘best available science.’

Title: WHO - UNICEF Yemen: Polio immunization campaign to protect 1.3 million children in 12 governorates of Yemen
Content: 25 February 2024
Aden, Yemen
Around 1.3 million children aged under five will be protected against polio in a vaccination campaign launched today with the support of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The Ministry of Public Health and Population aims to reach every child and UNICEF and WHO are assisting by providing the vaccine, equipping with cold chain storage, funding for training and deployment of vaccinators for the campaign targeting 12 governorates in Yemen.
This vaccination campaign is in response to an outbreak of variant poliovirus type 2, which to date has paralysed 237 children across Yemen. Polio infection can result in permanent, debilitating paralysis. It has no known cure but can easily be prevented through vaccination.
“For Yemen’s children, vaccination offers much-needed protection in one of the world’s most challenging contexts. The teams have been working around the clock to train vaccinators and make sure the cold rooms and solar fridges are working and cold boxes are in place to keep the vaccine cold from the moment it arrives in Yemen until it reaches every girl and boy under the age of five,” said UNICEF Representative in Yemen Peter Hawkins.
“We know that it is not enough to tell parents why it is important to vaccinate their children. In Yemen, where parents are dealing with conflict, economic crisis and extremely limited public health infrastructure and services, we need to improve access to vaccination. We need to make it easier. In this campaign, we have worked closely with the Ministry of Public Health and Population to ensure the vaccine will be brought to the doorstep of every house in every community in these 12 governorates,” added WHO Representative in Yemen Dr Arturo Pesigan.
Mass immunization campaigns aim to boost population immunity in a context of increased risk. This polio campaign comes as children continue to be paralysed, and as testing of wastewater shows the presence of poliovirus in communities. The campaign aims to give girls and boys under the age of five an extra boost of protection, on top of their regularly scheduled immunizations and the supplementary immunization campaigns that took place in 2022 and 2023. A second round of polio vaccination campaign will happen after Ramadan.
The vaccination campaign in Yemen is part of the global effort to eradicate poliovirus, spearheaded by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

Title: UNEP: Everything, everywhere, all as one: how the UN Environment Assembly can steer the world to a sustainable future
Content: 17 February 2024
By Inger Andersen, Under-Secretary of the United Nations and Executive Director, United Nations Environment Programme
The world does not have an environmental to-do list. The world has an environmental must-do list – for 2024 and for decades into the future. We must slow and adapt to climate change, protect and restore nature and biodiversity, reverse land degradation and desertification, and end pollution and waste. Get it right, and we can build a future that works for the many, not just the few – a principle that is at the heart of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Nations at all stages of development have committed to work towards this sustainable future under dozens of multilateral environmental agreements. In times of geopolitical crisis and shifting political landscapes, this is no mean feat. Action on the environment is a powerful force for unity.
There are global deals that set agreed goals and targets, such as the Paris Agreement, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the Global Framework on Chemicals. Many businesses and investors are promising to align their models and capital with low-carbon and nature-positive aspirations. International banks and organizations of all shades and stripes are making environmental action a core part of their objectives. The scientific community is increasingly moving from sounding the alarm to signposting solutions.
However, progress on turning commitments into transformative action must accelerate rapidly. Last year was the warmest on record, with resultant heatwaves, storms and droughts causing havoc. Millions of people died from pollution of the air, land and water. Rainforests continued to shrink and populations of species crucial to ecosystem health dwindled. Every day, every week, every month this continues, humanity digs itself into a deeper hole that will take longer to climb out from.
However, it isn’t just about working harder; it’s about working smarter. With so many agreements in play, there is a growing risk of fragmentation. This is a challenge we need to address by ensuring that work on each commitment dovetails with and amplifies the work of the others. After all, we are essentially facing one single global challenge: what we at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) call the triple planetary crisis: namely the crisis of climate change, the crisis of nature and biodiversity loss and the crisis of pollution and waste. The core drivers of every environmental challenge are often the same: unsustainable consumption and production chief among them. The best solutions to deploy are those that hit multiple challenges at once.
This is where the United Nations Environment Assembly, known as UNEA, comes in. The Assembly, the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment, unites nations every two years to look not just at isolated issues, but everything, everywhere, all as one.
The sixth gathering of the Assembly is taking place this month in Nairobi, Kenya at the home of UNEP – which hosts the secretariats of over two dozen agreements, regional conventions and scientific panels. This year, we are inviting the multilateral environmental agreements, nations and indeed every actor to come together and find new ways of working together towards a common goal.
I am not saying this will be simple. There are dozens of bodies, covering hundreds of goals and targets. The Paris Agreement targets limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C or 1.5°C. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework foresees the protection, restoration and sustainable management of Earth’s lands, oceans, coastal areas and inland waters. Nations are aiming for land degradation neutrality under the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. The Montreal Protocol continues to protect the ozone layer and is contributing to climate action. We have other agreements to do everything from protecting species to shielding people and the planet from harmful chemicals and waste. A new instrument to end plastic pollution is also in the final stages. Meanwhile, nations will step up at UNEA-6 with new resolutions aimed at tackling the triple planetary crisis.
With so much going on, it sometimes feels like we are all in one boat aiming for the same port, operating dozens of different wheelhouses connected to different rudders. We are not taking the fastest, most direct route to the destination. At UNEA-6, everyone must strive to find new ways to coordinate the wheelhouses. To learn from each other and apply lessons of the past to the future. And to start delivering on the many commitments that will make the planet, and humanity, whole and healthy.

Nairobi, 13 February 2024 – The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) have named seven initiatives from Africa, Latin America, the Mediterranean, and Southeast Asia as UN World Restoration Flagships. These initiatives include ecosystems at the tipping point of outright degradation resulting from wildfires, drought, deforestation, and pollution. They are now eligible for technical and financial UN support.
The World Restoration Flagship awards are part of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration – led by UNEP and FAO – which aims to prevent, halt, and reverse the degradation of ecosystems on every continent and in every ocean. The awards track notable initiatives that support global commitments to restore one billion hectares – an area larger than China.
The winning initiatives are announced ahead of the 6th session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-6), the world’s highest-level decision-making body for matters related to the environment, taking place from February 26 – March 1 at UNEP headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. Together, the seven new flagships are expected to restore nearly 40 million hectares − an area almost 600 times the size of Nairobi − and create around 500,000 jobs.
“For too long, economic development came at the expense of the environment. Yet today we see global efforts to usher in a comeback for nature,” Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, said. “These initiatives show how we can make peace with nature, put local communities at the heart of restoration efforts and still create new jobs. As we continue to face a triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, now is the time we must double down and accelerate restoration initiatives.”
The World Restoration Flagships are chosen as the best examples of ongoing, large-scale and long-term ecosystem restoration by the Task Forces for Science and Best Practices of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and approved by its Executive Board. Selection follows a thorough review process with over 60 indicators and criteria, embodying the 10 Restoration Principles of the UN Decade.
FAO Director-General QU Dongyu said: ”FAO is pleased to recognize these seven worthy champoins, proving that we can offer the leading examples to reverse ecosystem degradation at scale, while also addressing the impacts of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. Restoring terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is a crucial step in the transformation of global agrifood systems to be more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable. Ecosystem restoration is long term solution in the fight to eradicate poverty, hunger and malnutrition, as we face population growth and increased need for foods and ecosystem goods and services.”
In 2022, the inaugural ten World Restoration Flagships were recognized as part of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, to be followed with similar efforts every two years until 2030. This year’s World Restoration Flagships are part of an accelerated investment in nature by governments and private donors, notably reflected in USD 1.4 billion provided last year by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council.
Jason Momoa, actor and UNEP Advocate for Life Below Water: "Conserving nature is crucial, but it's not cutting it anymore. We've lost too much of our planet, and it's time to step up and rebuild what we messed up, fix what we broke, and restore what we trashed. These restoration initiatives are like the exciting answers to the big questions our connection to the natural world raises – just like the best movies do."
Each of the seven World Restoration Flagships is being announced in video messages shared on UN social media channels by a UN or UNEP Goodwill Ambassador or Advocate, including actors Dia Mirza, Jason Momoa, and Edward Norton, chef Leyla Fathallah, and super-model and best-selling author Gisele Bündchen.

From Fires to Forests – Resilience in the Mediterranean
The Mediterranean basin is the world’s second largest biodiversity hotspot, but 16 per cent of its forest species are threatened with extinction, in part due to climate-driven longer drought periods, extreme heat waves and wildfires. In the past decade, the region has experienced the worst fire seasons on record.
The Restoring Mediterranean Forests Initiative involving Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, and Türkiye consists of a novel approach to protecting and restoring these natural habitats and vulnerable ecosystems and has led to around two million hectares of forests restored across the region since 2017, with over eight million hectares planned for restoration by 2030.
The initiative is supported by FAO’s Committee on Mediterranean Forestry Questions – Silva Mediterranea, the governments of Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, and Türkiye, and The Association for Forests, Development and Conservation Lebanon (AFDC).
Living Indus – Restoring a Cradle of Civilizations
The 3,180 km long Indus River has served as the vibrant core of the social, cultural, and economic life of what is today called Pakistan for well over 5,000 years. Some 90 per cent of Pakistan’s people and more than three-quarters of its economy reside in the Indus Basin, and it irrigates over 80 percent of its arable land. Negligence, environmental degradation, and climate change have threatened the river’s ecosystem, including its abundant fish and fertile lands.
The Living Indus initiative was approved by Pakistan’s parliament in the wake of the devastating 2022 climate-change induced floods and was officially launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Sharm el-Sheikh (COP27). It aims to restore 25 million hectares of river basin by 2030, encompassing 30 per cent of Pakistan’s surface area through the implementation of 25 high-impact interventions for policymakers, practitioners and civil society. The initiative designates the Indus River as a living entity with rights – a measure taken to protect rivers elsewhere, including in Australia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Ecuador, India, New Zealand, Peru, and Sri Lanka.
Partners in this initiative include the Government of Pakistan, FAO and other UN agencies.
Acción Andina: Saving a global water and climate hotspot
The Acción Andina social movement is led by Peruvian conservation non- profit organisation, ECOAN (Asociacion Ecosistemas Andinos). It is scaling up a community reforestation model, which has proved itself over the past two decades as a cost-effective solution for climate resilience plans to restore and grow 30 million trees by 2030 across a vegetative band spanning almost 800,000 hectares in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.
The initiative ultimately aims to protect and restore a forest area of one million hectares. 25,000 people from remote Andean communities are already engaged in restoring 5,000 hectares and protecting over 11,000 hectares of Andean forests. They are expected to benefit from the initiative by 2030 in various ways, from access to medicine, solar panels, and clean-burning clay stoves, to improved grazing management, sustainable agriculture, microbusiness, and ecotourism management of Indigenous cultures. It also works to secure land titles for local communities, protecting the forest from future mining, timber exploitation and other drivers of degradation.
Partners in this initiative include the Asociación Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN) and Global Forest Generation (GFG).
Sri Lanka stopped planting mangroves and started growing them
In Sri Lanka, mangrove forests are immensely valuable coastal ecosystems that thrive at the border between land and sea and serve as an important bridge between marine and terrestrial biodiversity. The livelihoods of coastal communities in Sri Lanka are highly dependent on marine and coastal ecosystems. Nevertheless, climate change and human activities are posing threats to this unique ecosystem.
The Sri Lanka Mangrove Regeneration Initiative is science-driven, co-led by local communities, and focused on restoring the natural balance in the ecosystem. Since the initiative was launched in 2015, efforts have already resulted in 500 hectares of restored mangroves, benefiting 150 households. Some 10,000 hectares are slated for restoration by 2030, with 5,000 households to benefit and more than 4,000 new jobs to be created.
Partners in this initiative include the Sri Lanka Ministry of Environment and the governments of Australia, the UK and USA.
Terai Arc Landscape: Reviving Asia’s mega-fauna
Over seven million people depend on the Terai Arc Landscape, stretching across 5.10 million hectares and shared by India and Nepal. It is also one of the world’s most critical habitats for tigers whose numbers have sharply declined, along with those of other species such as rhinos and elephants, due to poaching, habitat loss, degradation, and human-wildlife conflict.
The Terai Arc Landscape Initiative has focused on restoring the forests of critical corridors of the Terai Arc Landscape and collaborates with local communities working as citizen scientists, community based anti-poaching units, forest guards and social mobilizers. The restoration of 66,800 hectares of Nepal’s forests, as well as other measures, has improved the livelihoods of about 500,000 households in Nepal. It also supported the tiger population in the landscape shared by India and Nepal, increased today to 1,174– more than doubling what had been its lowest number when the programme launched in 2001. Development is expected to continue as almost 350,000 hectares will be restored by 2030.
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Nepal is the primary partner in this initiative, supporting the Nepalese government.
Regreening Africa’s agriculture
The Regreening Africa initiative has been using proven agroforestry techniques, adapted to suit the needs of farmers under varying socio-ecological contexts in the past two decades, to restore over 350,000 hectares in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, and Somalia. By 2030, a further five million hectares are planned to be restored.
The initiative is expected to benefit more than 600,000 households. It is also increasing carbon storage, boosting crop and grass yields, makes soil more resilient (preventing floods) and treating it with fixed nitrogen that acts as a natural fertilizer.
Partners in this initiative include CARE Nederland, Catholic Relief Services, CIFOR-ICRAF, Oxfam, Regreening Africa, Sahel Eco, and World Vision Australia.
Growing forests in Africa's drylands: African farmers transforming food systems
The Forest Garden Program, launched in 2015, includes multiple Forest Garden projects in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, Senegal, Uganda, and Tanzania. Through researched agroforestry techniques, unsustainable farming practices are replaced and nature regenerates, as farmers receive essential training, supplies and equipment for their success.
By planting tens of millions of trees every year, it aims at expanding from 41,000 restored hectares today to 229,000 hectares by 2030, supporting many more through 230,000 jobs created.
Partners in this initiative include Trees for the Future.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE FOR THE  INTERNATIONAL DAY OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SCIENCE
Content: 11 February 2024
--
Gender equality in science is vital for building a better future for all. Unfortunately, women and girls continue to face systemic barriers and biases that prevent them from pursuing careers in science.
This deprives our world of great talent. Today, women make up only one-third of the global scientific community, obtaining less funding, fewer publishing opportunities and fewer senior positions at top universities than men. In some places, women and girls have limited or no access to education – an act of self-harm for the societies concerned, and a terrible violation of human rights.
From climate change to health to artificial intelligence, the equal participation of women and girls in scientific discovery and innovation is the only way to ensure that science works for everyone.
Closing the gender gap requires dismantling gender stereotypes and promoting role models that encourage girls to choose science; developing programmes to support the advancement of women in science; and cultivating a working environment that nurtures the talents of all, including women members of minority communities.
Women and girls belong in science. It is time to recognize that inclusion fosters innovation, and let every woman and girl fulfil her true potential.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL   --  MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF ZERO TOLERANCE FOR FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION
Content: 06 February 2024
“Her Voice. Her Future. Investing in Survivor-Led Movements to End Female Genital Mutilation”
Female genital mutilation is an egregious violation of fundamental human rights that causes lifelong harm to the physical and mental health of women and girls.
In 2024, some 4.4 million girls are at risk of suffering from this horrific act of gender-based violence. Even one mutilation is one too many.
We need decisive action to tackle the social, economic and political norms that perpetuate discrimination against women and girls, limit their participation and leadership, and restrict their access to education and employment.
That starts with challenging the patriarchal power structures and attitudes at the root of this abhorrent practice.
We need urgent investments to reach the target set in the Sustainable Development Goals of eliminating female genital mutilation by 2030.
And we need to amplify the voices of survivors and support their efforts to reclaim their lives, based on their bodily autonomy.
On the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation and every day, let’s redouble our efforts and investments to uphold the rights of women and girls, and put a decisive end to female genital mutilation once and for all.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF HUMAN FRATERNITY
Content: 04 February 2024
--
On this International Day of Human Fraternity, we celebrate the spirit of mutual respect and solidarity that binds us together as one human family.

Today, these values are being severely tested.  Our world is marred by divisions, conflicts, and inequalities.  Discrimination is running rampant.

We must come together to protect and uphold human rights, combat hate speech and violent extremism, and push back against those who profit from fear.

We can take inspiration from the declaration “Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together” – co-authored by His Holiness Pope Francis and His Eminence the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Sheikh Ahmed El Tayeb – to work towards a world where dialogue, compassion, and human dignity prevail.

Let us reaffirm our commitment to bridging divides, fostering religious understanding and cooperation among people of all cultures and beliefs.

Together, let us forge a path towards a more peaceful, just and harmonious world for all.

Title: UN SPECIAL ENVOY FOR YEMEN’S VISITS TEHRAN
Content: 04 February 2024
--
The UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, visited Tehran and met with the Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other senior officials and diplomats.
In his meetings, the Special Envoy stressed the need to safeguard the progress made toward a nationwide ceasefire, measures to improve Yemenis' living conditions, and the resumption of a Yemeni-owned political process under UN auspices. To this end, the Special Envoy explored with the Iranian officials ways to maintain a conducive environment for continued constructive dialogue in Yemen, including through sustained concerted regional and international support for UN-led peace mediation.
Discussions also focused on the need to de-escalate tensions at the regional level, and to prevent a relapse into the cycle of violence which plagued Yemen until the UN-brokered truce of 2022.
"I am encouraged by the continued regional support to the United Nations' peace efforts in Yemen at a time when there is so much at stake for 30 million Yemenis," Grundberg said and emphasized the need to reach a peaceful resolution that meets the aspirations of Yemenis.

Title: OCHA Yemen: The humanitarian community appeals to donors to help millions in need in Yemen
Content: 01 February 2024
1 February 2024
The United Nations and its partners released the 2024 Yemen Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) and Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) today to reach millions of people with lifesaving assistance and protection services.
Given the critical needs, 219 humanitarian partners are appealing for urgent support for over 18.2 million women, girls, boys and men.
“The HNO and the HRP give voice to civilians in Yemen, who have faced tremendous suffering daily for more than nine years due to conflict, economic deterioration, severely disrupted public infrastructure and services, as well as climate change,” said Peter Hawkins, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, a.i. “They demonstrate our collective and coordinated efforts to save lives, reduce risks and support resilience.”
The Humanitarian Response Plan for 2024 requires $2.7 billion for a strengthened, targeted, prioritized, risk-informed and bottom-up approach to programming in Yemen. The plan is based on robust consultations across the country with affected people, authorities and institutions, humanitarian actors, and development partners at both local and national levels. It also reflects the way the humanitarian community will adapt its response in view of limited funding and access constraints.
“Yemen is facing a critical juncture and has a unique opportunity to take a decisive step away from the humanitarian crisis by addressing the drivers of need,” Mr. Hawkins said. “While regional conflict dynamics have introduced additional risks, the humanitarian community remains committed to stay and deliver.”
The Plan emphasizes the collaboration with development partners to support livelihoods, basic services, and economic conditions to build long-term solutions, as outlined in the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for Yemen 2022-2025.
“We must not turn our backs on the people of Yemen. I am appealing to donors for their continued and urgent support to save lives, build resilience, and also to fund sustainable interventions,” Mr. Hawkins urged.
After more than nine years of conflict, 18.2 million people in Yemen require support. 17.6 million people are estimated to face acute food insecurity in 2024. In 2023, child mortality slightly improved following years of sustained humanitarian assistance. However, Yemen is experiencing some of the highest malnutrition rates ever recorded—with nearly half of all children under five years experiencing moderate to severe stunting—and the situation continues to worsen. An estimated 6.7 million people are living in inadequate shelters. Limited access to critical services continues to worsen the conditions for the most vulnerable groups, including women and children. 12.4 million people lack sufficient access to safe drinking water, increasing the risk of infectious diseases, while more than 4.5 million children of school age (5 to 17 years) do not attend schools. An estimated 4.5 million people are currently displaced in Yemen, one-third of whom have been displaced more than once, eroding their coping capacity. The 2024 HRP requires $2.7 billion for live-saving assistance and protection services. The UNSDCF requires $1.3 billion to support millions with sustainable development programming.

Title: IOM Rehabilitates Humanitarian Hub in Ta’iz to Enhance Access and Support
Content: 01 February 2024
Ta’iz
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has established a humanitarian hub in Ta’iz, in southwestern Yemen, to enhance access to critical services and support vulnerable communities in the region.
Endorsed by local authorities and supported by the Yemen Humanitarian Fund, the hub will serve as a secure operational base for humanitarian partners, facilitating their efforts to address urgent needs in Ta’iz.
“The establishment of the humanitarian hub in Ta’iz marks a significant milestone in our commitment to supporting vulnerable communities in Yemen,” said IOM Yemen’s Acting Chief of Mission, Matt Huber. “This initiative not only enhances access to critical services but also signifies a collaborative effort towards sustainable development and resilience-building in the region,” he added.
For over three years, IOM has been providing crucial services to displaced communities in Ta’iz governorate, responding to the effects of nearly a decade of conflict. The region faces significant challenges, including a water crisis, collapsed healthcare systems, and limited access to humanitarian assistance.
IOM serves around 10,000 people across 13 sites for internally displaced persons (IDPs); thus, the establishment of the hub is crucial for ensuring their access to multisectoral services and facilitating humanitarian operations. Through this intervention, IOM seeks to scale up its support and help communities recover and rebuild amidst these challenging circumstances.
Through its ongoing Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) activities, site maintenance, establishment of community groups, and implementation of effective community feedback mechanisms, IOM has been able to foster a supportive environment for displaced populations in Ta’iz.
Women empowerment initiatives across eight IOM-managed sites have engaged 200 women in on-the-job training and literacy activities, while 170 youths have participated in sports programmes across 10 sites. Ongoing flood reduction efforts and infrastructure enhancements in 12 sites have bolstered resilience, complemented by school rehabilitation projects promoting coexistence between displaced and host communities.
Furthermore, based on community assessments, IOM continues to implement Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) projects in five districts across Ta’iz, benefiting thousands with improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities.
Strategic interventions, including solarization and rehabilitation of pumping stations, alongside water supply station upgrades, have enhanced access for over 120,000 beneficiaries, mitigating longstanding challenges.
As Ta'iz grapples with prolonged conflict that has devastated healthcare infrastructure, leaving many communities without access to essential services, IOM, alongside partners, implements comprehensive health programmes ensuring vulnerable populations have access to critical services. From constructing and rehabilitating health facilities to operating mobile medical clinics, IOM focuses on delivering essential care and implementing preventative measures.
To ensure the sustainability of this intervention, IOM will also explore a cost sharing mechanism amongst the partners using the hub. This mechanism will follow the same formula used in other UN Hubs to support a stable environment for this important operational platform. The establishment of the humanitarian hub aligns with IOM’s broader efforts to expand humanitarian access, integrate durable solutions, and address critical needs in the region.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- REMARKS TO THE OPENING OF THE 2024 SESSION  OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE EXERCISE  OF THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE
Content: 31 January 2024
New York, 31 January 2024
[as delivered]
Mr. Chair, Ambassador Cheikh Niang, congratulations on your election to the Bureau.
The Committee’s mandate and advocacy are crucial amidst the unresolved Question of Palestine and the enormous violence and suffering, particularly since the horrific 7 October attack by Hamas in Israel and Israel’s ensuing military operations in Gaza.
The death, destruction, displacement, hunger, loss, and grief in Gaza over the past 120 days are a scar on our shared humanity and conscience.
And I once again condemn the horrifying attacks by Hamas and other groups that claimed the lives of over 1,200 Israelis and others – and call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.
There is no justification for the intentional killing, injuring, torture or kidnapping of civilians, using sexual violence against them, or launching rockets towards civilian targets.
But at the same time, nothing can justify the collective punishment of the people in Gaza.
The ongoing conflict and relentless bombardment by Israeli forces across Gaza have resulted in killings of civilians and destruction at a pace and scale unlike anything we have witnessed in recent years.
I am horrified by incessant military strikes that have killed and maimed civilians and protected personnel, and that have damaged or destroyed civilian infrastructure.
Over 26,750 Palestinians have been reportedly been  killed in Gaza alone – more than two-thirds women and children.
Over 70 per cent of civilian infrastructure -- including homes, hospitals, schools, water, and sanitation facilities in Gaza -- have been destroyed or severely damaged.
1.7 million people have been displaced, and not knowing if they will have homes to return to.
No party to an armed conflict is above international law.
International humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions in attack, must be upheld at all times.
And the binding decisions of the International Court of Justice must be complied with.
I also want to add that the United Nations immediately acted following the very serious allegations against UNRWA staff members.
I was personally horrified by these accusations.
And yesterday, I met with donors to listen to their concerns and to outline the steps we are taking to address them.
I underscored the importance of keeping UNRWA’s vital work going to meet the dire needs of civilians in Gaza, and to ensure its continuity of services to Palestine refugees in the occupied West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
UNRWA is the backbone of all humanitarian response in Gaza.
I appeal to all Member States to guarantee the continuity of UNRWA’s life-saving work.

Excellencies,
The humanitarian system in Gaza is collapsing.
I am extremely concerned by the inhumane conditions faced by Gaza’s 2.2 million people, as they struggle to survive without any of the basics.
Everyone in Gaza is hungry, while half a million grapple with catastrophic levels of food insecurity.
I call for a rapid, safe, unhindered, expanded and sustained humanitarian access throughout Gaza.
This is particularly crucial in the north, where most missions have been denied access by Israel, amid continued insecurity and fighting.
We also need more crossing points into Gaza to reduce congestion and avoid chokepoints.
I ask all parties to continue their active engagement with UN actors on the ground and to work closely with newly appointed Under-Secretary-General Sigrid Kaag -- the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza -- to scale up humanitarian aid to Gaza.
I count on full cooperation to ensure continuous humanitarian access.
And I repeat my call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.

Excellencies,
As we seek to address mounting needs in Gaza, we also remain focused on the deteriorating situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
I am extremely alarmed by the high levels of settler violence in the occupied West Bank.  Palestinian attacks against Israelis also continue.
All of this violence must stop, and the perpetrators held accountable.
Intensive Israeli operations go on, including in Area A of the occupied West Bank, leading to deadly armed exchanges.
Dozens of Palestinians have been arrested, with many detained without charge, including children.
The violence has not been limited to the occupied territory.
Rising hostilities across the Blue Line and attacks in Syria, Iraq and the Red Sea risk triggering a broader escalation risking regional stability.
I call for urgent steps to de-escalate the situation and spare the region from more violence before it is too late.

Excellencies,
The conflict must end with tangible progress towards a two-State solution – an end to the occupation and the establishment of a fully independent, viable and sovereign Palestinian State, of which Gaza is an integral part.
Only the two-State solution – based on the 1967 lines, with Israel and Palestine living side-by-side, with Jerusalem as the capital of both States, in line with UN resolutions, international law and prior agreements -- can ensure the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people as well as a just and lasting peace and stability in the region.
The international community must not waver in its commitment.
Let us work together to advance a meaningful peace process that will put an end to the tragic cycles of fear, hatred and violence and build a more peaceful and hopeful future for Palestinians and Israelis.
Thank you.

THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- REMARKS AT PRESS STAKEOUT

New York, 15 January 2024
Good afternoon.

More than 100 days have passed since the horrific 7 October attacks by Hamas that claimed the lives of more than one thousand Israelis and others, and resulted in the brutal seizing of hostages.

Every day I think of the anguish of the families I met.

I once again demand the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. In the interim, they must be treated humanely and allowed to receive visits and assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross.

The accounts of sexual violence committed by Hamas and others on October 7th must be rigorously investigated and prosecuted.

Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians – or the launching of rockets towards civilian targets.

At the same time, the onslaught on Gaza by Israeli forces over these 100 days has unleashed wholesale destruction and levels of civilian killings at a rate that is unprecedented during my years as Secretary-General.

The vast majority of those killed are women and children.

Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.

The humanitarian situation in Gaza is beyond words.  Nowhere and no one is safe.

Traumatized people are being pushed into increasingly limited areas in the south that are becoming intolerably and dangerously congested.

While there have been some steps to increase the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, life-saving relief is not getting to people who have endured months of relentless assault at anywhere near the scale needed.

The long shadow of starvation is stalking the people of Gaza – along with disease, malnutrition and other health threats.

I am deeply troubled by the clear violation of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing.

Last week, Under-Secretary-General Sigrid Kaag began her work as Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza – in line with Security Council Resolution 2720.

I ask all states and parties to the conflict for their full cooperation, as she also works with members of the Security Council and regional actors to deliver on the mandate set in the resolution.

An effective aid operation in Gaza – or anywhere else -- requires certain basics.

It requires security.

It requires an environment where staff can work in safety.

It requires the necessary logistics and the resumption of commercial activity.

The obstacles to aid are clear – and they have been identified not only by the UN, but by officials from around the globe who have seen the situation for themselves.

First, the United Nations and our partners cannot effectively deliver humanitarian aid while Gaza is under such heavy, widespread and unrelenting bombardment.

This endangers the lives of those who receive aid – and those who deliver it.

The vast majority of our Palestinian staff in Gaza have been forced to flee their homes.

Since October 7th, 152 UN staff members have been killed in Gaza – the largest single loss of life in the history of our organization -- a heart-wrenching figure and a source of deep sorrow.

Still, aid workers, under enormous pressure and with no safety guarantees, are doing their best to deliver inside Gaza.

We continue to call for rapid, safe, unhindered, expanded and sustained humanitarian access into and across Gaza.

Second, the aid operation faces significant hurdles at the Gaza border.

Vital materials – including life-saving medical equipment and parts which are critical for the repair of water facilities and infrastructure – have been rejected with little or no explanation, disrupting the flow of critical supplies and the resumption of basic services.

And when one item is denied, the time-consuming approval process starts again from scratch for the entire cargo.

Third, the aid operation faces major impediments to distribution within Gaza.

This includes repeated denials of access to the north, where hundreds of thousands of people remain.

Since the start of the year, just 7 of 29 missions to deliver aid to the north have been able to proceed.

Large stretches of agreed routes cannot be used due to heavy fighting and debris, with unexploded ordnance also threatening convoys.

Humanitarian notification systems to maximize the safety of aid operations are not being respected.

In addition, frequent telecommunications blackouts means humanitarian workers cannot seek out the safest roads, coordinate aid distribution or track the movements of displaced people who need assistance.

We are seeking to ramp up the response – but we need basic conditions in place.
The parties must respect international humanitarian law –respect and protect civilians, and ensure their essential needs are met.

And there must be an immediate and massive increase in the commercial supply of essential goods.

The UN and humanitarian partners cannot alone provide basic necessities that should also be available in markets to the entire population.

Ladies and gentlemen of the media,

Meanwhile, the cauldron of tensions in the occupied West Bank is boiling over with heightened violence compounding an already dire fiscal crisis for the Palestinian Authority.

Tensions are also sky-high in the Red Sea and beyond – and may soon be impossible to contain.

I have serious concerns about daily exchanges of fire across the Blue Line.

This risks triggering a broader escalation between Israel and Lebanon and profoundly affecting regional stability.

Tens of thousands of people in northern Israel and southern Lebanon have been displaced by the fighting and humanitarian access in Lebanon continues to be constrained.

I am profoundly worried by what is unfolding.

It is my duty to convey this simple and direct message to all sides:

Stop playing with fire across the Blue Line, de-escalate, and bring hostilities to an end in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1701.

Ladies and gentlemen of the media,

I have outlined concerns about a wide range of issues: the unprecedented level of civilian casualties and catastrophic humanitarian conditions in Gaza; the fate of the hostages; the tensions that are spilling [over] across the region.

There is one solution to help address all these issues.

We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.

To ensure sufficient aid gets to where it is needed.

To facilitate the release of the hostages.

To tamp down the flames of wider war because the longer the conflict in Gaza continues, the greater the risk of escalation and miscalculation.

We cannot see in Lebanon what we are seeing in Gaza.

And we cannot allow what has been happening in Gaza to continue.

Thank you.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE FOR INTERNATIONAL MIGRANTS DAY
Content: 18 December 2023
--
Migration is a fact of life and a force for good. It promotes the exchange of knowledge and ideas and contributes to economic growth. It enables millions of people to pursue opportunities and improve their lives.
At the same time, poorly governed migration is a cause of great suffering. It forces people into the cruel realm of traffickers, where they face exploitation, abuse, and even death. It undermines trust in governance and institutions, inflames social tensions, and corrodes our common humanity.
On International Migrants Day, we highlight the urgent need for safe migration governance rooted in solidarity, partnership, and respect for human rights.
Five years ago, the international community adopted the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration. This has become an important reference point and resource for Member States to assess actions, enhance cooperation, and expand rights-based pathways for migration.
Yet such measures remain the exception, not the norm. Today and every day, we must work towards a more humane and orderly management of migration for the benefit of all, including communities of origin, transit, and destination.
Together, let us secure a safer and more prosperous future for all.

Title: IOM Resumes Voluntary Return Flights for Stranded Ethiopian Migrants in Yemen
Content: 13 December 2023
Sana’a/Addis Ababa
On Monday (11/12), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) resumed its voluntary humanitarian return (VHR) flights from Yemen to Ethiopia, the first movement since September. The charter flight carrying 118 migrants, including men, women and children, brings a glimmer of hope to thousands of stranded Ethiopian migrants facing dire circumstances.
Insecurity and the lack of essentials like food, shelter and healthcare, along with exploitative labor conditions and violence perpetuated by groups involved in smuggling and trafficking, make life in Yemen challenging and extremely dangerous.
“Amidst these challenges, the international community is urged to swiftly intervene to ensure the safety and well-being of vulnerable migrants,” said Matt Huber, Acting Chief of Mission of IOM Yemen. “This marks just the beginning of this joint endeavour, and in light of the demand, we anticipate further collaboration to address the pressing needs of stranded migrants despite the limited resources for VHR in both Yemen and Ethiopia.”
Nearly 95,000 migrants arrived in Yemen between January and November this year, surpassing the total arrivals recorded in 2022, which stood at approximately 70,000. IOM estimates that over 200,000 migrants, primarily from East and the Horn of Africa, urgently require humanitarian assistance in Yemen.
These urgent needs often exceed the capacities of humanitarian actors to provide timely responses, hampered by limited access in certain areas and resource constraints faced by partner organizations.
Three years ago, 29-year-old Hayat embarked on a grueling journey from Ethiopia to Yemen, looking for better job opportunities. “Six months ago, I moved to Sana’a with my babies to seek help,” Hayat explains. “Since then, I have been waiting to finally reunite with my family.”
VHR flights are considered a lifeline for stranded migrants in Yemen. The programme establishes an efficient system for dignified returns to Ethiopia, ensuring essential access, logistics, and safety measures. Without VHR, thousands of stranded migrants are left without a safe route home, exposed to increased risks of violence, coercion and abuse.
In Yemen, IOM provides protection services through its Migrant Response Points and strategically located mobile protection teams, where migrants can seek counseling and guidance on accessing services. Additionally, IOM offers emergency health assistance and material support, including food, clothing, shoes and hygiene kits, to meet the basic needs of migrants.
Prior to the interruption of the VHR programme, more than 6,000 Ethiopian migrants had safely returned home from Yemen this year through flights originating from Ma’rib, Sana’a and Aden. Upon returning to Ethiopia, they receive comprehensive post-arrival assistance, encompassing onward transportation, medical assistance, mental health and psychosocial support, family tracing and reunification of unaccompanied migrant children in line with best interest procedures, and tailored reintegration support.
IOM’s humanitarian assistance and protection services are aligned with the Regional Migrant Response Plan (MRP) for the Horn of Africa to Yemen and Southern Africa. The MRP aims to address the needs of migrants in vulnerable situations and host communities in countries situated along the Eastern Migration Route, located between the Horn of Africa and Yemen and Southern route between the Horn and Southern Africa.
To reduce the risks of irregular migration, IOM urges states to focus on regional approaches to improve migration governance to render assistance to people regardless of their migration status, and to provide regular migration pathways to ensure safe migration for all.
IOM remains committed to assisting all migrants in need as additional flights are underway, extending essential support through its VHR programme funded by the United States Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, the German Federal Foreign Office, and the Governments of Norway and France.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON HUMAN RIGHTS DAY
Content: 10 December 2023
--
“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”
The iconic opening sentence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is as important today as it was when it was adopted 75 years ago.
The Universal Declaration is a roadmap, helping to end wars, heal divisions and promote lives of peace and dignity for all.
But the world is losing its way. Conflicts are raging. Poverty and hunger are increasing. Inequalities are deepening. The climate crisis is a human rights crisis that is hitting the most vulnerable hardest.
Authoritarianism is on the rise.
Civic space is shrinking and the media is under attack from all sides.
Gender equality remains a distant dream and women’s reproductive rights are being rolled back.
Today, it is more important than ever to promote and respect all human rights – social, cultural, economic, civil and political – which protect us all.
The Universal Declaration shows the way to common values and approaches that can help resolve tensions and create the security and stability our world craves.
As we work to update global frameworks and make them more effective in the 21st century, human rights must have a unique and central role.
I call on Member States to use this 75th anniversary, and the Summit of the Future next year, to strengthen their commitment to the timeless values of the Universal Declaration.
And on Human Rights Day, I urge people around the world to promote and respect human rights, every day, for everyone, everywhere.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY  OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Content: 03 December 2023
--
This year’s International Day of Persons with Disabilities reminds us that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires living up to the promise to leave no one behind, especially the 1.3 billion persons with disabilities worldwide.
Today, at the halfway point to the 2030 Agenda, persons with disabilities continue facing systemic discrimination and barriers that restrict their meaningful inclusion in all areas of society.
Truly sustainable development for persons with disabilities requires a laser-like focus on their needs and rights — not only as beneficiaries, but as active contributors across social, economic and political life.
This means ensuring that persons with disabilities are at every decision-making table, in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and across countries’ efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals — from poverty eradication, to health, education and climate action.
The United Nations is leading by example through our Disability Inclusion Strategy, and by supporting Member States as they drive progress for, and with, persons with disabilities.
On this important day, I call on the world to work side-by-side with persons with disabilities to design and deliver solutions based on equal rights in every country and community.

Title: UNDP Yemen: Climate change projections detail detrimental effects on human development in Yemen: UNDP Report
Content: 02 December 2023
Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 02 December 2023
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Yemen has released a new report detailing Yemen’s likely climate future and how climate change could affect economic and human development in the long run.
Yemen is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, and for decades has faced a worsening water crisis. Yet, like most low-income countries, Yemen has contributed little to the climate crisis. Climate change has no boundaries, and this report is a call for global action.
The Impact of Climate Change on Human Development in Yemen analyses historical data on temperature and precipitation across regions and seasons and uses statistical techniques to forecast likely climate futures. It compares a likely climate change scenario to a counterfactual in which climate change does not occur. In a projected third scenario, key development interventions focused on building resilience to the threats posed by climate change are considered, accelerating progress towards better human development.
The report projects an increase in malnutrition and poverty in Yemen if climate action to build resilience is not undertaken. With climate change, by 2060, it is projected that a cumulative $93 billion would be lost in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 3.8 million more people would suffer from malnutrition in Yemen.
“Today, climate change is not theoretical; we are already witnessing changing weather patterns in Yemen, and the worse is yet to come. With no action, it is projected that climate change will be responsible for over 121, 000 deaths in Yemen by 2060. UNDP’s new report outlines how a strategy to build resilience can help to mitigate the projected impacts of climate change in Yemen, to secure a decent future for the next generation in an already fragile context,” says UNDP Yemen Resident Representative Zena Ali Ahmad.
Commissioned by UNDP in the beginning of 2023, The Impact of Climate Change on Human Development in Yemen is the product of a collaboration with the Frederick S. Pardee Center for International Futures, the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, the University of Denver, and Appalachian State University.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY
Content: 02 December 2023
--
Slavery is both a historic horror and a contemporary outrage.
On the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, we remember the victims of the past – particularly the millions of African people ripped from their homes, exploited, brutalised or killed during the transatlantic slave trade. And we think of the 50 million people trapped in modern slavery.
The calls to tackle the enduring effects of slavery and colonialism are growing louder. The world must respond. Where appropriate, countries should acknowledge the truth, educate, apologise and offer reparations. Businesses and others should join them – by addressing their own links to enslavement and the case for reparations.
We must also move much faster to stop this terrible crime today.  Countries must legislate, protect the rights of victims, and eradicate the practices and conditions that allow modern slavery to flourish – from trafficking, to debt bondage, and economic marginalisation. We also need companies to play their part, by ensuring their business practices respect the human rights of all.
Together, let’s right historic wrongs and build a world free from the abomination of slavery.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  --  MESSAGE FOR WORLD AIDS DAY 2023
Content: 01 December 2023
--
World AIDS Day arrives at a defining moment.
AIDS-related deaths have fallen by almost 70 per cent since their peak in 2004, and new HIV infections are at the lowest point since the 1980s.
But AIDS still takes a life every minute.
We can — and must — end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.
Reaching this goal means heeding this year’s theme: Let Communities Lead.
The path to ending AIDS runs through communities.
From connecting people to the treatment, services and support they need — to the grassroots activism pushing for action so all people can realize their right to health.
Supporting those on the frontlines of the battle against AIDS is how we win.
That means placing community leadership at the centre of HIV plans, programmes, budgets and monitoring efforts.
We must also remove barriers to community leadership, and ensure space for local civil society groups to take forward their vital work.
Above all, we need funding.
The AIDS response in low and middle-income countries needs over 8 billion dollars more per year to be fully funded.
This must include scaled-up funding for local programmes led by people living with HIV, and prevention initiatives led by communities.
AIDS is beatable.
Let’s finish the job by supporting communities to end this scourge in their neighbourhoods, their countries and around the world.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE
Content: 29 November 2023
--
This International Day of Solidarity comes during one of the darkest chapters in the history of the Palestinian people. I am horrified by the death and destruction that have engulfed the region, which is overwhelmed with pain, anguish and heartache.
Palestinians in Gaza are suffering a humanitarian catastrophe. Almost 1.7 million people have been forced from their homes – but nowhere is safe. Meanwhile, the situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, risks boiling over.
I express my sincere condolences to the thousands of families who are mourning loved ones. This includes members of our own United Nations family killed in Gaza, representing the largest loss of personnel in the history of our organization.
I have been clear in my condemnation of the terror attacks by Hamas on 7 October. But I have also been clear that they cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
Across the region, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency is an indispensable lifeline, delivering vital support to millions of Palestinian refugees. It is more important than ever that the international community stands with UNRWA as a source of support for the Palestinian people.
Above all, this is a day for reaffirming international solidarity with the Palestinian people and their right to live in peace and dignity.
That must start with a long-term humanitarian ceasefire, unrestricted access for lifesaving aid, the release of all hostages, the protection of civilians and an end to violations of international humanitarian law. We must be united in demanding an end to the occupation and the blockade of Gaza.
It is long past time to move in a determined, irreversible way towards a two-State solution, on the basis of United Nations resolutions and international law, with Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace and security with Jerusalem as the capital of both States.
The United Nations will not waver in its commitment to the Palestinian people. Today and every day, let us stand in solidarity with the aspirations of the Palestinian people to achieve their inalienable rights and build a future of peace, justice, security and dignity for all.

Title: Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General - on the situation in the Middle East
Content: 27 November 2023
--
Seven weeks of hostilities in Gaza and Israel have taken an appalling toll that has shocked the world. For the past four days, the guns have fallen silent. We have seen the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held by Hamas and others since 7 October, and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
The Secretary General commends the Governments of Qatar, Egypt and the United States for facilitating this arrangement and he recognizes the critical role of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The United Nations will continue to support these efforts in every possible way.
During these four days, the United Nations has scaled up the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza and sent aid to some northern areas that have been largely cut off for weeks. But this aid barely registers against the huge needs of 1.7 million displaced people. The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is getting worse by the day.
The dialogue that led to the agreement must continue, resulting in a full humanitarian ceasefire, for the benefit of the people of Gaza, Israel and the wider region. The Secretary General once again calls for the remaining hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally.
He urges all States to use their influence to end this tragic conflict and support irreversible steps towards the only sustainable future for the region: a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side, in peace and security.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  --  MESSAGE FOR WORLD SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT DAY
Content: 26 November 2023
--
This first World Sustainable Transport Day reminds us that the road to a better future depends on cleaner and greener transportation systems.
Transportation represents the world’s circulatory system, delivering people and goods across countries and around the world, creating jobs, and supporting prosperity.
But it is also fueling climate chaos.
The transport sector is responsible for approximately one quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions. Ninety-one percent of the energy used in motorized transport on land, sea and air is derived from fossil fuels.
This makes the sector one of the most difficult to decarbonize.
But I am convinced humanity is up to the challenge of breaking our addiction to climate-killing fossil fuels, and creating resilient, efficient and low-carbon transportation systems grounded in innovative renewable energy sources.
From electric and solar-powered vehicles, to renewable aviation fuel sources, to massive investments in green public transportation systems, to measures like carbon pricing and subsidies for low-carbon fuels, we can steer our societies towards a cleaner and more sustainable path for people and planet.
There is no time to waste. Let’s get moving.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  -- MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
Content: 25 November 2023
--
Violence against women is a horrific violation of human rights, a public health crisis, and a major obstacle to sustainable development.
It is persistent, widespread – and worsening.
From sexual harassment and abuse to femicide – the violence takes many forms.
But all are rooted in structural injustice, cemented by millennia of patriarchy.
We still live in a male-dominated culture that leaves women vulnerable by denying them equality in dignity and rights.
We all pay the price: our societies are less peaceful, our economies less prosperous, our world less just.
But a different world is possible.
This year’s theme of the UNiTE campaign – “Invest to Prevent Violence against Women & Girls” – calls on all of us to take action.
Support legislation and comprehensive policies that strengthen the protection of women’s rights across the board.
Ramp up investments in prevention and support to women’s rights organization.
Listen to survivors and end impunity for perpetrators everywhere.
Stand with women activists and promote women’s leadership at every stage of decision-making.
Together, let us stand up and speak out. Let’s build a world that refuses to tolerate violence against women anywhere, in any form, once and for all.

The World Day of Remembrance of Road Traffic Victims shines a light on a dark reality: every year, 1.35 million lives are cut short and 50 million more suffer life-changing injuries because of road accidents.
We must do more to avoid these entirely preventable tragedies.
The Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety – now in its third year – aims to halve road deaths by building capacities, accelerating the implementation of UN road safety conventions, raising awareness, and mobilizing resources for greater traffic safety.
This year, we also launched the Global Campaign on Road Safety which will reach 1000 cities across 80 countries.  And our UN Road Safety Fund is financing action in low- and middle-income countries, where around 90 per cent of traffic casualties occur.
Urgent action remains imperative. I call on all donors to scale up much-needed financial and technical contributions. On this World Day, let us join forces to make roads safer for everyone, everywhere.

Gradually, the world is making progress towards bringing sanitation to all – and fulfilling one of the ambitions of the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. Over nine hundred million more people have access to safely managed sanitation services than in 2015.  And almost three hundred million more people have been spared the indignity of open defecation over the same period.
But a massive sanitation shortfall still exists, with billions of people cut off from safe services. We’re racing the clock. To meet the 2030 deadline for the SDGs, we need to move five times faster.
This World Toilet Day focuses on accelerating action on sanitation to drive progress across the SDGs. The world must respond urgently to this call. We need a massive cash injection across the board to get the SDGs on track. My proposal for an SDG Stimulus of $500 billion a year is gaining traction, and I urge leaders to act now to make it a reality.
On this World Toilet Day, let’s recommit to realising every person’s human right to safe sanitation, to help to flush away poverty and indignity for good.

Title: WHO Yemen: Diphtheria in Yemen-situation and response
Content: 16 November 2023
Sana’a, Yemen
Reports of diphtheria cases in Yemen (to 14 October 2023) are 57% higher than in 2021 and 2022. Cases have risen gradually since 2021, with a significant increase noted in 2023.
So far this year, 1671 suspected diphtheria cases have been reported in the country, with 109 associated deaths, compared with 1283 cases reported in the whole of 2022. Diphtheria is typically a winter illness, so the increase in cases noted from June to September 2023 marks a change from the usual seasonal pattern.
In response to the current increase in cases, WHO is working to supply Yemen’s Ministry of Public Health and Population with an urgent quantity of 2200 vials of diphtheria antitoxin, which will be distributed to the most affected areas. Due to the complexities of the Yemen situation, however, only 220 vials have been delivered to date, whereas the global shortage of diphtheria antitoxin affects its availability and increases prices.
“The 2200 doses that WHO has secured are only enough to treat 300 severe patients, which is inadequate to address the issue,” said Dr Arturo Pesigan, WHO Representative in Yemen. “It is projected that in 2024 multiple ongoing and growing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases – including diphtheria – will persist, with the proportion of unvaccinated, or zero-dose, children reaching 28%. The funding shortage and issues of inaccessibility are affecting the health and lives of vulnerable people in Yemen.”
Among children in Yemen, there has been a significant drop in immunization rates and a correlated increase in cases of vaccine-preventable diseases. This decline in coverage continues to worsen owing to economic deterioration, low incomes, displacement, and overcrowded living conditions in camps, coupled with an overstretched health system and chronic funding shortage. Millions of children cannot be reached by routine immunization activities, and suspected cases of vaccine-preventable diseases have risen to unprecedented levels.
WHO continues to monitor and analyse outbreak trends and reported cases on a weekly basis, to ensure a full understanding of the epidemiological situation for various circulating outbreaks.
About diphtheria
Diphtheria is an infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Signs and symptoms range from mild to severe and often come on gradually, with a higher mortality rate among unvaccinated younger children. In severe cases, the bacteria produce a poison (toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of the throat that can block the airway, making it hard to breathe or swallow.
The toxin may also get into the bloodstream, causing complications that may include inflammation and damage of the heart muscle, inflammation of nerves, kidney problems and bleeding problems. The damaged heart muscle may result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may result in paralysis.

Title: UNFPA Yemen: Women and girls need urgent help in the aftermath of Cyclone Tej that struck coastal Yemen
Content: 02 November 2023
Sana’a, UNFPA
The United Nations Population Fund estimates over 3,000 pregnant women are in need of lifesaving health services as Cyclone Tej destroys households and infrastructure in southern coastal areas of Yemen.
More than 10,000 households have been affected in Al Maharah, Hadaramout and Socotra governorates. Access to health services have been disrupted with life threatening consequences to an estimated 500 pregnant women who may develop complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
“We are working round the clock to provide immediate relief to families affected by this devastating cyclone, and deeply concerned for the health of hundreds of pregnant women who have endured years of conflict and are now struck by natural disaster,” stated Enshrah Ahmed, UNFPA Representative to Yemen.
UNFPA is dispatching emergency supplies to assist families affected by the cyclone, including lifesaving medicines and reproductive health kits. These kits help to ensure safe deliveries and address complication during childbirth when a health facility or a midwife is inaccessible.
As part of the rapid response mechanism, led by UNFPA, nearly 11,000 cyclone-affected households (72,000 individuals) have been enrolled to receive emergency relief kits, while an additional 4,000 kits are being dispatched to affected areas, containing ready to eat food provided by WFP, basic hygiene kits provided by UNICEF and female dignity kits provided by UNFPA.
The response is supported with contributions from the European Union Humanitarian Aid, Kingdom of Netherlands, USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance and the Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund.
UNFPA is the sole provider of essential life-saving reproductive health medicines in Yemen and leads coordination and provision of women’s reproductive health and protection services across the country.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY TO END IMPUNITY FOR CRIMES AGAINST JOURNALISTS
Content: 02 November 2023
--
Journalists and the media fulfill a vital role in society, upholding and enabling democracy and holding power to account. They are essential to strong and accountable institutions and to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
But this important position puts journalists at risk. Their commitment to investigating and revealing the truth means they are often targeted for attack, illegal detention, and even death.
In 2022, according to UNESCO, at least 88 journalists were killed for doing their jobs – a sharp increase on the preceding years. The current conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory is taking a horrific toll on journalists.
But the majority of journalists who are killed are not war reporters; they are working in countries that are at peace, investigating corruption, trafficking, human rights violations, and environmental issues.
I am deeply alarmed by these figures, and by the rise in threats of all kinds against journalists. Detention of journalists is at an all-time high. Online harassment of journalists, particularly women, is being used as a tool to silence them.
We need better safeguards to defend the journalists who are keeping us informed.
On the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, we call on all States to prevent violence against journalists, to provide a safe environment for them to go about their jobs, to bring to justice those who commit crimes against journalists and media workers, and to ensure support for victims and survivors.
Today and every day, we are grateful to the journalists and all media professionals who risk their health and lives to keep us informed, and to keep the truth alive.

Title: OHCHR & UNESCO Yemen: Joint Statement - International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists
Content: 02 November 2023
--
As we are commemorating on the 2nd of November the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, UNESCO and OHCHR in Yemen, would like to reiterate their commitment to support Yemeni journalists and media organizations in accordance with the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Journalism is a key component to ensure the full realisation of Human Rights. Journalists play an important role in keeping population informed allowing them to have access to sometimes vital information, especially in conflict settings, but also make informed decision and participate actively to their societies.

Investigative journalism, in particular, helps ensure that institutions are transparent and responsive. Online and offline independent media contribute to monitoring and early warning systems for the full range of potential human rights violations. And that is precisely why journalists are so frequently the targets of threats, violence and even murder.

Journalists in the conflict zones of our region, more than often risk their lives, to give voices to those who cannot express themselves anymore, to shed lights on difficult issues, uncover the truth and to provide independent and reliable information. They are at the forefront and contribute directly to the fight for justice and against impunity.

To date in 2023, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Yemen documented at least 18 cases of human rights violations against freedom of expression and the media. These included intimidation, threats, assaults, arbitrary arrests and detention, incitement against the media, and a raid of a media outlet. At least four journalists continue to be detained or are missing (Ahmed Maher, Aden; Waheed Al-Sufi, Sana'a; Nabil Al-Sadawi, Sana'a; and Muhammad Al-Muqri, Hadhramaut). Through its observatory of killed journalists and since 2011, UNESCO has condemned the killing of 40 journalists in Yemen. No killing is currently considered resolved based on the information UNESCO has received.

Women journalists in particular suffer intolerable levels of online harassment, often leading to attacks in real life.

In 2023, the observance of the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists seeks to raise awareness of the main challenges faced by journalists in the exercise of their profession, and to warn of the escalation of violence and repression against them. This year’s theme also reaffirms the obligation of States to adopt effective measures to protect the independent press and strengthen institutional frameworks that combat violence and impunity, and promote media independence, sustainability and diversity.

To provide a safe and enabling environment for journalists to perform their duties, we need the authorities in Yemen to step up their monitoring of violations against journalists and media freedom, with laws that safeguard media freedom, in line with international human rights law. We need the authorities to ensure accountability and bring to justice perpetrators of crimes against journalists, through much more effective action by police and justice systems to investigate and prosecute crimes that target journalists because of their work.

The observance of the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists is also an occasion for us all to pay homage to all the journalists that gave their life, were injured, detained or threatened to ensure access to information and freedom of expression and recognize their upmost contribution to the upholding of Human Rights in Yemen.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  --  MESSAGE FOR WORLD CITIES DAY
Content: 31 October 2023
--
World Cities Day is a time to consider the pivotal role cities play in sustainable development.
Cities are engines of economic growth and innovation that hold the key to achieving the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. They are also on the frontlines of today’s complex challenges, from the climate crisis to growing inequalities and political polarization.
But local authorities are struggling with limited support and resources, while demand for infrastructure, affordable housing, efficient transport, and social services is immense and growing. This year's theme, Financing Sustainable Urban Development, is a call to action.
Governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society, must work together to mobilize finance for resilient, sustainable cities. I am a strong advocate for equitable financing solutions at the global level. These must be used, together with innovative and diverse funding sources, to strengthen local financing strategies that are climate-friendly, inclusive and equitable.
The Advisory Group on Local and Regional Governments I established recently will strengthen coordination to implement the SDGs, and make sure the voices of cities and regions are heard as we prepare for the Summit of the Future next year.
As we mark World Cities Day, let’s resolve to work together for urban areas that are not only engines of growth, but beacons of sustainability, resilience, and prosperity for all.

The United Nations is a reflection of the world as it is – and an aspiration of the world we know it can be.
It is our responsibility to help build that world of peace, sustainable development and human rights for all.
I know we can do it. The Charter of the United Nations – which entered into force 78 years ago today – points the way.
Above all, it is rooted in a spirit of determination to heal divisions, repair relations, and build peace.
To expand opportunities, and leave no one behind.
To ensure justice, equality and empowerment for women and girls.
To provide life-saving relief to those in need.
And to be flexible enough to address challenges that did not even exist when the UN was born – from the existential climate crisis to the perils and promise of artificial intelligence.
The United Nations is guided by timeless values and principles, but it must never be frozen in time. That is why we must always keep strengthening ways of working and applying a 21st century lens to all we do.
On this United Nations Day, let us commit with hope and determination to build the better world of our aspirations.
Let us commit to a future that lives up to the name of our indispensable organization.
We are a divided world. We can and must be united nations.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ERADICATION OF POVERTY
Content: 17 October 2023
--
In our world of plenty, poverty should have no home.

Yet, as we mark the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, nearly 700 million people are barely scraping by, living on less than $2.15 per day.

Over a billion people are deprived of basic needs like food, water, health care and education. Billions more lack sanitation and access to energy, jobs, housing and social safety nets.

Meanwhile, conflicts, the climate crisis, discrimination and exclusion — particularly against women and girls — are deepening the distress.

This is compounded by an outdated, dysfunctional and unfair global financial system that hinders developing countries from investing in alleviating poverty and achieving the SDGs.

At current rates, almost 500 million people will still be living in extreme poverty in 2030.

This is unacceptable.

At the SDG Summit in September, world leaders recognized the need to reform the international financial architecture and committed to a bold plan to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals and accelerate efforts to eradicate poverty everywhere.

This includes support for an SDG Stimulus of at least $500 billion per year in financing for investments to achieve this.

Leaders also agreed on targeted action aimed at alleviating poverty and suffering for all people — from transformed food and education systems, to decent jobs and expanded social protection, as this year’s theme highlights.

Ending poverty is the challenge of our time.

But it is a challenge we can win.

On this important day, let’s renew our commitment to a world free of poverty.

Title: FAO Yemen: Yemen Marks World Food Day with a Plea for Increased Investment in Water Resources Management for Sustainable Agrifood Systems.
Content: 16 October 2023
Lahj, Yemen
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Yemen today joined the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Fisheries (MAIF) in celebrating the World Food Day at an event held in Lahj.
Today’s event was preceded by other World Food Day celebrations held in Sana’a, Aden, Dhamar and Mukalla in the last few days. All events were attended by farmers, pastoralists, agro-pastoralists, beekeepers and fisher folks, government officials, students, and FAO Yemen staff.
The FAO Representative in Yemen, Dr Hussein Gadain, said this year’s theme, Water is Life, Water is Food, and the slogan Leave no one behind, is a confirmation of the direct link between water and livelihoods. However, Dr Gadain added, while some societies with water in abundance take such a connection for granted, this is not the case in Yemen where water is scarce.
“We take this opportunity to highlight how the grip of water shortage continues to tighten around many Yemenis, thus dampening their aspirations for better production, better environment, better nutrition, and better life. To address this, we need more investment in technologies to make rain-fed and irrigated agriculture more resilient and productive, as well as technical work to support sound water policies and investments in infrastructure and research,” said Dr Gadain.
Dr Gadain added that FAO in Yemen was working with the authorities to strengthen the policy and regulatory framework, for example, establishing strong policy directions as well as science-policy interface regarding water use.
All venues where this year’s activities were held were hives of activities as farmers, pastoralists, agro-pastoralists, beekeepers, and fisher folks proudly displayed their products and equipment. The products on exhibition represent the wide array of the emergency, resilience, and development-focused interventions implemented by FAO in Yemen. These interventions are made possible through the generous support of various development partners.
The Lahj event was mixture of public displays and a mini football tournament where teams made up of participants in FAO implemented projects took part. All events held to mark this year’s World Food Day were used to highlight the impact of water scarcity in Yemen and to showcase some of the solutions which have been proven to work in the country.
The ramifications of water shortages reverberate throughout the Yemeni society diminishing the restoration and development of sustainable agri-food systems, threatening food, and nutrition security Water scarcity causes the spread of bacterial diseases as well as triggering conflicts over the resource.
Agricultural production accounts for 90 percent of water withdrawal in Yemen, against a global average of 70 percent. Qat, a mild stimulant regularly chewed by about 70 percent of Yemeni men, accounts for around 30 percent, of these massive water withdrawals. Qat production raises the consumption of underground water to unsustainable rates; poses several health and social problems; and discourages production of essential export and food products.
FAO has enhanced institutional development by educating and training farmers by establishing Water User Associations (WUAs) to resolve conflicts over water resources and efficiently use available resources. Women are actively participating in these local level water resources management.
In Yemen, FAO is supporting integrated water resources management (IWRM) into national sustainable development strategies, policies and cross-sectoral investment plans. This ensures that Yemen meets the growing need for food production and equitable access to food. These measures also curtail and reverse environmental degradation and climate change impacts.
FAO piloted an IWRM project in the Sana’a Basin where water use on irrigated land was reduced by 19 percent; from 72.6 cubic metres per hectare a year to 58.56 cubic metres a hectare per year. This was achieved through adoption of modern irrigation equipment, piped conveyance systems, protected agriculture (greenhouses), recharge of underground aquifers, planting perennial tree crops (almonds and peaches), and use of rehabilitated water harvesting infrastructure. Close to 150,000 almond seedlings were planted through FAO initiated interventions in the Sana’a basin. Growing almonds dampens the appetite for growing Qat.
Following this success, FAO, with funding from different development partners, has implemented a project in Wadi Hajr where, there is strengthening of community watershed governance and promotion of ecological and restorative agriculture, for example growing wheat. Similarly, in Wadi Hadramout, FAO helped to mitigate water-based conflicts with the inclusion of women as conflict-resolution agents and introduced drought-tolerant crops as a climate change mitigation measure. It has been the same case in Abyan, Dhamar, and Hadramout where projects enhancing water governance, food security, and reconciliation in conflict-affected communities are implemented.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON WORLD FOOD DAY
Content: 16 October 2023
--
World Food Day 2023 comes during a global food crisis, with the world moving backwards on ending hunger and malnutrition.

Some 780 million people around the world are going hungry; almost fifty million children are at risk of death from severe wasting. Yet funding for this year’s global humanitarian appeal stands at just 32 percent.

In our world of plenty, it is outrageous that a person dies of hunger every few seconds, while the World Food Programme has been forced to cut its essential aid programmes.

In 2015, after years of progress, Governments set the goal of zero hunger by 2030.

But eight years later, the number of people suffering from hunger has increased significantly.

This crisis demands action – first and foremost from national governments, which have a responsibility to make sure their people have enough to eat.

But many governments lack the resources to do so, and so effective international solidarity is also essential.

The long-term causes of the global food crisis include conflicts, climate extremes, inequality, and economic instability.

The UN system is addressing these root causes through our support for sustainable, equitable food systems that put people over profits.
That means massively scaling up investments in resilient agriculture, and aligning them with climate action.

It means leveraging science and technology to improve the efficiency and reach of food systems.

This year’s theme for World Food Day focuses on water – a necessity for nutritious and healthy food.

The sustainable management of water for agriculture and food production is essential to end hunger, achieve the SDGs, and preserve water for future generations.

Zero hunger is achievable.

This World Food Day, I call on governments, the private sector, civil society and academia to work together;

to prioritize feeding the hungry;

to bring ending this crisis to the top of the global agenda;

and to invest in long-term solutions that provide everyone with enough to eat.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
Content: 13 October 2023
--
2023 has shattered temperature records, and seen record drought, fire and floods around the world. Poverty and inequality are exacerbating these disasters.
Those with least are often at greatest risk from extreme weather. They may live in places that are more susceptible to flooding and drought; and they have fewer resources to deal with damage and to recover from it. They suffer disproportionately as a result, and may be pushed further into poverty.
Fighting inequality for a resilient future, is the theme of this year’s International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction. Countries must work to break the cycle of poverty and disaster by honouring the Paris Agreement, striving to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
We must also tackle inequality at the global level, by operationalizing the Loss and Damage Fund at COP28 this year and ensuring that every person on Earth is covered by an early warning system by 2027.
This International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction let us reaffirm our commitment to investing in resilience and adaptation, and building a safe and just future for everyone, everywhere.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE GIRL CHILD
Content: 11 October 2023
--
Halfway to the 2030 deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals, the world is failing girls.

On current trends, the end of child marriage is 300 years away. If nothing changes, by 2030, 110 million young women and girls who should be in classrooms, won’t be. And 340 million women and girls will still endure the grinding hardships of extreme poverty.

Old forms of discrimination against girls continue and in some cases are getting worse. Girls in Afghanistan are unable to exercise their most basic rights and freedoms, confined to their homes with no hope of education or economic independence.

New forms of bias and inequality are emerging. The digital divide means many girls are excluded from the online world. Algorithms based on the experience of men and boys are digitizing and amplifying sexism.

Yet around the world, girls are fighting back – confronting sexism, combatting stereotypes and creating change, on football pitches, in schools, and in the public square. We must stand with them.

My proposal for an SDG Stimulus to get the Goals on track is gaining traction. And we must invest in girls’ leadership – the theme of this year’s International Day of the Girl Child – to support girls to achieve their ambitions and to boost gender equality. When women and girls lead they can shift attitudes, create change, and advance policies and solutions that address their needs.

Women and girls can lead us to a fairer future. On this International Day of the Girl Child, let us amplify girls’ voices, and recommit to working together to build a world where every girl can lead and thrive.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  MESSAGE ON WORLD MENTAL HEALTH DAY
Content: 10 October 2023
“Mental health is a universal human right”
Mental health is vital to humanity, allowing us to lead fulfilling lives and contribute fully to our communities.

Yet one in eight people around the world lives with a mental health condition, with women and young people being disproportionately impacted.  Three in four people affected receive inadequate treatment – or no care at all.  And many face stigma and discrimination.

Mental health is not a privilege but a fundamental human right – and must be part of universal health coverage.  Governments must provide care that promotes people’s recovery and upholds their rights.  This includes strengthening community-based support and integrating psychological help into broader health and social care.

We must also tackle abuses and break down the barriers that prevent people from seeking support. And we must address root causes – poverty, inequality, violence, discrimination – and create more compassionate and resilient societies.

On World Mental Health Day and every day, let us reaffirm and uphold mental health as a universal human right, and together, build a healthier world where everyone can thrive.

The postal system has long served as a cornerstone of connectivity across the globe.
In today’s digital world, that fundamental role remains key. The postal network is immense and extends to many of the remotest communities.  We can maximize its reach to help boost digital inclusion and drive progress on the Sustainable Development Goals.
The theme of this year’s World Post Day – “Together for Trust” – calls on governments, the private sector and development partners to do exactly that.  I thank the Universal Postal Union (UPU) for its leadership of the Connect. Post initiative, which aims to ensure every post office has sufficient access to the internet by 2030.
On this World Post Day, we celebrate UPU’s work, and the critical contributions of postal workers around the world. Together, we can deliver a fair and sustainable digital future for all.

This year’s World Habitat Day focuses attention on ‘Resilient Urban Economies’ and the potential of cities as drivers of inclusive, green, and sustainable growth.

To fulfil this promise, cities must confront a range of challenges – from economic shocks and escalating climate emergencies to widening inequalities.

Through our Local 2030 Coalition, we are mobilizing the entire United Nations system to tackle these crises from the ground up and advance sustainable urbanization.

Local zero waste initiatives are supporting the creation of circular economies. Public efforts to expand green spaces help cool urban landscapes during heatwaves. And community action to reduce food waste and promote local production are key steps in transforming our food systems.

Building greater resilience and better protecting vulnerable populations requires far greater investments in sustainable infrastructure, early warning systems, and affordable, adequate housing for all.

At the same time, we must work to improve access to electricity, water, sanitation, transport, and other basic services – while investing in education, skills development, digital innovation, and entrepreneurship.

Local action is vital, and global cooperation indispensable.

On this World Habitat Day, let us pledge to build inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable human settlements for all people, everywhere.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON WORLD MARITIME DAY
Content: 28 September 2023
--
Shipping is a pillar of the world economy, a catalyst of development, and a vital link connecting goods, commodities, and communities across the world.

Today, the maritime sector transports over 80 per cent of global trade – and accounts for nearly three percent of global emissions.

That is why speeding up shipping’s voyage to carbon neutrality is critical to our collective future.

The updated Greenhouse Gas Strategy agreed at the International Maritime Organization earlier this year provides a clear plan for achieving net-zero by 2050.

Now we need all-hands-on-deck to deliver on the policies and investments required to realize a just and equitable transition for the entire maritime sector.

On this World Maritime Day, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of a landmark treaty to prevent pollution from ships: the MARPOL Convention.

Through the decades, MARPOL has made important contributions to protecting our planet and ocean by making shipping safer and cleaner.

Looking ahead, let us build on the legacy of this convention and together steer towards a more sustainable and prosperous future for this critical industry – and a safer future for humanity.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE FOR WORLD TOURISM DAY “Tourism and green investment”
Content: 27 September 2023
--
Tourism is a powerful force for progress and mutual understanding. But in order to deliver its full benefits, this force must be protected and nurtured.

Today, the climate emergency is threatening many travel destinations and the very survival of communities and economies that depend on tourism. And many developing countries that are severely affected by a changing climate are also facing a growing investment deficit and a cost-of-living crisis.

On this World Tourism Day, we recognize the vital need for green investments to build a tourism sector that delivers for people and planet.

Governments and businesses must invest in sustainable and resilient tourism practices. Private actors must adopt zero-emission pathways, lower their energy consumption and leverage renewable forms of energy. And everyone must protect the biodiversity and ecological balance of all destinations.

Targeted investments can deliver jobs and support local businesses and industries while mitigating the environmental impacts of tourism, empowering communities, promoting their cultures, and contributing to essential social protection systems.

So let us all do more to harness the full potential of sustainable tourism. Because investing in sustainable tourism is investing in a better future for all.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  -- MESSAGE ON THE OCCASION OF THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS
Content: 26 September 2023
--
The International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons reminds us that a peaceful future depends on ending the nuclear threat.
Geopolitical mistrust and competition have spiked the nuclear risk to Cold War levels. Meanwhile, hard-won progress over many decades to prevent the use, spread and testing of nuclear weapons is being undone.
On this important Day, we re-affirm our commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons and the humanitarian catastrophe their use would unleash.
This means nuclear-weapon States leading the way by meeting their disarmament obligations, and committing to never use nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
It means strengthening the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, including through the Treaties on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
It means all countries that have not yet ratified the Comprehensive-Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to do so without delay, and for those States that possess nuclear weapons to ensure a moratorium on all nuclear testing.
It means taking into account the evolving nuclear order, and addressing the blurring lines between strategic and conventional weapons and the nexus with new and emerging technologies.
Above all, it means deploying the timeless tools of dialogue, diplomacy and negotiation to ease tensions and end the nuclear threat. The recently launched Policy Brief on a New Agenda for Peace calls on Member States to urgently recommit to this important cause.
The only way to eliminate the nuclear risk is to eliminate nuclear weapons.
Let’s work together to banish these devices of destruction to the history books, once and for all.

Title: WHO and UNICEF Yemen Collaborate on Emergency Integrated Measles and Rubella vaccination campaign in 13 governorates in Yemen
Content: 23 September 2023
Aden, 23 September 2023
The Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOPHP) in Aden in collaboration with UNICEF and WHO is set to implement a Measles-Rubella (MR), vitamin A and COVID-19 integrated vaccination campaign. This joint effort aims at combatting the ongoing outbreaks and the spread of measles and rubella in Yemen.
The 6-day integrated Measles & Rubella vaccination campaign kicked off this morning of Saturday, 23 September 2023 and will target 1,267,082 children aged 6 months to 59 months across 121 districts in 13 governorates. The campaign will integrate COVID-19 vaccinations for the high-priority group in fixed and temporary fixed sites. A total of 3,025 medical teams, consisting of 847 fixed teams and 2,178 mobile teams, will be deployed for a minimum of six days.
Dr. Arturo Pesigan, WHO Representative in Yemen, and Peter Hawkins, UNICEF Representative to Yemen, expressed their commitment to this joint effort. Dr. Pesigan stated, “Our commitment to Yemen's children is unwavering, and we stand united with the government to strengthen the immunization program as a cornerstone of primary health care on our path to achieving universal health coverage.”
The World Health Organization Yemen and UNICEF Yemen are working closely with the Yemeni government, partners, and communities to guarantee the success of this integrated effort. By bringing together their efforts and resources, WHO and UNICEF strive to enhance vaccine coverage, protect vulnerable communities, and prevent future outbreaks of infectious diseases.
Peter Hawkins, UNICEF Representative to Yemen warns: “measles can kill, but vaccinating children against measles will save their lives. The vaccine is safe and is effective”. Hawkins continues to call upon everyone to “join in and make sure that every child between 6 months and 5 years of age is vaccinated”.
The campaign is made possible with the generous support of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, USAID, and the World Bank. Their assistance enables UNICEF and WHO Yemen and the Yemeni government to strengthen the routine immunization, reduce the zero dose children, protect vulnerable populations, and prevent future outbreaks of these diseases.
This campaign's integration of measles and rubella vaccines, vitamin A supplementation with COVID-19 vaccinations shows a comprehensive approach to public health. By tackling numerous diseases at the same time, the campaign aims to optimize its impact and contribute to Yemen's general health and well-being.

Title: WHO Yemen - World Patient Safety Day 2023: "Engaging Patients for Patient Safety" takes center stage in Yemen
Content: 17 September 2023
Yemen
Patient safety is an intrinsic element of healthcare quality, and its significance cannot be overstated. Unsafe healthcare practices can lead to severe consequences for patients, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality rates. In low- and middle-income countries, 134 million adverse events occur each year due to unsafe care in hospitals, contributing to 2.6 million deaths annually. Globally one out of ten patients experience harm in primary and ambulatory settings, with more than 50% of this harm being preventable.
The theme for World Patient Safety Day 2023 is "Engaging Patients for Patient Safety." This theme highlights the pivotal role that patients, families, and caregivers play in ensuring healthcare safety.
In Yemen, the World Health Organization is committed to aligning with global initiatives on Patient Safety Day. This alignment will be achieved through advocacy efforts targeting policymakers, hospital overseers, and healthcare practitioners. Within the context of a weakened health system and limited access to health care services due to more than eight years of conflict, WHO aims to shed light on the detrimental consequences of unsafe care, highlight international patient safety goals, and emphasize the critical roles played by healthcare providers and patients in elevating patient safety.
"Patient safety stands as a paramount determinant of healthcare quality. Evidence demonstrates that when patients are actively involved in their care as partners, it leads to significant improvements in safety, patient satisfaction, and health outcomes. By becoming active members of the healthcare team, patients can contribute to the safety of their care and the overall healthcare system. WHO is committed to redoubling its efforts in Yemen to ensure the provision of safe healthcare, empower patients, and engage with their families and caregivers. Together, we can make a profound difference in patient safety for all Yemeni families," Dr Arturo Pesigan, WHO Representative in Yemen.
To mark World Patient Safety Day, WHO in Yemen will collaborate on the following activities:
An inaugural event will be taking place at the University of Aden’s medical college with participation from senior health officials and focal points in Yemen’s Ministry of Public Health and Population, health care workers, hospital managers, and heads of governorate health offices and district health offices. Representatives from nongovernmental organizations are also invited to participate, recognizing their important role in advancing the patient safety agenda. This event will feature interventions from quality and patient safety experts, as well as technical experts from WHO’s Yemen country office.
Hospital-Based Awareness Sessions: 14 hospitals across 14 governorates will host dedicated awareness sessions, engaging key decision-makers, hospital management, and healthcare professionals.
Distribution of Educational Material: Patient safety posters and checklists emphasizing safe childbirth and surgical protocols will be printed and disseminated across affiliated hospitals.
Join us on World Patient Safety Day as we work together to elevate patient safety in Yemen and worldwide. We believe that every second counts, and together, we can save lives through improved patient safety.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE OZONE LAYER
Content: 16 September 2023
--
The international treaties to protect the ozone layer have made a dramatic and measurable difference to protecting people and planet. They show the power of multilateralism. And they should inspire hope that, together, we can avert the worst of climate change and build a sustainable and resilient world.
Limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius is still possible if we immediately and drastically accelerate climate action. I have proposed a Climate Solidarity Pact and an Acceleration Agenda to help achieve this. I urge all leaders to work together to put them into effect – and to support these efforts by getting behind the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and limiting planet-heating hydrofluorocarbons.
Fully ratifying and implementing the Kigali Amendment could avoid up to 0.5°C of warming by 2100. Combining the transition away from planet-heating gases with energy efficiency measures in cooling equipment could double this figure.
I call on all countries to ratify the Amendment. And I urge governments, along with business leaders, civil society, academia, youth groups, local communities, and others, to intensify efforts to bring about real change, and to ensure developing countries have the support they need to do so.
Let’s harness the spirit of the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol to build a world where humans, nature and the planet thrive together.

Democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights are bedrocks of resilient, inclusive, and peaceful societies.
They underwrite freedom, advance sustainable development, and protect the dignity and rights of every person.
On the International Day of Democracy, we celebrate its promise to societies – and recognize the many threats it faces at this time of tension and turmoil.
The walls are closing in on civic spaces.
Mis- and disinformation is poisoning public discourse, polarizing communities, and eroding trust in institutions.
This year’s theme – “Empowering the Next Generation” – focuses on the essential role of children and young people in safeguarding democracy today and in the future.
It is not enough to listen to children and young people.
We must support them with massive investments in education, skills-building, and lifelong learning.
We must protect human rights and advance gender equality.
And we must expand the meaningful participation of young people in decision-making processes at every level.
On this important day, let us join hands across generations and work as one to build a more just world for all.

Title: UN Secretary-General's remarks at the Peace Bell Ceremony
Content: 13 September 2023
New York, 13 September 2023
[as delivered]
Mr, President of the General Assembly, Excellencies, distinguished guests, Messengers of Peace, dear students, ladies and gentlemen.

Peace is the most fundamental job we have.

And it is not solely the responsibility of governments or Presidents.

Peace is a job that belongs to each and every one of us.

But as we gather today, peace is under assault across communities, countries and regions.

And peace is also under assault within the hearts and minds of people by the dark forces of disinformation and hate speech.

Drop by drop, the poison of war is infecting our world.

Placing millions in the line of fire.
Eroding human rights and the security and wellbeing of all people.

And reversing hard-won development gains.

But we can all do our part to change that and nurture the seeds of hope, by rallying together to tackle the common challenges we face.

Challenges like poverty, hunger, discrimination and inequality.

Challenges like those posed by rapid breakthroughs in technology — including artificial intelligence — which must be managed carefully to ensure that humanity is helped, not harmed.

And challenges like climate change, pollution and epic biodiversity loss.

For people and planet alike, we can — and we must — push for peace.

Pushing for peace means focusing on prevention, dialogue and mediation to heal divisions, defuse conflicts and ensure every community has a stake in a shared future.

Pushing for peace means rallying around the tools that support global trust and solidarity — including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Charter.

Pushing for peace means addressing discrimination and racism.

It means rescuing the Sustainable Development Goals and expanding opportunities for women and girls.

Pushing for peace means accelerating our battle against climate change, ending our addiction to fossil fuels and investing in renewable energy.

It means amplifying facts and science over lies and hate.

And pushing for peace means supporting activists, young and old, in their calls for progress.

Excellencies, dear friends,

Now more than ever, we need global solidarity, collective action, commitment and mutual trust.

Let us all pledge to be part of this push for peace.

Before I ring the peace bell, please join me in a brief moment of silence to reflect on the meaning and necessity of peace — and what each one of us can do in our own way to deliver peace to our world.

And I thank you.

Title: THE SECRETARY GENERAL  MESSAGE ON THE OCCASION OF THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL DAY TO PROTECT EDUCATION FROM ATTACK
Content: 09 September 2023
--
Education is not only a fundamental human right, but a pathway to a better future for every person, and a more peaceful, understanding world.

On the International Day to Protect Education from Attack, we shine a light on a startling truth: 224 million children and young people are in urgent need of educational support — including 72 million who are out-of-school altogether — because of crises like armed conflict.

Attacks on students, teachers, educational personnel and schools are becoming all-too-common, cruelly disrupting young learners’ education and inflicting untold psychological and physical damage that can last a lifetime.

I call on all countries to ensure the protection of schools, children and teachers at all times.

I also urge all countries to endorse the Safe Schools Declaration, support the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, and join the Global Initiative: Partnership for Transformative Actions in Crisis Situations that brings together partners to ensure children and young people can keep learning in times of crisis.

Together, we can ensure that schools are havens of safety and learning for every child, no matter where they live.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF CLEAN AIR FOR BLUE SKIES 2023
Content: 07 September 2023
--
Air pollution is a global emergency. Ninety-nine per cent of humanity breathes air laced with soot, sulphur and other toxic chemicals, with low- and middle-income countries suffering the highest exposures. Every year, seven million people die prematurely as a result, and air pollution is intimately linked to global heating.
Air pollution knows no borders, travelling thousands of kilometres, spreading contaminates with the wind. And the climate crisis is having devastating and growing impacts on every continent on Earth.
Global problems require global solutions. We must act together for clean air – the theme of this year’s International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies.
Together, we must accelerate a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuels, particularly coal, towards clean renewable energy, while ensuring that no one is left behind.
To help achieve this, I have proposed a Climate Solidarity Pact in which all big emitters make extra efforts to cut emissions, and wealthier countries mobilize financial and technical resources to support emerging economies to do so. And I have proposed an Acceleration Agenda to super-charge these efforts. I urge all countries to put both into effect.
We must also support the transition to clean cooking and electric vehicles. We must encourage walking and cycling in cities, and put in place systems to make responsible waste management second nature. And we must act on the pledge to reduce methane emissions.
Our air is a common good and a common responsibility. Let’s work together to clean it up, protect our health, and leave a healthy planet for generations to come.

Title: EU reconfirms commitment to peace in Yemen by contributing to laying the foundation to the UN Peace Support Facility Phase II
Content: 24 August 2023
Amman, Jordan: 24 August 2023
The European Union (EU) has recently announced its support of EUR 3 million to Phase II of the UN Peace Support Facility (PSF) for Yemen – a jointly managed programme by the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen (OSESGY), the United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The support reconfirms the EU’s commitment to peace in Yemen and to the continued support to the PSF.

PSF’s Phase II will continue to both support the UN-facilitated confidence-building measures between the parties to the conflict and lay the foundations for an inclusive political process under UN-auspices aimed at achieving durable peace across Yemen.

“I highly welcome the European Union’s valuable role in supporting peace in Yemen including through its contribution to the UN Peace Support Facility for Yemen. The international community has a pivotal part to play in advancing an inclusive political process under UN auspices in Yemen, mitigating the devastating impact of the conflict on the lives of civilians, and supporting post-conflict recovery and reconstruction,” says Hans Grundberg, UN Special Envoy for Yemen.
The EU funding to Phase II also aims to support local peacebuilding efforts through the PSF’s newly established small grant mechanism. The mechanism will provide opportunities for local civil society organizations to carry out peacebuilding programmes across Yemen, particularly women-led organisations and initiatives.

“The Peace Support Facility is playing a critical role to help Yemenis prepare for peace,” says David Gressly, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “We cannot wait for peace to begin peacebuilding. Restoring social cohesion and fostering the inclusion of local communities in decision-making processes will open opportunities for Yemenis to forge a better future when peace finally arrives,” he adds.

Furthermore, the EU support will specifically contribute to creating an enabling environment for gender inclusive dialogue and reconciliation, and for women and youth’s participation in Yemen’s peace processes. This continues to demonstrate the EU’s ongoing efforts to promote peace, stability, and the Women, Peace and Security Agenda in the region, and its belief in the importance of inclusive and sustainable peacebuilding approaches.

“UNDP is proudly hosting the Peace Support Facility,” notes Zena Ali Ahmad, UNDP Yemen’s Resident Representative. She adds, “We will continue to draw on UNDP’s wealth of experience from across the world to support the Yemeni-lead peace process at the national, sub-national, and local level.”

The EU had supported the first phase of the PSF mechanism with EUR 1 million. The work of the PSF in its first phase contributed substantially to the implementation of significant rehabilitation efforts in the Hudaydah port to facilitate the flow of fuel and commercial goods into Yemen. It also provided support to community safety initiatives across Yemen, which increased the trust between civilian communities and security forces, and other initiatives to ease tensions and model inclusive decision making at the community level in regards to improving access to basic services such as water. The first phase further advanced the inclusion of women and youth in mediation and peacebuilding efforts through partnerships and direct support to networks of women and youth peace advocates. This work will continue under Phase II of the PSF.

“The European Union supports an inclusive, UN-led peace process in Yemen. Today, we renew our commitment to the Peace Support Facility with a EUR 3 million contribution. This contribution will finance confidence building measures and other peace related activities that support the mediation efforts of the UN Special Envoy and deliver sustainable peace for Yemenis,” says EU Ambassador to Yemen Gabriel Munuera Vinals.

Funded by Germany and the European Union, the Peace Support Facility Phase II (PSF) is implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The project’s Steering Committee is co-chaired by the UN Special Envoy to Yemen and the UN Resident Coordinator.

Title: United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly,  Remarks at the conclusion of the oil transfer from the FSO Safer  at the United Nations noon briefing
Content: 12 August 2023
11 August 2023
The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, made the following remarks today by video conference from Aden, Yemen.
Thank you very much, Farhan. And thank you very, very much, Achim, for those excellent remarks and reflections.
I just arrived in Aden a few hours ago, about three hours ago in fact, on a flight from the city of Mukalla with the four Yemeni staff members who had been held hostage for the last 18 month. Of course, we are very delighted with this news. It is great news for our team here in Aden and more broadly in the southern part of the country.
As you recall, we had a World Food Programme member assassinated here about three weeks ago. So, it is good to have a good news day as we have today. So, it’s a welcome day for the families. It’s a welcome day for the UN personnel throughout Yemen.
I am pleased to report, as was mentioned in the opening, that they are unharmed, in good health and in good spirts. I had a chance to speak with them, obviously, on the way back. I am very much impressed not only by their good spirits but the strength they have exhibited under extraordinary circumstance. In addition, of course, we have our Bangladeshi colleague, Mr. Akim, who also has been released. And we celebrate for all of the families their release and reunion with their families.
As everyone has said, it has been a good day in Yemen. They don’t come every day. So, we are very pleased that we can share this news today.
And today we can say that the United Nations and a remarkably broad group of partners have succeeded in preventing the worst-case scenario of a catastrophic oil spill in the Red Sea.
Over the past 18 days, SMIT Salvage has pumped as much oil as possible from the FSO Safer to the MOST Yemen, formerly known as the Nautica.
More than 98 per cent of the estimated 1.14 million barrels are now safely stored on the Yemen. The residual oil on the Safer is mixed with sediment and cannot be pumped out at this point. It will be removed during the final cleaning of the Safer.
An enormous amount of political groundwork, fundraising and project planning over the past two years has brought us to this point.
I want to congratulate the United Nations Development Programme, under Achim’s leadership, for its outstanding work in implementing the project – which included considerable financial risk.
It’s been mentioned earlier that only the UN was in a position to do this. I have to say that the UN Development Programme was the agency that stepped forward to do this and I want to congratulate them for that work.
We should recognize the cooperation the United Nations received from the authorities in Sana’a – particularly through the Safer Technical Committee, currently based in Hodeidah, which  ensured access, security and technical support required to carry this out.
The crew of the Safer played a critical role in carrying out the operation, and they continue to work very closely with the SMIT team.
I’d like to highlight that two former captains that are working on the Safer actually came from Aden. They were invited up from Aden to work on the project here – an indication of the importance of going beyond the day-to-day concerns that exist on the civil war that continues here.
The United Nations also received important political and technical support from the Government of Yemen. That can not be underestimated. It also made a $5 million contribution through the Global Environmental Facility, making it one of the top 10 donors to the project.
The United Nations has raised more than $121 million from 23 Member States and the European Union, as well as the private sector and the global public. We still need about $20 million to finish the work we have started.
Bridging funding from OCHA provided the necessary liquidity UNDP needed to get us to this point. We continue to seek support from donors to reimburse OCHA, which I should add has also been a leading advocate for the Safer problem over many, many years.
The broad coalition working to prevent the catastrophe also includes countless individuals and organisations that provided invaluable expertise and in-kind support.  It includes private companies, like the Fahem Group that proposed the initiative that was the basis for the UN plan.
Member states contributed in many different ways. Djibouti has been an incredible host as a key hub for the operation. Both the Nautica (now the MOST Yemen) and the Ndeavor anchored in Djibouti before sailing to Yemen. Egypt’s Suez Canal Authority waived fees for the passage of the Ndeavor on its way to the operation.
These are just some of the many examples that show the breadth of support –which reflect the well-placed concern the world has had for the threat posed by the Safer.
Of course, the entire UN system has been engaged and I thank, in particular, the Secretary-General for his support.
So, a remarkable global coalition has come together under the UN umbrella to prevent an environmental, humanitarian and economic catastrophe that would have happened if the world had not acted.
But we still need to finish the work the UN started.
As outlined by Achim earlier, the installation of a CALM buoy is the next critical step. [The replacement vessel] will need to be tethered to it.
Then, of course, the final removal of the Safer and final cleaning of the Safer will be required to permanently eliminate the threat.
Thank you, very much.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE FOR INTERNATIONAL YOUTH DAY
Content: 12 August 2023
12 August 2023
Every year, International Youth Day celebrates the determination, ideas and leadership of young people as we pursue a better world.

Across all of today’s challenges, young people are calling for bold and accelerated action, standing in solidarity with the most vulnerable, and designing solutions to ensure social, economic and climate justice, and peace and prosperity for all. To expand their participation, I recently launched a policy brief calling for governments to make youth participation the norm, rather than the exception, across decisions and policies around the world.

This year’s theme reminds us of the importance of ensuring young people gain and apply skills in the burgeoning green economy. From innovative sustainable technologies and renewable energy, to revolutions in transportation systems and industrial activity, young people must be equipped with skills and knowledge to shape a cleaner, greener, more climate resilient future.

Humanity depends on the boundless energy, ideas and contributions of youth everywhere. Today and every day, let’s support and stand with young people in shaping a just and sustainable world, for people and planet.

Title: United Nations completes removal of oil from decaying tanker in Red Sea
Content: 11 August 2023
More than 1.1 million barrels of oil transferred to the replacement tanker over 18 days
Hodeidah, Yemen, 11 August

At 1800 local time, the United Nations successfully completed the transfer of oil from the FSO Safer supertanker off Yemen’s Red Sea coast, preventing the immediate threat of a massive spill.
The Safer has been at risk of breaking up or exploding for years. A major spill from the vessel would have resulted in an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe.
The cargo of oil aboard the FSO Safer has been pumped onto the replacement vessel MOST Yemen (formerly Nautica) in a ship-to-ship transfer that began on 25 July, following preparations on site for the operation that began in May by leading marine salvage company SMIT, a subsidiary of Boskalis. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), which contracted SMIT, is implementing the operation.
As much of the 1.14 million barrels has been extracted as possible. However, less than 2 percent of the original oil cargo remains mixed in with sediment that will be removed during the final cleaning of the Safer.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres said: “I welcome the news that the transfer of oil from the FSO Safer has been safely concluded today. The United Nations-led operation has prevented what could have been an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe on a colossal scale.”
UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said: “Today is a proud moment for the many people across the UN System as well as our donors and partners who have worked tirelessly over the past months and years to avert a disaster in a country already vulnerable following protracted conflict. There is still work to be done, but today we can say with confidence that the immediate threat of a spill has been averted.”
The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, who has led UN system-wide efforts on the Safer since September 2021, said: “Today is a great milestone. A remarkable global coalition came together under the UN umbrella to prevent the worst-case scenario of a catastrophic oil spill in the Red Sea. We need to finish the work the UN started. The installation of a CALM buoy to which the replacement vessel will be safely tethered is the next crucial step.”
The United Nations thanks donors for their generous support
We also thank the HSA Group, the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, the Trafigura and Leo Balmer Foundations, Octavia Energy/Calvalley Petroleum, and generous individuals that have contributed to the UN crowdfunding campaign.

The United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, made the following statement today:
I welcome the release this week of the five UN personnel who were kidnapped in the southern governorate of Abyan on 11 February 2022.
Our four national and one international colleagues spent 18 months in captivity. I was extremely pleased to see for myself that the four Yemeni colleagues were in good health when I flew with them to Aden from Mukalla today.
All five of our staff are receiving support. They are in good spirits and are in contact with their families.
I thank the Government of Yemen and all others that helped to secure the release of our UN colleagues and contributed to ensuring their health during such a long time in captivity.
While the entire UN family in Yemen is relieved that our colleagues are free, we also recall other UN staff are still held against their will in Yemen. We stand in solidarity with them.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- MESSAGE ON WORLD DAY AGAINST TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS
Content: 30 July 2023
30 July 2023
Human trafficking is a heinous violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms.

It preys on vulnerability and thrives in times of conflict and instability.

Today – amidst growing inequalities, worsening climate emergencies, and record displacement – more and more people are left vulnerable to traffickers.

The majority of detected victims are women and children, many of whom suffer brutal violence, forced labour, and horrific sexual exploitation and abuse.

Yet traffickers continue to operate with impunity. Their crimes are receiving not nearly enough attention. This must change.

We must invest much more in detection and protection. We must strengthen law enforcement to bring criminals that commodify human beings to justice. And we must do more to help survivors rebuild their lives.

On this World Day against Trafficking in Persons, let us redouble our efforts to detect, protect, and support survivors and leave no trafficking victim behind.

Together, let us build a world where no one can ever be bought, sold, or exploited.

Title: United Nations starts removal of oil from decaying tanker in Red Sea
Content: 25 July 2023
The transfer of the oil to the replacement tanker Yemen expected to last 19 days
Hodeidah, Yemen, 25 July
The UN-led project to prevent a massive oil spill from the FSO Safer supertanker off Yemen’s Red Sea coast began today with the removal of more than 1 million barrels of oil from the decaying vessel.
The Safer has been at risk of breaking up or exploding for years. A major spill from the vessel would result in an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe.
The oil aboard the Safer is being pumped into the replacement vessel Yemen (formerly Nautica) in a ship-to-ship transfer that is expected to take 19 days to complete. After its arrival at the site on 30 May, the leading marine salvage company SMIT, a subsidiary of Boskalis, has stabilized the 47-year-old Safer. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), which contracted SMIT, is implementing the operation to remove the oil.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres said: “In the absence of anyone else willing or able to perform this task, the United Nations stepped up and assumed the risk to conduct this very delicate operation.  The ship-to-ship transfer of oil which has started today is the critical next step in avoiding an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe on a colossal scale.”
UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said: “With every gallon of oil now being pumped off the Safer the threat of a potential spill that has loomed over the people of Yemen and indeed the countries and economies depending on the shared Red Sea ecosystem, recedes. The challenges on this project have been huge but the response by so many who have made this rescue operation possible has been equally huge. And it is a reminder of what the United Nations can achieve through its convening power and its capacity to coordinate a complex operation.”
Speaking from aboard the salvage vessel Ndeavor, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, said: “The transfer of the oil to the Yemen will prevent the worst-case scenario of a catastrophic spill in the Red Sea, but it is not the end of the operation. The installation of a CALM buoy to which the replacement vessel will be safely tethered is the next crucial step. I thank donors, private companies and the general public for providing the funds that have brought us to this milestone.”
Mr Gressly has led UN system-wide efforts on the Safer since September 2021.

Title: Statement on the killing of humanitarian worker in Turbah

OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS RESIDENT & HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR YEMEN
Shara’a
Hodeidah, 22 July 2023 – This statement on the attack by gunmen yesterday on World Food Programme staff members in Turbah in the Taiz governorate of Yemen is attributable to the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly. One staff member died in hospital shortly after the attack. He was the first humanitarian killed in the line of duty in Yemen this year.
I am shocked and deeply saddened by the appalling attack by unknown gunmen on World Food Programme (WFP) staff in Turbah today that left one staff member dead and another injured.
The entire UN family and humanitarian partners in Yemen are grieving the loss of Moayad Hameidi, a Jordanian national and dedicated humanitarian, who died in hospital shortly after the attack.
Hameidi, worked for WFP for 18 years, including on a previous posting in Yemen. He had only recently returned to the country to assume his new role as the head of WFP’s office in Taiz.
On behalf of the entire humanitarian community in Yemen, I convey my heartfelt sympathies to his family and friends at this very difficult time. I also wish the injured staff member a speedy recovery.
Mr. Hameidi’s death is indeed an unacceptable tragedy. I call on the authorities to
bring the perpetrators to justice. Humanitarian workers should never be a target.

Title: United Nations poised to begin transfer of 1 million barrels of oil from decaying tanker in Red Sea
Content: 15 July 2023
The vessel that will take on the oil in ship-to-ship transfer sailed today from Djibouti
Hodeidah, Yemen – 15 July – The UN-led project to prevent a massive oil spill from the decaying FSO Safer supertanker off Yemen’s Red Sea coast took a major step forward today when the replacement vessel Nautica sailed from Djibouti en route to the Safer site. All technical preparations and agreements have been finalized.
The Safer, which holds an estimated 1 million barrels of oil, has been at risk of breaking up or exploding for years. A major spill from the vessel would result in an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe.
Once the replacement vessel arrives, the oil aboard the Safer will be pumped out in a ship-to-ship transfer that is expected to take about two weeks to complete. The leading marine salvage company SMIT, a subsidiary of Boskalis, stabilized the Safer since arriving at the site on 30 May. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), which contracted SMIT, is implementing the operation to remove the oil.
UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said: “With the Nautica now en route, we expect the removal of oil from the Safer to begin in the next week. Removing the threat the Safer poses will be a huge achievement for the many people who have worked tirelessly on this complex and difficult project over months and years to bring us to this point. We will not rest until that threat is gone, and today we are close to beginning the operation.”
Speaking from aboard the Nautica, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, said: “The ship-to-ship transfer of the oil is an important milestone, but not the end of the operation. The next critical step is the installation of a CALM buoy to which the replacement vessel will be safely moored. I thank donors, private companies and the general public for providing the funds that have brought us so far.”
Mr Gressly has led UN system-wide efforts on the Safer since September 2021.

The United Nations thanks donors for the generous support

We also thank the HSA Group, the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, the Trafigura Foundation, Octavia Engergy/Calvalley Petroleum, and generous individuals that have contributed to the UN crowdfunding campaign.

Title: UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen -- Briefing to the Security Council on the status of the FSO Safer operation
Content: 10 July 2023
Sana’a, Yemen, 10 July 2023
Madam President,
Distinguished Council Members,
Good morning.
Usually briefs on the Safer focus on what needs to be done. Today I would like to focus on what has been done.
I would like to start today with a progress report on the UN operation to prevent a catastrophic oil spill from the decaying FSO Safer.
Since the salvage ship Ndeavor arrived at the Safer site on 30 May, SMIT Salvage, the Boskalis subsidiary contracted by the United Nations Development Programme, has done everything possible to stabilize the decaying Safer and prepare it for the removal of a million barrels of oil.
Just some of the work that I have witnessed over the past five weeks includes:
SMIT has certified to UNDP that the oil transfer can proceed, with the level of risk within an acceptable range. The Safer is fully stabilized for the ship-to-ship transfer of the oil.
The upcoming oil transfer still presents residual risk. The United Nations and its partners have put in place a robust crisis management team based in Hodeidah and assembled the expertise and equipment required to respond if there is an incident.

Madam President,
Shortly after Ndeavor’s arrival, the Sana’a authorities wrote to me to affirm their full support to the operation, including a wavier of all fees associated with it.
The Safer Exploration and Production Operations Company’s skeleton crew aboard the Safer is working closely with the salvage team.
In line with the 5 March 2022 memorandum of understanding (MoU), the Safer Technical Committee based in Hodeidah continues to effectively facilitate the operation.
The Committee provides access, security and technical support and has maintained a high level of coordination and cooperation with the UN team in Hodeidah and the salvage team.
Even when there were miscommunications and misunderstanding which are inevitable in a sensitive security environment, the Committee acted quickly to deescalate and resolve them.

Madam President
I am pleased to report to the Council that the Sana’a authorities provided authorization today for the oil transfer from the FSO Safer to the replacement vessel.
I want to acknowledge the overall cooperation received so far from the Committee and Sana’a authorities in the implementation of the project.
The replacement vessel Nautica is preparing to sail from Djibouti. It will moor alongside the Safer and should begin taking on the oil by early next week. Once the transfer starts, it will take about two weeks.
The completion of the ship-to-ship transfer of the oil will be a moment when the whole world can heave a sigh of relief.
The worst-case humanitarian, environmental and economic catastrophe from a massive oil spill will have been prevented.
But it will not be the end of the operation. The next critical step after the oil transfer will include the delivery and installment of a catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM) buoy to which the replacement vessel will safely be installed. The CALM buoy needs to be in place by September at the latest as currents and winds becaome more dangerous in October.
I want to recognize and thank the Government of Yemen for its full support to this operation.
In February 2022, the internationally-recognized Government confirmed to me in Aden its support for the plan. It pledged $5 million towards the operation, making it the sixth largest donor. This political and financial support have been critical to the succsess of the project.
I have been assured that the cooperation will continue.

Madame President,
The Security Council has remained seized of the situation of the Safer tanker over several years. The attention and unity of the Council on this issue has helped propel us to where we are today.
The current estimated budget is $143 million, of which the UN has raised $118 million from generous Member States, including eight around this table, the private sector and the general public, which has contributed $300,000 through a crowdfunding campaign.
The broad coalition working to prevent the catastrophe also includes environmental groups like Greenpeace and, in Yemen, Holm Akhdar.
The Secretary-General has placed great importance on resolving the issue of the Safer tanker. And he has directed the United Nations system to support the project.
UNDP has worked tirelessly to secure and manage the wide range of maritime expertise needed to conduct the complex and high-risk operation – not to mention the 320-meter replacement vessel.
The International Maritime Organization, UN Environment Programme, UNESCO and the World Food Progamme have provided invaluable expertise.
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided $20 million in bridging finance from the Central Emergency Response Fund, which gave UNDP sufficient liquidity to start the operation.
On the ground in Yemen, the project also has operational support from the UN Mission for the Hudaydah Agreement, UN Department of Safety and Security and the other members of Yemen’s UN Country Team, including UNFPA.

Madam President,
I wish to recognize the top five donors for their role in advocating for the FSO Safer operation and mobilizing resources – the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom.
We are thankful to all 23 Member States and the European Union for generous funding.
However, an additional $25 million is still needed, including to repay the $20 million to the Central Emergency Relief Fund.
With your continued support, I am confident of the project’s success to put an end to this environmental, humanitarian and economic threat.
Thank you, Madame President.

Title: UN Operation Underway to Prevent Catastrophic Oil Spill in Red Sea
Content: 30 May 2023
Salvage vessel arrived today at site of decaying supertanker off Yemen’s Ras Issa peninsula to prepare for removal of more than 1 million barrels of oil. Funding still urgently required to complete the operation.
Ras Issa, Yemen, 30 May 2023 – The United Nations today started a challenging operation to remove more than 1 million barrels of oil from the FSO Safer – a decaying supertanker moored off Yemen’s Red Sea coast that threatens a humanitarian and environmental disaster.
In a critical step forward in the operation, the salvage support vessel Ndeavor, operated by lead marine salvage company SMIT, a subsidiary of Boskalis, and contracted by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to undertake the transfer of the oil to a secure vessel, arrived onsite today.
The Ndeavor’s crew of experts will inspect the Safer and undertake all necessary work to make it secure for the transfer of oil to the replacement tanker Nautica, which is standing by in Djibouti to travel to the site next month and receive the oil.
The start of the operation on the water comes after almost two years of political groundwork, fundraising and project development, led by UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, who was aboard the Ndeavor today.
In December 2021, United Nations senior management endorsed the plan to prevent a spill by transferring the oil to a safe vessel and install long-term replacement capacity for the Safer, and asked UNDP to implement it, contingent on funding. Drawing on expertise from the UN System as well as external contractors, partners and experts, the UN has worked round the clock to prepare for this unprecedented effort.
"Today marks a critical step in the operation to remove the threat posed by the FSO Safer,” said UN Development Programme Administrator Achim Steiner. “With the marine salvage support vessel Ndeavor onsite, the project can now begin in earnest. This marks the culmination of tremendous amounts of work and coordination among UN agencies, maritime lawyers, oil spill experts and many more. This is a proud moment for the United Nations and for the UN Development Programme as the implementing partner for the emergency phase of the project to remove the oil. It is also a clear sign of what multilateral cooperation can achieve, and a prime example of the importance of prevention. Aside from a possible humanitarian and environmental catastrophe, funds spent now will prevent a disaster that could cost billions in the future. With this in mind, we call again upon the international community and private sector to step up and support us to close the funding gap on the project so that we can finish what we have started."
Even after the oil transfer averts the worst-case scenario of a spill of 1 million barrels, the decaying Safer will still hold a considerable amount of residual oil and pose a significant environmental threat to the Red Sea.
But the project remains underfunded, with $29 million still needed, including to safely moor the replacement vessel to a catenary anchor leg mooring buoy and towing the Safer to a green recycling yard.
“Member states, private companies and the general public have contributed $114 million to stop the Red Sea Spill, and so many other partners that have contributed expertise and advocated for this critical operation. I thank them all and want to recognize SMIT Salvage and the Fahem Group for presenting an initiative in 2021 that became the basis of the project being implemented today,” said David Gressly. “This is a great milestone, but we will not rest easy until the operation is completed. To do that we are counting on generous donors to close the remaining $29 million budget gap.”

The United Nations thanks donors for the generous support

We also thank the HSA Group, the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, Trafigura Foundation, and Octavia Energy/Calvalley Petroleum and generous individuals that have contributed to the UN crowdfunding campaign for the plan.
Background
The FSO Safer has been moored about nine kilometers off Yemen’s Ras Isa peninsula since 1988 and could explode or break up at any time. Due to the conflict in Yemen, the FSO Safer has decayed to the point where there is an imminent risk it could explode or break apart, which would have disastrous effects on the region and beyond.
A major spill would devastate fishing communities on Yemen’s Red Sea coast, likely wiping out 200,000 livelihoods instantly. Whole communities would be exposed to life-threatening toxins. Highly polluted air would affect millions. It could close of the ports of Hodeidah and Saleef – which are essential to bring food, fuel and life-saving supplies into Yemen, where 17 million people need food assistance. The closure of desalination plants would cut off a water source for millions of people. Oil from the Safer could reach the African coast and affect any country on the Red Sea. The environmental impact on coral reefs life-supporting mangroves and other marine life would be severe. Fish stocks would take 25 years to recover.
The cost of cleanup alone is estimated at $20 billion. Disruptions to shipping through the Bab al-Mandab strait to the Suez Canal could cost billions more in global trade losses every day, as happened after the Ever Given grounded in the Canal in 2021.
The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, has led UN system-wide efforts since September 2021. UNDP is implementing this complex and high-risk project.

Title: Joint News Release: Conflict and economic crisis drive food insecurity and malnutrition in Yemen
Content: 25 May 2023
May 25 2023, ADEN – The food security situation in Yemen’s districts under the control of the Government of Yemen (GoY) slightly improved during the first five months of this year, while acute malnutrition increased, compared to the same period in 2022. However, the outlook for the period between now until the end of 2023 indicates the need for more programme investments, as the modest improvements may be eroded, UN agencies have warned.
In a new Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis on Yemen released today, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) warned that, despite the slight improvements, nearly all districts under the control of the GoY were assessed to be facing high levels of food insecurity.
Yemen remains one of the most food insecure countries globally, mainly driven by the impact of conflict and economic decline, the three UN agencies added.
The report shows that Yemen continues to require attention, with hunger stalking millions of people and the situation could worsen if nothing is done to address the key drivers of food insecurity in the Middle Eastern country.

Despite modest improvements, second half of 2023 needs more investment
Today’s report showed that between January and May 2023, about 3.2 million people experienced high levels of acute food insecurity in the GoY areas, and these are classified in severe food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above), representing a 23 percent reduction from the October – December 2022 estimates.
Additionally, the number of people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) almost halved to 781,000 compared to the estimates for the last quarter of 2022.
The three UN agencies warned that these modest improvements were only a ‘temporary reprieve’ as the key drivers of food insecurity remain and are projected to worsen during the period June to December 2023.
The IPC report projected a 20 percent increase in the number of people facing IPC Phase 3 and above (638,500 additional people) during the June to December period. The number of people likely to experience high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or worse) is estimated to increase to 3.9 million (41 percent), out of which 2.8 million people are estimated to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 1.1 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).
The situation is likely to be compounded by a 20 percent decrease in humanitarian food assistance levels and the anticipated increase in food prices. While there has been a relative calm, sporadic fighting may continue in the frontline districts which further impacts food security.

Children and pregnant and lactating mothers facing acute malnutrition
As acute malnutrition continues to worsen in southern governorates, it is estimated that in 2023, half a million children will be acutely malnourished, including nearly 100,000 children who are likely to be severely malnourished. It is also estimated that up to a quarter million pregnant and lactating women (PLW) will be acutely malnourished, while child stunting levels are also very high, ranging from 35.9 percent in Abyan Lowland to 64.3 percent in Hodeida Southern Lowland.
Critical situations of acute malnutrition (IPC AMN Phase 4) persist in some parts of the southern areas. The area-level classification is expected to deteriorate further during the projection period for acute malnutrition with all 16 zones of southern governorates being classified in IPC AMN phases 3 (Serious) and above, including seven zones in IPC AMN Phase 4 (Critical).
David Gressly, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, said: “The United Nations and its partners made strides in rolling back the worst food insecurity last year, but these gains remain fragile and 17 million people are still food insecure in Yemen. We thank generous donors for commitments made so far but need further support to reach the level of funding received last year to sustain an integrated humanitarian response. With adequate resources, we will reach millions of Yemenis with critical food and nutrition support, clean water, basic health care, protection and other necessities, while building people’s resilience and preparing communities across the country to withstand future shocks.”
“FAO is seized with this situation, and we are working directly with farmers on the ground to enable them to maintain their livelihoods. We make sure that smallholder farmers in Yemen will withstand any shocks which impact food security. As such, our focus, through various interventions, is to improve household food security and income by strengthening agricultural production practices, increasing labour opportunities, and diversifying livelihoods in a sustainable way that fosters peaceful coexistence,” said FAO Yemen Representative, Dr. Hussein Gadain.
UNICEF and partners reached about 420,000 children suffering from severe and acute malnutrition with lifesaving interventions in 2022., This is the highest ever reached in Yemen, thanks to the scale up of nutrition services in 4700 PHC facilities. Despite this, malnutrition levels remain critical in many areas of the Southern Governorates. A multi sectoral approach to address all forms of malnutrition is essential and together with partners UNICEF is strengthening the provision of primary health care, including early detection and treatment of severe acute malnutrition”, said UNICEF Yemen Representative, Peter Hawkins.
“WFP’s assistance is critical for getting people to firmer ground, for averting crisis and famine, for a better future, and we urge our donors to renew their commitment to supporting the most vulnerable Yemenis. Yemen's food insecurity situation remains fragile, and the hard-won gains of the past 12 months will be lost without continued and urgent support from our donors. There are women, men and children behind these IPC statistics, whose lives straddle the fine line between hope and utter devastation. We simply cannot take our foot off the gas now,” said WFP Country Director, Richard Ragan.

Title: Statement: Remarks at the pledging event for the FSO Safer operation co-hosted by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom
Content: 04 May 2023
Sana’a, 04 May 2023 – The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, delivered the following remarks today at the online pledging event for the FSO Safer operation co-hosted by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
First, I want echo Achim’s thank you to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands for having organized this event.
And for contributing generously.
A third element that they both deserve credit for is recognizing early on the promise of a private-sector initiative to address the Safer which the Fahem Group and SMIT Salvage proposed in mid-2021 – a time when the previous UN plan to inspect the Safer was not moving.
The initiative called for a leading maritime salvage company to transfer the oil off the Safer and replace the decaying supertanker’s capacity.
That was the basis upon which the United Nations principals asked me to lead and coordinate UN system-wide efforts on the Safer, in September 2021.
In December 2021, United Nations senior management endorsed the UN-coordinated plan and asked UNDP to implement it, contingent upon donor funding.
In February 2021, I met with the Government of Yemen in Aden, which confirmed its support for the plan.
They have remained supportive ever since – as evidenced by a $5 million pledge that they made last year.
The Sana’a authorities had been favorable to the original initiative, but insisted that it be done under UN auspices.
In March 2022, they signed a memorandum of understanding with the UN that committed them to facilitating the operation.
A commitment that they continue to honor.
The agreement was also signed by myself with the Fahem Group, which has supported engagement in Sana’a on the initiative since 2021 on a voluntary basis.
By April 2022, the UN presented a draft operational plan to begin fundraising. The original budget for phase 1 and 2 was $144 million.
As Achim said, the Netherlands pledging event in The Hague last May brought in $33 million, which was a catalyst to move us to where we are today.
But finding funds to prevent a catastrophe proved far more difficult than finding money for a disaster.
In June, we launched a public crowdfunding campaign for the operation.
That has now brought in more than $250,000. More importantly, it captured media attention that galvanized further support for the plan.
In August, we received the first pledge from a private entity. $1.2 million from the HSA Group. The International Association of Oil and Gas Producers followed with a $10 million pledge and Trafigura Foundation with $1 million.
The private sector, we learned, was concerned about its liability linked to a contribution. UNDP, in particular, led the effort to resolve those issues of concern which gives us a basis for further private sector contributions.
By September last year, the UN met the target of $75 million to start the operation.
Unfortunately, even as UNDP was gearing up to begin, the cost of suitable replacement vessels surged, chiefly due to developments related to the war in Ukraine.
More money was also needed to start the initial phase because of the necessity to purchase a replacement vessel – also linked to the war in Ukraine as suitable vessels for lease were no longer available. The budget for the emergency phase – during which the oil will be transferred – is now $129 million. Most of the funding is now required up front in phase one. Now, the second phase only requires $19 million to complete the project.
So, the budget of $148 million is just $4 million more than was presented to donors a year ago.
Prior to today’s announcements, we had raised $99.6 million from member states, the private sector and the general public.
The general public has provided donations from $1 to $5,000.
The broad coalition working to prevent the catastrophe also includes environmental groups like Greenpeace and, in Yemen, Holm Akhdar.
Every part of the United Nations is involved, including the International Maritime Organization, the UN Environmental Progamme, and the World Food Progamme. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is among those that have worked on the Safer file for years and has now ensured $20 million of bridging finance. That would need to be replenished by donor funding.
I also want to recognize the United States for playing a tireless role in mobilizing resources. It is among the top five donors, together with the Netherlands, Germany, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom.
On 9 March, UNDP’s Administrator took the bold decision to purchase the replacement vessel Nautica – before all of the operation was in place.
That is because UNDP recognized the extraordinary problem and understood that the cost of inaction is too great, as Achim outlined.
UNDP also contracted the Boskalis subsidiary SMIT Salvage, which played an enormously helpful role in developing the UN plan long before it had a contract.
With both the Nautica and the SMIT vessel Ndeavor en route to Djibouti, we expect the operation to start before the end of the month.
Therefore, I thank all donors for the generous support, and we look forward to further generous support.
But the risk of disaster remains.
I am forever thankful to the heroic skeleton crew aboard the Safer that continues to do all it can to keep that vessel together until we can organize this salvage operation.
None of us will heave a sigh of relief until the oil is transferred.
And we will all heave a final sigh of relief when the critical second phase is completed. This requires that the project is fully funded as described.
As everyone has said we are just one step away so lets take the final step.
Thank you.

Title: United Nations Takes Next Major Step to Prevent Catastrophic Oil Spill in Red Sea
Content: 20 April 2023
Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 20 April 2023 – In the latest critical step towards preventing a massive oil spill off Yemen’s Red Sea coast, the global leading maritime services company Boskalis’s support vessel Ndeavor will sail enroute to the Red Sea in the coming hours.
The UN Development Programme has contracted the Boskalis subsidiary SMIT Salvage to transfer 1 million barrels of oil off a decaying tanker. The team’s vessel Ndeavor sets sail to the Red Sea today. Funding is urgently required.
Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 20 April 2023 – In the latest critical step towards preventing a massive oil spill off Yemen’s Red Sea coast, the global leading maritime services company Boskalis’s support vessel Ndeavor will sail enroute to the Red Sea in the coming hours.
On Wednesday, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) finalized the contract for the Boskalis subsidiary SMIT Salvage to transfer the million barrels of oil aboard the FSO Safer to a safe replacement vessel and prepare the Safer for towing to a green scrapping yard.
The work off Yemen’s Ras Isa peninsula is expected to begin in May. UNDP earlier secured the replacement vessel, Nautica, which will take on the oil from the Safer.
“The agreement today between UNDP and Boskalis subsidiary SMIT Salvage, to deploy a team of leading experts aboard the Ndeavour marks another critical milestone of the ‘Stop Red Sea Spill‘ operation to transfer oil from the decaying FSO Safer to a safe temporary vessel,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “We look forward to be working with Boskalis and other leading experts to prevent a humanitarian, environmental and economic disaster. We also appeal to leaders from governments and corporations to step forward and help us raise the remaining $29 million required to complete this complex rescue operation."
“This operation highlights the unique role the UN can play to address the world’s seemingly intractable problems. UNDP and other partners inside and outside the UN should be proud of their roles in getting us this far,” said David Gressly, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, who has led UN system-wide efforts on the Safer since 2021. “However, we urgently need to close the $29 million funding gap for the emergency operation and raise the additional funds needed to ensure safe long-term storage of the oil.”
The multipurpose support vessel Ndeavor, which will sail with its crew and experts, is loaded with generators, hydraulic pumps and other specialized equipment to carry out the operation on the Safer, which no longer has functioning systems.
“Following a long planning period, our salvage experts are keen to get to work and remove the oil from the Safer,” said Peter Berdowski, CEO Boskalis, who has signed the contract through its subsidiary SMIT Salvage with the UN Development Programme. “I would like to express my gratitude to the many UN member nations in their support for this operation including the Netherlands. The Boskalis vessel Ndeavor is ready for departure, and I wish the crew all the success in this important mission.”
On Monday, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands announced they will co-host a pledging event on 4 May with the aim of fully funding both phases of the Safer project.
‘‘An enormous oil disaster is looming, which could have serious humanitarian, environmental and economic
implications. But we now have a chance to prevent that disaster.” said the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Liesje Schreinemacher. “The Netherlands has worked hard to mobilise funds for the operation and now a major new step has been taken. It’s good that Dutch firm Boskalis is taking on a key role in the response. The Netherlands will continue helping the UN to bring this to a good end.’’
The United Nations has received firm funding commitments of $99.6 million. The total budget for this first phase is $129 million, leaving a gap of $29.4 million. An estimated $19 million is required for the second phase of the operation.
To fill the budget gap, the UN is appealing to Member States and private entities, as well as the global public through a crowdfunding appeal to which thousands of individuals have already contributed.

Title: UN Press Release- Tanker Sets Sail on United Nations Mission to Prevent Catastrophic Oil Spill in Red Sea
Content: 06 April 2023
Vessel’s departure is a significant development in the operation to remove more than a million barrels of oil from decaying supertanker off Yemen’s Red Sea coast. Funding still urgently needed to execute safe removal of oil.
New York, 6 April 2023
A very large crude carrier or VLCC set sail from Zhoushan, China today as part of a United Nations coordinated operation to remove more than a million barrels of oil from the decaying FSO Safer supertanker off Yemen’s Red Sea coast that threatens a humanitarian, environmental and economic catastrophe.
Secured last month by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the Nautica was in drydock in Zhoushan, China for regular maintenance and modifications. The vessel is expected to arrive in early May. The Safer has been moored about nine kilometers off Yemen’s Ras Isa peninsula since 1988 and could explode or break up at any time.
The UN Development Programme (UNDP), which is implementing the operation as part of a UN-coordinated initiative, is contracting the global leading marine salvage company SMIT to ready the Safer and safely carry out the ship-to-ship transfer of the oil.
“The departure of the Nautica, and its onward journey to the Red Sea, is a significant next step in the complex operation to take on the oil from the Safer. This moment marks the culmination of many months of preparation and coordination. It has involved many partners among them our UN sister agencies, a global community of funders – from government and foundations to school classes – as well as international experts to ensure we succeed and prevent a humanitarian, environmental and economic disaster,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “We are in a race against time and I urge leaders in government, CEOs of corporations and any individual in a position to contribute to step forward and support us in keeping this operation, that is fast
reaching a critical stage, on track,” he added.
While the project has received significant international support, the spiraling cost for VLCCs, in a market affected by the war in Ukraine, and other factors, means more funding is needed to complete the emergency phase of the plan. As of 4 April, the UN had received firm commitments for $95 million. The total budget for this first phase is $129 million, leaving a gap of $34 million.
“The sailing of the vessel that will take on the Safer’s oil brings us closer to preventing a catastrophe,” said David Gressly, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, who has led on UN system-wide efforts on the Safer since September 2021. “The UN family, including UNDP, UNEP, IMO, OCHA, WFP, member states, private companies and the public have all played a part in the UN-coordinated plan. We have the best available technical expertise and political support from all sides. Donors have been generous. We just need the final piece of funding this month to ensure success.”
To fill the budget gap, the UN is appealing to Member States and private entities, and the global public through a crowdfunding appeal to which thousands of individuals have already contributed. To learn more, visit www.un.org/StopRedSeaSpill&nbsp;

Title: UN Press Release - Major Step Forward on FSO Safer
Content: 09 March 2023
United Nations Takes Major Step Forward to Prevent Catastrophic Oil Spill in Red Sea as UN Development Programme Signs Agreement to Purchase Oil Tanker
Purchase of vessel is a critical development in operation to remove more than a million barrels of oil from
decaying supertanker off Yemen’s Red Sea coast. Funding still urgently needed to complete safe removal of oil
New York, 9 March 2023 – the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) signed an agreement with Euronav today to secure the purchase of a Very Large Crude Carrier – or ‘VLCC’ – as part of the UN-coordinated operation to remove more than a million barrels of oil from a decaying tanker off Yemen’s Red Sea coast that threatens a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe.
The replacement vessel is now in drydock for modifications and regular maintenance before sailing to the FSO Safer, moored about nine kilometers off Yemen’s Ras Isa peninsula. It is expected to arrive in early May for the operation.
The FSO Safer has not been maintained since 2015 because of the conflict in Yemen. It has decayed to the point where there is an imminent risk it could explode or break apart, which would have disastrous effects on the region.
A major spill would devastate fishing communities on Yemen’s Red Sea coast, likely wiping out 200,000 livelihoods instantly. Whole communities would be exposed to life-threatening toxins. Highly polluted air would affect millions.
It would also result in the closure of the ports of Hodeidah and Saleef – which are essential to bring food, fuel and life-saving supplies into Yemen, where 17 million people need food assistance. Desalination plants would close, cutting off a water source for millions of people. Oil from the Safer could reach the African coast and affect any country on the Red Sea. The environmental impact on coral reefs life-supporting mangroves and other marine life would be severe. Fish stocks would take 25 years to recover.
The cost of cleanup alone is estimated at $20 billion. Disruptions to shipping through the Bab al-Mandab strait to the Suez Canal could cost billions more in global trade losses every day, as happened after the Ever Given grounded in the Canal in 2021.
The UN Development Programme (UNDP), which is implementing the high-risk operation as part of the UN-coordinated initiative, is contracting marine salvage company SMIT to safely remove the oil and prepare the Safer for towing to a green scrapping yard.
UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said, “The purchase of this suitable vessel by UNDP marks the beginning of the operational phase of the UN-coordinated plan to safely remove the oil from the Safer and avoid the risk of an environmental and humanitarian disaster on a massive scale. We must accept that this is a very challenging and complex operation. UNDP is working around the clock with experts from UN sister agencies including IMO, WFP and UNEP among others as well as international consultancies on maritime law, insurance and environmental impact to ensure that we are deploying the best possible expertise to successfully complete this operation.”
While the project to remove the oil has received significant international support, spiraling costs mostly related to the war in Ukraine that triggered a significant price increase in the market for suitable vessels to undertake the operation mean more money is still needed to complete the emergency phase of the plan. As of 7 March, the UN has raised $95 million, of which $75 million has been received. The total budget for the emergency phase of the project is $129 million.
From Sana’a, David Gressly, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, who has led on UN system-wide efforts on the Safer since September 2021, said, “UNDP’s purchase of the vessel is indeed a major step, made possible by the generosity of donors, the private sector and global citizens. The parties to the conflict continue to endorse the plan. Now we are into the operational phase and hopeful the oil will be removed from the Safer within the next three to four months. But we still urgently need funding to implement the plan and prevent disaster.”
To fill the budget gap, the UN is re-launching a crowdfunding appeal which saw thousands of individuals around the world contribute to the FSO Safer project in 2021. To learn more, visit www.un.org/StopRedSeaSpill.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL   -- REMARKS AT HIGH-LEVEL PLEDGING EVENT FOR THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN YEMEN
Content: 27 February 2023
Geneva, 27 February 2023
As delivered
I thank the Governments of Sweden and Switzerland for again co-hosting this conference, and I thank all of you for your solidarity with the people of Yemen.
We ended last year with a measure of hope for the future of Yemen.
After years of death, displacement, destruction, starvation, and suffering, the truce delivered real dividends for people.
Civilian flights resumed from Sanaa; vital supplies arrived through the port of Hudaydah.
But the truce lapsed though after only six months.
Yes, key provisions have remained in place.
But the economy is in enormous difficulties.
Basic services risk to collapse.
And humanitarian needs continue to soar, while access is constrained, and funding perennially falls short.
Today, more than 21 million people – two in three Yemeni children, women, and men – need assistance and protection.
Pause and reflect for a moment what this staggering figure means.
The daily struggle for survival.
Parents unable to feed their children.
Women and girls too afraid to walk to school or even venture outside.
Families losing whatever hope they had left to ever return home.

Excellencies,

I am acutely aware that humanitarian needs worldwide are the highest they have ever been.
And I know that resources are stretched thin.
But I also know that your support can be the difference between life and death.
Today, we are appealing for $4.3 billion to support 17.3 million of the most vulnerable people in Yemen.
This will enable us to sustain vital operations that have proven their worth.
Last year, almost 11 million people received life-saving assistance – from food and clean water to shelter, protection, and education.
Thanks to this assistance – as well as the truce and other factors – two million fewer people suffered acute hunger.
And the number of people living on the brink of famine fell from over 150,000 to virtually zero.
But these gains remain fragile.
If support dries up now, aid agencies will be forced to scale back or suspend programming, at terrible human cost.

Excellencies,

Beyond sustained support, our humanitarian colleagues and partners need sustained access to people in need.
Bureaucratic impediments, interference, movement restrictions – particularly in Houthi-controlled areas – make it that much harder to reach affected populations.
Even worse, aid workers themselves are increasingly coming under attack.
I call on all parties to the conflict to facilitate the safe, rapid, and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief to all civilians in need, in line with obligations under international humanitarian law.
Humanitarians – including female Yemeni aid workers – must be able to carry out their work safely, independently, rapidly, and without hindrance or arbitrary restrictions.

Excellencies,

This marks the seventh time in seven years that we had to convene a pledging conference for the people of Yemen.
The people of Yemen deserve our support. But more than that, they deserve a credible path out of perpetual conflict and a chance to rebuild their communities and country.
Humanitarian aid is a band aid. It saves lives, but it cannot resolve the conflict itself.
We have a real opportunity this year to change Yemen’s trajectory and move towards peace.
By renewing and expanding the truce.
By advancing the political process facilitated by my Special Envoy.
And through sustained investments at scale in Yemen’s economy to restore basic services and build long-term resilience.

Excellencies,
The international community has the power and the means to end this crisis.
And it begins by funding our appeal fully and committing to disbursing funds quickly.
And allow me a very personal observation. When I was High Commissioner for Refugees, I visited Yemen several times – and I have been from Saada to Aden, from East to West. And I will never forget the enormous generosity of the Yemeni people.
At the time, even with all the problems, with all the difficulties, Yemenis were receiving Somali refugees in big numbers, coming to the coast, and they were granting to all of them prima facie refugee status.
I don’t know many developed countries in the world able to give prima facie refugee status to Somali refugees.
This extraordinary generosity needs to be matched by our own solidarity with Yemeni people.
And so, together, let us at long last turn the tide of suffering.
Let us give hope to the people of Yemen.

Shukran.

Title: Yemen’s health crisis: WHO calls for increased funding to save millions of Yemenis
Content: 26 February 2023
Sana’a, Yemen / 26 February 2023
Ahead of tomorrow’s High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, the World Health Organization (WHO) together with its Health Cluster partners in Yemen is appealing for US$392 million to reach 12.9 million people with essential health assistance in 2023.
“Yemen requires urgent and robust support from international donors and other partners to effectively avert the potential collapse of its health system,” said Dr. Adham Abdel Moneim Ismail, WHO Representative in Yemen. “New funding in the amount of US$392 million is required by Yemen’s health sector to ensure that overstretched health facilities can continue providing even most basic services to 12.9 million most vulnerable people.”
In 2022, international funding pledges enabled WHO and 44 Health Cluster partners (including 4 other UN agencies, 39 international and local NGOs, and Yemen’s Ministry of Public Health and Population) to deliver medical equipment, supplies, trainings and other support to hospitals and health facilities that provided a wide range of vital and often lifesaving services to nearly 7.8 million Yemenis. Nevertheless, this level of funding fell far short of addressing identified and urgent health needs of some 12.6 million persons, effectively limiting assistance to only 7.8 million of them.

Increased funding urgently needed
“To date in 2023, funds pledged to the WHO-led Health Cluster equals only 3.5 percent of the US$392 million required to provide even most basic services to the 12.9 million most vulnerable Yemenis targeted by this year’s United Nations Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for Yemen,” said Dr. Adham Abdel Moneim Ismail. “They include up to 540,000 children under age five who are otherwise facing severe acute malnutrition (SAM), with direct risk of death.”
“Unless and until this massive funding gap is reversed, we will not be able to sustain our health emergency interventions in Yemen. We therefore call upon donors to continue to support our efforts to provide essential and lifesaving health services to the Yemeni people,” Dr. Adham Abdel Moneim said.
Yemen requires continuing strong support from the international donor community to deliver a minimum health service package that prioritizes access to primary health care services by
vulnerable population groups, especially in remote and conflict-affected districts of Yemen where these services are most needed.
This minimum service package entails health interventions and continuum of services prioritized at each level of care – from prevention and diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation – in order to:
“Tomorrow’s high-level pledging event for the humanitarian crisis in Yemen comes at a crucial moment to show the world’s commitment to assisting millions of Yemenis who are in distress and suffering from diseases, malnutrition, and trauma,” Dr. Adham Abdel Moneim added.
Underfunding of the Health Cluster in Yemen in 2023 (serving 4,812 health facilities, 276 hospitals and specialized centres, 1,199 health centres, and 3,337 health units) will result in:

Note to the editors
Worsening health situation and WHO’s response across Yemen

In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) provided life-saving medical and healthcare services to 12.6 million Yemenis – 62 percent of last year’s Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP).

The World Health Organization (WHO) is sustaining an integrated response in these priority areas: 1) coordinating the national Health Cluster; 2) keeping therapeutic feeding centres (TFCs) operational; 3) strengthening disease surveillance; 4) responding to all infectious disease outbreaks; 5) supporting health care facilities and services; 6) controlling vector-borne, water-borne, and  neglected tropical diseases; 7) fighting chronic diseases including diabetes, renal diseases, and cancer; 8) maintaining water, sanitation and hygiene services (WASH) to strengthening infection prevention and control measures in hospitals; 9) supporting and improving maternal and newborn health care; and 10) responding to a neglected mental health crisis.
WHO follows an integrated and sustainable health approach focused on ensuring continuous access to health for all vulnerable people, while also strengthening the capacities and efficiencies of the national health system and Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP) in Yemen with sustainable solutions.
These solutions include but are not limited to the rehabilitation of health facilities; the establishment of units and laboratories that the Yemeni health system lacks; the establishment of a disease outbreak surveillance system, a health information management system, and much more.

Title: The ILO and Yemen’s development fund pledge to further promote decent work for the most vulnerable
Content: 18 January 2023
A new agreement will see increased cooperation on generating labour market data, creating short term decent jobs, and promoting social protection and gender inclusion.
SANAA (ILO News) - The International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Yemen’s Social Fund for Development (SFD) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to increase collaboration on promoting decent work in the country.
The agreement, signed by the ILO’s Regional Director for Arab States Ruba Jaradat and SFD Managing Director Abdullah Al-Dailami, aims to formalize joint work by the two agencies in key areas to foster job creation and gender inclusion and to generate labour market data.

“The ILO already has a long history of successful collaboration with Yemen’s Social Fund for Development, and we are delighted to enter into this new partnership with the SFD in order to promote decent work for some of the country’s most vulnerable communities,” said ILO Regional Director Jaradat. “We will jointly focus on generating much-needed employment opportunities, as well as reliable data on Yemen’s labour market in order to guide the development of robust and effective employment strategies and plans.”

"It is our pleasure to launch a new phase of technical cooperation between the Social Fund for Development and the ILO in several areas of social development,” said SFD Managing Director al-Dailami. “The cooperation will focus on enhancing decent work opportunities, especially for women, as well as enhancing occupational safety and health, vocational training and community contracting. It will include updating and refining relevant work manuals which will enable both parties to use SFD's rich experience and ILO's standards for benefiting vulnerable populations and poverty alleviation actors at the national and international level."

Future joint activities under the new agreement are expected to include conducting a labour force survey in Yemen in collaboration with other relevant authorities, and developing social protection schemes for public works programmes. Furthermore, activities will focus on supporting the SFD in integrating Employment-Intensive Investment Programme (EIIP) approaches into its existing cash-for-work or cash-for-assistance projects, as well as into SFD guidelines and tools, including those relating to Occupational Safety and Health. It will also build the business and management capacities of women community contractors and increase their participation in SFD projects.
EIIP approaches aim to create short-term decent jobs through projects that create assets, renovate and rehabilitate infrastructure systems, and promote environmental sustainability.

At the outset of January 2023, the ILO and SFD entered into a new cooperation area to enhance the working skills and employability of more than 600 vulnerable Yemeni men and women, to enable them to better cope with the crisis and enhance their resilience.

Prior to that, the two organizations worked on promoting an entrepreneurship culture among Yemeni youth and women, building the capacity of national institutions and training service providers in business development, microfinance and self-employment initiatives.

The new phase of cooperation ushered in by the MoU will end in December 2023.

Title: One-fifty houses are handed over under the “Adequate Housing” project in Aden
Content: 29 November 2022
Aiming to improve the living conditions of families in Aden, Yemen, UN-Habitat, in partnership with the Saudi Development and Reconstruction Programme for Yemen (SDRPY) and Alwaleed Philanthropies (AP), rehabilitated the houses of 150 families in the last two years.
Aden, Yemen, 29 November 2022 – Aiming to improve the living conditions of families in Aden, Yemen, UN-Habitat, in partnership with the Saudi Development and Reconstruction Programme for Yemen (SDRPY) and Alwaleed Philanthropies (AP), rehabilitated the houses of 150 families in the last two years.
The houses were handed over in a ceremony attended by Eng. Ali Ahmed Hassan, the Deputy Minister of Public Works and Highways, Eng. Ahmed Al Madkhali, Head of SDPYR Aden Office, Erfan Ali, UN-Habitat Regional Representative for the Arab States, and Diego Zorrilla, Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator.
“The handover of 150 houses today under the rehabilitation project returns the smile and hope of our citizens. We hope for the acceleration of implementing future phases to alleviate the suffering of our citizens,” Eng. Ali Ahmed Hassan stated in the ceremony.
The “Adequate Housing” project aims at improving the living conditions of low-income families in Aden, Yemen, through ensuring that their housing is safe, secure and designed to resist hazards.
"The developmental and economic support, through SDRPY, comes under direct guidance and care by the Custodian of the two Holy Mosques King Salman Bin Abdulaziz and His Royal Highness, the crown prince, with constant follow up by the Programme Director, Ambassador Mohamed Bin Saeed Al-Jaber, to improve the lives of the Yemeni people,” Eng. Ahmed Madkhali said. “The project is a product of a partnership between SDRPY, UN-Habitat and AP, following extensive efforts to improve the lives of our Yemeni brothers and sisters and to improve the living conditions of low-income Yemeni families.”
Over 4,000 people are set to benefit from this project after the rehabilitation of a targeted number of 600 low-income housing units in Aden.
“Rehabilitation of damaged houses allows Yemenis women, men and children of all ages to be as independent as possible in everyday activities, enabling participation in education, work, recreation, and meaningful life roles, such as taking care of family,” Dr. Erfan Ali commented.
The project also aims to enhance the capacity of Yemeni engineers and provide unemployed youth with vocational training. A partnership with the University of Aden resulted in the training of forty engineers from the Ministry of Public Works and Highways in the area of project management for construction.
Vocational training on skills such as carpentry and electrical installation is also provided for unemployed youth from targeted districts.

SDRPY have previously implemented 224 initiatives and projects throughout Yemeni governorates, focusing on 7 main areas. Education, health, water, energy, transportation, agriculture, fisheries and capacity building for governmental entities, in addition to development programmes.

Alwaleed Philanthropies
Over four decades, Alwaleed Philanthropies has supported and spent more than 4.4 billion dollars on social welfare and initiated more than 1000 projects in over +189 countries, managed by 10 Saudi female members, reaching more than 1 billion beneficiaries around the world, regardless of gender, race, or religion. Alwaleed Philanthropies collaborates with a range of philanthropic, governmental, and nongovernmental to combat poverty, empower women and youth, develop communities, provide disaster relief, and create cultural understanding through education. It seeks to build bridges for a more compassionate, tolerant, and accepting world.

Title: FAO Yemen Marks World Food Day with Pledge to Support Efficient, Inclusive, Resilient and Sustainable Agrifood Systems
Content: 19 October 2022
17 October 2021, Sana’a  – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Yemen today joined the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Fisheries (MAIF) in celebrating the World Food Day at an event held in  Aden.

The event is one in a series with others scheduled for Sana’a, Taiz and Mukalla within the coming few days. This year’s World Food Day is celebrated under the theme: Leave No One Behind and today’s event bore testimony to this as it was attended by various people including staff from FAO and MIAF, farmers, pastoralists, agro-pastoralists, beekeepers and fisher folks.
The FAO Representative in Yemen, Dr Hussein Gadain, in a message that was screened at the venue, said this year’s World Food Day comes at a time when the world faces several challenges including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts, climate change and rising food prices.
“Our aim is to work with farmers who dedicate time and energy to produce food, the livestock owners, the fisher folks, the poultry breeders, the market sellers and all the people who play a part to ensure that food is in our plates. We work with all and Leave No One Behind.
“We work to reduce malnutrition and food insecurity in Yemen through efficient, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable agrifood systems. We are committed to ensure better nutrition and food security, which is linked to sustainable production and decent livelihoods,” said Dr Gadain.
The FAO representative added that FAO is implementing bold, scaled, and collaborative actions.
“These actions are significantly improving food security conditions of rural families affected by the conflict and climate change shocks. We are building a sustainable environment where everyone, everywhere in Yemen, will have regular access to enough nutritious foods,” added Dr Gadain.
The venue was a hive of activity as farmers, pastoralists, agro-pastoralists, beekeepers and fisher folks were proudly displaying their products and equipment. These products and equipment are a result of their participation in some FAO interventions. These include sprayers to manage and control desert locust and drip irrigation equipment. Livestock farmers were also displaying tools and equipment used in dairy processing and  animal fattening.
There were pheromone traps on display and these are used in the management of the ferocious fall armyworm (FAW). Also, on display were systems that ensure availability of near real time data in support of early warning for early action. Beekeepers were also displaying their products, showing the recent interventions in the honey value chain.
The products on exhibition represent the wide array of the emergency, resilience, and development-focused interventions implemented by FAO in Yemen. These interventions are made possible through the generous support of our donors and partners.

Note to the media on the UN plan to prevent an oil spill from the FSO Safer
The United Nations official leading the organization’s efforts on the FSO Safer said today that donors have generously pledged all of the $75 million required for the emergency operation to transfer oil from the decaying supertanker to a safe vessel.
The United Nations official leading the organization’s efforts on the FSO Safer said today that donors have generously pledged all of the $75 million required for the emergency operation to transfer oil from the decaying supertanker to a safe vessel.
The official, David Gressly, who is the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, was speaking at a high-level event on the Safer co-chaired by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the United States of America, and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Mr. Gressly said reaching the amount needed to implement the emergency operation was a fantastic milestone. It followed the Netherlands announcement that it would increase its pledge to $15 million from $7.5 million.
To begin work on the emergency operation as soon as possible the United Nations needs donors to convert all of the pledges to cash. As of 18 September, $59 million has been disbursed or was in the process of being disbursed. Mr. Gressly said he was hopeful the remaining undisbursed pledges would be converted to cash very soon.
The UN also needs a further $38 million to finish the job with the installation of safe long-term replacement capacity for the Safer.
The revised budget for the two-track plan is $113 million, comprising $75 million for the emergency operation and $38 million to replace the Safer capacity.
The original budget was reduced by $31 million largely because of the adoption of a double-hull vessel tethered to a catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM) buoy system as the safe long-term solution. The system is the fastest to implement and most flexible of the three long-term replacement options that were considered.
During the event, Mr. Gressly also thanked the public for contributing $200,000 to the UN plan through crowdfunding and for raising awareness about the Safer.  He thanked the multinational  HSA Group, which was the first private entity to provide a contribution and said that he looked forward to further donations from the private sector.
ENDS

The co-hosts of the event said the following:
The Netherlands
“Normally, as minister, it’s my job to deal with the repercussions of disasters. But in this instance we have a chance to prevent a disaster. The Safer is a ticking timebomb. We need swift action.”
United States
"We are proud that the United States pledged $10 million for the UN Safer project.  Our contribution stands alongside contributions from a range of countries, organizations, and individuals across the globe, representing a broad coalition of partners that understands the importance of preventing an economic and environmental catastrophe from the Safer tanker."
Germany
“Thanks to our continued joint efforts, we have a rare opportunity here, to tell a story not often told: the story of how we prevented a catastrophe! With its contribution of 12 million, Germany significantly contributes to this accomplishment. If all parties to the conflict stick to the agreement made to rescue the FSO Safer and the operation is successful, the FSO Safer can go from being a symbol of impending disaster to a beacon of hope for Yemen!”

Title: World Humanitarian Day 2022
Content: 19 August 2022
In Yemen, humanitarian workers save lives every day
Sana’a, 19 August 2022 – Each year, the United Nations and aid agencies mark World Humanitarian Day on 19 August to advocate for the survival, well-being and dignity of people affected by crises, and for the safety and security of aid workers. On this World Humanitarian Day, we recognize that just as it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a whole community to help people in need.
Aid workers in Yemen – more than 95 per cent of whom are Yemenis – ensure that 12.6 million people on average receive humanitarian assistance or protection support every month. But they operate in an extremely challenging environment. They are too often subjected to threats to their safety and well-being, even as they work to save lives and reduce suffering every day.
This year has seen an alarming increase in attacks on aid workers in Yemen. The first half of 2022 saw an aid worker killed, two injured, seven kidnapped and nine detained. There were 27 incidents of threat and intimidation between January and June, compared with 17 such incidents recorded all of last year. There were also 28 carjacking incidents recorded in the first six months of the year, 17 more than in 2021. Twenty-seven attacks against aid organizations’ premises and facilities – including the looting of humanitarian supplies and other assets – were recorded in the first half of 2022, also more than in the whole of 2021.
In recent months, aid workers have been targets of disinformation and incitement, including false allegations that they corrupt Yemeni values, including the morals of young women. Such baseless allegations jeopardize the safety and security of humanitarian workers, especially Yemeni female aid workers at a time when women and girls are experiencing increased levels of violence and a rollback of their rights in many parts of the globe.
“Violence and threats against humanitarian workers undermine the delivery of aid, further jeopardizing the lives of those most in need,” said the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly. “Aid workers in Yemen deserve to be celebrated for their selfless dedication.”
While the UN-brokered truce has provided tangible relief to civilians since going into effect in April and deserves full backing, more than seven years of conflict and economic collapse continue to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. More than 23 million people need some form of humanitarian assistance or protection. The number of people that are food insecure is projected to increase to 19 million by December. The malnutrition rate among women and children is among the highest in the world and a third of the 4.3 million internally displaced people in Yemen continue to live under dire conditions. Without the tireless commitment of humanitarians in Yemen, the situation would be far worse.
“Aid workers in Yemen remain unwavering in their mission. These selfless women and men continue to step up to every day, providing millions of people in need with food and cash, health services and clean water, protection and emergency education,” Mr. Gressly said. “We should all do everything we can to protect them and support their critical work.”

Title: UNESCO Collaborates with Qatar National Library for Plans to Launch Yemeni Documentary Heritage Exhibition
Content: 14 August 2022


Doha, Qatar – 11 August 2022 –  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) signed a Letter of Intent with Qatar National Library on 10 August 2022 to collaboratively organize an exhibition to showcase Yemeni documentary heritage, planned to take place from May to July 2023.
The exhibition, supported by the UNESCO office for the Gulf States and Yemen, will be built on the Library’s rich photography and manuscripts collection from Yemen and aims to raise awareness of the importance of protecting and preserving it.

On the occasion, Tan Huism, Executive Director at Qatar National Library said, “We are pleased to collaborate with UNESCO to offer the public an opportunity to learn about Yemeni culture and heritage. The Library plays a significant role in increasing awareness and appreciation of local and regional heritage and has also been providing global access to knowledge across regional and international fronts.”
“With a treasure trove of some of the rarest and most valuable historical images and manuscripts from Yemen, we believe the exhibition will be a wonderful way for our communities to explore and engage with the cultural wealth of the country. The agreement is also an example of the Library’s efforts in raising awareness around the need for greater protection of the region’s documentary heritage,” she added.
“We are happy to pursue our longstanding partnership with Qatar National Library through the organization of this exhibition, which will shed light on the importance of preserving and protecting Yemeni documentary heritage. Today, more than ever, documentary heritage institutions in Yemen need support and funding to ensure the preservation of their extraordinary cultural heritage that is under increasing risk. We hope through this project, to raise awareness about the richness of the Yemeni heritage and highlight the importance and urgency of supporting initiatives that will have a direct impact on the preservation of documentary heritage,”
Salah Khaled, Director of the UNESCO Office for Gulf States and Yemen
UNESCO Gulf States and Yemen office and The Library continue to explore regional and international collaborations to continue their role in
sharing the cultural legacy of the Arab world and providing people with a wide variety of
informative and educational content.

Content: 18 June 2022
Aden, June 18, 2022 – With support from the Government of Japan, UNOPS delivered eight mobile clinics to the Ministry of Public Health and Population in  Aden.
Aden, June 18, 2022 – With support from the Government of Japan, UNOPS delivered eight mobile clinics to the Ministry of Public Health and Population in  Aden.
Funded by the Government of Japan, the project “Urgent Support to Health Services through the Provision of Mobile Clinics in Yemen,” focused on increasing access to healthcare through enhancing the operational capacity and resilience of the Ministry of Public Health and Population in Aden and southern governorates. It is envisaged that the additional mobile clinics will support provision of essential health services, including urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to 50,000 people, 47% of whom are females. In addition to the provision of the mobile clinics, through this project, UNOPS provided training to the health workers on operations and maintenance procedures for the clinics.
Appreciating the value of the initiative, the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Public Health and Population, Dr. Ahmed Al-Kamal said: “Today, we receive the mobile clinics provided by the people and Government of Japan and we extend our appreciation to them. The mobile clinics will provide a big service to the Yemeni people in the areas where healtcare services are not available. The mobile clinics could be considered mini-hospitals''
“The complexity of the crisis in Yemen in recent years, combined with the effects of the global pandemic, have seriously affected the living conditions of Yemeni communities and their access to essential social services, including health. As a result of our partnerships with Japan, the mobile clinics that UNOPS deliverd today will further enhance the Ministry’s capacity to reach  the communities in Aden and the southern governorates, and deliver the much needed access to quality health care,” said Muhammad Usman Akram, Director of UNOPS Multi-Country Office in Amman.

Title: Statement: UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, David Gressly, opening remarks at the Sana’a Center online briefing on the UN-coordinated plan to address the threat of the FSO Safer 13 June 2022
Content: 13 June 2022
I would like to thank you and the Sana’a Center for the opportunity to reach out to all of the media that’s online. And I look forward to answering questions as we go forward this afternoon. I would like to start off with just a brief outline of the overall plan that we have in place and then talk about the resource requirements, which is the critical piece that we’re facing right now.
Statement
UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, David Gressly, opening remarks at the Sana’a Center online briefing on the UN-coordinated plan to address the threat of the FSO Safer
13 June 2022
Well, Spencer, thank you very much. It’s really great to be here. I would like to thank you and the Sana’a Center for the opportunity to reach out to all of the media that’s online. And I look forward to answering questions as we go forward this afternoon. I would like to start off with just a brief outline of the overall plan that we have in place and then talk about the resource requirements, which is the critical piece that we’re facing right now.
We do have an operational plan that has the confirmed commitment from the authorities here in Sana’a and, equally important, the government of Yemen. In fact, we just had consultations on that today, in both Sana’a and Aden to reconfirm that. So this plan is well endorsed in terms of the overall approach.
So that was an important step to get this operation going. We are very far advanced on procurement of the salvage operation and vessel procurement for transferring the oil.
So we’re basically pretty ready to go. We have about $144 million we need to carry the whole operation through in two stages – an initial emergency operation just to get the oil out of the current Safer tanker into a secure vessel and then a longer term, second stage to replace the existing capacity that the current FSO vessel represents.
Frankly speaking, the primary constraint we face is no longer really political, security, procurement or operational. It’s resources. And that’s really why I want to highlight that aspect today. And so we’ve made an appeal in the Netherlands back in May where we raised about $33 million.
We need $80 million to start this operation – to do the emergency phase. We need the additional $64 million, approximately, to complete the second stage. So we have the $33 million plus roughly $5 million-$6 million that we already had in hand. We were roughly in the $40 million range and I want to thank the donors that made those initial pledges because that was extremely important to get this resource mobilization initiative underway.
Specifically, I would like to highlight the role that the Netherlands has played in not only making a significant contribution, but in the continued outreach to other member states to support. Germany, which has made a very significant contribution. The United Kingdom, European Union, Qatar, Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Switzerland, and Luxemberg have all made [pledges or] contributions that have carried us to this point. And, most recently, both the United States as well as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have pledged an additional $10 million each, which gets us to about the $60 million threshold of the initial $80 million that we need to raise to start the operation.
Our discussions with other donors for the second stage are well underway. So we’re optimistic that we’ll raise the funding for both stages in an appropriate time. But let’s focus on where we are today and how we can close the current gap. And that’s really what I want to highlight because we’re launching a social media fundraising campaign that will open tomorrow [14 June]. It’s important that we get the word out to the public that we really need to get this funding going.
So, we do have for the [emergency operation] about a $20 million gap and we really need to raise that as soon as possible. We’re still in a good period for the operation, but by the time we get to October, November, the environment to carry out the operation becomes more difficult. More importantly, it’s because of the nature of the winds and currents that increase the chances that this vessel, which is old and decaying, will break up. That would be the highest time of risk in in fact. So, we really want to get this going quickly.
We’re trying to get to this $80 million figure by the end of this month, it’s doable, but it’s going to take a push and that’s why we’re calling on the public to help us to cross the finish line to get that first $80 million in place.
$20 million is really not much when you look at the overall cost that this catastrophe would have. If indeed there were a spill, the estimates that we’ve received on the cleanup alone would be $20 billion. A $20 million additional investment today to save $20 billion seems like a very easy business case to make. A return of $1,000 on every dollar invested. But that $20 billion is just the cleanup cost. It doesn’t count the other costs that will affect the region.
The disruption to international shipping would have a major cost – costing huge amounts on a daily basis. We saw that with the recent incident of the Ever Given when it ran aground – how that impacted. That potential is there. If there’s sufficient pollution in the shipping lanes that could have a significant impact. It will certainly have a significant impact on the ecosystems. The Red Sea is known for its pristine environments, which would no longer be pristine after such a spill. The reefs and the mangroves across the Red Sea could be affected. It might take as much as 25 years to restock the fisheries.
Any country along the Red Sea could be affected. It would depend on the currents and winds at the time of the spill. That would determine which countries, but that means all countries are currently at risk. Tourism on the Red Sea would be affected. Desalination plants would be affected. It would affect not only the Arabian peninsula coastline of the Sed Sea, but also the African coastline.
But of course, Yemen, currently in conflict, would be the most affected.
Fishing communities would be devastated with maybe as many as 200,000 jobs wiped out overnight. This industry supports over 2 million people, directly or indirectly. Whole families would be exposed to pollutants. Millions of people would be forced to breathe more polluted air. The ports of Hudeidah and Saleef would be closed. These are the ports that supply the majority of Yemenis with food, whether commercial or humanitarian assistance, but also fuel and other life-saving commodities. 17 million Yemenis are already uncertain where their next meal will come from, even in the current circumstances with the ports open.
There’s too much at stake to allow this to happen. And we’re so close. We just need to bridge that gap and we can start this operation. As I said earlier, we need about $144 million to carry the whole operation through. We need $80 million to start it, to get the emergency operation done, and then we’ll work on the long-term replacement capacity.
As I mentioned at the beginning, the political will is there. We reconfirm that periodically. They’re anxious in fact that we start. We don’t see any real obstacle to move ahead from that front. We just need the funding, as I keep saying. We’re close, but we're not there. Every day that goes by is another day that we take a risk, a chance that this vessel will break up and the catastrophe that I described will unfold.
We need to take action. As I mentioned earlier, as we get into October, November, December, the odds of that happening will be significantly higher. So we’re running out of time.
That’s why today I’m announcing a social media fundraising campaign to help us close the gap. We’re asking the global public and not just member states – the global public to crowdfund a quarter of the remaining gap. That would be $5 million for this emergency operation. $5 million is an ambitious goal for this kind of campaign, but, given the stakes, I think it is one that we should strive for.
Importantly, every dollar that the public puts forward in this operation sends a message to all other member states and private companies, foundations that have not yet contributed or could contribute that they also need to act now before it’s too late.
The campaign will be located on the UN website at un.org/StopRedSeaSpill.
That’s fairly obvious. It will be hosted by the global United Nations website. Or it will also be accessible through the UN Foundation where there is a donation page hosted. So you can either access the donations through the global UN website or go directly to the UN Foundation and make your contribution directly there.
I’m basically appealing to the public as well as member states to help us close this gap, start this operation, and save a catastrophe that is not just a probability or possibility, but a certainty if we do not act. It’s not only a question of when. It’s not a question of if. Let’s get it done now, if we can.
Thank you very much for your time, your attention and your support. Thank you.

Title: UN-Netherlands press release on FSO Safer pledging event
Content: 11 May 2022
Pledging event raises $33 million to address threat of massive oil spill in Red Sea
More funding is still urgently needed to start emergency operation to remove oil from the FSO Safer
The Hague, 11 May 2022 – The Government of the Netherlands and the United Nations co-hosted a pledging event in The Hague today where donors pledged US$33 million in new funding for the UN-coordinated operational plan to address the threat of a major oil spill from the FSO Safer.
There is now $40 million available for the operation, which includes previously committed funds. The decaying oil tanker is moored off the coast of Yemen and holds four times the amount of oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez. It could break apart or explode at any time.
The conference marked the start in the effort to raise the $144 million that the plan requires, including $80 million for an emergency operation to transfer the oil to a safe temporary vessel. Also critical to the plan’s success is the installation of a long-term replacement capacity.
“Today has been an important step forward in eliminating the threat posed by the FSO Safer. In today’s pledging event, we managed to collect a sizeable amount. We will continue to support the UN in the month of May to gather the remaining funds needed. Many countries are showing great interest to join the effort. I am hopeful we will get there,” said Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands Liesje Schreinemacher. The Netherlands pledged almost $8 million. The other donors signing pledging commitments were Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Qatar, Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Switzerland and Luxembourg.
The result of a major spill would be a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe and cost the region tens of billions of dollars in cleanup and economic costs. More than 200,000 Yemenis in the fishing industry could lose their livelihoods overnight, tourism would be affected as far away as Egypt and shipping could be disrupted through the Bab al-Mandab straight and the Suez canal. The environmental damage in the Red Sea and its coastlines would be severe. Minister of Foreign Trade of the Netherlands Wopke Hoekstra said: “Together, we can prevent one of the largest environmental disasters in history and save lives. Cleaning up a disaster caused by the FSO Safer would cost an estimated $20 billion. Preventing it will cost only $144 million. It’s a very simple business case. But it does require us to act.”
“We are grateful to the donors that committed funding today at very short notice and look forward to receiving further commitments from those that have not yet pledged. When we have the funding, the work can begin,” said David Gressly, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “Today marks a strong launch of our efforts to ensure the project’s success, including outreach to the private sector. We need to work quickly to get the remaining funds to start the four-month operation in the weather window we have ahead of us,”
The planned operation comprises the installation of a replacement vessel or equivalent capacity and the emergency operation to transfer the oil to a safe temporary vessel. The plan would cover the salaries of a crew to maintain the leased temporary vessel until the long-term solution is implemented.
“The timing and funding are both critical. If we do not receive sufficient funding urgently, the weather window to transfer the oil will close. By October, high winds and volatile currents make the operation more dangerous and increase the risk of the ship breaking up,” said Auke Lootsma, UNDP Yemen Resident Representative.
Background for editors
In September, the United Nations’ senior management instructed Mr. Gressly to provide UN system-wide leadership on the FSO Safer and coordinate all efforts to mitigate the threat. He continues to engage in discussions with a wide range of stakeholders on the operational plan to resolve the threat while supporting work to strengthen contingency plans in the event of a catastrophic oil leak.
Constructed in 1976 as an oil tanker and converted a decade later to be a floating storage facility for oil, the FSO Safer is moored about 4.8 nautical miles off the coast of Hodeidah governorate. The 376-metre-long vessel contains more than one million barrels of light crude oil – four times the amount spilled by the Exxon Valdez. With no maintenance operations undertaken on the Safer since 2015 due to the conflict, its structural integrity has significantly deteriorated and the vessel is at imminent risk of spilling oil due to leakages or an explosion.
A significant spill would quickly surpass national capacity and resources to mount an effective spill response. The result would be catastrophic, devastating the Yemen coast, destroying livelihoods and likely forcing a closure of the ports of Al Hodeidah and As Salif - which are essential for the importation of commercial imports and life-saving humanitarian assistance. Depending on the season and prevailing wind and currents, the environmental impact would also affect Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia, and could disrupt vital shipping through the Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Red Sea.

Content: 03 April 2022
Sanaa– April 3, 2022 -
With the support from the Federal Republic of Germany, through the KfW Development Bank, UNOPS handed over Al Sabeen Hospital in Sanaa. The hospital is one of 19 health facilities and 21 isolation units that are being rehabilitated as part of the “Strengthening Resilience through enhancing Health Service Facilities in Yemen” project.
The project aims at supporting the local health service providers and local communities in increasing access to primary and secondary health facilities. Through restoring the physical infrastructure of the targeted health facilities, providing medical equipment and furniture, and building the capacity of the health staff, UNOPS contributes to the health sector in Yemen for improved healthcare services to the targeted populations.
Mr. Marc Engelhardt, Head of the Middle East Department at KfW Development Bank highlighted the strong partnership between KfW and UNOPS in the implementation of the project. He appreciated that over 130,000 patients will benefit annually from the improved health infrastructure and thanked UNOPS for the successful completion of the rehabilitation works.
Mr. Muhammad Usman Akram, UNOPS Director of Amman Multi-Country Office, said: “The handover of Al Sabeen hospital is another milestone intervention in support of the health sector in Yemen. Thanks to our partnership with the Government of Germany and the KfW, Al Sabeen hospital is better equipped and in a much better position to continue the provision of critical healthcare to Yemeni mothers and their children.”
“Strengthening Resilience through Enhancing Health Service Facilities in Yemen” project is funded by the German Government through KfW. The project aims at strengthening the resilience of the supported health facilities and the targeted communities by providing sustainable access to healthcare services. The project is aligned with the Health Cluster objectives of the 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, mainly, to enhance local referral health system by supporting selected tertiary health facilities in targeted communities; increase access to targeted communities to primary and secondary health care services; and, help ensure that health facilities in priority districts are able to respond to epidemics and outbreaks.
The project supports Sustainable Development Goal 3 - “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”.

Title: UNDP Partnership with European Union and Sweden: Supporting Livelihoods, Food Security,  and Climate Adaptation in Yemen
Content: 28 March 2022
Funded by EU & Sida, The Supporting Resilient Livelihoods, Food Security and Climate Adaptation in Yemen Joint Programme (ERRY III) is a 3 - year programme jointly implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and World Food Programme (WFP).The Joint programme aims to reduce vulnerability and strengthen resilience of crisis- affected communities in Yemen through creating sustainable livelihoods as well as improving resilience, food security and access to basic services in five vulnerable governorates in Yemen: Hajjah, Hodeidah, Lahj, Abyan, Taiz.
Sana’a, Yemen – The European Union (EU) and Sweden's International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) have contributed new funding totaling US$ 49.37 million to boost resilience, livelihoods, food security, and climate adaptation in Yemen. The recently signed agreement to support the third phase of the Supporting Resilient Livelihoods, Food Security and Climate Adaption in Yemen - Joint Programme (ERRY III) covers a three-year period starting in March 2022.
The programme aims to enhance capacity of crisis-affected communities to manage local risks and shocks for increased resilience and self-reliance. Specifically, it will target the most vulnerable community groups, including women, the unemployed, youth, marginalized minority groups, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and stressed host communities.
“The European Union believes in the future of Yemen and in the ability of Yemenis to build resilience and pathways towards sustainable development even during the ongoing conflict,” said the EU Ambassador to Yemen Gabriel Munuera Viñals. “With the additional funding, the European Union contributes to investing in Yemen’s future while supporting people in Yemen to address immediate challenges.”
The programme will potentially reach nearly 847,000 direct beneficiaries and will be implemented jointly by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the World Food Programme (WFP).
“It is critical to support communities throughout Yemen in local development to strengthen their resilience towards external shocks such as the conflict and the economic crisis,” said the Head of the Regional Development Cooperation at the Sweden Embassy in Amman, Ms. Maria Selin. Through ERRY III, we will work with UNDP, FAO, ILO, and WFP so that women, youth, and men have enhanced opportunities to access sustainable livelihoods and job opportunities through climate sensitive programming.”
Considering the social and cultural barriers rural women face in Yemen, the ERRY III activities will also focus on strengthening women's economic empowerment, including women at all stages of implementation, and addressing the specific needs and opportunities for women.
“The new phase of the ERRY joint programme builds upon the success of Phase II, a successful three-year programme that was also funded by EU and Sida. The programme significantly enhanced resilience, food security, and livelihood for over 740,000 vulnerable people in Abyan, Hajjah, Hodiedah, Lahj, and Taiz governorates,” explains Auke Lootsma, UNDP Resident Representative in Yemen. “These services are critical to reduce vulnerability and strengthened resilience of crisis affected rural communities in Yemen through the creation of sustainable livelihoods and improving access to basic services.”
The UN agencies will work together to ensure that community institutions are strengthened, and their capacity is developed around the following focus areas: a. Gender sensitive resilience planning, conflict resolution, and social cohesion. b. Vulnerable communities’ benefit from equal access to clean energy solutions, environmental protection, and climate adaptive capacity in sustainable manner. c. Sustainable livelihoods of women and men created through improved production, food security and income opportunities.

Title: Yemen: UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator welcomes progress on FSO Safer proposal
Content: 05 February 2022
Amman, 5 February 2022 – The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, held constructive meetings last week on the UN-coordinated proposal to mitigate the threat posed by the aging floating storage and offloading unit, FSO Safer, moored off the coast of Al Hodeidah.
During meetings with the Government of Yemen in Aden, Mr. Gressly discussed the proposal with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Transport, and the Safer Emergency Committee. “In our very positive discussions, the Government officials confirmed that they support the UN-coordinated proposal to shift the million barrels of oil onboard the vessel to another ship,” said Mr. Gressly, “They want to see the threat mitigated as soon as possible.”
“I also held very constructive discussions on 29 January with senior representatives of the Sana’a authorities on the FSO Safer,” said Mr. Gressly. “They stressed their concern over the environmental and humanitarian risk posed by the tanker and their wish to see rapid action to resolve the problem. They also agreed in principle on how to move forward with the UN-coordinated proposal.
There is strong commitment from the leadership to see this project implemented.”
“I am also engaging in a broader conversation with interested member states whose support will be crucial to realize the project. The risk of imminent catastrophe is very real. We need to translate the good will being shown by all interlocuters into action as soon as possible.”

UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator welcomes progress on FSO Safer proposal
Amman, 5 February 2022 – The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, held constructive meetings last week on the UN-coordinated proposal to mitigate the threat posed by the aging floating storage and offloading unit, FSO Safer, moored off the coast of Al Hodeidah.
UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator welcomes progress on FSO Safer proposal
Amman, 5 February 2022 – The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, held constructive meetings last week on the UN-coordinated proposal to mitigate the threat posed by the aging floating storage and offloading unit, FSO Safer, moored off the coast of Al Hodeidah.
During meetings with the Government of Yemen in Aden, Mr. Gressly discussed the proposal with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Transport, and the Safer Emergency Committee. “In our very positive discussions, the Government officials confirmed that they support the UN-coordinated proposal to shift the million barrels of oil onboard the vessel to another ship,” said Mr. Gressly, “They want to see the threat mitigated as soon as possible.”
“I also held very constructive discussions on 29 January with senior representatives of the Sana’a authorities on the FSO Safer,” said Mr. Gressly. “They stressed their concern over the environmental and humanitarian risk posed by the tanker and their wish to see rapid action to resolve the problem. They also agreed in principle on how to move forward with the UN-coordinated proposal. There is strong commitment from the leadership to see this project implemented.”
“I am also engaging in a broader conversation with interested member states whose support will be crucial to realize the project. The risk of imminent catastrophe is very real. We need to translate the good will being shown by all interlocuters into action as soon as possible.”

Background for editors
In September, the United Nations’ senior management instructed Mr. Gressly to provide UN system-wide leadership on the FSO Safer and coordinate all efforts to mitigate the threat. He has been engaging in discussions with a wide range of stakeholders on the new initiative to resolve the threat while supporting work to strengthen contingency plans in the event of a catastrophic oil leak.
Constructed in 1976 as an oil tanker and converted a decade later to be a floating storage facility for oil, the FSO Safer is moored about 4.8 nautical miles off the coast of Al Hodeidah Governorate. The 376-metre-long vessel contains more than one million barrels of light crude oil – four times the amount spilled by the Exxon Valdez. With no maintenance operations undertaken on the Safer since 2015 due to the conflict, its structural integrity has significantly deteriorated and the vessel is at imminent risk of spilling oil due to leakages or an explosion.
A significant spill would quickly surpass national capacity and resources to mount an effective spill response. The result would be catastrophic, devastating the Yemen coast, destroying livelihoods and forcing a closure of the ports of Al Hodeidah and As Salif - which are essential for the importation of commercial imports and life-saving humanitarian assistance. Depending on the season and prevailing wind and currents, the environmental impact would also affect Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia, and could disrupt vital shipping through the Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Red Sea.

Title: Statement by the UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg and the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen David Gressly
Content: 25 January 2022
Amman/Sana’a, 25 January 2021– We are alarmed by the escalating spiral of violence in Yemen that continues to harm civilians and is spilling over its borders. January will almost certainly be a record-shattering month for civilian casualties in Yemen.
We reiterate the United Nations Secretary-General’s condemnation of the air strikes carried out by the Saudiled Coalition on 21 January against a prison facility in Sa'dah where migrants were also held. The airstrikes reportedly killed 91 detainees and injured 226. It is the worst civilian-casualty incident in Yemen in three years.
Over the past few weeks, air strikes and missile attacks have hit hospitals, telecommunication infrastructure, airports, a water facility and a school. There has also been an alarming uptick in attacks against the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that resulted in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.
The scale of the escalation is exacerbating an already severe humanitarian crisis in Yemen, complicating efforts to provide relief, threatening regional security and undermining efforts to bring an end to the conflict.
We remind the parties that being at war does not absolve them of their obligations under international humanitarian law, which strictly prohibits disproportionate attacks and requires that all feasible precautions be taken to avoid civilian harm. We reiterate the importance of accountability for violations of international humanitarian law.
The United Nations has been in contact with all sides to explore options to achieve de-escalation and begin an inclusive dialogue aimed at reaching a negotiated political settlement that comprehensively ends the conflict.
We urge all parties to engage with these efforts immediately and without preconditions. We call upon them to prioritize the needs and interests of the Yemeni people.

Title: Office of the Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: Statement on communications equipment for Sana'a international airport
Content: 31 December 2021
Sana'a, 31 December 2021 – The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, made the following statement today:
Sana'a international airport is critical for aid operations in the north of Yemen.
Although closed to regular civilian flights since 2016, the United Nations and other humanitarian actors rely on the airport to fly in aid workers and supplies that help deliver life-saving assistance to millions of people every month.
Closure of the airport to humanitarian flights severely undermines aid operations, and I remain deeply concerned about any further disruptions.
Following the airport closure by the authorities in Sana'a on 19 December and airstrikes the following night, a UN team visited the airport on 21 December and determined that it remains operational for emergency use.
Humanitarian flights are emergency in nature. I call on the authorities in Sana'a to refrain from suspending humanitarian flights in the future, even for technical reasons, without advance consultations and mutual agreement with the United Nations. The temporary reopening of the airport on 27 December was a positive development.
Humanitarian flights should also operate under the maximum possible safety and security conditions. The communications equipment at Sana'a airport has had technical issues. Over the past 18 months, UN humanitarian flight crews have reported at least 10 instances in which they were unable to contact the air control tower at Sana'a airport or had unclear communications – a potentially dangerous situation. The Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority (CAMA) in Sana'a deems the equipment obsolete.
CAMA purchased new equipment for the control tower in 2019, which the United Nations agreed to fly into Sana'a airport. But the Saudi-led Coalition's Evacuation and Humanitarian Operations Committee (EHOC) has not authorized the transfer, despite several requests from the United Nations, citing the need for Government of Yemen approval.
To ensure maximum safety and reliability for humanitarian flights, I am urgently calling on the Government of Yemen to authorize the import of the equipment, the contents of which were verified by EHOC in December 2021. The equipment is needed to ensure the safe use of Sana'a airport for humanitarian flights and, by extension, the continuation of the aid operation in Yemen

Title: Japan Renews Support to Improve Life-Saving Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Services in Yemen
Content: 29 December 2021
Aden, Yemen – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) welcomes a US$ 1.2 million contribution from the Government of Japan to establish a new project, Emergency Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Support for Crisis Affected Communities in Hadramout.
Amid ongoing violent conflict, increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather systems have resulted in widespread damage and destruction to WASH infrastructure across Hadramout. As a consequence, communities are suffering from the increased risk of disease outbreak due to poor waste management. With the continual influx of displaced Yemenis fleeing to Hadramout from frontline conflict, the already damaged systems struggle to adequately serve the growing populations.
The new project will support improved WASH systems in five healthcare centres in Hadramout, including water supply and handwashing services, the rehabilitation of sanitation systems and training and systems development for medical waste management. This support will benefit over 50,000 local residents to access more well-equipped health services.
One of the five centres targeted will be focused on reproductive health, supporting women’s access to safe pre- and post-natal care.
An additional 20,100 Yemenis will benefit from life-saving emergency WASH interventions in communities affected by COVID-19, war and severe weather damage. These interventions will include repairs and/or installation of water and sanitation systems, support for solid waste collection and disposal, and community awareness raising to encourage best practice.
“This new project builds upon existing success from UNDP’s recently completed 3-year WASH project – also funded by Japan – which improved local water and waste management systems and service delivery for over 850,000 people in Aden and Mukalla,” explains Auke Lootsma, UNDP Resident Representative in Yemen. “These services are critical to a sustainable recovery in Yemen, building a healthier foundation for Yemenis to rebuild their lives free from the risk of disease.”
This agreement builds upon a well-established partnership between UNDP and the Government of Japan and reaffirms a joint commitment to serve Yemeni communities, helping to rebuild and achieve a sustainable, peaceful recovery for all.

Title: Yemen: Joint statement by OHCHR and UNESCO on two detained staff members
Content: 28 December 2021
GENEVA (28 December 2021) - The Director General of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, and Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, continue to be deeply concerned for the well-being of two of their staff members who were detained in early November in Sana'a, Yemen. No communication from the UN has been possible with the staff members since that time.
Although the two staff members remain in custody, the UN has not received information about the grounds or legal basis for their detention, or their current status, despite earlier assurances by the Ansar Allah movement (who are also called Houthis) of their immediate release.
OHCHR and UNESCO recall the privileges and immunities accorded to staff of the UN system under international law, which are essential to the proper discharge of their official functions, and call for the staff members' immediate release without any further delays.

Title: WFP forced to cut food assistance in Yemen, warns of impact as hunger rises
Content: 22 December 2021
SANA'A -- The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) warned today that it is running out of funds to continue to provide food assistance to13 million people in Yemen. From January, eight million will receive a reduced food ration, while five million at immediate risk of slipping into famine conditions will remain on a full ration.
The reductions come at the worst possible time for families in Yemen who are dependent on WFP’s food assistance to survive. In the last three months, inadequate food consumption – one measure of hunger tracked by WFP – has risen rapidly to affect half of all families as currency devaluation and hyper-inflation drives the economy to near collapse. Food prices have more than doubled across much of Yemen this year. Meanwhile, fighting across multiple frontlines continues to force families to flee.
"Every time we reduce the amount of food, we know that more people who are already hungry and food insecure will join the ranks of the millions who are starving. But desperate times call for desperate measures and we have to stretch our limited resources and prioritize, focusing on people who are in the most critical state,” said Corinne Fleischer, WFP Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.
With food assistance reductions from January, families will receive barely half of WFP's daily minimum ration. Without new funding, more severe reductions will soon be unavoidable. This could see people cut from food assistance programmes completely. Malnutrition treatment and school feeding for children may also be reduced.
“The Yemeni people are now more vulnerable than ever, reeling from relentless conflict and the deepening economic crisis that has pushed millions into destitution,” said Fleischer. “WFP food stocks in Yemen are running dangerously low at a time when budgets for humanitarian crises around the world are stretched to the limit. We desperately need donors, who were so generous in the past, to work with us to avoid this looming hunger catastrophe.”
Over half the population of Yemen or16.2 million people face acute hunger. Half the children under five (2.3 million) are at risk of malnutrition. WFP needs US$813 million to continue to assist the most vulnerable in Yemen through May. In 2022, WFP needs US$1.97 billion to continue to deliver vital food assistance to families on the brink of famine.

Title: Germany grants US$15.6 million to support displaced and host communities in Yemen
Content: 22 December 2021
Sana’a, 22 December 2021 – The Government of Germany through KfW Development Bank has granted US$15.6 million to UNICEF in support of multi-sectoral interventions to address vulnerabilities of conflict-affected displaced and host communities in Yemen. These interventions, benefiting at least one million people, including over 300,000 children, aim to improve access to water and sanitation services, to create child-friendly and gender-equitable learning spaces and to provide psychosocial support for conflict-affected children and life skills training for conflict-affected adolescents.
As the conflict continues to intensify, an estimated 1.7 million children are internally displaced, many of them suffering from multiple displacements which expose them to greater risks.
Children lack access to basic services and are at risk of violence, exploitation, abuse and trafficking. They often live in overcrowded camps or informal settlements, where access to basic hygiene and health services is limited.
“Children in Yemen need urgent assistance”, says Philippe Duamelle, UNICEF Representative to Yemen. “We are very grateful to the people and the Government of Germany for this important contribution, which will help us bring children the critical support they need for their survival”.
Since 2015, Germany has contributed over US$123 million to UNICEF Yemen to address urgent humanitarian needs. This contribution comes as a boost to the response of UNICEF and partners to the displacement crisis that Yemen is currently facing.

Title: Embarking on a New Professional Journey: Yemenis Receive Small Business Training and Grants
Content: 20 December 2021
Together, the Government of Japan, UNDP and For All Foundation are supporting Yemenis in Aden and Lahj to build new skills and generate stable incomes.
Aden, Yemen, 19 December 2021 -- With funding from the Government of Japan, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and its local partner, For All Foundation (FAF), began the distribution of 1,000 financial grants to Yemenis in Aden and Lahj -- including 500 women. The US$ 800 grants will enable recipients to establish their own small businesses and achieve a sustainable income.
Prior to grant distribution, recipients were employed through cash-for-work to rehabilitate 10 safe spaces in Aden and Lahj, earning critical income that allowed them to purchase necessities for their families. Recipients then participated in business management training, helping build their knowledge in financial planning and asset management.
"Small businesses are the heart of local economy and UNDP supports them to strive and thrive," says Arvind Kumar, UNDP Project Manager. "They also help reduce Yemen's high unemployment rate and provide critical services to communities."
The recipients of the grants will cover a range of service sectors including electrical and home appliance maintenance, fisheries, car mechanics, baking, food-processing, and handloom and textiles.
"This grant will enable me to open a shop where people can arrange the repair of their solar systems or the installation of new ones. The high demand for solar power systems has created new opportunities for sustainable energy and sustainable incomes," says Al Bara'a, a grant recipient.
Throughout the distribution process, all the recipients will have access to psychosocial support sessions to ensure their mental health and well-being and to build the confidence as they embark on a new professional and personal journey.\ \ With funding from the Government of Japan, UNDP's Building Resilient Livelihoods and Improving Protection Services for Conflict Affected Communities in Aden and Lahj (BRISCC) project targets the communities most affected by the ongoing conflict in Aden and Lahj. The key areas of focus include: (a) identification of needs and opportunities for affected communities to return to normal; (b) restoration of disrupted livelihoods for the crisis-affected population; and (c) strengthening of community-based protection mechanisms with a focus on women and youth.\

Title: IOM Launches COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign for Migrants in Yemen
Content: 15 December 2021
Aden – The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has begun a COVID-19 vaccination campaign for migrants stranded in Yemen, aiming to inoculate around 7,500 people at its Migrant Response Points in Aden and Ma’rib. IOM continues to advocate for more efforts to protect vulnerable populations by ramping up vaccination efforts for people on the move.
“We welcome the Government’s commitment to protecting migrants against COVID-19 and immunizing people on the move is key to combatting the spread of the disease,” said IOM’s Chief of Mission, Christa Rottensteiner. “There are still not enough doses to protect everyone in Yemen from this disease. More support from the international community to supply the country with enough vaccines will save lives.”
COVID-19 has had severe consequences for the health, well-being and income of people in Yemen. As of 12 December, there have been more than 10,000 cases reported but the full impact is difficult to assess due to limited testing and reporting across the country.
Since April, the Organization has been supporting efforts by the Ministry of Health to vaccinate at-risk and hard-to-reach populations. They have included health workers, people with chronic illnesses and elderly citizens, vaccinated at IOM-supported health centres in Aden, Ma’rib and Ta’iz governorates.
One Ethiopian migrant who received the vaccine in Aden, Naima Mohammed, said: “Last year one of my relatives died from COVID-19. Since then, I've come to the Migrant Response Point several times to learn measures to avoid contracting the virus, like handwashing and mask wearing. Now that I'm vaccinated, I'm more protected.”
Seven years of conflict in Yemen have weakened the health system, which was already in peril before the virus reached the country. The pandemic has had a dire impact on the most marginalized communities who lack access to health care, clean water and sanitation.
An estimated 36,000 migrants have been stranded on their journeys due to COVID-19-related mobility restrictions, nearly 3,500 in Ma’rib. Many are sleeping rough or in overcrowded and unsanitary accommodation where the virus can easily spread.
“Vaccinating against COVID-19 is even more crucial in places like Ma’rib where ongoing conflict continues to weaken health facilities and disrupt the supply chain for medicines,”  Rottensteiner said.
For the past three months, IOM has been conducting awareness-raising sessions among migrants to spread accurate information and debunk vaccine misconceptions. Vaccinated migrants will receive immunization documents which will allow them easier access to health facilities.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, IOM has helped prevent the spread of the disease and provide treatment for those infected. This includes encouraging behaviours to prevent transmission, increasing disease surveillance and testing, and securing critical supplies and personal protective equipment in health facilities.
So far this year, more than 135,000 people have been reached with COVID-19 awareness sessions and over 400,000 people have been screened for COVID-19 at IOM-supported health facilities throughout the country.
IOM’s vaccination campaign for migrants in Yemen is implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization with support by contributions from the governments of Germany, Finland and EU Humanitarian Aid.

Title: Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) – Yemen, 9 December 2021
Content: 13 December 2021
On 22 November 2021, the International Health Regulations national focal point (IHR NFP) for Yemen notified WHO of the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in stool samples from two children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Yemen.
The first case, a nine-year-old girl, from Thubab district, Taiz governorate, south-western Yemen, experienced onset of paralysis on 30 August. The child had not been vaccinated against polio. Two stool samples were collected on 31 August and 2 September, and VDPV2 was confirmed on 22 November, with 10 nucleotide differences from the Sabin type 2 poliovirus vaccine strain.
The second case, a 26-month-old girl, from Marib district, Marib governorate, north-east of Sana’a city, experienced onset of paralysis on 1 September. The child had also not been vaccinated against polio. Two stool specimens were collected on 4 and 5 September, and VDPV2 was confirmed on 22 November with 11 nucleotide differences from the Sabin type 2 poliovirus vaccine strain.
The two districts do not share a border and are approximately 430 km apart. The two VDPV isolates are genetically linked, and therefore, classified as cVDPV2. This is a new emergence and the viruses detected are not related to other known cVDPV2s globally.
The confirmation of cVDPV2 comes in the context of an ongoing outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1), which has to date paralyzed 35 children (three in 2021, 31 in 2020, and one in 2019).
The last VDPV2 case in the country was reported in June 2016 in Aden governorate, southern Yemen, and was classified as ambiguous[1]VDPV2 (aVDPV2). According to the WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage, polio vaccine third dose (POL3) coverage was reported to be 66% in 2020.
Public health response
The Ministry of Health, supported by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners, conducted a field investigation, and started implementing the polio outbreak preparedness and response plan. In addition, AFP surveillance continues to be enhanced.
WHO risk assessment
The risk of further spread of this strain in Yemen is exacerbated by decreased immunization rates during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the detected cases are from two governorates with accessibility and security issues, with high risk of population displacement to other governorates due to the recent security situation in Marib and Western Coast of Yemen which has led to significant levels of population movement, including to and from the Horn of Africa. The ongoing humanitarian crisis is a major risk factor to be considered for the spread of the disease.
Based on the above-mentioned gaps and challenges, WHO considers the risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 to be high. Additionally, the existing cVDPV1 outbreak as well as the emergence of cVDPV2 highlight the gaps in routine immunization coverage and inadequate outbreak response.
The Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005) convened a meeting in November 2021 on the international spread of poliovirus in multiple countries. As per the report released, the Emergency Committee expressed concern at the continued rapid spread of cVDPV2 to many countries and noted that the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 is currently high.
WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases and commence planned expansion of environmental surveillance in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.
WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel.
As per the advice of the Emergency Committee, the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and implementation of advice aimed at reducing this risk is strongly encouraged. Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, ensure the vaccination of residents and long-term visitors and restrict travel of individuals at the point of departure if not vaccinated or cannot prove their vaccination status.

Title: Supporting Cultural Institutions’ Readiness in Emergencies in Yemen
Content: 12 December 2021
Under the framework to support local institutions in Yemen, UNESCO and the Social Fund for Development held capacity building training on safeguarding cultural heritage during emergencies between November 6-11 in Sana'a.
Due to the ongoing conflict, climate change and lack of maintenance, many historical buildings and sites have been destroyed or severely damaged in Yemen. UNESCO has been responding by rehabilitating historical sites in Aden, Shibam, Sana'a and Zabid as part of the EU-funded project, Cash for Work: Promoting Livelihood Opportunities for Urban Youth in Yemen.
To ensure the readiness of local institutions to respond and contribute to the protection of cultural assets, UNESCO trained 42 cultural professionals, including decision-makers and experts, on how to intervene during emergencies by forming a team and developing a strategic plan.
It is almost impossible to prevent disasters, but it is possible to reduce their effects and damages by adopting an appropriate plan to manage and mitigate their risk
- Kamal Al-Dabai - Director of Dhamar Museum.
The workshop introduced people responsible with the correct mechanisms used in rapid intervention, strengthened partnerships between relevant authorities, and established a plan for the formation of an emergency intervention team in historic cities registered in UNESCO World Heritage List.
“There are systematic ways to work in safeguarding cultural heritage properties during disasters and it's necessary this work is managed by specialists and supported by other parties including civil society organizations,” said Ahmed Haidara, an SFD project officer.
At the end of the workshop, UNESCO and SFD simulated an emergency scenario in Shibam Kawkaban, a historical site recently impacted by floods. Attendees practiced measuring damages to buildings, intervening to protect antiquities, and conducting first aid on the injured.
“I hope this workshop expands to include other organizations from different parts of the country so everyone can be an active partner in protecting cultural heritage,” said Jamila Al-Daili, Director of the Folklore Museum in Sana’a. “We need additional extensive workshops to enhance our performance during disasters.”
UNESCO and the EU are committed to continue building the capacities of local communities in order to protect cultural heritage in Yemen. As of September 2021, the Cash for work project enrolled around 3,000 Yemeni women and men, rehabilitated 161 historic buildings and sites, and surveyed the damages of 16,000 historic buildings.
“It was a successful workshop as we managed to further emphasize the importance of cooperation in times of emergency,” said Haidara.

Title: Children Among Five Civilians Injured in Missile Attack on IOM-Managed Displacement Site in Yemen
Content: 09 December 2021
Ma’rib – Four children and one woman were injured in a dawn attack on Al Hamma displacement site, a camp for internally displaced persons managed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Ma’rib Al Wadi district.
IOM urgently calls on all parties to the conflict to respect International Humanitarian Law and protect civilian lives.
“Families have fled for their lives and come to this site to seek safety from ongoing hostilities. Civilians should never be a target,” said IOM Yemen’s Chief of Mission, Christa Rottensteiner.
The injured have been transported to a nearby hospital for treatment. One is in a critical condition. IOM teams are ensuring that the affected family receives the medical care required and other urgent assistance is provided.
Al Hamma displacement site hosts nearly 250 households – roughly 1,500 people. IOM has provided shelter, essential relief items and water, sanitation and hygiene services here since 2019. No IOM staff were injured in the incident.

Title: Sweden Supports UNFPA to Reach Most Vulnerable Women and Girls with Protection Services in Yemen
Content: 08 December 2021
Sana’a, December 2021 – The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) has announced a contribution of US$ 3.3 million to help UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund provide life-saving protection services to the most vulnerable women and girls.
Women and girls are among the most vulnerable in Yemen’s crisis. Displacement and the breakdown of protection mechanisms, driven by nearly seven years of conflict, have drastically increased the vulnerability of women and girls to violence and abuse. An estimated 6.1 million women are in urgent need of protection.
“Women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by the many woes facing Yemen. The effects of the pandemic, economic decline and continued displacement continue to make life extremely challenging. Far too many women and girls are also victims of gender-based violence. We are proud to continue to support UNFPA in their efforts to address these challenges. We need to lay a foundation upon which women and girls in Yemen can thrive and prosper” says Maria Selin, Sida’s Regional Director for Middle East and North Africa, based at the Swedish Embassy in Amman.
This latest funding would support an estimated 60,000 women and girls with specialized women’s protection services and will help some 1,000 women seeking such services to start their own businesses. The programme will engage with community leaders, police, lawyers as well as with humanitarian actors in addressing women’s protection issues in the country.
“UNFPA is deeply heartened by the generous support of Sweden to our efforts to help the most the vulnerable women and girls in Yemen,” said Nestor Owomuhangi, UNFPA’s Representative to Yemen. “The latest funding will translate into more people – particularly more women and more girls – enjoying the protection services and livelihood support that they urgently need at this point in time.”
Sweden has been one of the largest contributors to UNFPA’s protection programmes in Yemen, contributing nearly US$13 million since 2017, and in turn helping to reach hundreds of thousands of women and girls with protection information and services.
UNFPA leads the coordination and provision of protection services across the country. UNFPA is also the sole provider of life-saving reproductive health medicines in Yemen.

Title: Essential Health Services Project, supported by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, is a lifeline for millions across Yemen
Content: 05 December 2021
5 December 2021 – The conflict in Yemen has taken a dreadful toll on the health infrastructure. Almost 7 years of active conflict has impaired the availability and quality of health services to the most vulnerable. Leaving over 20 million civilians in need of health assistance. If that is not enough, the emergence of COVID-19 has exacerbated existing pressure on health facilities and civilians who barely have access to basic health services.
WHO has led the health efforts during such difficult times along with the Health Cluster and local health authorities to mitigate the risks and strengthen the health system in one of the most complex operational environments.
In partnership with the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief), and as part of large-scale efforts to support health in Yemen, WHO leads the Essential Health Services Project – a US$ 20 500 000 project that aims to enhance Health Cluster coordination and improve access to the Minimum Service Package in vulnerable and priority districts across the country.
WHO and KSrelief, through this project, support Lawdar hospital in the Abian governorate. Dr Nabil Hussein is the Director of Lawdar hospital. He has been working at the hospital for 25 years now. “We receive 200 to 250 cases per day. Which exceeds our operational capacity,” he says.
Hundreds of people come to Lawdar hospital from surrounding districts to seek medical care, specifically surgical care as it is the only hospital that offers surgical care in the area.
“The pressure is extreme and the resources are scarce. But we ensure our best effort as much as operational capacity allows. The hospital is in dire need of more health staff and specialized health care professionals due to the pressure and the number of patients coming in. More needs to be done, and we are looking forward to continued support by WHO and KSrelief,” Dr Nabil adds.
“We are grateful for the continued dedication of WHO in such difficult circumstances. The support we received has been substantial. The hospital has been equipped with machines, medical and non-medical supplies. The efforts also included support to our therapeutic feeding centre and the COVID-19 isolation units. Not to mention the highly beneficial quality care training that was offered to health staff in the hospital,” he says.
Through the Minimum Service Package, WHO was able to provide medical supplies, medicines, laboratory supplies, oxygen supply and medical equipment to targeted health facilities. This has ensured improved access to quality health services and technologies are available for over 6 million people in need. In addition, the project ensured provision of fuel and a safe water supply to maintain functionality of health facilities and crucial delivery of health care services.
The project helps support increased access to medical care and essential health services and improved quality of health care services in 19 health facilities. Aiming to reach approximately 2.3 million people through the project activities. In addition to supporting 206 health facilities with fuel, which in turn supported access to health care for over 733 000 people. Through the Minimum Service Package, 1.2 million consultations were conducted of which 74 000 were consultations for internally displaced persons (IDPs). Through the project, computed tomography scan (CT scan) and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) were provided to targeted health facilities, assisting around 73 000 patients seeking medical care at these facilities each month.
The project supports the operational needs of 26 emergency operation centres across Yemen that play a pivotal role in providing real-time information, assessing the needs and the COVID-19 response, receiving alerts, as well as coordinating and managing response interventions. This helps promote integrated preparedness and response operations with 36 partners across UN and non-UN organizations.

Title: Alarming Rise in People at Risk Amid Ongoing Hostilities in Yemen’s Ma’rib: IOM
Content: 24 November 2021
Ma’rib – The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is sounding the alarm on the worsening humanitarian situation in Ma’rib governorate where armed conflict is taking a heavy toll on displaced persons, migrants and the communities that host them. IOM urgently calls on all parties to end the ongoing hostilities and appeals for urgent funds to support those affected.
Active frontlines have shifted in the past two months more than any time this year. The number of people forced to flee their homes in Ma’rib – many for the fourth or fifth time – has escalated to more than 45,000 people displaced since September, according to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM).
“IOM is extremely concerned about the prospect that hundreds of thousands of people might be forced to move again if violence reaches the city, as well as rising civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure,” said IOM Yemen’s Chief of Mission, Christa Rottensteiner.
“We join the humanitarian community in calling for an end to hostilities, respect for international humanitarian law and also for urgent resources to scale up the response,” she said.
The governorate’s 137 displacement sites have seen a nearly ten-fold increase in new arrivals since September. As the largest organization working in the area, IOM teams are providing essential relief – including water, sanitation, shelter, household items and cash to cover urgent needs – in 61 sites. Since the beginning of the year, IOM has reached more than 200,000 people in Ma’rib with aid.
“We’ve not witnessed this much desperation in Ma’rib in the last two years as we have in the last two months,” Rottensteiner said. “Communities are being repeatedly displaced and arriving to our sites in dire need of the most basics.”
The Chief of Mission said new influxes of internally displaced persons are straining already overcrowded sites. “We’re now seeing, at times, up to 40 people with no choice but to share one small tent,” she said.
Humanitarian actors are planning for rising displacement to continue, and urgently require more funds. IOM appealed for USD 170 million in 2021 to meet the increasing needs of displaced, conflict-affected and migrant communities in Yemen. Only about half of these funds have been received. The USD 3.85 billion Humanitarian Response Plan for Yemen is only funded at 57 per cent.
DTM estimates that 10,000 people fled their homes in September when conflict began to surge. This trend continued at alarming rates, doubling in October when nearly 20,000 were displaced.
As of 20 November, more than 15,000 people fled conflict-affected areas to safer places in Ma’rib this month. As frontlines approach the city, more people are fleeing to Ma’rib Al Wadi, the governorate’s remote eastern part where services are lacking, than to the urban centre.
Among those affected are some 3,500 migrants who IOM estimates are stranded throughout the governorate. The shift in frontlines continues to impede the journeys taken by migrants to reach and depart from Ma’rib on their way to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Migrants in areas close to the fighting have been at even greater risk of detention, forced labour and sexual violence since the recent escalation of conflict. IOM is responding to their health and protection needs at its Migrant Response Point and in sites where many have settled.
IOM’s humanitarian operations in Ma’rib are supported by the governments of Germany, Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States, as well as EU Humanitarian Aid, the United Nations Central Emergency Relief Fund and the Yemen Humanitarian Fund.
IOM’s Global Crisis Response Platform provides an overview of IOM’s plans and funding requirements to respond to the evolving needs and aspirations of those impacted by, or at risk of, crisis and displacement in 2021 and beyond. The Platform is regularly updated as crises evolve, and new situations emerge.

Title: UNDP: Recovery in Yemen possible despite fast-deteriorating situation
Content: 24 November 2021
The report projects that in the last six years the crisis has caused Yemen to miss out on US $126 billion of potential economic growth.
New York – A new United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report projects that war-torn Yemen, currently among the poorest countries in the world, can end extreme poverty within a single generation, by 2047 – provided that the conflict devastating the country for the last six years ends now.
Through statistical modeling analyzing future scenarios, the report shows that the securing of peace by January 2022, coupled with an inclusive and holistic recovery process, can enable Yemenis to reverse deep trends of impoverishment facing the country and see Yemen leap to middle-income status by 2050, while eradicating extreme poverty which now affects 15.6 million people. The report also projects that malnutrition can be halved by 2025, and that the country can achieve $450 billion of economic growth by 2050 in an integrated peace-and-recovery scenario.
“This report on Yemen provides new insights into the world’s worst humanitarian and development crisis. Millions of Yemenis continue to suffer from the conflict, trapped in poverty and with little possibility for jobs and livelihoods,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.” The study presents a clear picture of what the future could look like with a lasting peace including new, sustainable opportunities for people. To help to get there, the entire UN family continues to work with communities throughout the country to shape a peaceful, inclusive and prosperous future for all Yemenis.”
The report comes as Yemen continues to be mired in a conflict underway since 2015, which in addition to loss of life is tearing apart livelihoods, social fabric, causing Yemen to teeter on the brink of famine, and resulting in widespread reversals of development progress. The report projects that in the last six years the crisis has caused Yemen to miss out on US $126 billion of potential economic growth.
The report, carried out by the Frederick S. Pardee Center for International Futures at the University of Denver, is the third installment of the Impact of War on Yemen series. Like the previous editions, the report uses an integrated statistical modeling technique that forecasts future scenarios.
While identifying potential peace dividends, the report also contains grim projects of future trajectories should the conflict continue into 2022 and beyond.
If the conflict continues through 2030, the report projects that it will have taken 1.3 million lives by that year. Moreover, the report shows that a growing proportion of those deaths will not occur  due to fighting, but due to second-order impacts that the crisis is waging on livelihoods, food prices, and the deterioration of basic services such as health and education. Thus far, the report projects that 60 percent of deaths from the crisis have been caused by these secondary factors – a proportion projected to grow to 75 per cent by 2030 if the war continues.
In this way, the report sheds light on the lesser-known yet widespread impacts that a persisting crisis in Yemen will continue to have across key dimensions of development and well-being. The crisis has already pushed an additional 4.9 million people into malnutrition, and the report projects that this toll will grow to 9.2 million by 2030 if the war persists; by the same year, the number of people living in extreme poverty would surge to 22 million, 65% of the population.
While urging that peace is the only viable way forward to end the suffering in Yemen, the report also calls upon national, regional, and international stakeholders to adopt an inclusive and holistic recovery process, across sectors and inclusive of the entirety of Yemeni society.  Support for recovery must go far beyond infrastructure and have people at the centre; investment focused on agriculture, women’s empowerment, capacity development, and effective and inclusive governance and institutions are projected to have the highest return on development.
The analysis emphasizes that women’s empowerment is key to recovery, with projections showing that focused efforts on uplifting women and girls across Yemen can boost its  GDP by 30% by 2050, while halving omaternal mortality by 2029.
The report sends a hopeful message that not all is lost in Yemen. However, it also makes clear that with the staggering effects of the conflict witnessed over the last six years, there is no time to waste as the situation continues to propel in a downward spiral. Plans to support recovery must be continuously developed even as fighting continues.
“The people of Yemen are eager to move forward into a recovery of sustainable and inclusive development,” said Khalida Bouzar, Director of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Arab States. “UNDP stands ready to further strengthen our support to them on this journey to leave no one behind, so that the potential of Yemen and the region can be fully realized – and so that once peace is secured, it can be sustained.”
UNDP works across Yemen to help people meet their most basic needs, restore livelihoods, support communities, and advance peacebuilding.

UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone.

Title: Displaced Yemenis struggle to access aid as fighting intensifies in Marib
Content: 24 November 2021
This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is gravely concerned about the safety and security of civilians in Yemen’s Marib governorate, including more than one million people who are estimated to be displaced. As the frontlines shift closer to densely populated areas, their lives are in danger and access to humanitarian aid is becoming harder.
UNHCR is warning that further escalation of the conflict will only increase the vulnerability of people in Marib – especially those displaced – and is calling for an immediate ceasefire in Yemen. Only a peaceful resolution to the conflict can halt further suffering.
Some 40,000 people have been forced to flee in Marib since September, according to interagency data. This represents almost 70 percent of all displacements in this south-eastern governorate since the beginning of the year. Marib now hosts half of the estimated 120,000 newly displaced countrywide in 2021.
New displacement is exacerbating the existing humanitarian needs, drastically increasing the need for shelter, essential household items, water and sanitation, education, and protection services – particularly for children.
Health conditions such as acute watery diarrhea, malaria, and upper respiratory tract infections, are common among the newly displaced. There is an urgent need for screenings to provide healthcare and prevent the spread of communicable diseases.
Families from the Sirwah district are among the most vulnerable. In recent weeks, many have fled intensified armed clashes, which led to the closure of five UNHCR-managed accommodation sites. Some of these families have already been displaced five times since the start of the conflict in 2015.
Meanwhile, rocket strikes close to the sites hosting the displaced are causing fear and panic. The latest incident was reported on 17 November when an artillery shell exploded, without casualties, near a site close to Marib City. UNHCR teams report that there is heavy fighting in the mountains surrounding the city and the sound of explosions and planes can be heard day and night.
UNHCR reiterates its call upon parties to the conflict to protect civilians and infrastructure, including health and education facilities, and displacement sites.
Since the start of the new offensive in Marib this September, UNHCR has reached over 2,000 displaced families with emergency relief assistance. So far this year, we have also provided cash assistance to over 66,500 families in Marib. We are working hard to reach people with legal assistance, on personal documentation and housing, land and property rights, and psychosocial support.
Meanwhile, we are strengthening our mobile protection activities in the sites and urban areas, to assess needs. The teams bring psychological assistance to people in distress; disseminate information on services; identify those with specific needs and refer for humanitarian support, which remains limited.

Title: Qatar Fund for Development addresses critical food security needs in Yemen through its support of the World Food Programme
Content: 18 November 2021
The contribution will support over 7 million people facing food insecurity.
ROME/DOHA – Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD) has signed an agreement with the World Food Programme for a generous contribution of US$90 million supporting humanitarian operations to address critical food security needs in Yemen, where conflict, economic decline and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are putting millions in danger of slipping into famine.
The agreement formalizes an announcement made by the state of Qatar in July. The much-needed contribution has already helped WFP to address critical funding shortfalls and ensured the continued provision of life-saving food and nutrition assistance to some 7 million people in Yemen.
“Today we need to stand together hand in hand to address the critical food security needs in Yemen, and with the World Food Programme’s significant efforts, we are taking big steps toward easing the life of the Yemenis. We are proud of this strategic partnership that supports food security and helps prevent famine in Yemen,” said HE Khalifa Al-Kuwari, Director General of QFFD.
“I have been urging the world to step up to help avoid mass starvation in Yemen, and I am grateful that the government and people of Qatar have listened,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “These funds could not have come at a better time as they allowed us to avoid imminent cuts in rations. The contribution has helped save millions of lives.”
In Yemen, inadequate food consumption, one measure of hunger, is experienced by up to 46 percent of families in some areas, according to recent WFP data. It is increasing each day and is largely driven by the economic downturn in the country. Over half of Yemen’s population – 16.2 million people – is facing acute hunger, with 5 million people one step away from famine.
With the generous contribution from Qatar Fund for Development, WFP has been able to continue providing emergency food assistance to millions of people, in the form of in-kind food transfers, vouchers and cash, and specialized nutritious foods to treat and prevent malnutrition among 500,000 pregnant and nursing mothers and children under five years of age. A portion of the contribution will be used to support the WFP-led United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS), a critical service that enables the wider humanitarian response in the country.
In Yemen, WFP provides emergency food assistance through direct food rations, vouchers, or cash to nearly 13 million people, prioritising areas with the highest rates of food insecurity. In addition, WFP is providing 3.3 million children and women with specialised nutrition support and assisting 1.6 million children through its school feeding programme. QFFD’s contribution will play a crucial role in achieving this goal.

Title: US$7.5 Million Committed by the Netherlands to Support Second Phase of UNDP’s Emergency Mine Action Project in Yemen
Content: 18 November 2021
10 November 2021 – Amman, Jordan: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) welcomes the generous US$7.5 million contribution of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands to support emergency mine action efforts in Yemen.
UNDP has supported humanitarian mine action efforts in Yemen since the mid-1990s, focusing on institution building, capacity development, technical assistance, operational support, and resource mobilization. While national authorities were able to boast significant improvements during this period, the reignition of violent conflict in 2014 and 2015 now demands a response to the increased and more complex contamination of explosive hazards – including a significant increase in the prevalence of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).
“Safety and security are fundamental to the peacebuilding process,” explains Auke Lootsma, UNDP Yemen Resident Representative. “Without the institutional capacity to clear explosive hazards in Yemen, civilians are left with no choice but to risk their life and limb to carry out everyday tasks. This is not a backdrop against which we can achieve sustainable peace,” he adds.
The Dutch funding will help establish a new three-year project – Emergency Mine Action Project – Phase II – that aims to build upon existing results to strengthen institutional capacity to respond to the threat of explosive hazards, and to improve awareness among local communities to avoid them. It will be Implemented across Yemen, with a particular focus on contaminated communities.
All activities will be implemented in cooperation with local partners, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (YEMAC) located in Sana'a and Aden, the Yemen Mine Action Co-ordination Centre, and the National Mine Action Centre (NMAC). They will focus upon:
“Demining is an important means to improve human security,” says Peter-Derrek Hof, Ambassador of the Netherlands Embassy to Yemen in Amman. “By supporting the Mine Action project, the Netherlands contributes to building a society in Yemen in which people will regain access to safety and security, schools, hospitals, markets, livelihoods and other important resources and services, necessary for socio-economic development,” he adds.
This agreement builds upon a previous partnership between UNDP and the Netherlands that supported mine action efforts in Yemen over the last five years, and reenforces the long-standing commitment of the Netherlands and UNDP to the safety and security of all Yemenis.

Title: FAO and KSrelief to scale up cooperation on humanitarian work, data-driven development
Content: 17 November 2021
Rome – The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief) announced an ambitious new five-year Strategic Joint Cooperation Agreement with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on Tuesday. The agreement commits the partners to scale up joint action to meet humanitarian needs, address drivers of acute food security, and help at-risk agricultural communities build resilience to shocks that undermine their productive potential.
The agreement also outlines efforts to improve knowledge sharing on agricultural best practices, engage in data-driven development work via FAO’s Hand-in-Hand Initiative, and advance agricultural innovation to help small-scale food producers achieve better production and build better lives.
It was signed at FAO’s Rome headquarters on Tuesday by FAO Director-General QU Dongyu and KSrelief’s Supervisor-General, Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Rabeeah.
The Director-General said: “We are looking forward to strengthen our partnership in the humanitarian arena, but also in the area of data and knowledge for development, including work under FAO’s innovative Hand-in-Initiative, which is opening up new opportunities for vulnerable agricultural communities in the Near East and North Africa region and beyond. Working together, we can make a huge difference in the lives of rural communities pushed to the brink by crises.”
Al Rabeeah stated that the signing of the two agreements represents the expanding partnership between KSrelief and FAO to help many people in need as well as help communities develop to be more resilient and thereby become more self-dependent.
Saudi Arabia and FAO have been long standing partners and with the establishment of KSrelief the relation has become much closer and expanded to enter into capacity building, exchange of information and to look into global issues to improve life quality and safer environment.
Al Rabeeah concluded that KSrelief is happy to see this relationship become a model to be followed for helping communities and countries in need.
Helping farming families in Yemen
As a first step under the new expanded partnership, KSrelief today contributed $5 million to improve the food security and nutrition of Yemen’s most vulnerable smallholder farmers.
The $5 million will fund an FAO project assisting more than 24 000 highly vulnerable smallholder farming families comprised of 168,000 people. It will provide them with high quality vegetable seeds, tools and irrigation kits, and animal feed and mineral blocks, while also offering them training on nutrition-sensitive agriculture to help them improve their diets.
Since its founding in 2015, KSrelief has provided approximately $33 million in support to FAO emergency and resilience interventions. KSrelief has been FAO’s largest humanitarian resource partner among the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in addressing food insecurity and malnutrition and reaching people most in need.

Title: Japan and FAO sign a project agreement to enhance the food security and nutrition of vulnerable families in Yemen
Content: 29 October 2021
On 29 October 2021, Japan signed an agreement with FAO to contribute USD 7 million (JPY 771 000 000) to enhance the food security and nutrition of vulnerable internally displaced, agro-pastoral and pastoral families in Yemen. The funding agreement was signed today in Rome by H.E. Mr OE Hiroshi, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to Italy and FAO Deputy Director-General Beth Bechdol. This generous contribution by the Government of Japan comes after a similar contribution in 2019 in which Japan supported FAO’s emergency work in Yemen with USD 8 million (JPY 891 000 000).
Yemen remains one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. After six years of devastating conflict, more than 16 million people are facing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), despite ongoing humanitarian assistance. Overall, there are more than 4 million internally displaced people in Yemen, uprooted by conflict and facing high levels of acute food insecurity. The COVID-19 pandemic generated further shocks to an already weak economy, the impacts of which have been felt hardest by the most vulnerable households. With reduced incomes, deteriorating purchasing power and rising food prices, most households are increasingly relying on humanitarian food assistance and other unsustainable coping strategies to meet their daily food needs. Due to the compounded effects of conflict, COVID-19 and economic collapse, an estimated 8 million Yemenis have lost their livelihoods. Additionally, heavy rainfall in 2021 resulted in intense flooding, which destroyed crops, homes and water infrastructure in Aden, Abyan, Al Dhale’e, Lahj, Hadramaut, Ma’rib, and Ta’iz Governorates.
With this contribution from Japan, FAO will carry out emergency activities to safeguard livelihoods and provide critical lifesaving support to 189 490 vulnerable people. Through this project, FAO will increase safe access to fuel and energy through the construction of traditional, energy-efficient clay stoves, one for each beneficiary household. The stoves will be constructed via a cash-for-work modality by selected unemployed internally displaced youths and sufficiently able people with disabilities whom FAO will train on construction of the stoves. FAO will also equip them with the necessary tools and materials. The cash-for-work approach will enhance income-generating opportunities among the selected trainees who can be employed to construct additional stoves for neighboring host community households as well as for internally displaced households through future interventions by humanitarian actors.
FAO will also work with community animal health workers to provide basic animal health care services to pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in remote areas. Through this component, FAO will enhance livestock production and productivity by supporting and training households to (i) improve their capacity to produce nutritious food of animal origin for their own consumption and/or sale in the local markets, (ii) improve access to high quality feed through distributing feed concentrates, feed blocks and minerals, (iii) improve fodder quality and (iv) develop good animal husbandry practices. This will not only contribute to enhancing food availability and access; reducing acute food insecurity and malnutrition; and the recovery of livelihoods and household incomes, but also ensures the nutritional value of the household and community-wide food baskets.
Finally, FAO will focus on strengthening community land and water management through the rehabilitation of water infrastructure, solar pumps and use of highly efficient and improved modern irrigation systems and water conveyance systems. Food-insecure households will also be supported through conditional cash transfers via cash for work during the lean season to repair and build critical community water infrastructure.

Title: Desert Locust upsurge may be declining but remaining swarms require vigilance in East Africa and Yemen
Content: 28 October 2021
$11.2 million donation from Mastercard Foundation to aid control and recovery efforts.
Rome – While the Desert Locust upsurge that swept through the Horn of Africa and Yemen may be declining, it is critical to continue implementing control efforts against any new swarms and monitoring subsequent breeding in the region until at least the end of the year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
A new $11.2 million partnership with the Mastercard Foundation means that locust surveillance and control efforts are now fully supported to the end of the year.
"Depending on weather conditions and our ability to reach breeding and migration areas, the upsurge could be over by the end of 2021 or in early 2022,” said Rein Paulsen, the Director of FAO’s Office of Emergencies and Resilience.
“Until then, we must not drop our guard. Thanks to the generous contributions of various partners, national teams guided by FAO experts are continuing to undertake the necessary survey and control operations in the affected countries.”
The campaign against Desert Locusts in the Greater Horn of Africa and Yemen has been underway since January 2020. FAO and the affected countries have gained major successes in containing the worst recorded locust upsurge in Ethiopia and Somalia in 25 years and the worst infestations seen in Kenya in70 years.
With the support of 29 partners and FAO’s own resources, more than $230 million was mobilized for the locust campaign. The Mastercard Foundation previously partnered with FAO in April 2020 contributing $10 million to the early detection of locust swarms, ground and aerial spraying operations, and impact assessments on the ground.
“The Desert Locust swarms weren’t just eating away at crops; they were eating away livelihoods, productivity, and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. As a foundation committed to enabling access to opportunity in Africa, we felt compelled to step up and address the crisis. The progress FAO has made is deeply encouraging—and holding on to the ground gained is critical to a process of reclaiming hope for farmers and communities in the region,” said Daniel Hailu, Mastercard Foundation’s Regional Director, East and Southern Africa.
Control operations undertaken by FAO and its partners protected the livelihoods of more than 40 million people in rural areas, saving crops and pasture and thereby securing households’ cereal and milk supplies. FAO estimates that around 4.4 million tonnes of cereal crops and some 878 million litres of milk were saved and the value of saved production exceeded $1.7 billion.
“It was an extraordinary effort in a short space of time. Together, we not only controlled the onslaught of this insidious pest but FAO managed to strengthen locust fighting capacity in East Africa from near zero in some places to a high level of readiness,” said Paulsen.
The Desert Locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world and a small swarm covering one square kilometre can eat the same amount of food in one day as 35 000 people.
Swarms the size of cities were vanquished and now a very small number of remnant swarms remain in Ethiopia and Somalia. Kenya is locust free and Djibouti and Eritrea are relatively calm and under control.
Lingering risks
Despite progress, there is continuing concern about northern Ethiopia where new swarms have formed in the past month as local conflict has limited control operations. The swarms may pose a risk to the critical Meher season harvest, already anticipated to be 40 percent below normal.
FAO forecasts suggest these swarms will migrate north out of Ethiopia or into eastern regions of the country where control operations are possible. However, there is concern about how many might remain and whether they threaten crops in a highly food insecure region.
New swarms from Yemen where controls remain a challenge could also pose a threat if they move south across the Gulf of Aden and reinvade the Horn of Africa.
Livelihoods support for farmers and their families
Despite the success of the locust control operations, up to 2.5 million people were affected by the upsurge in 2020 in addition to at least another 1 million in early 2021.
FAO has been helping farmers who suffered locust damage with agricultural support packages, providing veterinary care for vegetation-starved livestock, and making cash transfers to families who have lost their crops so that they can purchase food.
To mitigate the devastating impact on livelihoods, FAO provided diverse support to over 300 000 farming, agro-pastoral and pastoral households, while an additional 347 000 families were assisted by partner non‐governmental organizations under the Regional Desert Locust Alliance (RDLA). Together, these activities assisted over 4 million people.
While regional and local preparedness and field operations are much improved, they can only be supported with effective forecasting and early warning, which FAO’s Desert Locust Information Service has been providing for more than 50 years.

Title: US$9 Million Committed by the Netherlands to Support UNDP’s Efforts to Promote Safety and Justice in Yemen
Content: 28 October 2021
26 October 2021 – Amman, Jordan: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) welcomes the generous US$9 million contribution of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands to promote safety and justice in Yemen.

The violent conflict in Yemen has resulted in the collapse of several public institutions, including the Rule of Law, forcing Yemenis to rely on dysfunctional services, damaged or destroyed infrastructure, limited equipment, and reduced human resource capacities. Compounded by a lack of inclusiveness in decision making and increasing corruption, the ability of the Yemeni population to live in safety and security, with access to effective justice, has become difficult.
The funding will help establish a new three-year project, Promoting Inclusive Access to Justice in Yemen (PIAJ), that aims to strengthen the resilience of institutions and communities, and to maintain a foundation for recovery and reconstruction. It will be Implemented in the four governorates of Aden, Hadramout, Hodeidah and Sana’a and has four key focus areas:
“Fragmented public institutions not only prevent inclusive access to justice, but the trickle-down effects of unstable Rule of Law institutions can seriously stifle Yemen’s economic, social and political recovery," says Auke Lootsma, UNDP Yemen Resident Representative. "By restoring the community’s trust in local authorities and justice services, Yemenis have more opportunity to rebuild their lives and livelihoods, provide for their families, and facilitate access to education for the next generation.”
Building on this, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Mr. Peter Derrek Hof adds, “Access to justice for all, including the most vulnerable and marginalized groups is not only a priority for the Netherlands, but is also essential for a just and inclusive peace. We are excited to strengthen our partnership with UNDP to promote people-centered justice and the rule of law in Yemen".
The PIAJ project is committed to ongoing community consultation to build-in local ownership, identify local priorities and design sustainable solutions. It also supports a strategic approach to rule of law coordination and sharing of good practices.
This agreement builds upon a previous partnership between UNDP and the Netherlands that supported safety and justice in Yemen, and reenforces the long-standing commitment of the Netherlands and UNDP to the rule of law in Yemen.

Title: IOM Steps Up Help on Yemen’s West Coast as Clashes Heighten Desperation
Content: 20 October 2021
Al Makha – The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has ramped up its humanitarian assistance on Yemen's west coast where the needs of communities displaced by years of conflict are growing amid ongoing violence.
The Organization is also urging more help from donors and aid partners.
IOM's response is focusing primarily on the two governorates of Ta’iz and Hodeidah, where active frontlines continue to cause instability and force families to flee.
Since 2017, when mass displacement in the area began, tens of thousands of people have struggled to survive in protracted displacement in hard-to-reach areas where public services and humanitarian assistance are extremely limited.
“We were displaced here four years ago and we still feel unsafe from the bullets flying overhead,” said Aziza, a mother displaced in Khoka district. “There are seven families living in my small shelter. We can’t afford medical care or school costs. We need peace and we need to go back home.”
More than 17,000 displaced families are living in more than 140 displacement sites in the area, while ongoing fighting continues to provoke new waves of displacement. Most recently, clashes in eastern Al Tuhayta district have displaced more than 200 families westward to safer areas.
“As the needs of displaced communities on the west coast continue to mount, IOM is ramping up its response to thousands of people in need of urgent services, especially health care, water and sanitation, and shelter,” said Christa Rottensteiner, IOM Yemen Chief of Mission.
“We urge donors and other partners to commit more significant investments to ease the levels of desperation facing too many people on the west coast.”
As one of the few international humanitarian organizations operating in the area, IOM is implementing lifesaving interventions in 13 displacement sites, providing shelter, clean water, latrines, cash and essential relief items to thousands of families in need.
The Organization is expanding the availability of health care to affected populations by enhancing primary and child and maternal health care, addressing malnutrition, promoting mental health and psychosocial support, providing incentives to health-care workers and deploying mobile medical teams in underserved areas.
IOM is working with donors and partners to support communities on the west coast by coordinating services in displacement sites, and promoting longer-term recovery with transitional shelters, rehabilitating water networks, increasing COVID-19 testing and constructing flood risk reduction walls.
The Government of Canada has been instrumental in IOM's scale-up of the lifesaving humanitarian response to the most immediate needs of communities – namely water, health and shelter improvement.
IOM’s Global Crisis Response Platform provides an overview of IOM’s plans and funding requirements to respond to the evolving needs and aspirations of those impacted by, or at risk of, crisis and displacement in 2021 and beyond. The Platform is regularly updated as crises evolve, and new situations emerge.

Title: WFP and Khalsa Aid International strike partnership to support most vulnerable in two critical food crises
Content: 16 October 2021
Rome/London – The World Food Programme (WFP) welcomes a contribution of US$ 2.75 million from Khalsa Aid International as part of a three-year programme to support school children in Yemen and refugees from the Tigray Crisis
A partnership between WFP and Khalsa Aid International will deliver vitally needed support to Yemen and to refugees who have fled from Ethiopia’s Tigray region to Sudan. This collaboration will help WFP to maintain programmes that provide vulnerable children and women with the nutrition they need to survive and thrive.
In Yemen, Khalsa Aid International’s contribution will go towards WFP’s Healthy Kitchens programme, supporting collective kitchens that employ vulnerable members of the community – 80 per cent of whom are women – to prepare fresh, healthy meals for almost 10,000 school children. The meals are made with locally sourced ingredients and respect domestic food culture, while also providing local producers with regular business.
In Sudan, the partnership will facilitate essential nutrition assistance to refugees who have fled the Tigray crisis in neighbouring Ethiopia. This assistance will help protect and support tens of thousands of individuals, particularly children under five and pregnant and breastfeeding women who are at risk of suffering from malnutrition.
“Through this partnership, we will reach more communities with more of what they need most: food, help, and hope. We thank Khalsa Aid International for its shared commitment to building a world without hunger and for its trust in WFP’s ability to deliver for the people we serve,” says Tim Hunter, Director of Private Sector Partnerships and Fundraising at WFP.
Ravi Singh, Founder and CEO of Khalsa Aid International, says: “Khalsa Aid International is proud to do what we can to provide vitally needed support to the most vulnerable in two critical food crises in Yemen and Sudan. We are delighted with the partnership we have formed with WFP, which builds on our previous humanitarian initiatives, and have selected programmes that provide vulnerable children and women with the nutrition they need to survive. Feeding people nutritious food is at the core of Khalsa Aid’s work, in line with the Sikh philosophy of langar (free community kitchen) and seva (meaning selfless service to humanity), which is at the core of all our current global programmes. Through this partnership, Khalsa Aid has further extended its reach in feeding the hungry globally. I envisage this is just the start of a long partnership to help feed the world’s hungry.”

Title: Statement on the escalation of fighting in Ma’rib, Shabwah and Al Bayda governorates
Content: 14 October 2021
UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator calls for cessation of hostilities for Al Abdidyah
Sana’a, 14 October 2021 – The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, made the following statement today:
The escalation of fighting in Yemen in recent weeks, particularly in Ma’rib, Shabwah and Al Bayda governorates, is having a devastating impact on civilians, who continue to bear the brunt of more than seven years of conflict in the country.
I am particularly concerned about the situation in Ma’rib Governorate’s Al Abdiyah District. The ongoing security situation has severely restricted movement in and out of the district for an estimated 35,000 people, including nearly 17,000 extremely vulnerable people who had found refuge there after fleeing the conflict in neighboring areas.
This untenable situation has severely limited the delivery of life-saving aid and prevented the sick and wounded from receiving urgently needed medical care, while the provision of basic commodities has become exceedingly difficult and dangerous.
I call on all parties involved in the fighting to agree now to a cessation of hostilities for Al Abdiyah District to allow for the safe passage of civilians and aid workers, and for the evacuation of all of those wounded in the fighting.
The United Nations and its partners remain committed to working with all relevant authorities to ensure that humanitarian assistance continues to reach people in need across Yemen despite the ongoing clashes.
***
Additional information for editors
Last month, 235 civilians were killed or injured during hostilities in Yemen, according to preliminary information – the second highest monthly casualty toll in two years.
In Ma’rib Governorate, fighting forced nearly 10,000 people to flee their homes in September, the highest monthly figure this year. In some areas, the fighting has also disrupted the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance, including food and medicines.
More than 20 million people need humanitarian assistance and protection this year, including 12.1 million people in acute need. The 2021 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, which seeks $3.85 billion to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection to 16.2 million people in need, is only 55 per cent funded.

Title: United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly Remarks to media in Geneva – 11 October 2021
Content: 12 October 2021
Near verbatim transcript
What I would like to speak to you about today is the current situation in Yemen and how we are trying to confront the various problems that we see on the ground. It is a quite serious situation.
Where I would like to start is the fact that this is now getting into seven years. It is a long time for the conflict to take place and each year that goes by just exacerbates the problem for the population on the ground, north and south.
The numbers we are talking about are staggering.
We are talking about 20 million people in need of humanitarian assistance – that is two-thirds of the total population of the country. Five million people in severe or nearly severe hunger – just a step away from famine. About 400,000 children are at imminent risk of death from malnutrition.
We have received reasonable funding for food security and nutrition this year. When we announced the new response plan in March, there was a good enough response to allow us to scale up and to start once again providing not only to the 10 million people we had previously been providing support to, but to 13 million (an additional 3 million) and, more importantly, for those in the most severe need, increasing the rations form half rations, which is what we did when the funding was quite lowlast year, to full rations for those in the most severe need and three quarters for those in less dire circumstances.
That fast intervention and a parallel one on the nutrition side, particularly for children, has taken us a step back, but it’s very fragile. And I think this is the core message I would like to get across: this assistance needs to be sustained if we are not to go back to the abyss of being on the edge of famine.
We’re also concerned now with the escalation in fighting around Marib. This has now added to additional displacement in that area, a place where we already have over a million people displaced.
Secondly, we have enclaves where the fighting is continuing that we’re not able to provide support to. I’ll touch upon that a little bit later. The fact is that we’re continuing to see fighting along the major frontlines.
Myself, I’ve been in this position now for approximately six months, I’ve taken advantage of this time to basically try to see the situation on the ground. I drive. I go by road. I don’t have an airplane. But I’ve traveled to most of the governates that are on the frontlines to see up close what is happening – both in the northern governates, as well as those in the south.
What I’d like to share with you is what I see. I see an economy, number one, that’s collapsed. I see the destruction of schools, of factories, of roads and bridges.
I’ve seen the destruction of power systems. So what made Yemen work seven years ago in many cases, no longer exists. And with that collapse, we’ve seen a collapse in the economy, a reduction of income by about 50 per cent. and this economic collapse, in many ways, is what drives the humanitarian catastrophe itself. People don’t have the income to buy food. The restrictions introduced because of the conflict have actually increased significantly the cost of importing food, the cost of distributing food and other essential commodities once inside Yemen. It is important to remember that the bulk of the food that Yemenis consume is imported commercially. So this has a significant impact. The conflict has led directly to an economic collapse, which has led to the current humanitarian crisis that we see to today.
But I don’t just see the infrastructure and the economy that’s collapsed. Everywhere I go, it’s a chance to speak with people on the ground who really want to tell their story. And I think that story is extremely important to share with you.
It’s usually mothers who come to me and they hold onto my arm, literally, because they have a story they want me to hear. And I think, Implicitly, they want me to tell you that story.
I’ll give you an example. When I was recently on the southern side of the frontline outside the port city of Al Hodeidah, an area where very limited humanitarian assistance has come in the past. The objective of the trip, in fact, was to open it up to more of that assistance. So these are villages that have had limited contact with the international community, in the last years of the conflict.
I would be told, as they hold on to me, mothers talking about their children, not having access to school, the fact that they face problems with landmines, the fact that fisheries are no longer working so they don’t have a livelihood.
They can’t access water because the water system is on the other side of the frontline; whereas the wells that they dig because of the proximity to the ocean tend to be salty and therefore not drinkable. Not being able to access hospitals because they’re on the other side of the frontline.
This is a tragedy that goes all the way across Yemen – that kind of blockage to access to public services. And then you see the hospitals that are packed with patients. Because there’s no clinics functioning outside the government or provincial capitals those seeking treatment have to come in from long distances, traveling two, three days just to get there, and sometimes being denied access to medical services simply because there’s not enough staff beds to do so. And being told to go on to another governate. It’s very tragic to see this. It’s very tragic to see how people suffer as they try to get medical care.
On the other hand, we see the dedication of the Yemeni staff, health in particular, who struggle to try to help people as much as possible. So it’s extremely important to understand that this is a system that’s very fragile, that humanitarian assistance needs to be sustained if we want to avoid going back to the near famine.
But we also have to recognize that the support to other systems in the country is almost non-existent. We’re at about 20 per cent funding for health, water, education, livelihoods, including agriculture, support to internally displaced persons. We have 4 million IDPs. The demands just continue. What I worry about as much as anything right now is the lack of fuel for hospitals, for water systems – to keep those systems going. I worry about the fact that public servants don’t get paid. How long will they continue to work?They’re not been paid since last year.
All of these things are slowly degrading the life of the average Yemeni, both in the north and the south. And we need to continue to work on doing this.
So what are we looking for? One is sustaining humanitarian assistance, as I’ve mentioned – better funding this year, but just enough to stave off famine. Secondly, we need to make sure that these additional areas are covered in health, water, agriculture, for the IDPs, education, et cetera.
Number two, we need to look at why the economy has totally collapsed and what we can do to unlock that economy, because the skills are still there for business to operate, for livelihoods to operate, if these restrictions, that I referred to before are, are removed.
So we need to have – and we’ve developed – an economic strategy to say these are the things that are holding back this economy, that are driving down incomes, raising food prices. The stability of the currency is also an important part of this. Its rapid depreciation has reduced the purchasing power of the rial and therefore increased the rial cost of food that comes into the country.
All of these things are working in the wrong direction and we need to find, and we’ve identified ways, to try to reverse that – to compliment the humanitarian assistance that’s going into the country. I think we can do so, but we need the political will by the parties in conflict, by those who have influence on the parties in conflict to isolate the people of Yemen from the conflict, from an economic point of view, so that they can resume economic activities and take care of themselves.
As we go forward, I think there are two or three issues that are extremely important.
We need a stronger evidence base on the situation in Yemen. We’re working very hard on this right now to increase the quality of the food assessments, nutrition assessments, and the assessments in the other areas that I’ve described. [This is] critically important to make sure that we can provide to donors the reality on the ground.
I think we’ll see that in the south, the situation has further deteriorated because of the kind of security instability that we have seen increasing over the recent months. And you will have seen the recent attack in Aden as an example. That also is working against the humanitarian situation in the southern governates as well.
We’re also working to improve the biometrics of the distribution of food to reduce the potential for diversion to make sure that the food and other support is going to the right people and, likewise, substantially increasing our monitoring on the ground and looking for ways to break through various impediments to our support to families on the ground – whether it’s from security restrictions by authorities or from delays in approval of projects, this remains a major matter of priority for us.
I want to summarize, and I think we can take some questions. We need a sustained humanitarian response and funding that makes that happen. We need to unlock the economy. And most importantly, the fighting has to stop.
We cannot reverse what’s happening in Yemen without a political settlement, without a ceasefire. As long as the conflict continues, we’re going to continue to see massive humanitarian needs in Yemen. That’s just the reality. We would like to see otherwise. I would hope that we can find a way forward on that as soon as possible to allow Yemenis to rebuild their economy and their lives – and to avoid the situation I have seen in so many countries that I’ve worked in, where a conflict goes on for 20, 25 years. When that happens, you have a totally transformed country.
It’s nearly impossible to go back to where you were before the animosity, the difficulties of having lived in a war, in a violent conflict affect relations for years to come, makes the possibility of reconstruction much more difficult because usually public services decline and degrade to the point where you have to rebuild the human capital, as well as the infrastructure. But most importantly, the impact on children who grow up in conflict. If that’s all they know, that changes their view on how to live and how to survive. And if they don’t have access to education, you don’t go back just 5, 6, 7 years. You go back a generation or two in terms of trying to rebuild. Malnutrition leads to stunting that has an impact over decades for the future.
This is the path that Yemen could take. We need to find it on a different path if we want to succeed.
I’ll conclude just by making note of the situation around Marib, where recent advances by forces from the de facto authorities in Sana’a have led to additional displacement where there’s populations that we were not able yet to access, where we’re trying to find different ways to do so.
It’s a reminder of why we need this fighting to end, a reminder why we have to find a different path forward as I described before. So I will stop there and just see if there are some questions that people would like to follow up on.
Thank you very much for your time.

Title: Yemen’s future recovery hangs in balance, warns senior UN aid coordinator
Content: 11 October 2021
Ongoing conflict and violence across Yemen continue to impact heavily on the country’s people who desperately need the fighting to end, so that they can rebuild their lives, the UN’s senior humanitarian official in the country said on Monday.
“I’ve seen the destruction of schools, of factories, of roads and bridges; I’ve seen the destruction of power systems so what made Yemen work seven years ago in many cases no longer exists”, said David Gressly, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen.
Speaking in Geneva after a weekend that saw a car bomb at Aden airport reportedly leave 25 people dead and 110 injured, the veteran aid worker warned about arecent escalation of fighting in the oil-rich northern province of Marib.
“This is now adding to additional displacement in that area, a place where we already have over a million people displaced”, he said. “And secondly, we have enclaves where fighting is continuing where we’re not able to provide support”.
Longstanding concerns over potential famine in the country prompted a UN-led appeal for $3.6 billion in funding in March that has raised nearly $2.1 billion to date.
An additional $500-$600 million was also pledged during the recent UN General Assembly, Mr. Gressly added, noting that although the international response has been higher than for other emergencies, “it’s been particularly focused – and we understand why – on the food security and nutrition side, for most immediate lifesaving response”.
This has left the situation inside Yemen “very fragile and if that’s not sustained, if we’re not getting the new pledges on time…in 2022, we will revert back to where we were in March”, Mr. Gressly insisted.
He explained that people needed more than emergency care: “Health, education, water, access and support to IDPs (internally displaced people) and livelihood support; those are almost all funded below 20 per cent, and so while the lifesaving is important, we can’t, we cannot afford to ignore the rest”.
Critical to Yemen’s recovery is support for the country’s civil servants, many of whom have not been paid in many months, amid conflict between the internationally backed government of Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi and Houthi opposition forces, who occupy much of the north of the country.
Mr. Gressly stressed the importance of finding ways to support these civil servants as they are key to the country’s recovery – and the UN’s aid programmes. Without them, “the whole humanitarian response” risks becoming more expensive”, he said.

Title: Thousands of People Forced to Flee Escalating Hostilities in Yemen’s Ma’rib
Content: 07 October 2021
Ma’rib – An escalation of hostilities in and around Yemen's Ma’rib governorate has forced thousands of people to flee in search of safety in an alarming rise in displacement since the beginning of September.
IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) – which currently has access in seven of Ma’rib’s 14 districts – recorded the displacement of close to 10,000 people last month, the highest rates recorded in Ma’rib in a single month this year.
“This renewed violence in Ma’rib is destabilizing the lives of thousands of people and leading to tragic death and injuries of civilians, including children,” said Christa Rottensteiner, IOM Yemen Chief of Mission.
“IOM calls on all parties of the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and protect civilians.”
Recent conflict has destroyed critical infrastructure such as bridges and roads.
Routes within and into Al Abdiyah district, in the south of Ma’rib, have reportedly been cut off – obstructing the movement of people and essential supplies. The district is one of the largest in the governorate, with an estimated 31,500 residents, according to local authorities.
Humanitarian organizations are concerned about the well-being of conflict-affected communities in areas where assistance cannot reach.
The situation is also dire in Harib, Al Jubah and Rahabah districts, from where nearly 4,700 internally displaced persons (IDPs) are estimated to have fled this month. The majority went to safer areas in Al Jubah and Ma’rib Al Wadi districts, and to densely populated, urban areas in Ma’rib city.
Hostilities in parts of neighbouring Shabwah also caused the displacement of hundreds within that governorate and north into Ma’rib.
Needs are drastically mounting in what the United Nations describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
Many of the newly displaced live in deplorable conditions, with multiple households sheltering under one roof. More than half say shelter is their top need, followed by food and water.
"We’ve now fled for our lives for the second time," said Fatma*, a woman displaced from Harib five days ago. "We could barely afford to pay for the bus that brought us here. Twenty-two of my family members are now sharing one tent. We can't sleep and we can barely find food.”
Since January 2020, IOM and partners estimate that close to 170,000 people have been displaced towards Ma’rib city, many of them multiple times. One third have fled since the beginning of 2021.
Many have fled to the 34 displacement sites managed by IOM, exacerbating the overcrowded conditions. Others are seeking refuge in abandoned public buildings, in the homes of relatives or have depleted their savings renting accommodation.
As the largest humanitarian actor in Ma’rib, IOM teams are working tirelessly to respond rapidly to the overwhelming needs.
In the last month, IOM has provided cash assistance that has allowed nearly 3,000 people to buy food, medicine and other critical items. The organization has distributed water and provided shelter and other emergency household items to more than 1,000 people who fled with nothing.
Health teams are responding to hundreds of IDPs who have been injured or fallen sick on their journeys, providing emergency health care at mobile and static clinics.
Among those affected are also 4,000 migrants who are stranded in the governorate.
They have found themselves in the middle of the conflict and are increasingly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Often unable to continue their journeys, most struggle to find jobs or access food, basic health care or other services.
IOM scaled up its response to migrants in Ma’rib this year – opening a new Migrant Response Point in July where they can now receive health care, emergency items and other assistance.
IOM’s humanitarian operations in Ma’rib have reached more than 200,000 people with support from the governments of Germany, Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States, as well as EU Humanitarian Aid, the United Nations Central Emergency Relief Fund and the Yemen Humanitarian Fund.

Title: Stopping the march towards famine: A UN Resident Coordinator blog
Content: 03 October 2021
Seven years into a brutal conflict, Yemen is heavily dependent on humanitarian assistance, but the UN is intent on avoiding a repeat of the worst periods of famine and malnutrition its citizens have suffered. On a recent visit to UN headquarters in New York, David Gressly, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, told UN News that, although emergency funds have been received, the humanitarian response remains severely underfunded.
“I recently went up the west coast of Yemen, along a narrow strip of land between the frontlines, to try to reach households that haven't really been able to access humanitarian support. People in these areas were desperate to tell their story.
Usually it’s the mothers who want to tell you how they they're struggling to get access to schools for their children, access to water, to food, or to hospitals. It's a cry for help, a cry that we need to heed.
At one location, we saw a school that had been destroyed in a mortar attacks, and the area was contaminated by landmines, so crops weren't being harvested. Drinking water and medical assistance was on the other side of the frontline, and the people just felt totally squeezed from all sides.
We hear these kinds of stories over and over again and, every two or three days, I read reports of another injury from a landmine or unexploded ordinance, and it’s usually a child.
We've fortunately been able to get enough funding coming in, particularly between April and June, to stop the march towards famine, but it's fragile and it needs to be sustained.
We've received approximately $2.1 billion so far, and last week we've seen additional pledges of approximately $600 million. So, it gets us a little bit closer, but we’re still short of the total requirements.
There are massive gaps in areas such as health, education, water, sanitation, protection support for the eradication of land mines and unexploded ordinance. All of those areas are around 80 to 85 per cent under funded.
We’ve been able to reach children at risk of malnutrition, but funding needs to continue through to the end of this year into 2022. And we need to start preparing for that push for more funding in the coming year.
The COVID-19 pandemic is complicating what is already a very difficult situation. I've been to many hospitals on the ground, and I've seen how crowded they are. Because clinics are no longer functioning outside the provincial capitals there’s a lack of space and the beds are full. Mothers have been turned away and told to go to another province.
So COVID-19 just adds to that burden on top of everything else, including the many other diseases that affect the Yemeni people.
There are three things we really need in Yemen right now. One is to sustain the humanitarian response and stop people from falling into famine or acute malnutrition.
The second is to take a step back and take a look why this humanitarian catastrophe exists. It's linked of course, to the war, but what the war did is destroy the economy and most jobs were lost, so people don't have the income to buy food.Even in the midst of a conflict, we need to have a more economic approach to compliment the humanitarian assistance, and find ways to unlock the economy and help businesses to open up where possible, and generate jobs and income so that families can buy their own food.
And of course, the third element we need is a political settlement to end the conflict. However, we don't have to wait for a political settlement to start on the economic side. We can do a lot right now, if we can mobilize political will.
Eventually this will end. These things always do at some point. My biggest fear at this point in time is that this conflict will just go on and on. I've worked in other countries where this kind of situation has gone on for some 20 or 25 years, and that fundamentally transforms the country to the point where it can't go back to the social norms and development that existed before.
I took this job because I think there is real hope of making a difference, but now is the time to stop this conflict, before we lose a full generation of young people who will know nothing but war.”

Title: أمين عام الأمم المتحدة يطالب بتسريع العمل من أجل الوظائف والحماية الاجتماعية لتفادي تعاف عالمي غير متساو ومنع أزمات مستقبلية
Content: 29 September 2021
قال الأمين العام للأمم المتحدة أنطونيو غوتيريش اليوم إن الاستثمار في نمو ثري بالوظائف وفي الحماية الاجتماعية وانتقال عادل إلى مستقبل خال من الانبعاثات، وبخاصة في البلدان المنخفضة والمتوسطة الدخل، يُمكن أن يمنع مزيدا من تعمق أوجه عدم المساواة بين البلدان المتقدمة والنامية، والتي تفاقمت أثناء أزمة جائحة كوفيد-19 العالمية.
وفي موجز سياساتي أصدره اليوم، وقدمه في فعالية رفيعة المستوى حول الوظائف والحماية الاجتماعية من أجل القضاء على الفقر، لفت الأمين العام إلى أن هناك حاجة لما لا يقل عن 982 مليار دولار في صورة إجراءات حفز مالي للاستجابة للصدمات الفورية في سوق العمل، الناتجة عن الأزمة ولدعم انتقال عادل. كما أن هناك حاجة إلى 1.2 تريليون دولار سنويا كحدود دنيا للحماية الاجتماعية في البلدان المنخفضة والمتوسطة الدخل.
وأقيُمت الفعالية برعاية مبادرة التمويل من أجل التنمية في عصر كوفيد-19 وما بعده، بدعم من منظمة العمل الدولية، وبمُشاركة سياسية رفيعة المستوى على مستوى رؤساء الدول والحكومات، إلى جانب رؤساء المنظمات الدولية الكبرى، والبنوك ومؤسسات التمويل متعددة الأطراف، والمجتمع المدني والقطاع الخاص والمجتمع الأكاديمي.
وبحسب الأمين العام، فإنه لم ينجح أي اقتصاد متقدم في تحقيق تقدم اقتصادي واجتماعي من دون الاستثمار في أنظمة الحماية الاجتماعية والخدمات العامة الجيدة التي تتيح للناس الدعم اللازم للتعامل مع تقلبات العيش.
وفي حين زادت ثروة أصحاب المليارات بما يزيد على 3.9 تريليون دولار بين آذار/مارس وكانون الأول/ديسمبر 2020، فإن تأثير الجائحة على عالم العمل، ضمن عوامل أخرى، زاد عدد الأشخاص الذين يعانون من الفقر المُدقع بين 119 و244 مليون شخص- وهي أول زيادة في الفقر على مدى أكثر من 21 عاما.
وشهد عام 2020 خسارة ما يُقدر بـ 8.8 في المائة من إجمالي ساعات العمل – أي ما يُعادل عدد ساعات عمل 255 مليون شخص بدوام كامل في عام واحد.
ويرتبط هذا بخسارة في دخل العمال بقيمة 3.3 تريليون دولار قبل الدعم الحكومي.
وبسبب الجائحة، تراجعت الوظائف بنحو ما يقدر بـ 75 مليون وظيفة في 2021 مقارنة بما كانت عليه قبل الأزمة، وتراجع متوقع بقيمة 23 مليون وظيفة في 2022.
ويدعو الموجز السياساتي إلى استثمارات عاجلة في تعاف ثري بالوظائف ومستدام وشامل اجتماعيا. وينبغي على القطاعين العام والخاص زيادة التمويل لتعزيز تلك الاستثمارات بشكل كبير لإعادة العالم إلى المسار الصحيح نحو تحقيق أهداف التنمية المستدامة ولمعالجة المخاطر المتزايدة من تغير المناخ والتدهور البيئي اللذين يُمكن أن يعرضا للخطر 1.2 مليار فرصة عمل – ما يُعادل 40 في المائة من قوة العمل العالمية.
ويستلزم تعاف من الجائحة محوره الناس، لأن تعمل سياسات التوظيف والحماية الاجتماعية جنبا إلى جنب، لا لتحسين مستويات عيش الناس فحسب، وإنما لمساعدتهم على مواجهة التحديات الناشئة في ظل عالم العمل سريع التغير، والانتقال نحو الهدف العالمي بالوصول إلى صفر انبعاثات بحلول 2050.
تسريع وتيرة خلق الوظائف
لتحقيق تعاف غني بالوظائف وانتقال عادل إلى اقتصاد مستدام وشامل للجميع، يدعو الأمين العام إلى "مُسرع عالمي للوظائف والحماية الاجتماعية من شأنه خلق ما لا يقل عن 400 مليون وظيفة ومد الحماية الاجتماعية إلى 4 مليارات من النساء والرجال والأطفال ممن يفتقرون حاليا لغطاء اجتماعي.
ولتحقيق ذياك الهدف، فإن الموجز السياساتي الذي يحمل العنوان، "الاستثمار في الوظائف والحماية الاجتماعية من أجل القضاء على الفقر ومن أجل تعاف مستدام"، يوصي بعدة إجراءات:
- تطوير استراتيجيات وطنية متكاملة وشاملة للتعافي من أجل خلق فرص العمل اللائقة، وخاصة في قطاعات الرعاية والقطاعات الخضراء، والحماية الاجتماعية الشاملة، وانتقال عادل، وضمان أن يكون كل ذلك متسق مع سياسات للاقتصاد الكلي وسياسات مالية مدعومين ببيانات سليمة.
- توسيع الاستثمار في الحدود الدنيا للحماية الاجتماعية كنسبة من الناتج المحلي الإجمالي في الموازنات الوطنية.
- وضع إجراءات سياسية لمد الحماية الاجتماعية للعمال في الاقتصاد غير الرسمي، ولدعم إضفاء الطابع الرسمي على المشروعات والتوظيف، بما في ذلك في اقتصاد الرعاية.
- خلق سياسات فعالة لسوق العمل تساعد العمل على رفع مهاراتهم والتزود بمهارات جديدة للاحتفاظ بوظائفهم أو تغييرها، والتأقلم مع عمليات الانتقال الخضراء والرقمية.
- تطوير بنية مالية سليمة لتعبئة الاستثمارات من أجل فرص العمل اللائقة، والحماية الاجتماعية وانتقال عادل، بما في ذلك عبر نقل حقوق السحب الخاصة لدعم استراتيجيات التعافي إلى البلدان المحتاجة.
- تعزيز التعاون مع القطاع الخاص لتعزيز الاستثمارات في القطاعات الاستراتيجية من أجل تعزيز ريادة الأعمال، والوصول الفعال إلى المشروعات النسائية والمشروعات التي تملكها النساء بشكل خاص، لسد الفجوة في المهارات.
- جعل الاستراتيجيات متسقة مع اتفاقات باريس للمناخ، بحيث تدعم المشروعات والعمال، بينما تضمن في الآن ذاته ألا يتم إهمال الفئات السكانية الضعيفة في الانتقال إلى اقتصادات خالية من الانبعاثات.

Title: UNFPA welcomes USAID support for the health and protection of vulnerable women and girls in Yemen
Content: 29 September 2021
Sana’a, 29 September 2021 – The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance has contributed US$5 million to UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, to provide life-saving reproductive health and protection services to more than 300,000 of the most vulnerable women and girls in Yemen over the next 12 months. Lack of funding continues to critically undermine life-saving services for women and girls in Yemen.
Yemen’s health system is in tatters, a situation exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Reproductive health services are particularly affected. An estimated 5 million women and girls of childbearing age, and 1.7 million pregnant and breastfeeding women have limited or no access to reproductive health services. Only 20 per cent of functioning health facilities provide maternal and child health services.
Displacement and the breakdown of protection mechanisms, driven by nearly seven years of conflict, have drastically increased the vulnerability of women and girls to violence and abuse. An estimated 6.1 million women are in urgent need of protection. Violence and deprivation are also taking a toll on the psychological well-being of Yeminis. One in five people is estimated to suffer from a mental health disorder, yet mental health services remain scarce.
“The suffering of women and girls in Yemen has never been this alarming. They are faced with multiple threats of conflict, famine and the COVID-19 pandemic, which impact them uniquely. Yet, we are faced with a severe shortage of funds which would ensure that women and girls have the services they require,” said UNFPA’s Representative in Yemen, Mr. Nestor Owomuhangi. “We are extremely thankful to USAID for recognising this funding gap. This latest funding will translate into more people – particularly more women and more girls – enjoying the reproductive health and protection services that they urgently need right now.”
This new funding will help UNFPA provide emergency obstetric and maternal health care in 14 hospitals and two mobile health clinics across eight governorates, targeting areas where needs are most severe. Six women and girls’ safe spaces will be supported to provide psychosocial care, legal aid, medical services and livelihood opportunities, while mental health services will be supported in two specialized psychiatric care centres.
UNFPA is the sole provider of essential life-saving reproductive health medicines in Yemen and leads coordination and provision of women’s reproductive health and protection services across the country. To keep reaching the most vulnerable women and girls, UNFPA requires US$100 million in 2021. To date, only 41 per cent of this funding appeal has been received.

Title: FAO and World Bank continue support to Desert Locust surveillance and control operations in Yemen
Content: 24 September 2021
Efforts critical to safeguarding agriculture-based livelihoods as potential locust upsurge threatens to worsen an already precarious food security situation
24 September 2021, Sana’a – A renewed Desert Locust control campaign has been launched in the Yemeni governorates of Lahj, Abyan and Shabwah, as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Bank continues their partnership to support Yemeni authorities in the fight against the Desert Locust.
Intensified control efforts to defend against the locust, widely acknowledged as the world's most dangerous migratory pest, come after increased breeding activity was observed in the targeted areas. This is due to favourable breeding conditions triggered by heavy rains and floods in July and August, providing ideal ecological conditions for the locusts to multiply and spread rapidly. Over 30 Desert Locust control field officers and technicians have been equipped and deployed to infested areas throughout the three governorates in a bid to contain the spread of the pest, which if not urgently addressed, can cause substantial damages to pasture and crops across the country, threatening the food security of agriculture-based communities that are already on the brink.
FAO Representative in Yemen, Dr Hussein Gadain, stressed the need for continued, concerted efforts to confront the spread of the locust, emphasizing its potentially devastating effects on food security in an already fragile context. "A single swarm can duplicate 16-20 times in less than three months if it is not controlled. Coordinating early intervention and early control actions such as these therefore saves time, effort and costs, and reduces the chance of Desert Locust infestations spreading to other regions", he added.
Dr Gadain expressed his gratitude to the World Bank for its continued support to Yemen’s Desert Locust response, citing the Bank’s integrated support to improving food security in Yemen through multiple projects that are providing rural families with opportunities to build sustainable livelihood options. Dr Gadain reiterated FAO's commitment to continue using its technical expertise in the fight against the devastating pest, and called for continued financial support to lessen local infestation in key breeding grounds to prevent new locust swarms from invading neighbouring countries.
The 2-month long campaign, which started at the beginning of September, will extend to the winter breeding season. Desert Locust field teams will track locust activity and status through the implementation of field surveys and rapid interventions that will control local breeding. According to Ashraf AlHawamdeh, FAO’s Emergency Desert Locust Control Project Manager, about 67 1244ha of land has been surveyed during this year’s winter and summer seasons from March to September 2021. "We expect the current surveillance and control operations to reduce the numbers and sizes of infestations and lessen any additional breeding, reducing the risk to crops and pasture", he explained further.
Since 2020, FAO and the World Bank have been working with Yemeni authorities to combat locust swarms through national control campaigns targeting seasonal breeding areas across the country. Through the current Emergency Desert Locust response project financed by the Bank, FAO is supporting the restoration of livelihoods in locust-affected areas and the establishment of a national network of Desert Locust Control Centers (DLCCs) that will include early warning and response systems to allow authorities to rapidly respond to new locust infestations. The warning and response system will be connected to FAO’ Desert Locust Information Service, a global service that receives and analyses data from locust-affected countries to issue warnings and alerts, promoting collaboration among countries and keeping the global community informed on locust developments.
FAO supported Desert Locust control operations have benefited thousands of agriculture-dependent communities whose resilience and coping mechanisms have been eroded by almost seven years of conflict. In 2021, FAO is seeking 90 million dollars to reduce acute food insecurity and safeguard the livelihoods of 6.3 million vulnerable Yemenis.

Title: Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, Opening Remarks on the High-Level Side Event on the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, at the 76th United Nations General Assembly
Content: 22 September 2021
____________
Thank you Nima. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
I want to thank the European Union and the Governments of Sweden and Switzerland for hosting this important event.
It has been almost seven months since we met for the high-level pledging conference on Yemen in early March.
Since then, the crisis has continued unabated. Fighting has escalated in Ma’rib, Ta’iz, Hudaydah and other places.
Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. Millions remain a step away from starvation.
The country’s economy has reached new depths of collapse, and a third wave of the pandemic is threatening to crash the country’s already fragile health-care system.
As always, the most vulnerable people bear the highest costs of this crisis.
For too many of Yemen’s children, war is a fact of life – one that has robbed them of safety, education and opportunities.
Women and girls are more likely to be hungry, sick or exposed to gender-based violence.
Millions of internally displaced people face a daily struggle to survive, with little access to essential services.
Yemen has, however, seen one positive turnaround this year – an increase in support for the humanitarian aid operation.
And that is a credit to all of you gathered here today.
Yemen’s Humanitarian Response Plan is among the most well-funded. Ninety-eight per cent of the pledges made at the event in March have been fulfilled. In total, over $2 billion has been received, representing over half of the appeal’s requirement.
This funding has helped the UN and our partners to prevent famine and pull people back from the brink of despair.
I thank you deeply for your commitment to Yemen.
Thanks to our donors’ generosity, we have been able to deliver assistance in every single one of the country’s 333 districts.
Each month, we provide food, clean water and other life-saving assistance to more than 10 million people.
These are important achievements – but our work is far from done.
We are nowhere near the funding levels of 2019, when our appeal received $3.6 billion – almost 90 per cent of what we required.
A number of sectors still face alarming funding gaps. Humanitarians providing health care, clean water, sanitation and shelter have less than a fifth of the money they need this year.
Without additional funding, these and other forms of critical life-saving support – including food assistance – will have to be reduced in the coming weeks and months.
Excellencies,
Your presence here today is a demonstration of solidarity with the people of Yemen.
However, Yemenis need more than our words or our good intentions. They need our action. Without it, they will not weather this crisis or be able to build a better future – one of safety, dignity and self-reliance.
My ask of you today is threefold.
First, please continue to give generously to the humanitarian operation. Ensuring timely, adequate and balanced funding across the Humanitarian Response Plan is the best way to save lives, protect people and keep famine at bay.
Second, maintain focus on the country’s most vulnerable groups by advocating the need to respect international humanitarian law and protect civilians. We must also listen to people – to women and girls, persons with disabilities and other marginalized groups – and include and empower their voices in all our planning and decision-making.
Third, we must address the root drivers of this crisis. If not, millions of Yemenis will remain stuck in this cycle of suffering. New measures to boost the country’s economy and people’s incomes must be enacted. Imperative among these is lifting restrictions on commercial imports to bring down the price of fuel, food and other essential goods.
It also means doing everything in our collective power to stop this war. Because at the end of the day, peace is what will provide Yemenis the most sustainable form of relief.
Thank you.

Title: 3 million people in Yemen could face ration cuts in October unless new funding arrives, WFP Chief says
Content: 22 September 2021
NEW YORK – The United Nations World Food Programme Executive Director, David Beasley, has urged the world to step-up support for the people of Yemen, saying WFP food assistance in the country could soon start to run out.
Excerpts from David Beasley’s remarks at the High-Level Ministerial Event on Humanitarian Situation in Yemen – New York, 22 Sept 2021
“There’s good news and bad news actually. The good news is that we were really in trouble earlier in the year and we had to cut rations, but major donors stepped up like the US, like Germany, UAE and the Saudis stepped up and allowed us to give again full rations. Because of that we averted famine and catastrophe. However here we are, we are running out of money and by October we will have to cut 3.2 million people in terms of their rations, by December 5 million people of their rations.
In a nation of 30 million people we reach 12.9 million on general food rations, 3.3 million children and woman that are in significant need of special nutrition and we also reach 1.6 million school children. So, our hands are full. There’s a lot going on, and the people are suffering immensely
We’re literally looking at 16 million people marching towards starvation. We need this war to end number 1, and if donors are getting fatigued, well end the war. World leaders need to put the pressure on all parties involved to end his conflict because the people Yemen have suffered enough. They have no coping capacity, prices are collapsing in terms of the devaluation of the riyal, food prices are spiking. They don’t have any money left over to buy anything. It is a heartbreak, it really is.
As [UNICEF Executive Director] Henrietta [Fore] said, as [UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs] Martin Griffiths said many times, every 10 minutes a child is dying from lack of food, lack of nutrition. Do the math. Just do the math. That is a thousand people a week dying from lack of food and nutrition. We are predicting that if we don’t receive the funds that we need in the next 6 months -- which is $800 million -- when we start cutting rations, you could actually see that number go to 400,000 children under age five dying in the next year. What if that was your little girl, and your little boy? We have a moral, obligation, to speak out and step up
These are our children; these are our brothers and sisters we need the donors to step up immediately otherwise children are going to die. Let’s not let them down. Let’s do what we need to do.”

Title: Yemen: Millions of Displaced Persons and Migrants Desperate for Aid Amid Funding Shortfalls
Content: 21 September 2021
Geneva – The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said today millions of lives remain at risk in Yemen, as it echoed a United Nations call for urgently needed funds to allow aid organizations to continue responding to the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.
IOM has appealed for USD 170 million in 2021 to meet the increasing needs of displaced, conflict-affected and migrant communities in Yemen. As of today, only half of these funds have been received. The USD 3.85 billion Humanitarian Response Plan for Yemen is also only funded at 50 per cent.
“Without additional funding, organizations like IOM may have no choice but to drastically reduce operations, which would leave tens of millions of people without food, water and healthcare they rely on to get by each day,” IOM’s Deputy Director General for Operations, Ugochi Florence Daniels, said today ahead of an event on Yemen's humanitarian situation held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly today.
Earlier this year, donors rallied to support the millions of Yemeni and migrant children, men and women facing alarming levels of acute malnutrition and food insecurity, as COVID-19 also threatened their well-being and livelihoods. Generous contributions allowed aid organizations like IOM to maintain programming and avert disaster.
Still, the situation is dire for the more than 20 million people affected by the crisis. Nearly 5 million people are again on the brink of famine, 4 million are displaced, two-thirds of the population relies on humanitarian assistance, and another wave of COVID-19 has arrived. Some 32,000 migrants are stranded and at risk of exploitation and abuse.
Critical areas of the response remain severely underfunded. Aid partners have received less than 10 per cent of funding needed to deliver lifesaving health, water and sanitation, and refugee and migrant support.
“Now is the time to scale up, not down, our lifesaving interventions if we are to avert suffering and keep up with the rising needs that have been compounded by the pandemic,” Daniels said.
Lives can be changed when humanitarian funding is available. Last year, IOM reached 6 million people with humanitarian assistance. This year, the Organization has so far supported 2 million conflict-affected people and migrants with emergency aid.
IOM has maintained lifesaving operations in locations such as Marib, where thousands are fleeing fighting. In keeping with the Organization’s strategy to respond in some of the most underserved areas, IOM has also expanded aid to the west coast of Yemen. In partnership with authorities in Yemen and Ethiopia, IOM successfully relaunched its Voluntary Humanitarian Return programme, helping over 1,000 vulnerable migrants stranded in Yemen so far this year.
These successes would not have been possible without donor support but funding is quickly running out and lifesaving programmes risk reductions.

Title: Restoring and improving access to water and sanitation services in Yemen
Content: 21 September 2021
A new World Bank-funded, UNOPS-implemented project will help restore basic services and improve access for around 850,000 people.
Years of conflict have caused a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, with more than 230,000 deaths at the end of 2020. More than half of those deaths were caused by a lack of access to food, health services and infrastructure. And the COVID-19 pandemic has added yet another challenge for Yemen to grapple with.
As part of the World Bank's Yemen Emergency Human Capital project, UNOPS will help increase access to water and sanitation services in urban, peri-urban and rural areas of the country.
Over two years, UNOPS will work to rehabilitate water supply, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure, using a $30 million grant from the World Bank.
"The project will provide around 850,000 people with access to safer drinking water and improved wastewater collection and treatment services," said Muhammad Usman Akram, Director of UNOPS Multi-Country Office in Amman
Training will also be provided to local workers to ensure that rehabilitated infrastructure is maintained and will continue to benefit local communities for years to come.
"Protecting and investing in the Yemeni people and the institutions that serve them is vital, not only to build resilience during conflict but to safeguard the future of coming generations." Tania Meyer - World Bank Country Manager for Yemen
As part of the project, UNOPS will procure and install water wells with solar-powered pumps as well as solar panels in disadvantaged areas of Yemen, to provide a clean, cost-effective and reliable source of energy. To support COVID-19 response efforts, UNOPS will procure personal protective equipment.
About the Yemen Emergency Human Capital project
The Yemen Emergency Human Capital project – funded by a $150 million grant from the World Bank and implemented by UNOPS, UNICEF and the World Health Organization – aims to increase access to basic health, nutrition, and water and sanitation services while building national and local capacities in Yemen. As part of this, UNOPS is implementing a $30 million water, sanitation and health project. Read more about the Yemen Emergency Human Capital project here.

Title: The Yemen Humanitarian Fund helps to sustain women’s protection services with support to UNFPA
Content: 08 September 2021
Sana’a, 08 September 2021 – UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund welcomed the generous contribution of US$1.3 million from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund (YHF) to assist the most vulnerable women and girls with life-saving protection services.
The funding will help UNFPA to continue its support to seven women and girls’ safe spaces and one safe shelter in the governorates of Al Dhale'e, Marib and Shabwah, where protection needs of women are most severe. This support will enable more than 40,000 women and girls to access a range of protection services over a period of eight months. These services include psychosocial support, medical care, legal aid, livelihood assistance and shelter support.
“With an estimated 6.1 million Yemeni women in need of protection services, it is urgent that essential services for women and girls are not only sustained but also scaled-up,” stated Nestor Owomuhangi, UNFPA Representative to Yemen. “We are grateful for this timely contribution, when women’s protection programmes in Yemen remain severely underfunded.”
UNFPA leads the coordination and provision of women’s protection services across the country. UNFPA’s support to the humanitarian situation in Yemen also responds to the reproductive health needs of women and girls.
UNFPA, is appealing for US$100 million in 2021 for reproductive health and protection services for women and girls affected by the on-going crisis. Only US$41.2 million has so far been mobilised.

Title: Thousands of  Stranded  Migrants  in Yemen  Need Extra Support to  Return Home
Content: 07 September 2021
Aden – As the dangers for migrants in Yemen intensify against a backdrop of conflict and the COVID-19 crisis, nearly 5,000 Ethiopians stranded in Yemen are waiting for their chance to safely return home.
This week, about 300 migrants are scheduled to depart Aden for Addis Ababa on two Voluntary Humanitarian Return (VHR) flights run by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The Organization hopes to continue at this pace, operating two flights per week until the end of the year and plans to expand VHR to other places such as Ma’rib where the conflict persists.
“Since the start of the pandemic, migrants in Yemen have been pushed even further into the shadows,” said John McCue, IOM Yemen’s Deputy Chief of Mission.
So far in 2021, 597 migrants have voluntarily returned on five flights from Aden and 79 others on a flight from Sana’a. A flight from Aden is set to land this afternoon in Addis Ababa and another from there is scheduled for Thursday – a promising sign of progress in securing more opportunities for stranded migrants to voluntarily return in the future.
To sustain this programme, IOM urgently needs USD 3 million from the international community, as well as the continued support of Yemeni and Ethiopian authorities to facilitate the movements.
“We call on donors to make more significant contributions to this crucial lifeline which provides thousands of stranded migrants with their only chance to escape a dangerous situation and make their way home,” McCue said.
An estimated 32,000 migrants are stranded in dire conditions in the country – mainly in urban transit hubs – due to COVID-19 mobility restrictions which have impeded their journeys to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).
These restrictions have meant that smuggling networks on this route are not as lucrative as they once were. To make up for financial losses, some are adopting alternative ways to exploit migrants and make a profit.
Some migrants are forced to work off their debts on farms while others are exposed to gender-based violence (GBV) and abduction for ransom. The vast majority lack access to water, food, sanitation and health care.
Many migrants have become increasingly desperate to return home. Since May 2020, an estimated 18,200 in Yemen have made the perilous return journey by sea to Djibouti or Somalia, using the same network of smugglers they used heading to the Arabian Peninsula. Dozens of migrants have drowned this year after overcrowded boats capsized.
“I've been beaten, detained, and exploited in Yemen,'' said Tigist*, a 24-year-old woman from Ethiopia who travelled home last week. Most nights I went hungry. After everything that happened to me, I am happy to go back to my home and family."
Of those who have travelled home on VHR flights this year, 20 are under the age of 18. More than 10 per cent of new arrivals to Yemen are unaccompanied minors. The so-called Eastern Corridor has some of the world's highest proportions of children using an irregular migration route. In addition to arranging the flights, IOM offers counselling to the migrants before they leave, helps them secure travel documents and liaises with authorities in Yemen and Ethiopia to ensure safe passage and transit.
In Ethiopia, returning migrants are temporarily accommodated at the IOM transit centre, where they are given food, essential non-food items, counselling services, and a transport allowance to their final destinations. The Organization also arranges medical and psychological care, as well as family tracing and reunification for unaccompanied migrant children.
“Facilitating safe voluntary return of migrants from Yemen remains to be an extremely critical programme, and ought to be accompanied by lasting solutions to irregular migration,” said Malambo Moonga, Head, Migration Management Unit for IOM Ethiopia.
“We continue to appeal for investments in sustainable reintegration of returnees and resilience-building in Ethiopian communities with high rates of irregular migration.”
VHR operations from Yemen in 2021 have been supported by the Government of the United States through the Regional Migrant Response Plan and the Government of Germany.

With the recent loosening of restrictions on international movements, migrant arrivals into Yemen have started to show a slow increase, although the overall numbers remain low compared to pre-pandemic years.
According to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), over 138,000 migrants arrived in Yemen in 2019, while just over 37,500 arrived in 2020. As of the end of August 2021, IOM has recorded more than 12,600 migrant arrivals to the country. This accounts for a 60 per cent drop in new arrivals in 2021, compared to 2019.

Title: YHF supports vulnerable groups and ensures access to safe drinking water and critical health services
Content: 31 August 2021
Sana’a, 30 August 2021 – The Yemen Humanitarian Fund (YHF) is empowering aid partners to respond to the needs of vulnerable groups and scale up priority health care services and critical water assistance to millions of people in need. In July, the YHF allocated US$50 million to improve living conditions, access to assistance and protection for people with disabilities, minority groups such as the Muhamasheen, female-headed households, vulnerable children, and other people with specific needs. This was followed by an additional $5.44 million provided by the fund in August to provide fuel support to ensure that critical health facilities and water stations can continue to provide life-saving services to millions of people across Yemen.
“It is critical that vulnerable groups receive life-saving assistance, especially people living in remote areas and under-served areas,” said the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly. “Additionally, health facilities and water stations provide life-saving services to millions of people, and it is vital that they are kept operational.”
“Starting in September 2021, some agencies may revert to reducing programmes, including in water, health and other sectors, due to lack of funding. This would be catastrophic for millions of people,” Mr. Gressly said. “Critical sectors continue to be severely underfunded. The Health Cluster has so far received only some 11 per cent of the funds it needs this year, while the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster has received only 8 per cent of its required funds. It is urgent that donors provide adequate and balanced funding across all sectors to enabled aid agencies to avert the worst.”
The $50 million, provided under the first YHF Standard Allocation in 2021, will target areas where the severity of needs is high, such as As Sawadiyah District in Al Bayda Governorate, Abs District in Hajjah Governorate, and Bayt Al Faqih and Hays districts in Al Hodeidah Governorate, as well as in Al Hazm District in Al Jawf Governorate and several districts in Ma’rib, Abyan and Ad Dali’ governorates. This funding will provide emergency life-saving assistance and protection to internally displaced people, refugees, migrants and host communities who are most at risk due to recent clashes and displacements. About 25 per cent of this funding will be allocated to cash-based interventions, allowing displaced families to pay rent, staving off the risk of eviction, invest in improving their livelihoods or cover their basic needs as they see fit.
Overall, 1.9 million people in need will benefit from 61 projects supported by the first Standard Allocation. Approximately $46 million (92 per cent of the allocation) will go to international and national NGOs as well as Red Crescent Societies (RCS), while $4 million (8 per cent) will go to UN agencies. The funding allocated to national NGOs will amount to 26 per cent of the allocation, exceeding the Grand Bargain commitment on localization of aid.
Provided as part of a Reserve Allocation, a further $5.44 million will ensure that health facilities have access to fuel up to December and water stations and wastewater treatment facilities will have access to fuel up to November. UNICEF will receive $3.86 million to provide 2.4 million vulnerable people with access to clean water and sanitation services. It will support 34 water facilities across Yemen with fuel to ensure access to clean portable water and adequately treat wastewaters. This support is critical to guard against the resurgence of cholera and other waterborne diseases as well as to support COVID-19 prevention.
WHO will receive $1.58 million to provide fuel to 206 health facilities across Yemen to cater to the critical health care needs of 5 million people. The funds will enable these facilities to remain open and run critical lifesaving services such as operating theatres and intensive care units. With only 51 per cent of the health facilities in Yemen fully operational, it is critical that the remaining health facilities remain open, especially at a time when COVID-19 is putting pressure on Yemen’s already overstretched healthcare system.
Additional funding is urgently required to ensure that critical life-saving aid is scaled up and sustained until the end of the year. Yemen remains the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with some 20.7 million people requiring some form of humanitarian assistance and protection.

Title: Shelter needs soar for newly displaced in Yemen’s Marib
Content: 24 August 2021
This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Aikaterini Kitidi – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
As fighting in Yemen’s Marib governorate forces more people to flee, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is warning of alarming levels of humanitarian needs among displaced communities, including for shelter.
Since the beginning of the year, close to 24,000 people have been uprooted by armed clashes, shelling and air strikes in Marib governorate – a region that is already hosting a quarter of Yemen’s four million internally displaced people. They have sought safety in urban centres and about 150 informal settlements.
A recent UNHCR needs assessment showed that conditions at the settlements are deplorable. They have exceeded capacity, hosting in total nearly 190,000 people. Shelters are inadequate, and many have been further damaged by recent floods and fire incidents due to open-fire cooking. Given the scarce resources from humanitarian partners, scores of displaced families have been forced to build their own accommodation, using old blankets and plastic sheeting.
Clean water, latrines, electricity and health facilities are in short supply. Only 21 per cent of residents are reachable by aid organizations due to the prevailing insecurity, as these families were displaced in the vicinity of active frontlines. UNHCR is calling on all parties to the conflict to ensure unimpeded access to the settlements to guarantee the safe delivery of lifesaving assistance.
With nine in 10 of the settlements built on private land and without occupancy agreements, fear is high among the residents about the threat of eviction. Eviction is also a key concern in urban centres, as rental prices have soared after the recent wave of displacements. A striking 85 per cent of displaced families are unable to pay rent on a regular basis as livelihoods opportunities are scarce, and a quarter of those displaced in Marib have no source of income. Further displacement, due to eviction, would only deplete their own resources and increase their needs.
Women and children constitute 80 per cent of the displaced. With limited shelter options, they are the ones who suffer most from the ensuing overcrowding, lack of privacy and limited access to basic services, such as toilets or water.
With our partners, the Society for Humanitarian Solidarity (SHS), and Human Access, UNHCR is providing basic household items, legal assistance and psychosocial support in seven settlements in Marib’s Sirwah district, hosting some 20,000 people. Additionally, we have distributed cash for rent to over 2,800 families, as part of a plan to assist some 6,000 families at risk of eviction.
Ending the conflict is the only way to stop displacement and the suffering of the Yemeni people. UNHCR reiterates its call to all parties to the conflict to take the necessary measures to protect civilians and public infrastructure from the impact of the conflict, and to provide safe passage for civilians fleeing conflict areas.

Title: KSRelief Supports UNFPA to Reach Most Vulnerable Women and Girls with Protection Services in South Yemen
Content: 23 August 2021
Aden, August 2021 – Saudi Arabia’s King Salman Humanitarian Aid & Relief Centre (KSRelief) has supported UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, in reaching over 65,000 of the most vulnerable women and girls in south Yemen with protection services, since January 2021.
KSRelief’s assistance has helped UNFPA to improve gender-based violence services in areas where protection needs of women and girls have grown, with support to eight safe spaces and two shelters across nine governorates.
Since the inception of the project, more than 30,000 people were reached with information on protection services through awareness-raising sessions. Some 800 women faced with violence were provided with livelihood skills training, while over 200 women received cash assistance.
"I am no longer the weak person I was in the past. I feel like a new person. I have graduated from my last training course. I am preparing to start my own business in manufacturing cakes and sweets," tells one women who received training in livelihood skills at a KSRelief-supported women and girls safe space in Marib.
The partnership between KSRelief and UNFPA in Yemen since 2015 is helping to reach hundreds of thousands of women and girls with reproductive health and protection information and services.

NEW YORK, 23 August 2021 - "More than six years ago, adults started a war in Yemen. They did so despite knowing the terrible toll that violent conflict exacts on children.

"The war in Yemen, now in its seventh year, has created the largest humanitarian crisis in the world – one made worse by the public health and socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Since I last spoke with you about Yemen two years ago in the Security Council Chamber, little has changed for the country’s civilian population. Each day, the violence and destruction wreak havoc on the lives of children and their families. This year has seen growing displacement, with 1.6 million children now internally displaced because of the violence – particularly around Hudaydah and Marib.

"Basic services like healthcare, sanitation and education – all of which are vital for the humanitarian response – are incredibly fragile and on the brink of total collapse.

"Widespread lack of access to safe and sufficient water is of the utmost concern. Those who are internally displaced are particularly vulnerable to ongoing water cuts taking place across front lines.

"Meanwhile Yemen’s economy is in frighteningly poor condition. GDP has dropped by 40 per cent since 2015, causing jobs to disappear and family incomes to plummet. About one quarter of the population – including many doctors, teachers and sanitation workers – rely on civil servant salaries which are paid erratically if at all. There is food in Yemen, but those who cannot afford it are at risk of starvation.
"Today in Yemen, almost 21 million people, including 11.3 million children, need humanitarian assistance to survive. 2.3 million children are acutely malnourished and nearly 400,000 children under five suffering from severe acute malnutrition are at imminent risk of death. More than 10 million children and close to 5 million women cannot properly access health services.

"In Yemen, one child dies every 10 minutes from preventable causes, including malnutrition and vaccine-preventable diseases.

"Children’s education in Yemen has also been gravely impacted by the war. Two million children are out of school and one in six schools can no longer be used. Two-thirds of teachers – over 170,000 teachers in total – have not received a regular salary for more than four years because of the conflict and geopolitical divides. This puts around four million additional children at risk of disrupted education or dropping out as unpaid teachers quit teaching to find other ways of providing for their families.
"Children who do not finish their education are trapped in a self-perpetuating cycle of poverty. If out-of-school children or those who have dropped out recently are not properly supported, they may never return to school.

"These are the numbers. But the numbers do not really tell us what it is like to be a child growing up today in Yemen.

"Being a child in Yemen means watching your parents struggle to provide enough food for your family to eat, without which you could starve. It means that if you are fortunate enough to have a school to go to, you could be killed by a bullet, an explosion or by stepping on a mine walking along the road to get there. 

"Or perhaps you are one of the children recruited to join the fighting, used by a party in a non-combat role, or forced into marriage because your family is out of options.

"Being a child in Yemen means you have probably either experienced or witnessed horrific violence to which no child should ever be exposed. It means that if you do survive the war, you might carry the physical and emotional scars with you for the rest of your life, undermining your development and happiness as an adult.

"Fighting around your community means it may be impossible for you to get vaccinated against polio or measles. And if you do get sick, there may be no hospital or clinic for you to safely visit.

"Being a child in Yemen is the stuff of nightmares. 

"We are doing everything we can to help children get through this ordeal. Shoulder-to-shoulder with our partners, we are providing access to clean water and sanitation, along with health, nutrition, protection and education services.

"These efforts include delivering vaccines and supporting primary healthcare centres and hospitals to remain operational. We’re responding to COVID-19 and we’re providing emergency cash transfers to 1.5 million households every quarter — benefitting around 9 million people.

"Across the country, UNICEF is supporting the treatment of acute malnutrition in over 4,000 primary health care facilities and 100 therapeutic feeding centres. We are working to rehabilitate schools and have provided financial support and supplies so that secondary school students can sit for national exams.

"But none of this is enough given the scale of the humanitarian needs amidst the ongoing violence.
"There have been glimmers of progress on the political front – occasional signs of hope that this nightmare could come to an end. Yet there are no tangible signs of peace on the ground. In fact, hostilities have increased significantly in places like Marib. All the while, children continue to suffer. After six years of war, when will parties to the conflict and those with influence over them put children first? 

"Again, I call on them to make every possible effort to keep children safe and abide by their legal obligations to keep them out of the line of fire. This includes sparing essential infrastructure on which children depend from attack – such as health facilities, water and sanitation systems.

"I want to emphasize that respecting and protecting education, including schools, students and teachers is of the utmost importance for Yemeni children and youth. We remain gravely concerned about the severity and frequency of threats and attacks against education and the use of schools for military purposes.
"The implications of such attacks on the safety of students and their ability to enjoy their right to education cannot be overstated.

"All parties bear responsibility for killing and maiming children and all parties have regularly failed to take the necessary precautions to protect civilians. This must end.
"In addition, UNICEF and our partners need sustained, unconditional and uninterrupted humanitarian access to people in need wherever they are in Yemen – no matter who controls the areas they live in. Bureaucratic hurdles should not get in the way of our ability to deliver aid and we value support from donors and Member States in resolving these challenges.

"Such efforts are also crucial for demining work to be carried out safely and effectively. 

"Yemen imports nearly everything, including humanitarian supplies. We must reopen the port of Hudaydah to commercial imports and fuel. Millions more people could be plunged into famine if vital imports remain restricted.

"The last time I addressed the Security Council on Yemen was before the pandemic. COVID-19 has further complicated the already dire humanitarian situation. The health system is hanging by a thread. So is the economy. Vaccination campaigns across the country must be urgently expanded, especially with the emergence of highly transmissible COVID-19 variants.
"I also take this opportunity to urge the international community to increase its financial support to help meet the immediate needs of children, and make longer-term investments to prevent the complete collapse of health, water, sanitation, nutrition, protection and education systems – all of which Yemeni children need now and over the years to come.

"UNICEF and our partners are ready to work with the parties to ensure that the salaries of civil servants are paid regularly – a step that would put money back in the pockets of millions of people, helping families to survive. This would also support the functioning of basic services that are essential to a successful humanitarian response.

"Likewise, we must also take steps to boost people’s incomes. That means protecting remittances, which are a lifeline for millions of families and constitute Yemen’s largest source of foreign exchange.
"Ultimately, children in Yemen need a comprehensive and lasting peace. Parties to the conflict must work to reach a negotiated political solution, prioritizing and upholding the rights of children. Only then will children be able put this nightmare behind them and turn hopefully toward their dreams for the future."

Title: Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mr. Martin Griffiths Statement Briefing to the Security Council on Yemen, 23 August 2021
Content: 23 August 2021
Thank you very much, Mr. President. And thank you, Khaled.
So, I am very pleased to join you today on what is, of course, quite a familiar topic, although from a rather different point of view. And this is my first outing, in fact, in the Council in my new function, so I’m very glad it is concerned with Yemen.
Yemen really is a magnificent country – we were talking just before the session started. It’s home to a rich culture, amazing history, beautiful places, wonderful people. So much more than the war that we discuss here every month.
But after six years of that war, that war overshadows everything.
In my previous role, as Khaled mentioned, I had the immense privilege of trying to help Yemenis to get across that line to make peace to end the war. And during that time, I was repeatedly struck by the shocking brutality of the humanitarian crisis and listened carefully to the briefings of the distinguished Mark Lowcock.
So, I am grateful to have an opportunity now to address those issues to this Council.
There is a lot to address. And in all cases, it is civilians – and as you will hear from Henrietta, particularly children – who are bearing the brunt.
The war grinds on, as Khaled has described, including the devastating Ansar Allah offensive in Marib and clashes along nearly 50 other front lines. Hostilities this year have so far reportedly killed or injured more than 1,200 civilians.
Institutions and public services have imploded, depriving people of clean water, of sanitation, education, health care, and helping to spread diseases like cholera and COVID-19, as we were discussing before the start.
The war has also decimated the economy. This collapse – as I will describe if I may, Mr.
President, shortly – is perhaps the biggest driver of people’s humanitarian needs, including the risk of famine.
And, as if all this were not enough, climate change is taking a toll – a direct, immediate toll.
Rains this year have been among the heaviest ever, with over 100,000 people affected by flooding in the last few weeks alone.
So, the list goes on and on. More than 20 million people in Yemen need humanitarian assistance and protection. That’s about two thirds of the population. And it continues to be quite an astonishing figure.
But out of all those needs, there is perhaps one overarching humanitarian priority: and that is to stop the famine. Today, about 5 million people are just one step away from succumbing to famine and the diseases that go with it. Ten million more are right behind them.
Famine isn’t just a “food problem.” It’s a symptom of a much deeper collapse, as you know. In many ways, it is all of Yemen’s problems rolled into one. It demands a comprehensive response.
That means, of course, providing immediate relief to the millions of people who are on the verge of famine. It also means attacking the problems that are pushing Yemen towards famine in the first place. And it is particularly on this point where I think the world can do more to help.
By October, for example, food aid will probably face cuts. And programmes in other sectors – especially health, water, sanitation and shelter – I’m sure Henrietta will speak to this – are already struggling. And if aid levels fall sharply, there you get the risk of famine roaring back.
Next month, the European Union, Sweden and Switzerland will host a humanitarian event on Yemen during the General Assembly week. That meeting is an opportunity for the world to show its commitment again, renew its commitment to addressing this crisis with new funds.
But, Mr. President, I must be clear that even a well-funded humanitarian operation does relatively little to empower people to look after themselves, which is what most Yemenis want.
The biggest challenge is the economy, and Khaled indeed discussed it already. People in Yemen, as Mark has often said, are not starving because there is no food in the country. They are starving because they can’t afford it.
One reason is because incomes have dried up. GDP has plummeted 40 per cent since 2015, taking many jobs with it. One quarter of the population – including doctors, teachers, health professionals, social workers, water and sanitation workers – these rely on civil servant salaries, which, as you know, are only sporadically, erratically, unreliably paid.
Paying civil servant salaries – not a new issue, much discussed – would put money in the pockets of millions of people. It’s also essential to keeping basic services running – many of which are key institutions for the humanitarian response. So, we are of course eager to work with the parties to continue to try to find a solution to this. And I think there is a lot of work that has been done on this, by certainly the mission, but also by UNDP and others about how to meet these immediate needs.
But we must also take steps also to boost people’s incomes, other people’s incomes. Protecting remittances, for example, which is a lifeline for millions of families and constitute Yemen’s largest source of foreign exchange. And there was recently a story about the possibility of remittances from Saudi Arabia being at risk, and that is of course a very important source of income for many people in Yemen.
It means promoting economic opportunities for farmers, fishing communities and local businesses. And I want to stress that it is not unusual for a humanitarian official, as I am now, to talk a lot about the needs for livelihoods and development funding and institutions to survive through that type of support and assistance.
Another reason many people in Yemen can’t afford to eat is because, as I have said, commodity prices are skyrocketing, not just food. Food is more than three times now as expensive as before the war. Fuel is four times more expensive, which has, of course, knock-on effects on other products.
Prices are rising in part because the Yemeni currency (the rial) has collapsed – a disaster, of course, in a country which relies on imports. Foreign-exchange injections through the Central Bank, and Khaled referred to this, would help stabilize the rial. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been very generous in the past this regard. It’s very good news to hear today’s announcement by the IMF that Yemen will receive, I think, it’s $665 million in special drawing rights, which will also help the liquidity and hopefully stem the fall of the rial.
Prices are also rising because the parties interfere with the market. With the exception of food,
Government restrictions now re-route nearly all commercial imports away from Ansar Allahheld ports, Hudaydah, of course, to Aden and elsewhere. And many of these imports are then shipped by road up to the north of the country, adding to the cost and indeed affecting the black market.
That approach is much more expensive. It opens the door for market manipulation, and the end result is much higher costs and prices for people who anyway can’t afford the prices that went before.
Restrictions on commercial imports beyond the international arms embargo – I want to be very clear about this, Mr. President – should be lifted right away. That means Hudaydah and Saleef ports should be opened without additional impediment. Other market manipulation – like profiteering downstream through the informal market – must also stop.
Doing this will, as Khaled has already said, boost civilians’ access to the goods they need to survive. And he has talked about the need for fuel ships to come into those ports. That is consistent with the obligation of all parties to treat civilians under their control humanely – as is required by international humanitarian law. It is an obligation, it is a responsibility, it is not an option.
It’s consistent with the obligation under international human rights law to uphold an adequate standard of living. Refraining from interference with access to essential goods and services is an important step towards fulfilling that obligation. And I want to make this appeal here to the Council.
On a related point, I believe Sana’a airport should also be re-opened – at least for the thousands of civilians to travel abroad for medical care. International humanitarian law requires all parties to care for the wounded and the sick, and that should include travel abroad when treatment is not available.
To conclude, Mr. President, I have gone on perhaps excessively about the way in which the economy is driving needs and risking famine in Yemen, and that it is also the economy that we need to pay attention to, to give people safety from that threat.
But we must not forget what has caused the economy to collapse in the first place, and that is the war. The world must push, as we have done so often in this chamber, for that nationwide ceasefire that Khaled and the mission is mentioning today.
A ceasefire will give desperate civilians a break. It will create space to address the drivers of the crisis, which I have described in some length, as well as to provide the basis, as Khaled said, of the resumption of the all-inclusive political process necessary to end the war.
I know from my own experience that resuming that political process is no easy task. It is essential. And I want to congratulate Hans Grundberg, who I know well, on his appointment as Special Envoy. He has, of course, all our support for his difficult, essential, central task.
And I hope that the war that has gone on for too long can now come to an end.
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Title: Climate crisis exacerbates humanitarian situation in Yemen
Content: 19 August 2021
Sana’a, 19 August 2021 – Across the world, the climate emergency is wreaking havoc at a scale beyond what the humanitarian community and the people on the frontlines of the emergency can manage. Millions of people are already losing their homes, their livelihoods and their lives as a result of the climate emergency, with those who have contributed the least to the crisis often the most severely impacted. Globally, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) estimates that following climate-related disasters, the number of people in humanitarian need could double to over 200 million by 2050, and humanitarian funding needs could increase to US$20 billion annually by 2030. While the climate is changing everywhere, it is the people living in fragile circumstances who feel the effects most harshly.
In Yemen, vulnerability to natural hazards, floods and droughts have led to the destruction of shelters and infrastructure, restricted access to markets and basic services, wrecked livelihoods, facilitated the spread of deadly diseases and caused fatalities, as well as contributed to population displacement in what is already the world’s fourth biggest internal displacement crisis, with over 4 million internally displaced people. The annual rainy season brings heavy rainfalls, high winds and flooding, particularly to coastal areas. In 2020, at least 13 governorates were impacted by adverse weather, affecting over 62,500 families, while thousands more families have already been impacted in 2021. By blocking passage of roads, flooding also continues to impede the ability of humanitarian partners to deliver lifesaving assistance to people in need.
Driven by conflict and economic collapse, some 5 million people in Yemen are on the brink of famine as the country grapples with increasing food insecurity, rising malnutrition and associated mortality as well as other long-term, irreversible effects on child growth and development. Already, more than 2.25 million children aged below 5 years and over a million pregnant and breastfeeding women are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition this year. With water sources slowly depleting and desertification brought on by agricultural pressures, the already frail food security situation is further threatened by recurrent drought and climate change, which are negatively impacting the availability of arable land and access to safe drinking water.
“This World Humanitarian Day, we add our voices to those of our colleagues around the world to emphasize that the climate crisis is a humanitarian crisis,” said David Gressly, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “Urgent action must be taken to meaningfully address climate change, and to reduce the human and environmental cost of the climate crisis. Otherwise, it is the most vulnerable among us who will once again bear the greatest cost.”
Yemen has been recognized as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis for the past half a decade. Over six years of war, economic collapse and surging public health risks have resulted in more than 20 million people needing humanitarian assistance and protection this year, including 12.1 million people in acute need. The 2021 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, which seeks $3.85 billion to provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance and protection to 16.2 million people in need, is less than 50 per cent funded.

Title: Scaling up Yemen's fight against animal disease outbreaks
Content: 04 August 2021
FAO completes large-scale livestock vaccination and treatment campaign to shield the livelihoods of over 36 000 livestock-dependent households.
4 August, Sana’a– The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has completed a month-long livestock vaccination and treatment campaign in Yemen as part of its continued efforts to control transboundary animal diseases and build resilience of communities through regular vaccination and treatment activities.
Over 600 000 sheep and goats in 16 districts throughout the country were vaccinated against Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) and Sheep and Goat Pox (SGP), and treated against various internal and external parasites and diseases. PPR and SGP are two highly infectious animal diseases that affect most small ruminants in Yemen, decreasing the viability of the livestock sector, which is one of the remaining lifelines and income sources for the majority of the rural population.
According to FAO Representative in Yemen, Dr Hussein Gadain, animal diseases - if not adequately addressed, can have severe consequences on the country's already compromised food security. "In Yemen, where over half of the population is grappling with acute hunger and the resilience of livelihoods has been eroded by six years of continuous conflict, keeping livestock alive and healthy is becoming increasingly vital", he said. "It is campaigns such as these that provide much-needed respite to thousands of vulnerable livestock-dependent households who would otherwise lose their only remaining productive assets ", he added.
The campaign is part of the implementation of a three-year programme titled Supporting Resilient Livelihoods and Food Security in Yemen (ERRYII), jointly funded by the European Union (EU) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), and was carried out in close coordination with local authorities and the Ministry of Agriculture with additional support from the Smallholder Agricultural Productivity Restoration and Enhancement Project (SAPREP) funded by the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GAFSP) under supervision from the World Bank. Under the ERRYII, FAO seeks to shore up the livelihoods options of vulnerable households through interventions such as animal vaccination and treatment campaigns that save livestock assets, giving communities the resilience they need to cope with the conflict-induced crisis. Over 72 teams of local agriculture officers were deployed throughout targeted governorates to oversee vaccination efforts and conduct pre and post efficacy tests.
"Through a simple calculation, we can assess the economic value of vaccinating livestock; one vaccine costs just USD 0.40 compared to over USD 100 to replace a dead animal”, added FAO Yemen's Senior Emergency and Resilience Officer, Andrea Berloffa. Mr Berloffa stressed the importance of extending vaccination efforts to other districts, “the animals saved thanks to this campaign are the main source of food and income for pastoral families, including daily milk supply, which is especially vital for the nutrition and well-being of children and lactating mothers – it is critical that these efforts are extended to other areas that were not reached during this campaign”, he highlighted.
The completed campaign, which is expected to lead to increased income generation for over 36 000 livestock-dependent households, is one of the ways in which FAO is working to protect, rebuild and restore agricultural productivity and create livelihood opportunities in Yemen as millions of Yemenis continue to grapple with the consequences of a devastating conflict.
In 2021, FAO is seeking 90 million dollars to reduce acute food insecurity and safeguard the livelihoods of 6.3 million vulnerable people in Yemen.

Title: UNDP Delivers Personal Protective Equipment to Mine Clearance Teams in Aden
Content: 01 August 2021
28 July 2021 – Aden, Yemen: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has delivered 300 personal protective equipment (PPE) sets to the Yemeni Executive Mine Action Centre (YEMAC) in Aden. This PPE will better enable demining personnel to safely respond to reports of Explosive Hazards (EH) in the community.
"UNDP's commitment to improve community safety through mine clearance and risk awareness across Yemen began in the mid-1990s and continues today," says Mr. Auke Lootsma, UNDP Yemen Resident Representative. "As long as communities remain at risk of injury and death due to explosive hazards, this protective equipment will help keep demining teams safe as they undertake their dangerous but lifesaving work."
The delivery of PPE, worth US$ 650,000, was made possible with funding from Yemen Humanitarian Fund (YHF) and includes helmets, visors, vests and knee pads – critical equipment used during the safe assessment and destruction of explosive hazards.
PPE is essential to reduce risk and protect the lives of mine clearance personnel when used in combination with safe working practices and operating procedures, effective supervision and control and appropriate education and training. In 2021, UNDP has supported Non-Technical Survey, Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) good practice trainings for over 117 demining personnel in Yemen, helping to build the local capacity to identify, report and respond to explosive hazards – including mines, unexploded ordnance and IEDs.
In addition to resource mobilization, UNDP currently works closely with YEMAC, on clearance activities, unexploded ordnance destruction, Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) and is assisting in the improvement of inter-agency and stakeholder coordination through its on-going Emergency Mine Action Project.

Title: US $127 million from World Bank to shore up food security and rural livelihoods in Yemen
Content: 29 July 2021
Support for joint work by FAO, UNDP and WFP comes as hunger intensifies
JOINT NEWS RELEASE
29 July 2021,Washington DC/New York/ Rome - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) have welcomed US$127 million in support, provided by the World Bank, for an interagency project to fight the spread of extreme hunger in Yemen. The project will provide rural families with opportunities to build sustainable household food security.
Humanitarian needs in Yemen continue to rise. The country is reeling from the impacts of over six years of incessant conflict and economic disruptions compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, floods and desert locusts.
Currently, 16.2 million Yemenis face crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above) according to the latest Integrated Food Security Classification analysis. This includes approximately 47,000 people experiencing catastrophic (IPC Phase 5) levels of food insecurity –famine like conditions.
The World Bank grant will focus on delivering immediate support to vulnerable households through cash-for-work opportunities and nutrition support for mothers and children. The project will also provide targeted livelihoods support aimed at boosting agricultural production in the short term, while enhancing agriculture’s contributions to food security and economic activity over the longer term and building capacity for food security management.
“Food insecurity is one of the most pressing human development challenges facing Yemen. Within the broader context of the ongoing conflict and economic crisis, the combination of a high household dependence on food imports, high food prices, and significantly reduced income are having a devastating impact on people’s lives,” said Tania Meyer, World Bank Country Manager for Yemen. “The World Bank is adopting a multi-sectoral approach to food insecurity. The new Food Security Response and Resilience project is a key piece of this operational package, integrating immediate support to households with medium term interventions aimed at building resilience to future shocks”.
The grants were made possible by generous contributions from the Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) (US$100 million) and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) (US$27 million).
Linked-up action on multiple fronts
Approximately US$61 million will support FAO-led activities aimed at increasing production of crop, livestock and fish products, including backyard/garden production; promote climate-smart agriculture; strengthen local-level agrifood systems; and establish national-level agricultural value chains.
“For millions of Yemeni families, backyard food production represents a firewall between them and the most severe manifestations of hunger. So we must boost local food production right now to prevent high acute food insecurity from spreading. But we must also work on building up agriculture as a source of food and jobs that can endure over the longer term – this is why this multi-year funding from the Bank is so important,” said FAO country representative Hussein Gadain.
UNDP will receive US$23.8 million to lead a range of climate change adaptation measures in rural Yemen that will provide immediate access to food by creating temporary employment opportunities through a cash-for-work (CFW) programme. Specifically, the funding will allow for restoring damaged public and collective productive assets, including those affected by the 2020 floods.
“This project is vital in helping Yemenis overcome compounding crises – including the fact that food crisis exists because Yemenis simply cannot afford their food, not because the food is unavailable,” says UNDP’s Resident Representative, Auke Lootsma. “While the project addresses the critical and acute food crisis by putting needed money in people’s pockets to purchase food, it also works to begin to rebuild lost community assets that have either been destroyed or badly damaged in the conflict or in the recent devastating floods.” He adds, “Rebuilding vital infrastructure is a critical starting point for longer-term recovery in Yemen.”
WFP will use US$42.2 million in bank support to improve the nutritional status of vulnerable rural households, focusing on the core role women play in improving food security. The project will address immediate nutrition needs of women and children focused in areas with the highest rates of food insecurity, delivering specialized nutrition products to both treat and prevent malnutrition among this vulnerable group. Meanwhile, WFP will promote women’s entrepreneurship activities by providing both skills development opportunities and start up grants focused on agriculture and food production.
“Evidence shows that when women and girls have better access to information, resources and services, the result is improved decision-making and economic opportunities that leads to increased food security and nutrition for herself, her family, and her community” said WFP Country Director for Yemen, Laurent Bukera. “Promoting the equal and meaningful participation of women will contribute to ensuring a food secure future for Yemen.”
Agriculture’s potential
Agriculture remains Yemen’s most important economic sector but has been severely damaged by the effects of the conflict and disease, which have limited livelihood opportunities.
The country is largely dependent upon commercial imports to satisfy its domestic consumption requirements for wheat, the main staple, while food assistance is a main food source for over one-third of families.
Currently the country’s agricultural sector only supplies around 15 to 20 percent of its food needs due to limited agricultural land and water resources and poor agricultural practices compounded years of war, high fuel prices, and water scarcity.
The World Bank has supported Yemen’s development for more than four decades, cooperating with national and local actors and establishing operational partnerships with key United Nations agencies. These include FAO, the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), UNDP, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), WFP and the World Health Organization (WHO)

Title: UNDP and the Republic of Korea Support Women’s Access to Justice and Health Security
Content: 26 July 2021
---------
26 July 2021 – Aden, Yemen: The Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are working together toward stronger gender justice and health security for 10,000 women and 10,000 children in Aden and Mukalla amid the ongoing conflict and the COVID-19 crisis.
The project, Enhanced COVID-19 Protection through Inclusive Security Governance, will work in partnership with the Yemen Women Union (YWU) to convene women leaders from the Ministry of Interior (MOI), the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour (MOSAL), and the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOPHP) for training and capacity building.
With the on-going conflict now its sixth year, COVID-19 has created a crisis within a crisis in Yemen. As in many other countries, the pandemic has intensified social and economic challenges – in particular for women, leading to a sharp increase in Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and a rapidly shrinking social space for women’s participation in public life. Despite this “shadow pandemic,” Yemeni women have demonstrated immense resilience and solidarity, as demonstrated by YWU’s delivery of protection services for women and children, including access to safe spaces for refuge.
On 11 July, UNDP and YWU successfully launched a five-day joint training course for women police from Ministry of Interior and women staff from Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and Ministry of Public Health and Population in Aden and Mukalla. Training activities will continue until September, building the capacity of 200 women police in five governorates (21 Abyan, 98 Aden, 21 Lahj, 40 Mukalla, and 20 Seiyun) and strengthening their relationships with 20 women social and health workers.
Training topics will include, human rights, GBV, case referral, and community policing, particularly the role of women police to promote gender justice and health security in their communities. UNDP will also facilitate knowledge-sharing on digital gender justice such as prevention and response to GBV cybercrimes, in partnership with experts from the Korean National Police University.
The project will empower women leaders to raise their voices at MOPHP’s Risk Communication and Community Engagement forums in Aden and Mukalla, a key platform for the coordination of COVID-19 response activities across Yemen.
“The financial strain of the pandemic has forced many Yemenis into unchartered territory, finding themselves out of work in a declining economy, or for many women, pressured in to working in new sectors to support their family,” explains Auke Lootsma, UNDP Resident Representative in Yemen. "In these new circumstances, this project will respond to a need for more inclusive and integrated protection and recovery from the consequences of the pandemic by empowering women leaders in public institutions and civil society."
To ensure a sustainable impact, the project will support the development of interagency Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on gender justice and health security in public health crises, engaging relevant ministries and civil society organizations to ensure an inclusive process.
UNDP’s Rule of Law Programme in Yemen will continue to help mitigate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 and conflict by expanding its partnership with women leaders and men champions for gender equality. The generous contribution from the Republic of Korea (ROK) has laid a solid foundation for greater impact and enabled the scaling up of gender justice and health security programming, demonstrating the value ofintegrated policy solutions to Sustainable Development Goal’s 3 (health), 5 (gender), and 16 (justice) and the Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus.

Title: Statement by WFP Executive Director on Qatari funding for humanitarian operations in Yemen
Content: 22 July 2021
----------
WASHINGTON – I am deeply heartened by the announcement from Qatar that it will contribute US$100 million to humanitarian operations in Yemen, where conflict, COVID and economic decline are driving a grinding hunger crisis which is in danger of slipping into famine without adequate funding. This contribution reinforces the opportunity for regional peace and security.
Qatar’s support, part of which will go to WFP, is critical for staving off famine in Yemen and will save millions of lives. I am very encouraged by this latest development in Qatar’s partnership with WFP and my sincere thanks go to the government and people of Qatar for this much-needed expression of solidarity.
Right now, two thirds of Yemen’s population – some 20 million people – need humanitarian assistance with five million at immediate risk of famine. Acute malnutrition is eating away the futures of 2.3 million children and 400,000 are at risk of dying if left without treatment
The international community must not wait for a famine classification in Yemen to act, as Qatar is doing now joining other donors who have generously stepped up to support WFP’s operation in the war-torn country. People do not start dying when a declaration of famine is made. It is their deaths that trigger a declaration.
WFP supports 12.9 million in Yemen with emergency food assistance and provides special foods to treat and prevent malnutrition to 3.3 million children and mothers. To prevent famine in Yemen, WFP needs at least US$1.9 billion in 2021. Not including Qatar, donors have stepped up with just over $1 billion so far this year.
The United Nations World Food Programme is the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate.  We are the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

Title: UNDP Yemen’s New Rapid Financing Facility Project Builds Community Resilience Against Future Crises
Content: 15 July 2021
----------
Hadramout, Yemen: 15 July 2021 – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has launched a new project aimed at supporting Yemen’s national recovery from COVID-19 while building the resilience of local communities to respond more effectively to the on-going pandemic and future crises.

The Rapid Financing Facility (RFF) is designed to catalyze UNDP’s “COVID 2.0” offer - Beyond Recovery: Towards 2030 - through high-quality, high-impact initiatives in Hadramout’s Seiyun district. Working in clear alignment with the UN System’s response under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator, these initiatives will strengthen socioeconomic response capacities by restoring lost livelihoods and strengthening access to basic services.

With support from the Government of Italy, UNDP has designed a multi-pronged, 18-month-project that began implementation in December 2020, together with local partner, SOUL for Development. Project activities include:
“Small businesses have been adversely impacted by the on-going pandemic in Yemen. Compounded by six years of continued conflict and the declining value of the Yemeni Riyal, many businesses have been forced to reduce staffing or close all together,” says Auke Lootsma, UNDP Resident Representative in Yemen. “This innovative project aims to provide Yemenis with new skills and capital to establish or rebuild their businesses in key sectors – including eco-transport.”

This project is expected to benefit close to 15,000 members of the local community, including project participants and their families. The RFF aims to contribute to improved community resilience in the face of future crises, by implementing mutually reinforcing activities geared to financially and socially empower people experiencing aggravated hardship caused by COVID-19.

Title: Adequate Housing Project to rehabilitate 600 homes in Aden launched
Content: 14 July 2021
----------
Aden, 14 July 2021 – A consultation workshop marked the launch of “Adequate Housing Project” in partnership with the Saudi Development and Reconstruction Programme for Yemen (SDRPY), Alwaleed Philanthropies (AP) and UN-Habitat to rehabilitate 600 damaged houses for low-income families in the Yemeni city of Aden.
The project aims to contribute to a sustainable solution for the vulnerable families of IDPs and returnees in Aden city to improve living conditions and the social cohesion of displaced people, returnees and their host communities, in the priority districts of the governorate.
The project, expected to benefit over 4000 people, will also support 200 unemployed youth with vocational training. Some 1600 new jobs will be created during the implementation period in coordination with the Yemeni Government and local authorities, and in cooperation with civil society organizations.
The participants discussed different approaches to reach the most effective implementation plan, selection of targeted neighbourhoods and end beneficiaries. Recommendations were made to be further discussed among parties.
The Head of SDRPY Office in Aden, Mr. Ahmed Madkhali stated: “The Adequate Housing project, came as an extension of the SDRPY’s cooperation and continuous coordination with the Yemeni government and the local authority, and as a result of the agreement signed on 13 January 2021, with AP and UN-Habitat to implement the housing sector support programme in the Republic of Yemen. In addition, the project will contribute to improving the urban landscape of residential neighbourhoods in the governorate of Aden, as the project will restore 600 homes at a rate of 150 homes for each district."
Alwaleed Philanthropies Executive Manager of Global initiative, Abeer AlFouti, stated: “We are proud to work with our partners in this initiative that will secure an adequate housing for Yemen communities. We work hard at Alwaleed Philanthropies to provide long-term solutions and sustainable impact to the most vulnerable segments of society.”
The Deputy Minister of Public Works and Highways Mr. Muhammad Thabet stated: “We in the Ministry are fully prepared to provide support to reconstruction of Yemen. in this workshop, I would like to take the opportunity to thank our partners SDRPY, AP and UN-Habitat and also to highlight the significant damage in houses in Aden due to the ongoing war since 2015.”
He added “We suffer from two main problems, which are the devastation caused by wars, and the problem of natural disasters and climate change. Especially the floods that hit most of Yemen, including Aden.”
UN-Habitat Head of Country office Mr. Wael Al-Ashhab said: “UN-Habitat appreciates the partnership with SDRPY and AP in enhancing our participation in Yemen and enabling us to help and support the most vulnerable groups in Aden through the housing rehabilitation project.

Title: Supporting Yemenis to Lead Economic Recovery
Content: 08 July 2021
UNDP and the Government of Japan launch new project aimed at building community resilience and economic growth
Aden, Yemen: 29 June 2021 – With funding from the Government of Japan, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has launched a new project aimed at helping Yemenis return to, rebuild, and strengthen their communities in Aden and Lahj.

After six years of Yemen's ongoing conflict, the local and national economy continues to decline. The livelihoods of millions of Yemenis have been destroyed following the displacement of over 4 million people as they have been forced to leave their jobs, farms and businesses behind in search of safer locations for their families.

The project, Building Resilient Livelihoods and Improving Protection Services for Conflict Affected Communities in Aden and Lahj (BRISCC) and will run from March 2021 – March 2022. It aims to strengthen community protection, increase security and safety measures, and provide Yemenis with the personal skills and tools they need to lead more resilient lives – ultimately helping the communities in Aden and Lahj, particularly the returnees from displacement, to re-establish a stronger local economy.

Project activities will include:
“UNDP remains fully committed to helping Yemenis rebuild and strengthen their economy. By providing community members with the skills and funds to establish and grow small businesses, Yemenis are empowered to retake ownership of their personal and community recovery. This helps ensure that after the protracted conflict that people can regain their dignity and have a sense of hope and pride in contributing toward Yemen’s recovery,” says Auke Lootsma, UNDP Resident Representative in Yemen.

This project will build on the great achievements of the Yemen Livelihoods and Human Security project (YLHS) (February 2017 – December 2021), through which over 1,100 small businesses have been established with the support of the Government of Japan.

Title: Vocational & business skills training and support project helps improve income prospects for youth
Content: 05 July 2021
-------------------
Sana’a, Yemen – The United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) Vocational and Business Skills Training and Support Project concluded training of 64 community business advisors, half of whom were women. The trained advisors will deliver technical and business advisory services for 1,035 Yemeni youth in four governorates – Dhamar, Hadhramaut, Ibb and Lahj.
Funded by the King Salman Humanitarian and Aid Relief Center (KSrelief), the US$ 3,000,000 partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is implemented by the Small and Micro Enterprise Promotion Service (SMEPS) to help improve Yemeni livelihoods and access to productive services.
“The Project aims to empower young rural women and men with vocational, technical and business skills, and nurture a culture of entrepreneurship among them, enhancing their employability and productive engagement in local economic recovery,” says Ms. Tracy Vienings, UNDP Project Manager.
Currently one-in-four Yemenis have lost their job, and more are underemployed. "Many are barely able to make ends meet,” adds Farouk Al-Salihi, UNDP Project Coordinator. “This project is designed to help bridge the skills gap - restoring access to vocational training after years of conflict.”
The successful trainings have introduced theoretical and practical knowledge in three main areas:
The agro-business training is designed to provide youth with valuable skills in utilizing excess food and avoiding common mistakes. A trainee consultant, Ms. Fatima Al-Eryani, provides an example of how the training will assist the youth. "It will help livestock breeders not only get milk from cows, but also make yogurt to sell. It will also help farmers make excellent use of vegetable surplus as they can either preserve excess food or start processing it into other products like pickles, mayonnaise or jam," she says. "Plus they can sell it to improve their income.”
“The technical and business training, coupled with financial grants, will ensure that more employment opportunities are created and sustained. Linking Yemenis to prospects of micro-finance will motivate the expansion of the micro-economy and stimulate replication”, says Anwar Masood, SMEPS Programmes and Projects Director.
All training activities have been undertaken with COVID-19 safety measures in place. Awareness brochures were also distributed in the local community to raise awareness of COVID-19 protection measures to encourage the regular use of personal protective equipment and social distancing.
About the project:
The Vocational and Business Skills Training and Support Project is funded by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid & Relief Center (KSrelief) and implemented in partnership with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Small and Micro Enterprise Promotion Service (SMEPS). The US$ 3,000,000 project helps improve Yemeni livelihoods and access to productive services through provision of training and support in: agro-business and food processing, textiles and handloom, in additional to technical skills (carpentry, and maintenance of cars, cellphones and appliances). The project also provides the beneficiaries with training on business planning and management.

Title: European Union supports UNFPA for lifesaving aid to women, girls and the displaced in Yemen
Content: 04 July 2021
Sana’a, 13 June 2021 – Nearly half a million of the most vulnerable women and girls in Yemen will receive emergency relief, life-saving reproductive health and mental health services thanks to a EUR 6 million humanitarian contribution from the European Union (EU). The funds will allow UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund to continue providing critical services at a time when its humanitarian response is challenged by limited funds and the rapid spread of COVID-19.
The health system remains in tatters. Nearly half of all health facilities have been forced to close, or are only partially functioning. COVID-19 has aggravated the situation, with roughly 15 per cent of the functioning health system re-purposed to respond to the pandemic. Only 20 per cent of functioning health facilities provide maternal and child health services due to lack of essential medicines, supplies and specialized staff. One in five people suffer from mental disorders, while mental health services remains severely scarce. Some 4 million people have been displaced since the escalation of the conflict, more than 32,000 of them since the beginning of the year.
European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said: “Six years of war have brought the country and health system to their knees. Two-thirds of the population - some 20 million Yemenis - needs humanitarian aid and health assistance. Only an end to the conflict can stop this suffering and downward spiral. Meanwhile, the EU is determined to ensure girls, women and displaced people can find help amid the chaos.”
The new funding will support UNFPA to provide emergency obstetric and maternal health care in 30 hospitals; mental health services in two specialized psychological care centres, and facilitate coordination and enrolment for emergency assistance through the UNFPA-led Rapid Response Mechanism when fighting leads to new displacement.
The European Union has been a major contributor to UNFPA’s humanitarian response in Yemen, providing more than EUR 24 million since 2018. In 2020 alone, more than a million women and girls were reached with life-saving services with funding support from the European Union. “I recently visited Yemen, where I met women whose lives had been transformed by access to reproductive health and protection services. I also saw first-hand the tragic hardship and suffering when communities lack these services,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem.
“Thanks to the European Union’s generous contribution, UNFPA will be able to extend this lifesaving assistance to hundreds of thousands of women and girls.”
UNFPA is the sole provider of essential lifesaving reproductive health medicines in Yemen and leads coordination and provision of women’s reproductive health and protection services across the country. To keep reaching the most vulnerable women and girls, UNFPA requires US$100 million in 2021. To date, only 30 per cent of this funding appeal has been received.

UNFPA, delivers a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.

Title: Protecting Human Capital in Yemen: US$150 million in grants for health, nutrition, and water and sanitation services [EN/AR]
Content: 01 July 2021
-----------
WASHINGTON, June 30, 2021 — The World Bank today approved US$150 million in grants to increase access to basic health, nutrition and water and sanitation services in Yemen.
Yemen has been embroiled in a conflict that, since 2015, has turned the poorest country in the World Bank’s Middle East and North Africa region into the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
By the end of 2020, its death toll had reached [233,000 people]9https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/12/1078972), with half the deaths caused by a lack of food or access to health care, as well as by the lack of basic infrastructure to provide these services. Out of a total population of about 29 million, about 20 million Yemenis are food insecure and at risk of malnutrition, with two-thirds unable to afford enough food and water and sanitation services. Over 4 million people have fled their homes. Communicable diseases, including diphtheria and dengue fever, have spread throughout the country. And, with the onset of COVID-19, Yemen faces yet another challenge.
The new grants for the Yemen Emergency Human Capital Project (YEHCP) will help preserve the institutions and human capital involved in providing essential health, nutrition, water, and sanitation services. Because of the exceptional circumstances, the World Bank will continue to rely on a partnership with UN agencies operating on the ground while focusing on strengthening local institutions.
“Protecting and investing in the Yemeni people and the institutions that serve them is vital, not only to build resilience during conflict but to safeguard the future of coming generations," said Tania Meyer, World Bank Country Manager for Yemen. “The project will provide much needed emergency funds to help deliver quality healthcare for the poorest and most vulnerable, including those living in remote areas.”
The new project will provide essential health and nutrition services to 3.65 million Yemenis; essential Water and Sanitation Services to 850,000 Yemenis, train 3,000 health personnel; and support 388 sites for early warning and disease surveillance systems to detect outbreaks of infectious diseases. Public health programs will also be carried out to prevent polio, malaria, schistosomiasis, and trachoma, amongst others.
“This project builds on the achievements and lessons of a previous and ongoing projects. These have strengthened the health system by supporting 72 hospitals and close to 2,000 primary care facilities, and helped it respond to emergencies involving severe malnutrition and the threat of famine as well as infectious disease outbreaks,” said Jorge A. Coarasa, Senior Economist, Health and Task Team Leader.
The projects reached about 24 million people with health and nutrition services. This included 7.5 million children who were immunized, over 1 million pregnant women who received antenatal care, 2.6 million people who gained access to improved water sources, and 2.2 million people who had access to improved sanitation as well as 5.7 million people who received consumable hygiene kits. UN agencies operating on the ground in Yemen will be the recipients of these grants from the International Development Association, the World Bank’s fund for the world’s poorest countries. This support is aligned with the World Bank Group’s strategy for funding in contexts of fragility, conflict, and violence, which focuses on remaining engaged in countries experiencing active conflict to support key institutions and the most vulnerable communities.
The project will be carried out by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund, and the United Nations Office for Project Services, in collaboration with Yemen’s local authorities.

Title: KSrelief helps WFP provide vital emergency food assistance to famine-risk Yemen
Content: 01 July 2021
---------------------
ROME – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has welcomed a $60 million contribution from the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief) to help meet the urgent food needs of the most vulnerable in famine-risk Yemen.
The contribution, signed by WFP Executive Director David Beasley and KSrelief’s Supervisor-General Dr Abdullah Al Rabeeah on the side-lines of the G20 development ministers meeting in Brindisi, southern Italy, comes as WFP battles to sustain its life-saving operations in Yemen as the ongoing conflict, economic decline, and the impact of COVID-19 makes life harder for millions in Yemen.
“We are currently witnessing an alarming deterioration of the food security situation in Yemen that goes beyond any levels seen before, with 5 million people just a step away from famine”, said Beasley. “We are grateful to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for this urgently needed contribution to WFP’s life-saving operation, without which our large-scale and complex humanitarian response in the country cannot be sustained” he added.
With the contribution from Saudi Arabia through its aid arm, KSrelief, WFP will be able to close critical gaps in our life-saving food assistance programme over the next few months, which supports a total of nearly 13 million people. WFP will procure wheat grain or flour and vegetable oil, staple elements of the monthly food basket provided to families. This will assist 4.9 million severely food insecure people across 15 governorates.
WFP has increased food assistance in all famine-risk areas since the start of the year as additional funds have become available. Yet around 3 million people WFP supports are still receiving food assistance on alternate months as funding remains uncertain.
Around 50,000 people in Yemen are living in famine-like conditions, the first time such critical levels of hunger have been identified in two years. Over 16.2 million people are forecast to be living with acute levels of food insecurity (IPC3+) by mid-2021, requiring immediate humanitarian intervention to survive.
This support comes as Yemen struggles with rising food prices – up to 200 percent above pre-war levels – and a deadly second wave of COVID-19 sweeping across the country and putting pressure on the healthcare system. Emergency food assistance is a lifeline for millions.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has contributed US$858 to WFP’s response in Yemen since 2018, including US$380 million in 2019 that helped WFP scale-up operations to reach 13 million people - pulling Yemen back from the brink of famine and saving lives.
The United Nations World Food Programme is the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. We are the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

Title: World Bank Approves $20 Million in Grants to Support COVID-19 Vaccination Rollout in Yemen
Content: 17 June 2021
WASHINGTON, June 17, 2021 — The World Bank today approved a US$20 million grant package. This package is composed of US$9 million from International Development Association (IDA), US$$7.76 million from the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), and US$3.25 million from the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Fund (HEPR). This is the first additional financing to the Yemen’s COVID-19 Response Project (YCRP), bringing the World Bank’s total contributions to the country’s national COVID-19 response and vaccination campaign to US$47 million.
The additional resources will support some of the deployment costs of administering vaccines to at least 1.3 million people. It will also help cover the costs of monitoring and specialized analysis—carried out by the Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS)—and more training for two national COVID-19 hotline centers in Aden and Sana’a.  The Yemen COVID-19 Response Project will continue to support the early detection and screening of the virus, provide essential medicines and medical equipment to treatment centers, and build the capacity of human resources to address the pandemic.
“Years of conflict have taken a massive toll on the health system in Yemen. Only half of the country’s health facilities remain open and still lack essential items to be fully functional –water, fuel, and oxygen amongst others.” said Tania Meyer, World Bank Country Manager for Yemen. “These additional resources will help strengthen the healthcare system, facilitate the rollout of the vaccine and protect the poorest households from the direct impact of the pandemic.”
The scaled-up YCRP will build on work done since 2017 by the Emergency Health and Nutrition Project (EHNP), which was also supported by the World Bank and implemented through WHO and the UN’s Children’s Fund. That project has supported strengthening the health system through its support to 72 hospitals and close to 2,000 primary care facilities, as well as by responding to emergencies involving severe malnutrition due to a threat of famine, cholera epidemic, and COVID-19.
The expanded health response to the pandemic, supported by development partners, is being coordinated by the Government of Yemen (GOY) and will provide essential resources for the ongoing pandemic response, including vaccination.
“The YCRP Additional Financing will play a significant role in deploying vaccines by supporting the deployment costs involved in administering the vaccine. It will continue improving the services provided by national laboratories, strengthening the surveillance capacity and case management of COVID-19 cases, and ensuring environmental and social safeguards,” said Jorge A. Coarasa, Senior Economist, Health and Task Team Leader.
The project is aimed at helping Yemen mitigate the risks associated with the pandemic by strengthening its local capacity to address them. It will continue working with the country’s existing systems to provide technical health assistance at local levels.
World Bank Group COVID-19 Response:
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank Group has committed over $125 billion to fight the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic, the fastest and largest crisis response in its history. The financing is helping more than 100 countries strengthen pandemic preparedness, protect the poor and jobs, and jump start a climate-friendly recovery. The Bank is also providing $12 billion to help low- and middle-income countries purchase and distribute COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and treatments.

Title: UNOPS to further improve critical urban services across Yemen
Content: 10 June 2021
The World Bank’s International Development Association approved a $50 million grant to further support the Yemen Integrated Urban Services Emergency Project.
Implemented by UNOPS with support from local partners, funding for the continuation of the project comes at a critical time as the country grapples with damaging floods and the effects of COVID-19.
“We are proud to continue to support the World Bank to revitalize critical urban services in cities across Yemen. This additional funding will further help to improve living conditions, generate economic opportunities and build local capacity. Muhammad Usman Akram - Director of UNOPS Multi-Country Office in Amman
More than six years of conflict in Yemen has caused widespread damage to urban infrastructure, including transportation, healthcare, waste management and electricity infrastructure. The damage from conflict and climate-related shocks has further impacted trade, mobility and access to critical services such as healthcare, education and markets.
During the first phase, the Yemen Integrated Urban Services Emergency Project rehabilitated more than 230 kilometres of roads in 8 cities and restored access to critical services for more than 3 million people through improving basic living conditions. A key component of the project aims to boost the local economy and strengthen capacity by partnering with local Yemeni institutions and service providers.

Title: The European Union provides support for WFP's famine relief efforts in Yemen
Content: 07 June 2021
SANA’A – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomes EUR 37 million from the European Union (EU) to support the humanitarian response in Yemen and provide emergency food assistance in response to an alarming rise in food insecurity which has left millions on the brink of famine.
The EU funds will allow WFP to continue to address the urgent food needs of nearly 13 million people in the country through food distributions or cash assistance. Over half of all Yemenis are unable to afford basic food items as over six years of conflict has displaced millions, destroyed livelihoods and left the economy in tatters.
Conditions in Yemen have worsened over the past 12 months and pockets of famine have returned to the country for the first time in two years.
“Thousands of Yemenis are already experiencing famine-like conditions and many more are threatened by intensified fighting and the COVID-19 surge. How much more will Yemenis be forced to bear? The EU will not abandon them in their hour of need,“ said European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič.  “The new EU funding to WFP shows our sustained commitment to ensuring lifesaving food assistance and humanitarian aid reach those most in need. This is the time for everyone to step up and for warring parties to end the conflict that has inflicted years of suffering on the population.”
New contributions from the EU and other key donors have allowed WFP to resume monthly food distributions in Yemen’s worst hunger hotspots over the last few months, a year after funding shortfalls and operational challenges forced ration cuts in Yemen’s north.
More than 350,000 people in 11 districts facing famine-like conditions (IPC5) have received monthly assistance since February. While nearly 6 million people in the nine governorates with the highest rates of emergency food insecurity (IPC4) will receive monthly support from June.
“Hunger is on the rise around the world, but nowhere more than in Yemen, where the scale of the crisis is truly staggering and famine is knocking on the door,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “The European Union has been a strong and consistent supporter of WFP’s work in Yemen, helping deliver life-saving food assistance to the most vulnerable children and their families. But ultimately we are just treating the symptoms of this crisis – the suffering will only end when there is peace in Yemen.”
With the EU’s support, WFP will expand the use of cash transfers to deliver food assistance. Cash transfers provide immediate relief for struggling families while also having a multiplier effects on the local economy, building economic resilience.
EUR 2 million of the EU’s new contribution will go towards the WFP-run United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS), transporting humanitarian workers and cargo. UNHAS recently opened an air route to Marib to support the emergency response for families displaced by fierce ongoing clashes.
Over the last six years, the EU has contributed over EUR 250 million to WFP’s Yemen operation and been a vocal advocate for the need for an accountable and transparent humanitarian response in the war-torn country. Responding to the acute humanitarian crisis requires the support and action of many. Resources remain stretched at a time when needs are rising. Despite strong support so far this year, WFP’s ability to maintain famine prevention efforts through to the end of the year hangs in the balance.

Title: World Bank Approves $50 Million to Continue Improving Critical Urban Services in Yemen
Content: 07 June 2021
Washington, June 7, 2021 – The World Bank Board of Directors today approved a $50 million grant from the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the poorest countries, to support the Yemen Integrated Urban Services Emergency Project (YIUSEP). This additional financing is for restoring access to critical urban services and strengthening the resilience of selected cities in Yemen to external shocks.
Yemen’s cities have been very badly affected by six years of conflict, with the destruction of urban infrastructure widespread. In January 2020, damage in the 16 cities covered by the World Bank’s Yemen Dynamic Needs Assessment was estimated at between US$6.9 billion and US$8.5 billion. Among the 16, Sana’a has suffered the greatest damage, followed by Taiz. Aden and Hodeida have also been severely affected.
Major roads and bridges—and municipal roads in Sana’a, Aden, Ibb, Taiz, Hodeida, Sa’ada and Amran, among others—have been severely damaged. The damage to urban roads has rendered large segments inaccessible to people and vehicles, with negative impacts on trade, mobility, and access to local services like markets, health facilities, and schools. Through YIUSEP, 234 kilometers of urban roads in eight cities have been rehabilitated, and access to critical services has been restored for more than three million beneficiaries.
Recent floods have also caused extensive damage to urban road networks, as well as to a number of key road corridors considered economic lifelines.
“This project is more necessary than ever. In addition to the devastating impact of the conflict and compounding effects of COVID19, Yemen is vulnerable to floods and other climate-related shocks” said Tania Meyer, World Bank Country Manager for Yemen. “Through an integrated approach aimed at building resilience in urban areas, YIUSEP II will support basic services, key corridors and off-grid power to health and education facilities”.
Yemen had one of the lowest per capita levels of electricity consumption—and the lowest level of access to it in the Middle East and North Africa region—before the current conflict worsened in 2015. Its public supply from the national grid has since largely shut down. Light emissions visible from satellite imagery indicate that electricity consumption has decreased by about 75%. The population and economy are suffering greatly from the effects the scarcity of diesel fuel is having on reducing the supply of electricity.
Its impact on critical facilities has been devastating: the country is struggling to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic because many of its hospitals and clinics have been damaged by the conflict and those remaining open face frequent power shortages. Under YIUSEP, solar systems were installed in water wells and 208 health and education facilities.
“The new project will not only support restoring critical urban services but also ensure that the country’s fragile public institutions are sufficiently benefiting from a wide range of training and other capacity building opportunities that can potentially maximize productivity and extend the reach of services to the populations in need,” said Federica Ranghieri, Senior Urban Development Specialist and Task Team Leader.
By working across sectors, the project aims to provide 600,000 Yemenis with access to rehabilitated water and sanitation, rehabilitate 60 kilometers of urban roads, and restore 39,000 megawatt hours of electricity capacity. It will be implemented by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in partnership with local Yemeni institutions. The project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s strategy for countries suffering from fragility, conflict, and violence, which focuses on remaining engaged in countries experiencing conflict in order to support their most vulnerable communities and key institutions.
The newly approved funds bring the total of IDA grants for Yemen to US$2.291 billion since 2016. In addition to funding, the World Bank provides technical expertise to design projects and helps put them in place by developing partnerships with UN agencies.

Title: UN-Habitat improves water distribution and sewer networks Aden, Yemen
Content: 04 June 2021
Aden, Yemen June 2021 - Residents of six districts in Aden - Al Manquleen, Al Rawdha, Sheikh Othman, Teqaneia, Bir Fadhl and Sirah districts – will see major improvements in water and sewage services after UN-Habitat completes its ongoing work. The work is part of the “Prevention of Water Borne Disease Outbreak through Emergency Repair and Upgrade of Damaged Wastewater Facilities in Aden City- Yemen” project funded by the Government of Japan.




At least 6,000 metres of water and wastewater pipelines, including fittings, valves, accessories, and manholes will beinstalled.
Mr. Abdullah Al-Duraibi, the community focal point of the Al Manquleen district thanked UN-Habitat and Government of Japan for standing by them, as the neighbourhood has suffered for a long time from the lack of clean water availability.
Bassam Thabit, a UN-Habitat engineer, explained that “the neighbourhood relied on random water pipes connections on the surface for a long time. Due to the absence of a sewer network, the sewage overflow to the surface from the pits and mixes with drinking water supply though pipes leakages causing water pollution and different diseases.”
The project will improve the water and sewer networks and reduce the risk of waterborne disease outbreaks. It will directly benefit around 25,000 community members living in the targeted areas and create employment. In addition, employees of Local Water and Sanitation Corporation will be trained on assessment, prevention and management of water and wastewater systems.

Title: Transcript of Special Envoy's press conference at Sana'a Airport
Content: 31 May 2021
Good afternoon, thank you all for being here today.
The United Nations has been mediating between the parties to achieve a nationwide ceasefire, lift restrictions on the freedom of movement of people and commodities to and from Yemen, and relaunch the political process. These elements have been under negotiation for over a year now. Throughout this process, we have suggested several ways to bridge the gap between the parties and their positions. I have discussed this plan with Yemeni and Saudi officials in Riyadh several times. I have discussed it also in Muscat, most recently just a few days ago. And I have also discussed it yesterday with Mr. Abdul Malik Al Houthi here, in Sana’a.
need to tell you that there is considerable regional and international support for the United Nations plan and our efforts. But more important than that is the fact that this is the desire of the Yemeni people who wish this war to end and wish to recover their freedoms. We hope that that support from the Yemeni people and from the regional and international organisations, and all the work we have done on the parties for the past year might finally yield results and bring this negotiation, this long negotiation to a successful conclusion.
Our positions, the positions of the United Nations have been clear and unequivocal, and I want to repeat them here for you. This is our view:
First: All impediments to the access of Yemeni people to food and essential commodities, including fuel, must be removed. The flow of imports of goods, including fuel, into and throughout Yemen for civilian use must be ensured as a matter of principle regardless of political and military considerations. All our proposals that we have been negotiating for the past year have included lifting access restrictions on the Hudaydah ports, particularly as it pertains to the entry of fuel ships.
Second: a nationwide ceasefire is urgently required to provide immediate humanitarian relief to the people of Yemen, to open roads for the free movement of people and goods and to return a sense of normal life for the people of Yemen. The continuation of military activities in several parts of the country, including Marib, is undermining in my view the prospects of peace in Yemen. It puts lives of millions at risk. And this war needs to end.
Third: All our proposals have also guaranteed the re-opening of this airport where we are speaking today, Sana’a airport. The opening of this airport to commercial traffic is essential for the freedom of movement. All these proposals are in line with the stated desire and public statements by the parties, by all the parties, about prioritising the humanitarian needs of Yemen. However, we have yet to see an agreement.
Fourth and equally important: an end to the cycle of political upheaval and violence can only be achieved through a negotiated settlement that ushers in a future of sustained Yemeni-Yemeni political dialogue, accountable governance, economic justice and equal citizenship for all. This is the guiding principle for the United Nations’ mediation efforts in Yemen.
It is my view that it is unfair to deny to the people of Yemen the hope that there is an end in sight to their suffering. It is entirely unfair to deny them the prospects of a brighter future. Yemen will be sustainably governed without military dominance. It will also be sustainably governed without external interference.
I know how difficult a decision it is to transition from wartime to peacetime; to demand the greatest concessions and sacrifice in leadership of the parties. It takes courage to move away from war and the suffering of war and to enter into the uncertainties of peace. It takes courage. And I just hope with you that that courage will be found in the leadership and the people of Yemen to end this conflict and build on the issues that I have been discussing. Thank you.
Questions and Answers
[N.B: Questions were posed in Arabic and were inaudible. The questions were roughly translated into English]
We noticed the absence of Hadi, his government, and the Southern Transitional Council in Muscat. The Americans, the Saudis and the Ansar Allah were present there. Is this different approach, the absence of the main parties that should be on the table? What is the role that the Americans play in the Muscat consultations, and is it restricted in only guarantees?
Mr. Griffiths: As you know, the negotiations have been happening for the last year and a half largely due to the COVID virus was shuttle negotiations; I go for one party and then I go to the other, and I take messages from one to the other. No agreement will be reached unless the two parties, the government of Yemen and Ansar Allah, agree. Their obligation, their responsibility is to make those decisions. But it's my job to go anywhere, where I can learn from people how to make progress on these four points. I have just been in Riyadh before Muscat, where I met the senior leadership of the Government of Yemen. There is no exclusion, my mandate is very clear to secure an agreement between the government of Yemen and Ansar Allah to end this war. You asked a question about the US special envoy. We work very closely with Mr. Lenderking, the United States has been very helpful to us, as many other members states. The United Nations envoy works with any member state that can help. That is why I was saying earlier that there is an extraordinary amount of diplomatic consensus in support of these proposals.
The authorities in Sana’a have been asking about the entrance of oil derivatives and also food. Is this difficult for the other party to work on the humanitarian issue?
Mr. Griffiths: As I said earlier, the United Nations has been consistent, every month in the Security Council the last three years in favor of lifting impediments on the entry of ships into Hudaydah. We see this as a humanitarian issue and that the people throughout Yemen need to benefit with no impediments from the flow of commodities. Including fuel. We are working very closely not just perhaps to get some more fuel ships coming in from time to time, but to open up the ports on a normal basis. We are very much encouraged in fact by the responses we get from the Government of Yemen and the Coalition. And I hope we can see progress quite soon on that. But I want to make one additional point: a nationwide ceasefire is as humanitarian as anything can be. To open up the roads to allow children to go to school, to allow the people to go to work, to allow trade to happen, to allow families to be reunited, that’s humanitarian. So we do not see it as neither or, we think both are very important.
There have been many rounds of negotiations between Yemenis and also Yemenis and the Coalition, but so far, we have not seen any initiative that would resume peace to Yemen, when do you think there will be serious negotiations?
Well, look. Nobody can be more frustrated than I am. We have spent a year and a half on things which are relatively simple to describe, the ceasefire, the opening of Sana’a Airport, the opening of Hudaydah ports, the much delayed start of the political negotiations. We have been negotiating this in detail word by word by word with both parties for a year and a half. Let me be honest with you. Sometimes we make good progress, and we think that it’s going to work, that we will get an agreement. And then the war intervenes and one or other party thinks they will gain more in the battlefield, until they do not want to end the war yet. Our call is very simple: stop the war, stop the prospect of military gain, end the conflict, build peace in Yemen, make Yemen a place for the people of Yemen.
You asked me when might happen? I am always accused of being much too optimistic. I am not sure it is going to happen today. We are taking from our meeting yesterday with Abdel Malik al Houthi some ideas which we will share with the other side. What I can say is that there is a real diplomatic energy now, which hasn’t always been the case. I think it is powerful but many of the issues - not all - are humanitarian. I think this is very powerful, very powerful reason for why leaders need to come to an urgent agreement.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Really appreciate it.

Title: FAO launches Market Information System Dashboard to improve the availability of reliable Food Security and Early Warning Data in Yemen
Content: 10 May 2021
10 May 2021- Sana'a: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has launched a Market Information and Early Warningdashboard as part of its efforts to strengthen food security and nutrition early warning data and information in Yemen. The dashboard is the first publicly available near real-time price information in Yemen that will present market data and analysis from 119 markets throughout Yemen's 22 governorates, including providing regularly updated price data on over 103 food and non-food commodities.
Aggravated by six years of conflict, Yemen continues to grapple with high levels of food insecurity. The latest IPC statistics estimate that 54 percent of the total population will require food security assistance by June this year. In this fragile socio-economic context, worsened by shocks such as the COVID 19 pandemic, the availability of timely and accurate food security data remains indispensable for anticipating food security responses. "FAO is working to promote the availability of reliable, freely accessible data to inform evidence-based decision-making in Yemen and other countries around the world through the Hand in Hand Initiative”, commented Mr. Hussein Gadain, FAO Representative in Yemen.  "The Hand-in-Hand initiative pinpoints where agricultural investments in improving food and nutrition security and in poverty reduction can be most effective. The information system launched today is one of the innovations under this initiative that will provide information to facilitate the design and implementation of these need-based responses", he continued.
The newly launched dashboard will be used by various partners ranging from government institutions to humanitarian and development actors. According to Mr. Kamau Wanjohi, Chief Technical Adviser at FAO Yemen, "The information system will also allow private sector entities and individual traders to check trends in food and non-food commodity prices and get information on which markets have favorable prices." The launch of the dashboard is part of larger efforts to strengthen food security and nutrition early warning information systems in Yemen under a project on Food Security and Nutrition Information Systems (FSNIS) implemented by FAO and funded by the European Union (EU). Under the FSNIS, 23 Government Focal Units which collect data on markets and other food security indicators have been established throughout the country, 500 people have been trained in food security and nutrition analyses and 55 agrometeorological weather stations have been rehabilitated and maintained to provide timely, detailed meteorological information to Yemeni farmers and other food security players.
Through the FSNIS's various interventions and continuous development of knowledge sharing platforms to make data available as a public good, food and nutrition security decision-makers in Yemen are able to make informed and timely decisions to save lives and protect livelihoods.
As millions of Yemenis continue to endure the consequences of the ongoing conflict, urgent action is needed to protect, rebuild and restore agricultural productivity and create livelihood opportunities to reduce the alarming levels of food insecurity and nutrition while stimulating economic recovery.  FAO is seeking 90 million dollars to reduce acute food insecurity and safeguard the livelihoods of 6.3 million vulnerable people in 2021.

Title: FAO provides livestock inputs for rural families to sustain food production amidst soaring levels of food insecurity
Content: 19 April 2021
The intervention is expected to safeguard livelihoods, enhance resilience of affected communities and promote early recovery
18 April 2021- Sana’a: The livestock sector in Yemen has been significantly affected by a conflict spanning six years, yet it is one of the remaining lifelines and income sources for the rural population. To increase the resilience of vulnerable livestock-dependent households, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is distributing livestock input packages to over 11,500 livestock farmers in Yemen’s Abyan and Lahj governorates.
The input packages, which include 340 metric tonnes of wheat bran, 690 metric tonnes of feed block and 400 metric tonnes of molasses, are being distributed as part of a three-year programme titled “*Supporting Resilient Livelihoods and Food Security in Yemen (ERRY II)”*. The programme is implemented jointly with the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Food Programme (WFP)with funding from the European Union (EU) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).
“According to the latest IPC statistics, 16.2 million people - 54 percent of the total population in Yemen are likely to experience acute food insecurity by June this year’’, said Hussein Gadain, FAO Representative in Yemen. “Interventions such as these, aim to save livelihoods through the provision of quality inputs and supplies to the most vulnerable Yemeni communities to enhance their resilience and improve their food security and nutrition’’, he added. Mr. Gadain emphasized that the process through which FAO procures and distributes inputs to beneficiaries is undertaken according to rigorous protocols and procedures to ensure the delivery of inputs of the highest quality, and FAO’s global network of technical experts remain committed to uphold these standards.
Under the ERRYII, FAO aims to strengthen livelihood options and shore up productive assets of more than 370 000 vulnerable people, focusing on the most vulnerable populations such as unemployed youth, women, and other marginalized groups in far remote areas. “By prioritizing livelihood programmes that increase food and livestock production, diversifying income sources and developing value chains, FAO is equipping Yemeni families with the tools they need to restore their livelihoods to cope with the conflict-induced crisis.” said Mulugeta Shibru, the FAO’s Yemen Program Officer.
As millions of Yemenis continue to endure the consequences of the ongoing conflict, urgent action is needed to protect, rebuild and restore agricultural productivity and create livelihood opportunities to reduce the alarming levels of food insecurity and nutrition while stimulating economic recovery. FAO is seeking 90 million dollars to reduce acute food insecurity and safeguard the livelihoods of 6.3 million vulnerable people in 2021.

Title: Yemeni business leaders explore means to position the private sector at the heart of reconstruction
Content: 09 April 2021
Business leaders from across Yemen met virtually to discuss how to boost the activities of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry to ensure that the private sector plays a central role in the country’s reconstruction process.
SANAA (ILO News) – The International Labour Organization and the Federation of Yemen Chambers of Commerce and Industry held a series of three webinars for representatives of Governorate Chambers to share their current concerns and shape a new value proposition, reinvent the business model and look for new alliances to boost resilience and sustainability.

The Federation of Yemen Chambers of Commerce and Industry is the national cross-sectoral body representing private sector interests vi-a-vis the governmental authorities and external stakeholders. Its members are the 21 governorate chambers; companies in Yemen have to be affiliated to governorate chambers within the territory they operate. Despite the conflict and the consequent country fragmentation, the Federation has managed in recent years to maintain close contacts with most governorate chambers, and is an important platform for business leaders to meet and maintain commercial relations across Yemen.
Fifteen business leaders attended the series of webinars from 25 March to 8 April 2021, connecting from various cities across Yemen: Sana’a, Aden, Taiz, Alhodeida, Ibb, Al-Mukalla’a and Seiyun in Hadramoot.

Yemen’s economic and social prospects in 2021 and beyond are uncertain, hinging on the political and security situation. Most recently, the compounded threats of continued conflict, the spread of COVID-19 and environmental issues have pushed the country into an extremely fragile situation. A cessation of violence and hope for political reconciliation and the reintegration of state institutions would improve the operating environment for the private sector, and facilitate the reconstruction of the economy and rebuilding of the country’s social fabric.
“In Yemen there used to be 500,000 industrial establishments. Around 50 per cent stopped their operations or were forced into the informal market. The main problems they face are double taxation, lack of road and port infrastructure, corruption and insecurity,” said Vice Chairman of the Federation Mr Abubaker Salem Baobaid. This sharp decrease in industrial activities has deeply impacted the financial and operational capacities of the chambers, which derive most of their income from membership fees. Many chambers had to lay off up to half of their staff due to their inability to pay salaries. Additionally, a number of chambers buildings were damaged by the war.
“It is essential to give a chance to the Federation and governorate chambers to reactivate and expand their operations. In the past, the chambers played a substantial role in economic and socio development in Yemen,” continued Mr Baobaid. “Relations with the government and, and public-private dialogue in general, is too weak at the moment. The government needs assistance and the private sector is ready to help. The right channels and mechanisms should be established. We should bear in mind that the private sector is an essential asset for the country’s stability.”
A number of international business leaders who have been instrumental in maintaining business networks and promoting peace processes in their own countries shared their experience during the webinars. Mr Suresh de Mel, CEO and Chair of the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, illustrated the role that the private sector played in peacebuilding in Sri Lanka. “Engaging with media, improving visibility and outreach of the private sector within the community and maintaining and even boosting commercial ties across the entire country were some of the key ingredients of the Business for Peace campaign in Sri Lanka,” Mr de Mel explained.
In the closing session, participants discussed short-term priorities to reposition the Federation and the individual chambers and ensure that the private sector would have a central role in the peacebuilding and reconstruction process. Participants identified the top priorities as building a unified database system to accurately assess the number of companies still operating in selected governorates; developing a communication strategy to reconnect external stakeholders with companies; and mapping the most pressing needs of companies in order to design new business development services in Yemen.
“If the chambers can return to the same level of activity they had before the conflict, they will greatly contribute to reconstruction efforts in Yemen and rebuilding its economy. We count on ILO expertise to support us in increasing our representativeness, influence and outreach,” Mr Mohammad Qaflah, Secretary General of the Federation of Yemeni Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said in his closing remarks.

Aden, Yemen, 31 March 2021 – Today, Yemen received 360 000 COVID-19 vaccine doses shipped via the COVAX Facility, a partnership between the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO). The AstraZeneca vaccines licensed and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India will enable health workers and other priority populations vulnerable to COVID-19 to be protected against the virus.
UNICEF Representative, Philippe Duamelle, and WHO Representative, Dr Adham Ismail, took delivery of the vaccines in Aden, together with the Minister of Health and Population Dr Qasim Buhaibeh, and the Deputy Minister of Public Health and Population Dr Ali Alwaleedi. The 360 000 doses arrived together with 13 000 safety boxes and 1 300 000 syringes that are critical for the safe and effective roll-out of the vaccination campaign. This first batch is part of 1.9 million doses that Yemen will initially receive throughout 2021.
“The arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine doses is a critical moment for Yemen,” said UNICEF Representative Philippe Duamelle. “As COVID-19 continues to claim lives around the world, Yemen now has the capacity to protect those most at risk, including health workers, so that they can safely continue to provide life-saving interventions for children and families. Vaccines work, vaccines save lives, now let’s start getting people vaccinated,” he added.
“This shipment represents an important step in the fight against COVID-19 in Yemen. It will help save lives, including those at highest risk of serious disease, and will help protect the health system. These safe and effective vaccines will be a gamechanger, but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks, physically distance and avoid crowds,” said Dr Adham Ismail, WHO Representative in Yemen.
“We are delighted Yemen has received its first COVAX vaccine doses and we look forward to the launch of the vaccination campaign,” said Rehan Hafiz, Senior Country Manager Yemen, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “Thanks to the work of the Government of Yemen and of the COVAX partners, and with the support of our donors, we are now able to protect our most vulnerable populations. Our work is only just beginning but the arrival of the first COVAX COVID-19 doses is a major milestone for Yemen.”
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organisations, vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others.

Title: Aid partners appeal for US$3.85 billion to avert famine in Yemen
Content: 17 March 2021
Sana’a, 17 March 2021 – Yesterday, the Humanitarian Country Team in Yemen released the 2021 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP), appealing for US$3.85 billion to provide humanitarian assistance to some 16 million people in need, including 12.1 million people in acute need.
“The toll that more than six years of conflict have taken on the people of Yemen is devastating,” said Mr. David Gressly, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “People in Yemen need urgent humanitarian assistance to fend off hunger, to access essential health services, to maintain their dignity and resilience and to rebuild their communities.”
This follows the release of the 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) on 21 February, which showed that Yemen remains the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and is at high risk of further deterioration. More than 16.2 million people face hunger in 2021, including nearly 50,000 people who are already experiencing famine-like conditions. Some 5 million people are on the verge of famine. An estimated 7.6 million people require services to treat or prevent malnutrition and over 2.25 million children aged below five and more than a million pregnant and breastfeeding women are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition in 2021. With at least one child dying every 10 minutes because of preventable diseases, humanitarian partners estimate that 20.1 million people in Yemen need health assistance.
“Yemen is approaching the point of no return. If we make the wrong choice now, Yemen will experience the worst famine the world has seen in decades,” said Mr. Gressly. “What the international donor community chooses to do next is vitally important. It is a choice between fully funding the humanitarian operation or doing nothing and watching the country fall deeper into famine. I urge donor countries and Yemen’s partners to provide immediate support. The millions of Yemenis who are starving, suffering from disease and bearing the brunt of six years of protracted conflict can’t wait. Yemen can’t wait.”
The 2021 YHRP strategy is centered on three priority objectives: preventing disease outbreaks and reducing morbidity and mortality; preventing famine, malnutrition and restoring livelihoods; and protecting and assisting civilians.
More than 20.7 million people require some form of humanitarian assistance and protection, and the $3.85 billion YHRP will enable 167 partners to assist the millions of people in Yemen in dire need of help. At the high-level pledging event co-hosted by the Governments of Sweden and Switzerland on 1 March, donors pledged only $1.7 billion of the total required to help 16 million Yemenis in desperate need this year. To date, only $374 million has been disbursed to aid agencies.

Title: Japan grants $4 million to promote access to quality education in Yemen
Content: 23 February 2021
The Government of Japan has provided US$ 4 million to UNICEF to promote access to quality learning for at least 135,000 children in Yemen over a period of three years. The grant will also support at least 3,000 teachers in delivering quality education.
Nearly 2 million children are out of school in Yemen, including almost half a million who dropped out since the conflict escalated in March 2015.
“More than ever, children in Yemen need immediate assistance. The education of children in Yemen is on the edge. Children out of school are at increased risk of violence, abuse and exploitation with potential profound effect on their future.”, said Philippe Duamelle, UNICEF Representative to Yemen.” This contribution from the people and Government of Japan is crucial in ensuring children do not miss out on their education and become the future productive citizens that Yemen needs”.
The three-year grant, will be used to:
Since 2016, the Government of Japan has donated more than $39 million to support the education of children in Yemen. This latest contribution comes as a major boost to the efforts of UNICEF and partners aiming to support and improve the education of children across the country tethering from the consequences of a conflict which is threatening all aspects of a child’s life.

Title: Acute malnutrition threatens half of children under five in Yemen in 2021: UN
Content: 12 February 2021
Humanitarian crisis continues to exert a terrible toll on children, warn FAO, UNICEF, WFP and WHO
SANA’A/ADEN/ROME/NEW YORK/GENEVA, 12 February 2021- Nearly 2.3 million children under the age of five in Yemen are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition in 2021, four United Nations agencies warned today. Of these, 400,000 are expected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition and could die if they do not receive urgent treatment.
The new figures, from the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Acute Malnutrition report released today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), UNICEF (the United Nations Children’s Fund), the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, mark an increase in acute malnutrition and severe acute malnutrition of 16 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, among children under five years from 2020.
The agencies also warned that these were among the highest levels of severe acute malnutrition recorded in Yemen since the escalation of conflict in 2015.
Malnutrition damages a child’s physical and cognitive development, especially during the first two years of a child’s life. It is largely irreversible, perpetuating illness, poverty and inequality.
Preventing malnutrition and addressing its devastating impact starts with good maternal health, yet around 1.2 million pregnant or breastfeeding women in Yemen are projected to be acutely malnourished in 2021.
Years of armed conflict and economic decline, the COVID-19 pandemic and a severe funding shortfall for the humanitarian response are pushing exhausted communities to the brink, with rising levels of food insecurity. Many families are having to resort to reducing the quantity or quality of the food they eat, and in some cases, families are forced to do both.
“The increasing number of children going hungry in Yemen should shock us all into action,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “More children will die with every day that passes without action. Humanitarian organizations need urgent predictable resources and unhindered access to communities on the ground to be able to save lives.”
“Families in Yemen have been in the grip of conflict for too long, and more recent threats such as COVID-19 have only been adding to their relentless plight,” said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu. “Without security and stability across the country, and improved access to farmers so that they are provided with the means to resume growing enough and nutritious food, Yemen’s children and their families will continue to slip deeper into hunger and malnutrition.”
“These numbers are yet another cry for help from Yemen where each malnourished child also means a family struggling to survive,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “The crisis in Yemen is a toxic mix of conflict, economic collapse and a severe shortage of funding to provide the life-saving help that’s desperately needed. But there is a solution to hunger, and that’s food and an end to the violence. If we act now, then there is still time to end the suffering of Yemen’s children.”
Diseases and a poor health environment are key drivers of childhood malnutrition,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “At the same time, malnourished children are more vulnerable to diseases including diarrhea, respiratory infections and malaria, which are of great concern in Yemen, among others. It is a vicious and often deadly cycle, but with relatively cheap and simple interventions, many lives can be saved.”
Acute malnutrition among young children and mothers in Yemen has increased with each year of conflict with a significant deterioration during 2020 driven by high rates of disease, such as diarrhoea, respiratory tract infections and cholera, and rising rates of food insecurity. Among the worst-hit governorates are Aden, Al Dhale, Hajjah, Hodeida, Lahj, Taiz and Sana'a City, which account for over half of expected acute malnutrition cases in 2021.
Today, Yemen is one of the most dangerous places in the world for children to grow up. The country has high rates of communicable diseases, limited access to routine immunization and health services for children and families, poor infant and young child feeding practices, and inadequate sanitation and hygiene systems.
Meanwhile, the already fragile health care system is facing the collateral impact of COVID-19, which has drained meagre resources and resulted in fewer people seeking medical care.
The dire situation for Yemen’s youngest children and mothers means any disruptions to humanitarian services – from health to water, sanitation and hygiene, to nutrition, food assistance and livelihoods support – risk causing a deterioration in their nutrition status.
The humanitarian response remains critically underfunded. In 2020, the Humanitarian Response plan received US$1.9 billion of the US$3.4 billion required.

Title: Escalating hostilities in Al Hudaydah Governorate put thousands of civilians at risk
Content: 28 January 2021
Sana’a, 28 January 2021 – Concern is increasing for civilians in southern areas of Al Hudaydah Governorate following an uptick in clashes since mid-January, including shelling of residential areas, putting thousands of civilians at risk. Preliminary reports indicate there have already been civilian casualties, that houses and farms in Hays and Ad Durayhimi have been damaged and over a hundred families – at least 700 people – have been displaced.
“Indiscriminate attacks on residential areas are a breach of international humanitarian law and must stop immediately,” said Mr. Auke Lootsma, Humanitarian Coordinator a.i in Yemen. “The parties must remember that they have a duty to take all necessary measures to protect civilians at all times and allow humanitarians to respond to the injured and displaced.” Across Al Hudaydah, up to eight civilian casualties were reported in the week of 20 January, and scores of houses and farms were damaged. Most casualties were women and children. Initial information indicates that about 120 families were displaced in Ad Durayhimi over the past week, verification of numbers is ongoing.
Field reports signal that clashes and shelling have continued in southern districts of Al Hudaydah over recent days, including in Ad Durayhimi and At Tuyahat, with little or no regard for civilians or their livelihoods. “The conflict continues to exert misery on millions of lives,” said Mr. Lootsma “An immediate end to hostilities is urgently needed to allow humanitarians to conduct needs assessments and provide crucial medical support to wounded civilians and material support to those who have been displaced and lost their livelihoods.” One international medical organization has already engaged its mass casualty plan at a hospital serving the conflict-affected areas while another humanitarian organization is supporting local hospitals with medical items, including dressing kits, to treat the wounded.
The number of civilian casualties in Al Hudaydah Governorate is an ongoing cause of concern. In the last three months of 2020, 153 civilian casualties were reported in Al Hudaydah, the highest number reported in any governorate across the country, with continued clashes close to residential areas.
Yemen remains the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the population – over 24 million people – require some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Only 56 per cent of the US$3.38 billion needed for the humanitarian response in 2020 has been received.

Title: Three civilians killed in Al Hudaydah attack
Content: 03 January 2021
Sana’a, 3 January 2021 – Initial reports indicate that three civilians were killed and at least four others were injured when artillery shells fell in the vicinity of a wedding hall in Al Hawak District in Al Hudaydah City on 1 January.
“It is unacceptable that civilians continue to die in these senseless and indiscriminate attacks,” said Mr. Ally-Raza Qureshi, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen a.i. “I extend my deepest condolences to the families of those who had been killed and wish those injured a full and speedy recovery.”
Attacks causing multiple civilian deaths and injuries have increased in Al Hudaydah in recent months. On 3 December 2020, artillery shells hit the Thabet Brothers Industrial Complex in Al Hudaydah City, killing six civilian workers and injuring ten others. On 29 November 2020, five children and three women were killed when artillery shells hit a house in Al Ghaza village in Ad Durayhimi District. Six other women and children were injured in that attack.
“I call on the parties to the conflict to stop these indiscriminate attacks, which are causing so many casualties among civilians in clear violation of international humanitarian law,” said Mr. Qureshi.
Yemen remains the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the population – over 24 million people – require some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. By the end of December 2020, only 50 per cent of US$3.38 billion needed for the humanitarian response had been received.

Title: On the eve of the international pledging conference, COVID-19 is spreading in Yemen
Content: 29 May 2020
Sana’a – Seven weeks after the first case of COVID-19 was announced in Yemen on 10 April, the virus is spreading unchecked and unmitigated across the country.
“A tragedy is unfolding in Yemen” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen.
“Without sufficient testing capacity, it’s impossible to know precisely how many people are impacted. What we do know is that hospitals are having to turn people away and there are shortages of everything.”
Preliminary reports from intensive care unit (ICUs) indicate a case fatality rate of nearly 20 per cent compared to the global average of 7 percent.
“Two years ago, Yemen faced the worst cholera outbreak in modern history. Last year, Yemen was on the brink of famine. This year, tens of thousands of families have lost everything in once-in-a-generation flooding,” said Ms. Grande. “Working together, we’ve been able to push back on cholera and push back the famine but if we don’t get the funding we need and if more isn’t done to suppress the virus, COVID-19 could engulf Yemen.”
Of 41 major UN programmes in Yemen, 30 will close in the next few weeks. A week after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was announced, agencies were forced to suspend incentives for up to 10,000 frontline health workers from lack of funding.
“The international community has stood with the people of Yemen throughout the conflict, providing generous support for the world’s largest humanitarian operation,” said Ms. Grande. “Millions of innocent people have been saved because donors have stepped forward and helped.”
“With the resources we have, we’re doing what we can,” said Ms. Grande.
“14,000 volunteers are fanning out across the country informing communities about the virus, how it is transmitted and what they can to do to protect themselves. We’re scouring markets around the world to procure the supplies Yemen needs. More than 4,520 metric tons of medical equipment, testing kits and medicine has already arrived in country; 4,500 metric tons are on the way. Supplies are coming by sea, land and air.”
Partners are helping to build, upgrade, equip and train staff in 59 intensive care units across Yemen. An advance team has arrived in country ahead of possibly deploying two high capacity mobile field hospitals. Partners are starting to pay allowances for nurses and doctors and intend to expand this to 9,000 frontline COVID-19 workers as soon as funding is received.
“We have to do more and we can do more,” said Ms. Grande. “If we receive funding.”
Yemen remains the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. Nearly 80 per cent of the population requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. On 2 June at the High-Level Pledging Event in Riyadh, aid agencies will be asking donors for US$2.41 billion to cover essential activities from June through to December, including programmes to address COVID-19.

Title: Yemen in the eye of a COVID-19 perfect storm
Content: 28 April 2020
Sana’a – Aid agencies are deeply concerned by the presence, and the potential for the rapid spread of coronavirus in Yemen. To date, Yemen has been an outlier in the Eastern Mediterranean region with a single laboratory confirmed case of COVID-19 declared on 10 April in Hadramaut.
“Since the first confirmed COVID case, we have warned that the virus is now in Yemen and may quickly spread,” said Ms. Lise Grande, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen.
“The factors are all here. Low levels of general immunity, high levels of acute vulnerability and a fragile, overwhelmed health system.”
Based on the transmission patterns of the virus in other countries, and the passing of seventeen days since the first case declaration, agencies are warning there is now a very real probability that the virus has been circulating undetected and unmitigated within communities. This increases the likelihood of a surge of cases which may quickly overwhelm health capacities.
“There’s no time to lose. People have to be informed accurately and quickly about what is happening so they can do what’s necessary to protect themselves and their families,” said Ms. Grande. “The record is clear,” said Mr. Altaf Musani, WHO Representative in Yemen. “In countries where people are aware and warned, and where there is testing, tracing and isolation measures, transmission of the virus has been interrupted.”
In line with the International Health Regulations (article VI), announcing and managing any potential threat to global health security, including disease, is the responsibility of national authorities.
The United Nations and its front-line partners continue to advocate for necessary steps, provide guidance, and coordinate with and support health authorities to suppress transmission, prepare and equip COVID-specific hospitals and isolation units, secure supplies, identify and treat people with the virus and inform the public about the virus and how communities can protect themselves.
Yemen is the largest humanitarian operation in the world, reaching more than 13 million people each month. Nearly 80 per cent of the population requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and 7 million people are malnourished.
Unless funding is urgently received, 31 of the UN’s 41 major humanitarian programmes, will either reduce or shut in coming weeks. Health partners require hundreds of millions of US dollars for COVID-19 programmes.

Title: Yemen is hit by once-in-a generation floods; tens of thousands of families lose everything
Content: 26 April 2020
Sana’a - Initial reports indicate that more than 100,000 people across Yemen have been impacted by torrential rains and flooding since mid-April. Health authorities in Aden Governorate, one of the hardest-hit areas, have confirmed seven deaths, including four children. Two people are missing, and deaths and injuries have been reported elsewhere.
“Countless families have lost everything,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen.
“This tragedy comes on top of the COVID-19 crisis, which comes on top of the pre-famine last year, which came on top of the worst cholera outbreak in modern history.”
Aden, Abyan, Lahj, Marib and Sana’a governorates and Sana’a City have been worst affected.
Flooding has damaged roads, bridges and the electricity grid, and contaminated water supplies, cutting access to basic services for thousands of people. Conditions are hardest for thousands of families already displaced who have now lost shelter, food rations and household supplies.
Humanitarian agencies have rushed to provide life-saving assistance including emergency health care, food packs, shelter, clean water and survival items. Agencies are also helping to drain water and clean flooded sites.
“Truly, none of us know how much more suffering the people of Yemen can take,” said Ms. Grande.
“The solution is clear. The parties to the conflict need to find the courage to stop fighting and start negotiating.”
“This is the only way this never-ending tragedy will finally stop.”
Yemen remains the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. Nearly 80 per cent of the population requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and 7 million people are malnourished. Of the UN’s 41 major humanitarian programmes, 31 will either reduce or shut unless funding is urgently received.

Title: Humanitarians are racing against time to help Yemen address COVID-19; the odds are stacked against them
Content: 23 April 2020
Sana’a – Humanitarian agencies are rushing to help authorities suppress the spread of COVID19 in Yemen and to prepare and equip facilities in case people become ill.
“It’s a race against time,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “The threat of COVID19 is so terrifying we have to do everything we can to stop the spread of the virus and help the people who may become infected.”
“We have to be frank, the odds are stacked against us. Already we are supporting the largest humanitarian operation in the world, reaching more than 13 million people each month,” said Ms. Grande.
“Operating conditions are restrictive, in some places paralyzing so, and we don’t have enough resources. Until donors see that we are allowed by authorities to do our jobs the right way, in accordance with the same principles respected everywhere in the world, funding is going to remain limited.”
Using existing resources, even as they try to mobilize additional funds, humanitarian agencies are taking decisive steps.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is funding the work of 333 Rapid Response Teams. These five-person teams are present in every single district across the country, responsible for detecting, assessing, alerting and responding to suspected COVID-19 cases. People can reach out to these teams through multiple channels including newly established hotline numbers.
“The aim is to increase the number of teams to 999, a tripling of existing detection capacity,” said Mr. Altaf Musani, the WHO Country Director.
As the leading international health agency in the country, WHO is equipping and helping to upgrade specialized isolation units in the 37 hospitals across the country that authorities have designated for COVID. Thirty-two hospitals have already received equipment and 7 specialized isolation units are now fully operational. The remaining 30 will be fully operational within the next two weeks, with WHO funding.
WHO has moved quickly to secure equipment on global markets, where supplies are limited, prices high and buyers for Yemen face stiff competition from other countries Already, WHO has procured, transported and distributed 520 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 208 ventilators. WHO has purchased 1,000 more ICU beds and 400 ventilators and will transport and distribute these as soon as conditions permit.
In the past two months, WHO has purchased and distributed more than 6,700 testing kits and has secured an additional 32,400 which will arrive in coming weeks. Despite global shortages, WHO is aggressively trying to secure the personal protective equipment needed to meet expected needs for the next six months.
Knowing how important first-line treatment is, WHO is working with partners to re-purpose the 26 Emergency Operations Centres (EOC) which were established at the height of the cholera epidemic to address COVID-19. Partners have already trained nearly 900 health personnel on rapid response, infection control, case management, psychological first aid and helping children cope with stress.
“Helping people to better understand the virus is key to stopping its spread,” said Ms. Sara Beysolow Nyanti, UNICEF Country Representative. “People are worried and afraid for their families and themselves. Getting the right information into their hands is one of the most important things we can do.”
UNICEF has been training 10,000 community volunteers across the country. The role of these volunteers, who are present in nearly every community, is to explain to people how the virus is transmitted, what someone can do to protect themselves and what steps to take if someone becomes ill.
“Fighting COVID-19 is going to be very difficult in Yemen,” said Ms. Grande. “After five years of continuous conflict, a debilitating blockade and the collapse of public payrolls, less than 50 per cent of health facilities are fully functioning. Expecting that a health system which is already fragile, and in many areas broken, to respond to a crisis the size of COVID-19 is unrealistic.”
“This is why it’s more important than ever to work together in a genuine partnership so that we can beat this virus,” said Ms. Grande. “We need the right conditions to let us do our jobs and we need funding.”
Yemen remains the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. Nearly 80 per cent of the population requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and 7 million people are malnourished. Of the UN’s 41 major humanitarian programmes, 31 will either reduce or shut unless funding is urgently received.

Title: Strikes kill scores of civilians in Al Jawf Governorate
Content: 15 February 2020
Sana’a – Preliminary field reports indicate that on 15 February as many as 31 civilians were killed and 12 others injured in strikes that hit Al Hayjah area of Al Maslub District in Al Jawf Governorate.
“We share our deep condolences with the families of those killed and we pray for the speedy recovery of everyone who has been injured in these terrible strikes,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen.
“So many people are being killed in Yemen—it’s a tragedy and it’s unjustified. Under international humanitarian law parties which resort to force are obligated to protect civilians. Five years into this conflict and belligerents are still failing to uphold this responsibility. It’s shocking.”
Humanitarian partners deployed rapid response teams to provide first aid to the victims, many of whom are being transferred to hospitals in Al Jawf Governorate and Sana’a for treatment. Partners are also providing support to the health facilities which are treating the injured. An NGO medical mobile team has been deployed and a second mobile team is being dispatched shortly.
Armed clashes since mid-January have escalated in several districts in Marib, Al Jawf and Sana’a governorates, forcing at least 4,700 families to flee. Humanitarian partners are providing emergency food, hygiene supplies, shelter material, life-saving water, nutrition and protection services to people who need help in these areas.
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis with nearly 80 per cent of the population in need of some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and 7 million people are malnourished.

Title: Attacks on Marib hospitals limit medical services available to thousands of displaced people
Content: 10 February 2020
Sana’a – Initial reports indicate that on 7 February, Al Jafra Hospital, and Al Saudi field hospital in Majzer District in Marib, were hit during clashes. The hospitals, which lie about 75 kilometres north west of Marib City, serve a population of about 15,000, many of them displaced people.
The facilities have been badly damaged, including the intensive care unit, occupational therapy unit, inpatients unit and the pharmacy at Al Jafra Hospital, which is the main hospital in the area. The nearby Al Saudi field hospital, a mobile clinic, was structurally damaged. In addition, a paramedic was injured. Given ongoing hostilities in the area, the hospitals were closed for the safety of staff and patients.
“This is a completely unacceptable breach of international humanitarian law”, said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “It’s terrible that facilities upon which thousands of people depend to survive have been badly damaged.”
“The health sector has been hit very hard during this war,” said Ms. Grande. “Preventing further damage and helping to rebuild it are some of our highest priorities.”
Fighting escalated in districts in Marib and neighbouring governorates in mid-January, scattering up to 4,673 families across Marib, Sana’a and Al Jawf governorates. Many of those fleeing frontline areas were displaced for the second time and have exhausted all their resources. Humanitarians have been rushing to respond to the thousands of people displaced across the region in recent weeks. This includes providing emergency kits of food, hygiene supplies, shelter materials and other essential items to 1,884 families, as well as providing life-saving water, sanitation and hygiene; health; nutrition and protection services.

Title: Third attack on Al Raqw market in Sa’ada in a month kills at least 17 civilians
Content: 25 December 2019
Sana’a– Preliminary field reports indicate that an attack on Al Raqw market in Monabbih District in Sa’ada Governorate on 24 December has left at least 17 civilians dead, including 12 Ethiopian nationals, and injured at least 12 others.
This is the third attack on the same market in a month; 28 civilians were killed or injured in an attack on 20 November and 32 were killed or injured on 27 November, bringing the total number of reported civilian casualties at Al Raqw market to 89 since 20 November.
“We share our deepest condolences and sympathies with the families of those killed and injured,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen.
“The attacks on Al Raqw market raise deeply troubling questions about the commitment of the parties to the conflict to uphold international humanitarian law. Every attack of this kind is a gross violation. The parties responsible for this, an other atrocities, must be held accountable.”
Humanitarian partners are supporting Al Jumhori and Al Talh hospitals in Sa’ada where the injured are being treated. Help is also being provided to the local communities impacted by the attack.
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis with nearly 80 per cent of the population in need of some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and 7 million people are malnourished.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis including 10 million people who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs every month. As of today, the YHRP is 83 per cent funded

Title: Workshop on joint analysis and recovery planning for Aden city
Content: 10 December 2019
The conflict has amongst others resulted in a housing crises: more than 12000 houses in Aden have been damaged, informal settlements have mushroomed as a result of the influx of IDPs, and rents have quintupled in some areas.
Partnering with the European Union, UN-Habitat has been working on the Rapid City and Neighbourhood Profiling project in Yemen to support the humanitarian and recovery response to the Yemen crisis through providing better urban information and analysis.
Building upon the previous rapid city profiling experiences from the Arab states, UN-Habitat is currently developing seven City Profiles to Aden, Sana’a, Sa’ada, Taizz, Al Hudaydah, Al Hawah and Zinjibar. These profiles foster early recovery and contribute to stabilization and peacebuilding by empowering urban communities and to guide investments and capacity building towards this same objective.
As part of this project, UN-Habitat and iMMAP organized a three-day joint analysis and recovery planning workshop for Aden from 24 to 26 November 2019 at the UN-Habitat Yemen Programme office in Amman. The objectives of the workshop were to bring stakeholders together to better understand the situation in Aden, particularly in the area of housing, basic services, governance, heritage, economy, and population, and to develop strategic priorities for a recovery plan of the city. In order to initiate the joint planning discussion, ten officials from different departments and local government in Aden were invited to participate. Mr. Ahmed Hussein Abdulkarim Jawi, General Director of the International Cooperation from the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) “We would like to thank UN-Habitat for this useful workshop, and especially for consulting the government in this planning process.”
The workshop focused on how the conflict has affected the city of Aden in all sectors. The conflict has amongst others resulted in a housing crises: more than 12000 houses in Aden have been damaged, informal settlements have mushroomed as a result of the influx of IDPs, and rents have quintupled in some areas. These developments also threaten cultural heritage sites, as informal constructions encroach on or taken building materials from historical monuments. “ A UNESCO representative also joined, and provided insights on how to protect and preserve heritage in crisis and post-crisis settings.
Based on the challenges and opportunities identified, the participants worked together in several groups to analyse and strategically plan for urban growth, economic recovery, and cultural heritage, with an aim of identifying short-term and mid- to long-term goals for Aden’s urban recovery and reconstruction.

Title: To answer global protests, tackle new inequalities: 2019 Human Development Report
Content: 09 December 2019
2019 Human Development Report says business as usual will not solve new generation of inequalities
Bogota,  Colombia – The demonstrations sweeping across the world today signal that, despite unprecedented progress against poverty, hunger and disease, many societies are not working as they should. The connecting thread, argues a new report from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), is inequality.
“Different triggers are bringing people onto the streets -- the cost of a train ticket, the price of petrol, demands for political freedoms, the pursuit of fairness and justice. This is the new face of inequality, and as this Human Development Report sets out, inequality is not beyond solutions,” says UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner.
The 2019 Human Development Report (HDR), entitled “Beyond income, beyond averages, beyond today: inequalities in human development in the 21st Century,” says that just as the gap in basic living standards is narrowing for millions of people, the necessities to thrive have evolved.
A new generation of inequalities is opening up, around education, and around technology and climate change -- two seismic shifts that, unchecked, could trigger a ‘new great divergence’ in society of the kind not seen since the Industrial Revolution, according to the report.
In countries with very high human development, for example, subscriptions to fixed broadband are growing 15 times faster and the proportion of adults with tertiary education is growing more than six times faster than in countries with low human development.
“What used to be ‘nice-to-haves’, like going to university or access to broadband, are increasingly important for success, but left only with the basics, people find the rungs knocked out of their ladder to the future,” argues UNDP’s Pedro Conceição, Director of the HDR Office, which pioneers a more holistic way to measure countries’ progress beyond economic growth alone.
The report analyzes inequality in three steps: beyond income, beyond averages, and beyond today. But the problem of inequality is not beyond solutions, it says, proposing a battery of policy options to tackle it.
Thinking beyond income
The 2019 Human Development Index (HDI) and its sister index, the 2019 Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index, set out that the unequal distribution of education, health and living standards stymied countries’ progress. By these measures, 20 per cent of human development progress was lost through inequalities in 2018. The report, therefore, recommends policies that look at but also go beyond income, including:
• Early childhood and lifelong investment: Inequality begins even before birth and can accumulate, amplified by differences in health and education, into adulthood. For example, children in professional families in the United States are exposed to three times as many words as children in families receiving welfare benefits, with a knock-on effect on test scores later in life. Policies to address it, therefore, must also start at or before birth, including investing in young children’s learning, health and nutrition.
• Productivity: Such investments must continue through a person’s life, when they are earning in the labour market and after. Countries with a more productive workforce tend to have a lower concentration of wealth at the top, for example, enabled by policies that support stronger unions, set the right minimum wage, create a path from the informal to the formal economy, invest in social protection, and attract women to the workplace. Policies to enhance productivity alone are not enough, however. The growing market power of employers is linked to a declining income share for workers. Antitrust and other policies are key to address the imbalances of market power.
• Public spending and fair taxation: the report argues that taxation cannot be looked at on its own, but it should be part of a system of policies, including public spending on health, education, and alternatives to a carbon-intensive lifestyle. More and more, domestic policies are framed by global corporate tax discussions, highlighting the importance of new principles for international taxation, to help ensure fair play, avoid a race to the bottom in corporate tax rates, especially as digitalization brings new forms of value to the economy, and to detect and deter tax evasion.
Looking beyond averages
Averages often hide what is really going on in society, says the HDR, and while they can be helpful in telling a larger story, much more detailed information is needed to create policies to tackle inequality effectively. This is true in tackling the multiple dimensions of poverty, in meeting the needs of those being left furthest behind such as people with disabilities, and in promoting gender equality and empowerment. For example:
• Gender equality: Based on current trends, it will take 202 years to close the gender gap in economic opportunity alone, cites the report. While the silence on abuse is breaking, the glass ceiling for women to progress is not. Instead, it is a story of bias and backlash. For example, at the very time when progress is meant to be accelerating to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, the report’s 2019 Gender Inequality Index says progress actually is slowing.
A new “social norms index” in the Report says that in half of the countries assessed, gender bias has grown in recent years. About fifty per cent of people across 77 countries, said they thought men make better political leaders than women, while more than 40 per cent felt that men made better business executives. Therefore, policies that address underlying biases, social norms and power structures are key. For example, policies to balance the distribution of care, particularly for children, are crucial, says the report, given that much of the difference in earning between men and women throughout their lifecycle is generated before the age of 40.
Planning beyond today
Looking beyond today, the report asks how inequality may change in future, looking particularly at two seismic shifts that will shape life up to the 22nd century:
• The climate crisis: As a range of global protests demonstrate, policies crucial to tackling the climate crisis like putting a price on carbon can be mis-managed, increasing perceived and actual inequalities for the less well-off, who spend more of their income on energy-intensive goods and services than their richer neighbours. If revenues from carbon pricing are ‘recycled’ to benefit taxpayers as part of a broader social policy package, the authors argue, then such policies could reduce rather than increase inequality.
• Technological transformation: Technology, including in the form of renewables and energy efficiency, digital finance and digital health solutions, offers a glimpse of how the future of inequality may break from the past, if opportunities can be seized quickly and shared broadly. There is historical precedent for technological revolutions to carve deep, persistent inequalities – the Industrial Revolution not only opened up the great divergence between industrialized countries and those who depended on primary commodities; it also launched production pathways that culminated in the climate crisis.
The change that is coming goes beyond climate, says the report, but a ‘new great divergence’, driven by artificial intelligence and digital technologies, is not inevitable. The HDR recommends social protection policies that would, for example, ensure fair compensation for ‘crowdwork’, investment in lifelong learning to help workers adjust or change to new occupations, and international consensus on how to tax digital activities – all part of building a new, secure and stable digital economy as a force for convergence, not divergence, in human development.
“This Human Development Report sets out how systemic inequalities are deeply damaging our society and why,” said Steiner. “Inequality is not just about how much someone earns compared to their neighbour. It is about the unequal distribution of wealth and power: the entrenched social and political norms that are bringing people onto the streets today, and the triggers that will do so in the future unless something changes. Recognizing the real face of inequality is a first step; what happens next is a choice that each leader must make.”

The Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, welcomes the unilateral release of 128 Yemeni detainees by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. “I am grateful to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for this move. This, together with other measures to de-escalate violence are proof of the parties’ good will and interest to provide a conducive environment for peace-making.
I am thankful for the efforts of the International Committee of the Red Cross in facilitating this process,” Mr. Griffiths said. The Special Envoy urged the parties to continue working towards fulfilling their commitment to release all conflict-related detainees as per the Stockholm agreement. “I reiterate my invitation to the parties to work with my office and the International Committee of the Red Cross on the future exchange of detainees in order to alleviate the abject suffering of the families waiting to be reunited with their loved ones,” he said.

Title: New attack kills more civilians in Sa'ada Governorate
Content: 28 November 2019
“With each day, the cost of this war becomes more unbearable,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen
Sana’a – Preliminary reports indicate that at least ten civilians have been killed and a further 22 injured, including four children and a woman, during a 27 November attack on AlRaqw market in Monabbih district, Sa'ada. This attack comes just a week after a similar incident caused the death of ten civilians at the same location. Many of the killed and wounded are Ethiopians.
“We send our heartfelt condolences to all of the bereaved families,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen.
“With each day, the cost of this war becomes more unbearable,” said Ms. Grande. “Every indiscriminate attack on civilians violates international humanitarian law. None of these can be justified—none of them.”
More than 120,600 East African refugees and migrants have entered Yemen this year.
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis with nearly 80 per cent of the population in need of some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and 7 million people are malnourished.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis including 10 million people who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs every month. As of today, the YHRP is 71 per cent funded.

Title: 30 Years of Child Rights Yet Yemen Remains One of the Worst Places to be a Child- UNICEF
Content: 19 November 2019
Children to participate in first ever nation-wide sports activities since the escalation of conflict in 2015
SANA’A/ADEN  – Despite historic gains made for children since the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) was adopted 30 years ago by the United Nations General Assembly, Yemen remains one of the worst places to be a child.
A Continuing brutal conflict and a subsequent economic crisis have left basic social services systems across the country on the brink of collapse with far reaching consequences on children. Today, over 12 million-nearly every child- in Yemen is in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.
In 1991, Yemen ratified the CRC, making it among the first countries in the world to commit to improving rights for children in the country and reporting on progress.
“Those who bear the responsibility, including the Yemeni authorities have fallen short of their promises and commitments to the children”, said Sara Beysolow Nyanti, UNICEF Yemen Representative. “The 30th anniversary of the convention should serve as a stark reminder to all of us to urgently recommit to our accountabilities to help the children of Yemen to survive and grow in a safe and peaceful environment”.
Too many children have been killed by the war in blatant attacks. Children have been killed while playing outdoors with their friends, on their way to or from school or in the security of their homes with their families.
On 20th November, to mark the 30th anniversary of the CRC in Yemen, UNICEF is organizing sports activities for boys and girls in each of Yemen’s 22 governorates to highlight the right to play as an important aspect for the physical and mental development of a child. This also serves as an opportunity to remind parties to the conflict that children should not require such special arrangements just to be able to come outside at the same time to play.
“Every day we strive to deliver on our promise to meet the needs and help realize the rights of the children of Yemen. But the purest form of childhood - play, is so often neglected,” Ms Nyanti said.
“The sports activities organized by UNICEF and partners mean that children can come together, without fear of attack, to play across the country. We have also asked all parties to the conflict to exercise restraint and allow a day of tranquillity on 20th November so that children can play without fear of attacks. Although this does not end their daily suffering, it does show the potential for a peaceful future for Yemen. We hope through this symbolic gesture we can remind the world about the children of Yemen, children who continue to carry the heaviest burden of the ongoing conflict.” Ms Nyanti said
While UNICEF and partners continue to deliver lifesaving services for children in health, nutrition, water and sanitation, as well as protection services, only peace can provide a lasting solution to the deteriorating humanitarian crisis and alleviate the situation of children.

Title: IOM Provides Over 1 Million Health Consultations in Yemen Since Start of 2019
Content: 15 November 2019
Sana’a – With more than four years of conflict pushing the public sector to a breaking point, people in Yemen are struggling to access health care. As part of its emergency lifesaving services and support to the health sector to ensure it continues to function, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has carried out 1,095,072 health consultations for displaced and conflict affected Yemenis and migrants in 2019 (as of 09/11).
Only half of Yemen’s health facilities are currently operating, causing people to travel long distances in search of essential services and forcing many to go without. Prior to the conflict in 2015, public facilities were already strained. Today, the lack of financial resources, doctors, medicine and medical equipment has caused further deterioration, while the increased number of people seeking medical assistance in certain areas has overwhelmed health facilities.
“Our lives are difficult in terms of income, education, health services, water and transportation,” said Maryam, a Yemeni woman living in Birali, Lahj governorate, where IOM helped get the local health centre back up and running. “When there was no health centre, we had to travel to Hadramout or Aden (approximately 120 and 450 kilometres away, respectively); a woman in labour couldn’t do that,” she added.
IOM’s health programming strengthens key public institutions and helps ensure they survive the crisis. To support the re-establishment of Yemen’s primary health care systems, IOM ensures that public health facilities can provide a minimum servi ce package to their target population through provision of human resource, medicines and medical supplies.
IOM is supporting the restoration and operational needs of 86 facilities across Yemen, ensuring effective, safe and quality free health care through over 120,000 consultations per month.
The organization also operates nine mobile health teams, which reach migrants and displaced people who do not have access to traditional health facilities. Four of these mobile teams provide newly arrived migrants with emergency health services along Yemen’s coast.
Complications with import and internal transportation of items, such as medical stock, puts further pressure on Yemen’s health system by causing critical medications to be unavailable in much of the country. IOM has stockpiles of critical medicines, such as antibiotics or medication for management of Type 2 diabetes, in warehouses across Yemen to ensure IOM-run and supported facilities have a constant supply.
“With health needs rising and many people living in locations with virtually no health services, IOM’s provision of health care to conflict-affected communities, internally displaced people and migrants is vital to the continuation of accessible health services and the strengthening of the overall health system in Yemen,” said Dr Nedal Odeh, IOM’s Health Programme Coordinator in Yemen.
Within the over 1 million health consultations, over 19,000 people were provided with psychosocial counselling, 113,000 others received reproductive health consultations, and more than 71,000 people were reached through health awareness-raising activities.
IOM’s health programming in Yemen is made possible through contributions from the Governments of Canada, Finland, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Slovakia, the United States and the United Kingdom. IOM also works in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Yemen Humanitarian Fund and is a principal recipient for the Global Fund in Yemen.

Title: From Cairo 1994 to Nairobi 2019: Reigniting the movement for rights and choices for all
Content: 10 November 2019
World leaders, civil society and private sector gathering in Kenya to commit to actions for ending maternal death, meeting demand for contraceptives and protecting women and girls from violence by 2030
Yemen -- Actions to save mothers’ lives meet the global demand for contraception and stop violence against women and girls by 2030 are the primary focus of a three-day global summit that takes place in Nairobi, Kenya, from 12-14 November 2019.
The Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 is happening 25 years after the groundbreaking International Conference on Population and Development, or ICPD, in Cairo where 179 governments unanimously called for the empowerment of women and girls in all spheres of their lives, including sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights.
At the Nairobi Summit, top government officials, including heads of state, parliamentarians and representatives from non-governmental and civil society organisations will announce financial and programmatic commitments, policies and other initiatives with a view to achieving all the goals laid out in the Programme of Action stemming from the ICPD in 1994.
Today, across the world, an estimated 232 million women want to prevent pregnancy but are not using modern contraception. Each day, more than 800 women die from preventable causes during pregnancy and childbirth that’s about 4380 women each year in Yemen. Each day, hundreds of girls are forced into marriage. And every year, more than 19 percent of girls are subjected to female genital mutilation in Yemen.
The Summit is bringing together an unusually diverse group of people including top government officials, thought-leaders, technical experts, religious leaders, activists and community organizers, young people, business leaders, indigenous peoples, international financial institutions, people with disabilities, academics and many others committed to sexual and reproductive health and rights, as well as media partners.
Five main issues are the focus in Nairobi: sexual and reproductive health as part of universal health coverage; the funding required to realize all goals of the ICPD’s Programme of Action; demographic diversity and its power to drive economic growth and sustainable development; measures to end gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls; and the right to sexual and reproductive health care, even in humanitarian and fragile contexts.
Discussions in Nairobi will also highlight the absolute necessity and the power of gender equality, youth leadership, political and community leadership, innovation and data, and partnerships to accelerate change – recognising that without achieving ICPD the world will not achieve the Sustainable Development Goals that underpin the 2030 Agenda.
The governments of Kenya and Denmark along with the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, are co-convening the summit, which is also receiving financial or in-kind support from other governments and private partner organizations.

Title: Statement by the Chair of the Redeployment Coordination Committee, Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Abhijit Guha
Content: 08 November 2019
Hudaydah, Yemen -  The recent establishment of five Observation Posts along the Hudaydah city frontlines has led to a significant reduction in violence on the ground. The Head of UNMHA and Chair of the Redeployment Coordination Committee, Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Abhijit Guha, commends the commitment of the parties to the work of the Ceasefire Enhancement and De-escalation Mechanism, which was established in September onboard the UNMHA vessel.
However, the past days have witnessed reports of incidents involving the construction of new fortifications, movement of forces, and use of drones – all of which are in contravention of ceasefire agreements between the two parties.
As the situation in Hudaydah remains volatile, Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Guha urges the two Yemeni parties to continue working jointly and in good faith through the Ceasefire Enhancement and De-escalation Mechanism to deal with incidents of escalation in violence in Hudaydah. He reiterates UNMHA’s commitment to support the work of the parties through this Mechanism.
Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Abhijit Guha reiterates his call on the parties to desist from any action in contravention to the Stockholm Agreement.

Title: Strikes damage a key hospital serving hundreds of thousands of Yemenis
Content: 07 November 2019
The hospital is the only facility providing emergency trauma, obstetric and surgical care to half a million people along the western coast.
Sana’a – Preliminary reports indicate that a key hospital serving hundreds of thousands of Yemenis has been badly damaged by strikes which occurred on 6 November in Al Mukha, in Taizz Governorate on the western coast of Yemen.
The hospital, which is run by Doctors without Borders, has been forced to close, and a large warehouse of medical supplies has been destroyed. “Medical facilities are protected under international humanitarian law,” said Ms. Lise Grande, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen.
“Hundreds of thousands of people along the western coast who need emergency assistance, including hundreds who need life-saving surgeries each month, won’t get the help they need because of these strikes.” “This is shocking and completely unacceptable,” said Ms. Grande.
The City of Al Mukha, located 180 kilometres south of Hodeida, is surrounded by northern and eastern frontlines. The hospital is the only facility providing emergency trauma, obstetric and surgical care to half a million people along the western coast.
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the total population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and starvation and 7 million people are malnourished.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis including 10 million people who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs every month. As of today, the YHRP is 71 per cent funded.

Title: Women Peace Leaders Share their Perspectives on Peace in Yemen
Content: 06 November 2019
Women discussed power-sharing and political and security arrangements in the peace process, as well as messaging and advocacy, and shared their perspectives on key issues for the transitional period.
A diverse group of twenty Yemeni women peace leaders from across Yemen and the diaspora convened for a two-day meeting in Amman on 29 and 30 October 2019. The meeting organized by the Office of the Special Envoy for Yemen (OSESGY) aimed at consulting and gathering Yemeni women‘s perspectives on political and security arrangements, as well as on the agenda for the transition in Yemen.
Coming from governorates across Yemen, representatives of at least seven different women’s peace networks, including young women and independent women, participated in the meeting in addition to members of the OSESGY’s women’s Technical Advisory Group. Women discussed power-sharing and political and security arrangements in the peace process, as well as messaging and advocacy, and shared their perspectives on key issues for the transitional period. They were briefed about the latest developments in the Yemeni peace process and engaged in a discussion on the future of this process.
Ola Alaghbary, one of the participants said the meeting was an occasion for her to get a better understanding of the efforts deployed to stop the war in Yemen, and of power-sharing and stakeholder mapping. “This was also a great opportunity for me as a young Yemeni woman, to tell them about our local efforts and initiatives in opening the roads in Taiz and what kind of support they can provide in this respect” she said adding that in Yemen, “young people and women suffer from marginalization in the decision-making process at all levels”.
This meeting was one of many informal discussions with different stakeholders including women, carried out by the Office of the Special Envoy, to get their views on the peace process.

Title: WFP brings vital humanitarian supplies to civilians trapped on Yemeni frontline
Content: 22 October 2019
Sana’a – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has reached families trapped in Yemen’s Durayhimi City with much-needed humanitarian assistance. This is only the second time in over a year that WFP has been able to reach the town which lies about 20 kms south of the port city of Hodeidah.
While most of Durayhimi City’s residents have fled, some 200 civilians remain and are now highly vulnerable as fighting rages around them. There are no functioning health facilities and the shops are bare. Finding enough to eat is a struggle. With each passing day, the war takes more of a toll on those who remain behind.
Last week, WFP and sister UN agencies distributed a three-month supply of food, as well as nutrition supplements, water, medicine, and hygiene kits.
“When we arrived in Durayhimi City, many people were angry that it had taken us so long to get to there and those cries quickly turned to pleas for help,” said WFP Yemen Deputy Country Director Ally-Raza Qureshi who led the mission. “I agree with them - it’s totally unacceptable that these civilians lack safe passage out and that the humanitarian community finds it so difficult to reach them with relief supplies.”
WFP calls on all parties to the conflict to ensure safe passage for civilians in and out of Durayhimi City. Families must be able to come and go freely so they can access medical care, reach markets and regain a semblance of normal life.
Over 20 million Yemenis are hungry and half of them are facing acute shortages of food – just one example of the human cost of Yemen’s war. WFP is providing 12 million of those people who are most in need with monthly food assistance. This is the agency’s largest humanitarian operation in the world. WFP’s ability to alleviate hunger depends on safe, consistent access to its food stocks and to the people it serves.

Hudaydah- The Head of the United Nations Mission to Support the Hudaydah Agreement (UNMHA) and Chair of the Redeployment Coordination Committee, Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Abhijit Guha, welcomes the establishment of four joint observation posts by Yemeni parties along the Hudaydah city frontlines.The two parties finalized written agreements in all four locations and deployed liaison officers at each observation post. Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Guha observed this process on the ground over the past four days.
The establishment of these observation posts, which are designed to facilitate direct inter-party de-escalation in flash point areas seen as susceptible to conflict, follows the agreements reached by both parties during the previous joint meetings of the Redeployment Coordination Committee. The posts operate in conjunction with the recently established 24/7 Joint Operation Centre of the Ceasefire Enhancement and De-Escalation Mechanism, which is supported by the Mission.
Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Guha urges the parties to fully support the observation and liaison process, and the Mechanism to enhance the ceasefire and de-escalate tensions in order to save lives.  He further calls on all parties to reduce rhetoric and support the efforts to maintain the ceasefire in Hudaydah.

Title: Prolonged conflict would make Yemen the poorest country in the world, UNDP study says
Content: 10 October 2019
Brussels —Yemen will become the poorest country in the world if its conflict goes on through 2022, a new report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) projects.
The study was presented in the framework of a series of events showcasing the partnership between the European Union and UNDP in Brussels which is helping vulnerable people meet their most urgent needs such as access to basic services, delivery of services and revitalize local governance and economic development to help Yemen build back better and stronger than before.
Since 2014, war has driven poverty in Yemen from 47 percent of the population to a projected 75 percent by the end of 2019. If fighting continues through 2022, Yemen will rank as the poorest country in the world, with 79 percent of the population living under the poverty line and 65 percent classified as extremely poor, the report, Assessing the Impact of War in Yemen on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), says.
The report, produced for UNDP by the Pardee Center for International Futures at the University of Denver, says that in the absence of conflict Yemen could have made progress toward achieving the SDGs, the global anti-poverty framework agreed in 2015 with a target date of 2030. But more than four years of fighting has set back human development by 21 years—and Yemen would be unlikely to achieve any of the SDGs even if the war were to stop today.
“Not only has the war made Yemen the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, it has plunged it into a harrowing development crisis too. The ongoing crisis is threatening to make Yemen’s population the poorest in the world – a title the already suffering country cannot afford,” said UNDP Yemen’s Resident Representative, Auke Lootsma.
“Through the support of the European Union and other international and national partners, UNDP is helping empower Yemenis now to keep basic services functioning and to build personal, community and national capacity to ensure the people and country can recover when peace returns,” he noted.
Using cutting-edge data modeling and open-source information, the report finds that Yemen’s war will have more than tripled the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty if fighting persists. It will skyrocket from 19 percent of the population in 2014 to a projected 65 percent in 2022.
The intensity of poverty has also surged, with Yemen projected by 2022 to have the largest poverty gap—the distance between average income and the poverty line—in the world.
The surge in poverty across Yemen is driven by factors attributed to war, including a breakdown of the economy that has seen US $89 billion in lost economic activity since 2015.
The conflict has disrupted markets and institutions and destroyed social and economic infrastructure, while inequalities have sharply increased. Gross domestic product per capita has plummeted from US $3,577 to US $1,950, a level not seen in Yemen since before 1960. Yemen is now ranked as the world’s second most unequal in the world in terms of income, surging past 100 other countries in inequality levels in the last five years.
The report also identifies spikes in malnutrition across Yemen. Twenty-five percent of the population was malnourished in 2014, but the report estimates that this figure is now closer to 36 percent and could reach nearly 50 per cent if fighting continues through 2022. By the end of 2019, caloric intake per person will have fallen by 20 per cent from 2014 levels.
The report contains especially dire projections if the war continues for the next decade. If fighting continues through 2030, 78 percent of Yemenis will live in extreme poverty, 95 percent will be malnourished, and 84 percent of children will be stunted.
More than 80 percent of Yemen’s roughly 30 million people now require humanitarian assistance and protection. The report launched argues that if Yemen remains at war through 2030, the costs will be borne by generations to come, with poverty seeding ever more deeply, institutions decimated, and Yemen more vulnerable to an ongoing and vicious cycle of conflict and suffering.
UNDP works across Yemen to help people meet their most basic needs, restore livelihoods, support communities, and advance peacebuilding.

Title: UNFPA receives urgent life-saving support from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund
Content: 03 October 2019
Sana’a – UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund welcomed the generous contribution of US$3 million from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund to assist the most vulnerable women and girls with lifesaving reproductive health and protection services.
The funding will help UNFPA to continue its support to 47 health facilities, 10 women safe spaces and two psychological care centres in severely conflict affected areas of Yemen. These facilities were facing closure due to the lack of funding towards UNFPA’s response in Yemen. This support will reach more than 120,000 women and girls in the next four months; enabling pregnant women with complications to deliver safely and for the most vulnerable women and those faced with violence to obtain the care and support they require.
“Every form of assistance we provide now can mean the difference between life and death for hundreds of thousands of women and girls in Yemen. This funding comes as a lifeline of support when UNFPA is being forced to discontinue reproductive health and protection services affecting one million women and girls,” stated Nestor Owomuhangi, UNFPA’s Acting Representative to Yemen.
UNFPA is the sole provider of lifesaving reproductive health medicines in Yemen and leads coordination and provision of protection services across the country. To keep reaching the most vulnerable women and girls, UNFPA requires US$68.2 million over the next three months out of the US$110.5 million appealed for its response in 2019. To date, only 38 per cent of funding has been received.

But more than four years of fighting has set back human development by 21 years—and Yemen would be unlikely to achieve any of the SDGs even if the war were to stop today.
“The war has already made Yemen the largest humanitarian disaster in the world, and now threatens to make its population the poorest in the world,” said UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner. “UNDP’s work with support from international partners and as part of the UN’s overall engagement - is focused on helping Yemenis keep institutions and businesses running to ensure they have the solid footing needed to recover when peace returns.”
Using cutting-edge data modeling and open-source information, the report finds that Yemen’s war will have more than tripled the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty if fighting persists. It will skyrocket from 19 percent of the population in 2014 to a projected 65 percent in 2022.

UNDP released the report as United Nations agencies, NGOs, and international partners are seeking to expand urgent humanitarian and development work across Yemen to save lives, meet humanitarian needs, and support resilience in the country, and as UN-backed peace talks continue.
“This report is a reminder that Yemen cannot afford to wait. We must act now,” Ambassador Jürgen Schulz, Deputy Permanent Representative of Germany to the United Nations, said. “Without a political solution, we will see Yemen disappear right before our eyes. That’s why there is no alternative to the efforts of Special Envoy Martin Griffiths to advance an inclusive political process.”
More than 80 percent of Yemen’s roughly 30 million people now require humanitarian assistance and protection. The report launched today argues that if Yemen remains at war through 2030, the costs will be borne by generations to come, with poverty seeding ever more deeply, institutions decimated, and Yemen more vulnerable to an ongoing and vicious cycle of conflict and suffering.
UNDP works across Yemen to help people meet their most basic needs, restore livelihoods, support communities, and advance peacebuilding.

Title: As school year starts in Yemen, 2 million children are out of school and another 3.7 million are at risk of dropping out
Content: 25 September 2019
SANA’A– As the new school year starts amid continuing violence in Yemen, 2 million children are out of school, including almost half a million who dropped out since the conflict escalated in March 2015. The education of another 3.7 million children now hangs in the balance as teachers’ salaries have not been paid in over two years.
“Conflict, underdevelopment and poverty have deprived millions of children in Yemen of their right to education – and of their hope for a brighter future. Violence, displacement and attacks on schools are preventing many children from accessing school. With teacher salaries going unpaid for over two years, education quality is also at stake,” said Sara Beysolow Nyanti, UNICEF Representative in Yemen.
The current conflict in Yemen spiralled more than four years ago and has devastated the country’s already fragile education system. One in five schools in Yemen can no longer be used as a direct result of the conflict.
“Thirty years since the Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified, it is unacceptable that education and other fundamental child rights are out of reach for children in Yemen all because of man-made factors,” said Nyanti.
When children are not in school, they face countless risks of exploitation, abuse and other rights violations.
“Children out of school face increased risks of all forms of exploitation including being forced to join the fighting, child labour and early marriage. They lose the opportunity to develop and grow in a caring and stimulating environment, ultimately becoming trapped in a life of poverty and hardship,” added Nyanti.
Together with partners, UNICEF is working around the clock so that children can realize their right to education. In the last school year, UNICEF paid incentives to over 127,400 teachers and school-based staff who had not been paid in over two years to help them cover their transportation to school and other basic expenses. UNICEF has rehabilitated over 1,300 schools since 2015 and continues to provide learning materials for children.
Urgent efforts must be made to prevent an entire generation of children in Yemen from missing out on their education.
Above all, parties to the conflict in Yemen must work towards peace to allow for recovery and for children  a return to normalcy.

Title: Statement by the Special Envoy for Yemen on recent developments in Yemen
Content: 25 September 2019
Amman - The Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths is saddened by the recent military activity that claimed once again the lives of scores of civilians, including children. “This is yet another heartbreaking event,” Mr. Griffiths said.
The Special Envoy calls on all parties to seize the opportunity that lies ahead and to commit to it. “I urge all to take tangible and quick steps to reduce the violence, respect international humanitarian law and allow for a conducive environment for Yemen to return to a political process without delay.”
“Priority should be given to urgent humanitarian issues that would alleviate the suffering of millions of Yemenis who cannot afford food, basic commodities, travel and medical treatment,” added the Special Envoy.
The Special Envoy is confident that any steps taken to de-escalate tensions and improve the lives of Yemeni men, women and children will be supported by the international community. “Yemen needs to break from this vicious cycle of violence now and be safeguarded from the recent tensions in the region that could risk its prospects for peace,” Mr. Griffiths said.
The Special Envoy reiterates that the solution to the war in Yemen is a political settlement based on partnerships, neighborly relationships and building the state institutions in line with the three references.

Title: Emergency Relief Coordinator thanks Saudi Arabia for $500 million for United Nations agencies in Yemen
Content: 25 September 2019
New York- Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock today thanked the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for $500 million in funding to the United Nations for the 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan.
“I wish to thank Saudi Arabia for their generous contribution. This money will allow United Nations agencies to save millions of lives in Yemen,” said Mr. Lowcock.
“My office will now organize the transfer of these funds to the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the International Organization for Migration, UNHCR, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Food and Agriculture Organization,” he continued. “These agencies will use the funds to support essential priorities in the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan.”
“This funding is very good news for millions of Yemenis across the country who need assistance. Receiving the money as a single block grant also gives greater flexibility to aid agencies, and I am pleased to see this approach repeated after last year’s success,” said Mr. Lowcock.
At a signing ceremony today in New York, Supervisor-General of the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief), Dr Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, presented the United Nations with a cheque for $500 million.
Mr. Lowcock explained the importance of the UN’s partnership with KSRelief to ensure the efficient and effective implementation of the aid operation.
Flexible grant terms governing contributions last year played a key role in allowing UN agencies to scale up rapidly to meet growing needs. This approach was essential to preventing widespread famine and rolling back the world’s worst-ever cholera epidemic. It was also cited as a global best practice in humanitarian donorship.
“With today’s provision of funds from Saudi Arabia, the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan will have received more than $2.3 billion, or 56 per cent of its requirements for the year,” noted Mr. Lowcock. “This is substantial progress, and we thank all our donors for their support. But we still have more to do, and I call on all our partners in the region and beyond to do everything they can to ensure the Yemen response plan is fully funded.”

Title: Kuwait contributes US$ 2 million to support FAO’s emergency programme in Yemen
Content: 24 September 2019
Sana’a/ Geneva - The Government of Kuwait has contributed US$ 2 million to boost FAO’s emergency agricultural interventions and improve food security and nutrition in Yemen. The Kuwaiti funding in support of FAO’s Humanitarian Response Plan for Yemen will be crucial in providing assistance to some of the 8.6 million severely food insecure Yemenis.
"This new agreement reinforces the relationship between the State of Kuwait and FAO," said H.E. Jamal M. Al Ghunaim Ambassador Permanent Representative of the State of Kuwait to the U.N. in Geneva. "We aim to work closer together to accelerate humanitarian efforts towards the people of Yemen and other countries in the near East region who are suffering from conflicts."
Yemen remains the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. The protracted crisis has taken a devastating toll on the economy, collapsing essential services and exhausting the population’s coping mechanisms, leading to widespread food insecurity and malnutrition. This new contribution will build on gains made through previous Kuwaiti funding.
“Kuwait and FAO are  building strong partnership to fight hunger and malnutrition in the Near East and North Africa region (NENA). Kuwait today generous grant will strengthen the resilience of farmers and herders of Yemen. It adds  to Kuwait recent contribution to the farmers in Syria”, said FAO's Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for NENA
Building on a successful partnership
The Kuwait-FAO ongoing partnership is already delivering emergency agricultural interventions and working to improve food security and nutrition in Yemen. Repair and rehabilitation of water and irrigation networks is one of the most pressing needs in addressing Yemen’s declining agricultural output and, therefore, in addressing its broader food security crisis.
The project is in the process of setting up small-scale water infrastructures, which will see almost 11 000 farmers benefit from the availability of water for agricultural purposes. The works involve rehabilitation of shallow wells, cleaning rehabilitating and constructing canals, terraces, water harvesting tanks and protection walls.
The rehabilitation and construction work is being done by the local community and internally displaced populations in the project’s targeted areas. Targeting both IDPs and host communities alike is helping to de-escalate tension that has been rising in the area. Due to the protracted conflict, thousands have fled their homes and settled in new areas, putting a strain on limited natural resources like water. Through Cash-for-Work modality over 6 500 vulnerable people will receive much-needed income through temporary employment. This new funding will also allow current efforts to be scaled-up to include additional farmers.
“This generous contribution will help FAO secure and restore agricultural livelihoods. By promoting self-reliance of communities, we are trying to ensure families continue to produce food for themselves even in times of crisis”, said Hussein Gadain, FAO Representative in Yemen.
Conflict and insecurity humper food security efforts
According to the Crop Prospects and Food Situation report issued recently by FAO, Yemen remains among the top in the list of the 41 countries requiring external food assistance. Conflict and insecurity continue to be the main drivers of food insecurity in the country.
The conflict has devastated people’s livelihoods, limited income opportunities and reduced their ability to purchase food. This dramatic deterioration destroyed households’ ability to cope. Any changes in their circumstances, or a further disruption in food access, is likely to push communities to the brink of famine.
Agriculture is not just the main source of livelihood and income for millions of Yemenis, it represents one of the few remaining lifelines, especially for hard to reach rural areas. Humanitarian food assistance alone cannot meet the country’s needs. Livelihoods support interventions thus play a critical role within the humanitarian response - safeguarding and rapidly scaling up food production and therefore increasing food availability among the most vulnerable.
The new contribution from Kuwait will go a long way towards helping thousands of vulnerable farmers and herders, especially women-headed households, through a mixture of crop and vegetable seeds, fishing gear, poultry production kits, cash support, animal health campaigns, restocking and animal feed.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: Scores of people killed and wounded in Amran and Al Dhale’e
Content: 24 September 2019
Sana’a – Twenty-two civilians have been killed in two separate air strikes in the past two days. The first incident occurred on 23 September in Al Sawad, in Amran Governorate when strikes hit a mosque; seven civilians, including women and children from the same family were killed. Today, 15 civilians were killed and 15 more were injured when airstrikes hit a house in the Al Fakhir area in Al Dhale’e Governorate.
“We share our deepest condolences with the families of the killed and injured,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen. “For these tragedies to have occurred during the UN General Assembly, when world leaders come together to advance peace and security, is profoundly disturbing.”
Protection partners report that more than 700 civilians have been killed and 1,600 injured during 2019 as result of the conflict.
“This is the time when everyone should be finding ways to end this terrible war,” said Ms. Grande. “Instead, families are being forced to bury their loved ones and tend the wounded. This is heart-breaking and senseless.”
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the total population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and starvation and 7 million people are malnourished.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis including 10 million people who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs every month. As of today, the YHRP is 42 per cent funded. At the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen convened by the UN Secretary-General in February 2019, the United Nations and humanitarian partners were promised USD$ 2.6 billion to meet the urgent needs. Until recently, less than half of this amount has been received. Humanitarian agencies are appealing to donors to provide funds as quickly as possible.

Title: Protracted conflict, the climate crisis, a rise in mental illness and online misinformation among biggest emerging threats to children - UNICEF
Content: 22 September 2019
NEW YORK -- Protracted conflicts, the worsening climate crisis, a rising level of mental illness among young people, and online misinformation are some of the most concerning emerging global threats to children, UNICEF said today in an open letter issued by the organization’s Executive Director Henrietta Fore.
In addition to existing threats to young people, such as access to education, poverty, inequality and discrimination, the inaugural letter warns of emerging threats to children’s rights, and outlines a path to stepping up efforts to address them.
The letter is being issued as part of UNICEF’s commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of a Child – the world’s most widely ratified human rights treaty.
“And your generation, the children of today, are facing a new set of challenges and global shifts that were unimaginable to your parents,” writes Fore.
“Our climate is changing beyond recognition. Inequality is deepening. Technology is transforming how we perceive the world. And more families are migrating than ever before. Childhood has changed, and we need to change our approaches along with it.”
The letter outlines eight growing challenges for the world’s children: prolonged conflicts; pollution and the climate crisis; a decline in mental health; mass migration and population movements; statelessness; future skills for future work; data rights and online privacy; and online misinformation.
On conflict, the letter notes that the number of countries experiencing conflict is the highest it has been since the adoption of the Child Rights Convention in 1989, with one in four children living in countries affected by violent fighting or disaster.
On climate change, the letter warns that children are already having to contend with rampant destruction to the planet and a global climate crisis that has the potential to undermine most of the gains made in child survival and development over the past 30 years. The rise in extreme weather patterns and toxic air, prolonged drought and flash floods are all part of this crisis, and are disproportionally affecting the poorest, most vulnerable children.
UNICEF is working to mitigate the impact of the climate crisis in countries across the world. For example, in Ethiopia, UNICEF has pioneered new technology to map groundwater, and is developing solutions for chronically water-scarce communities. In Malawi, UNICEF has developed a long-lasting, eco-friendly system using solar power to improve access to clean water for communities. Yet more must be done to slow down climate change altogether.
“Governments and business must work hand in hand to reduce fossil fuel consumption, develop cleaner agricultural, industrial and transport systems and invest in scaling renewable energy sources,” writes Fore.
The letter also expresses concern that the majority of children will grow up as natives of a digital environment saturated with online misinformation. For example, so-called ‘deep fake’ technology uses artificial intelligence techniques to create convincing fakes of audio and video content, relatively easily.
The letter warns that an online environment where truth can become indistinguishable from fiction has the potential to totally undermine trust in institutions and information sources, and has been demonstrated to skew democratic debate, voter intentions, and sow doubt about other ethnic, religious or social groups.
The letter warns that online misinformation is already leaving children vulnerable to grooming, abuse, and other forms of exploitation; skewing democratic debate; and, in some communities, even prompting resurgence in deadly diseases due to distrust in vaccines fueled by online misinformation – the results of which could be the creation of an entire generation of citizens who do not trust anything.
To respond to this challenge, UNICEF has been piloting media literacy programme, such as the Young Reporters programme in Montenegro, aimed at teaching young people about spotting misinformation online, how to fact check online content, and the roles and techniques of responsible journalism.
“We can no longer rest on the naïve assurance that truth has an innate upper hand against falsehood in the digital era, and so we must, as societies, build resilience against the daily deluge of falsity online,” writes Fore. “We should start by equipping young people with the ability to understand who and what they can trust online, so they can become active, engaged citizens.”
On mental health, the letter cautions that mental illness among adolescents has been on the rise in the years since the adoption of the CRC, and that depression is now among the leading causes of disability in the young.
The letter urges that appropriate promotion, prevention and therapeutic treatment and rehabilitation for children and young people affected by mental health issues be prioritized, and that the stigma and taboo surrounding mental illness be challenged so that treatment can be sought and support provided.
Finally, the letter recognizes that children and young people have already created movements across the world in search of solutions to overcome the challenges they – and their peers – face, and calls for world leaders to follow their lead.
“Children and young people of today are taking the lead on demanding urgent action, and empowering yourselves to learn about, and shape the world around you,” writes Fore. “You are taking a stand now, and we are listening.”

Title: Decades-old conflict over water in Yemeni village comes to an end
Content: 20 September 2019
Lahj – More than 20 million people in Yemen are food insecure and water is a scarce resource, with access further restricted by over four years of conflict. This is especially challenging for farmers who depend on water for a good harvest.  Through support from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in partnership with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), access to water has been improved for Yemeni farmers living across nearly 4,000 acres of agricultural land in the coastal governorate of Lahj.
In the area of Al Faradha, improved access to water for 2,000 farmers, as reported by the local community, has also meant an end to a 37-year-old local conflict.
In 1982, a large flood surged into Al Faradha causing great damage to an irrigation channel used by local farmers, who solely depended on rain passing through the channel to irrigate their farms. When the channel was damaged, many of them were deprived of access to water for their farms.
“The farms were nourished with water, the crops were abundant, and the farms were green, but when the flood destroyed the channel, farmers could not irrigate their lands and stopped farming,” explained Sami Saleh, the Secretary General of the Water User Association in Al Faradha. Years of fighting have meant that there are little resources available for the maintenance to public infrastructure like irrigation channels, and in a country like Yemen where7.4 million people require services to treat or prevent malnutrition, ensuring that farmers can grow crops is of paramount importance.
In a desperate attempt to irrigate their lands, farmers in Al Faradha changed the path of the channel by connecting it to other nearby main channels, diverting the water flow. The detour, while increasing access for some farmers, decreased the water flow to the farmlands of others. The flow became too little and was shared by too many farms, and upstream in the channel flooding would take place with the excess watering running into the sea and being lost by the community. The farmers livelihoods were heavily affected, and a dispute arose between more than 500 farmers from Al Faradha and others living in nearby areas. A dispute that lasted for nearly 30 years.
Through funding from the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, IOM partnered with FAO to support the community in Al Faradha solve their long running water access issues. The UN organizations worked with the local Water User Association to kick start the process. The three partners met the parties involved in the local conflict to understand their issues and work together on possible solutions.
“This is truly a community-led project, with IOM and FAO merely listening to the community about their needs and problems and facilitating them in addressing their water access issues,” said Abeer Aboras, a member of IOM’s team in Yemen. “It’s also important to note that women, who work side-by-side with men in farms or are often heads of rural households, had an essential role in resolving Al Faradha’s water access problems,” added Aboras.
Before this project, the Al Faradha Water User Association, established in 2004, had never included any women on its board. During the project, the Association members came to believe in the positive impact of including women in conflict resolution. To work specifically on resolving the water conflict, IOM established a Conflict Resolution Committee (CRC) in Al Faradha, which consisted of two women and two men to begin negotiations in order to come up with a solution.
The Association and Committee, with local farmers, decided to build a dam to stop the water from flowing away from local farmlands, reconstruct water gates and remove sediment from the channel to increase its capacity to contain more water.
“The water is enough water for everyone living off these irrigation channels now, so the dispute subsided between the farmers, and their agricultural productivity has increased greatly,” added Thamer Bin Shoa’ib, an IOM Yemen Field Engineer, who worked with the community in Al Faradha.
Today, an IOM partner supervises the operation of the dam, ensuring every farm gets its fair share of water.
IOM and FAO implemented this UN Peace Building Fund project in both Sana’a and Lahj governorates. As a result of the project, thousands of farmers have improved access to water through rehabilitated irrigation channels in seven sites throughout Lahj governorate’s Turban Valley, with around 400 people from local communities employed during the construction work.
The irrigation channel rehabilitations have not only assisted farmers in rebuilding their livelihoods and given vulnerable households an income but helped communities end age-old local conflicts.

Title: OP-Ed by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen: We can end the war in Yemen
Content: 16 September 2019
Yemen’s war has to end. And the secret is that the way it ends is no secret at all.
On Sept. 14, a drone attack on Aramco facilities in Saudi Arabia destroyed approximately half of Saudi crude oil production. The Houthi militia in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack; Saudi Arabia and the United States, however, are pointing fingers at Iran. This situation threatens to turn regional tensions into a shooting war, as well as destabilizing the global economy. And for Yemen, the risk of being drawn into a war between states, and not merely between proxies, is now very real. If more evidence was needed for the urgency of a political solution in Yemen, then these attacks provide it.
Most wars appear to have no solution. They are occasioned by rival states, fueled by rival ideologies and impermeable to the cries of the victims. Yemen is in some ways no different. Every single family in the country has lost a generation of education among its children; every single family has seen a relative or a friend killed. Few see the sense in a war among their leaders that costs each and every one of them so dearly.
This is a conflict the international community can resolve. And because we can, we must. The details of this settlement are in plain sight. Seven elements will necessarily underpin any agreement to end the war.
First, the monopoly on force must be returned to the government of Yemen. No Yemenis outside the state should be allowed to use violence to achieve their ends. This is a simple but absolute requirement. The militias that fight over Yemen’s land must be replaced by the exclusive authority of the state. This can be achieved through a process overseen by the United Nations of gradually transferring weapons from the militias to the new government.
Second, the government must be more than a coalition. It must be an inclusive partnership among the political parties that now take different sides. This is the state that will require that differences be resolved through politics and that force is its servant and not its threat.
Third, the government must ensure that its country will not be used for attacks on neighbors or even those beyond. This must be a compact between Yemen’s new leaders and its neighborhood.
Fourth, the government will adopt and uphold its historic responsibility of ensuring the safety of the trade that has for millenniums depended on the security of its seas. Yemen will police its borders, and it will be supported by those who benefit from this assurance.
Fifth, the people of Yemen will eliminate and outlaw from its territory the terrorist threat that even now we see.
Sixth, Yemen’s neighbors will guarantee the prosperity and stability of its population through trade and the generosity that will remove the scars of this war.
And finally, it will be the people of Yemen and their leaders who decide on the future of the state. No others need apply. The future shape of Yemen can, and indeed should, be determined only by Yemenis free of the duress of war and willing to negotiate the future of their country in good faith.
These seven elements are known to all in Yemen who study peace and to the leaders around the world, particularly those in the region who have spent blood and treasure on seeking a way back to a society of civility and a state of accountable governance that can ensure stability. The application of these principles can transform Yemen from a source of violence, terror and humanitarian crisis into an island of relative stability in an increasingly volatile region.
With the requisite political will on all sides, I know this can be done. But to do so requires us to convince leaders that stability and their region’s security is best reached not through military pressure but through a genuine and tested cooperation with their enemies. I am not the first to suggest a bold move to end this war and make peace. Just a little short of a year ago Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis put out an urgent call for an immediate end to the fighting in Yemen. These two statesmen believed not only that ending the fighting was the right thing to do, but also that it could be done. They were right then, and it is right now. My hope is that the people who care will now turn that call into a present reality.
Let us be clear: Yemen cannot wait. And moreover, Yemen need not wait. And neither should we.

Title: Yemen: Collective failure, collective responsibility  (UN expert report)
Content: 03 September 2019
Geneva – A UN report on Yemen released on Tuesday details a host of possible war crimes committed by various parties to the conflict over the past five years, including through airstrikes, indiscriminate shelling, snipers, landmines, as well as arbitrary killings and detention, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, and the impeding of access to humanitarian aid in the midst of the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.
The Group of International and Regional Eminent Experts on Yemen, created by the UN Human Rights Council, found that the governments of Yemen and the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as well as the Houthis and affiliated popular committees have enjoyed a “pervasive lack of accountability” for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.
The report calls for the immediate cessation of all acts of violence committed against civilians in violation of applicable international human rights and international humanitarian law, and demands that the parties take action to protect civilians and ensure justice for all victims.
It urges other States to refrain from providing arms that could be used in the conflict, and reminds them of their obligation to take all reasonable measures to ensure respect for international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict.
“Five years into the conflict, violations against Yemeni civilians continue unabated, with total disregard for the plight of the people and a lack of international action to hold parties to the conflict accountable,” said Mr. Kamel Jendoubi, chairperson of the Group of Experts on Yemen.
“The international community must multiply its efforts to free the Yemeni people from the persistent injustice they have been enduring.”
Despite a lack of cooperation by the Coalition and Government of Yemen, the Group of Experts was able during the short time available this year to conduct more than 600 interviews with victims and witnesses, to examine documentary and open-source material,  and to carry out investigations into emblematic cases to establish patterns of conduct indicative of alleged violations in Yemen since September 2014.
The Experts found reasonable grounds to believe that the conduct of hostilities by the parties to the conflict, including by airstrikes and shelling, continued to have an extreme impact on civilians and many of these attacks may amount to serious violations of international humanitarian law. The Experts further found reasonable grounds to believe that, in addition to violations related to the conduct of hostilities, the parties to the armed conflict in Yemen are responsible for arbitrary deprivation of the right to life, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, sexual violence, torture, ill-treatment, child recruitment, violations of fundamental freedoms, and violations of economic, social and cultural rights. These amount to violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as applicable. Subject to determination by an independent and competent court, many of these violations may result in individuals being held responsible for war crimes.
The Group of Experts has identified, where possible, individuals who may be responsible for international crimes, and an updated confidential list of individuals has been submitted to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Where identification of individuals was not possible, the Experts have identified the group responsible.
“This endemic  impunity – for violations and abuses by all parties to the conflict – cannot be tolerated anymore. Impartial and independent inquiries must be empowered to hold accountable those who disrespect the rights of the Yemeni people. The international community must stop turning a blind eye to these violations and the intolerable humanitarian situation,” said Jendoubi.
The Group of Experts attributed direct responsibility to the parties to the conflict regarding the humanitarian situation in Yemen. The continued extreme impact of attacks against civilian infrastructure such as hospitals, water facilities, food transport, farms and market places, as well as the use of blockades and siege-like warfare, impeding humanitarian access, and other such measures have exacerbated the disastrous humanitarian situation.
“The inhumane deprivation of the Yemeni population of their rights to medicine, water and food should stop immediately. The very survival of the 24 million in need should be the first priority”, added Jendoubi.
The Group expressed strong concern that the parties to the conflict may have used starvation as a method of warfare, as these acts contributed to depriving the population of objects indispensable to its survival.
The Experts’ report calls on all States and international organizations to promote and support all efforts, notably those of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen to achieve a sustainable political solution including accountability.
The report urges the Human Rights Council to ensure that the situation of human rights in Yemen remains on the Council’s agenda by renewing the mandate of the Group of Experts and further suggests that the Council request the Group to continue to report to it periodically. The Group of Experts further suggested that the Council strengthen its mandate to combat impunity by requesting it to collect and preserve evidence of alleged violations.

About the Group of International and Regional Eminent Experts on Yemen
In its resolution 36/31 in September 2017, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish a group of eminent international and regional experts on Yemen to monitor and report on the situation of human rights. The  Group of Experts was mandated to carry out a comprehensive examination of all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights and other appropriate and applicable fields of international law committed by all parties to the conflict since September 2014, including the possible gender dimensions of such violations, and to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged violations and abuses and, where possible, to identify those responsible.
On 4 December 2017, the High Commissioner established the Group of Independent Eminent International and Regional Experts, appointing Mr. Kamel Jendoubi (Tunisia) as Chairperson, and Mr. Charles Garraway (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), and Ms. Melissa Parke (Australia) as experts. Following the submission of the first report of the group to the 39th session of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/39/43) in September 2018, resolution 39/16 renewed the mandate of the Group for further year, requesting a second report at its 42nd session in September 2019.

Title: Media personnel push for ICPD agenda
Content: 03 September 2019
UNFPA and Studies and Economic Media Center wrapped up 3-day training in Aden for more than 20 journalists from Aden, Al Dahleh, Abyan and Lahj governorates. The training aimed to equip the participants with skills on how to write human interest stories on gender-based violence and reproductive health issues. Media personnel were introduced to the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) historical agenda where RH and GBV were recognized for the first time. They were also briefed on the Nairobi Summit.
Earlier in August, a similar training concluded in Taizz governorate where 25 media personnel were targeted.
In commemoration the 25th anniversary of ICPD, UNFPA is running a series of training for media covering 15 governorates across the country aiming to create a large network of journalists who can contribute towards the advancement of the ICPD agenda in Yemen.

Title: Joint statement by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen and the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen
Content: 01 September 2019
Sana’a–On 1 September, air strikes hit a former community college compound on the northern outskirts of Dhamar City.  According to sources on the ground, as many as 170 prisoners were being held in a detention facility within the compound.
Initial reports from health officials indicate that at least 60 people have been killed and 50 injured.  The Yemen UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has confirmed that 52 detainees are among the dead. At least 68 detainees are still missing. Casualties are most likely to increase as rescue efforts are still ongoing.
“Today’s event is a tragedy. The human cost of this war is unbearable. We need it to stop. Yemenis deserve a peaceful future. Today’s tragedy reminds us that Yemen cannot wait. I hope the Coalition will launch an inquiry into this incident. Accountability needs to prevail.” said Martin Griffiths, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen.
“This is a horrific incident,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen. “The scale of the casualties is staggering. We send our deepest condolences to families that are today grieving for their loved ones.”
First responders have been struggling to reach the scene due to repeated strikes on the site. Survivors are believed to remain trapped under rubble and the search for further casualties continues.
“Humanitarian partners are rushing surgical and medical supplies, including trauma kits, to Dhamar General Hospital and Maaber Hospital. We are diverting critical medical supplies from the cholera response,” said Ms. Grande. "We have no choice.”
“These are very dark times for Yemen,” said Ms. Grande. "There have been days of fighting and strikes in the south and hundreds of casualties,” said Ms. Grande.
“It's obvious, and we say it again and again. The only way to end the killing and misery in Yemen is to end the conflict,” said Mr. Griffiths.
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 percent of the total population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and starvation and 7 million people are malnourished.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis including 10 million people who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs every month. As of today, the YHRP is 34 percent funded. At the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen convened by the UN Secretary-General in February 2019, the United Nations and humanitarian partners were promised $2.6 billion to meet the urgent needs. To date, less than half of this amount has been received. Humanitarian agencies are appealing to donors to provide funds as quickly as possible.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: Tens of people killed and wounded in Aden and Abyan
Content: 29 August 2019
Aden – Preliminary reports from medical facilities indicate that as many as 13 people have been killed and at least 70 wounded during clashes in Aden and Abyan governorates since 27 August. Streets are empty in Aden and flights to and from Aden airport are temporarily suspended.
“We mourn for the dead and wounded and plead with everyone who is fighting to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen.
"The situation is very fragile. Families are again trapped in their homes by fighting, unable to secure food and reach medical care,” said Ms. Grande.
“The timing couldn't be worse,” said Ms. Grande.
“The humanitarian operation in Yemen is in deep trouble. Pledges made to us at an international conference in February haven't materialised. We've already been forced to close vaccination and health programmes and scale-back on protection services for the victims of sexual and gender-based violence. If donors don't honour the promises they've made, 22 major programmes will close in coming weeks.”

Title: One million Yemeni women at risk due to lack of funding says UNFPA
Content: 29 August 2019
UNITED NATIONS - UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, echoes the urgent call by UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen Lise Grande for donors to provide the funding promised earlier this year.
"Over one million Yemeni women need funds now, or they will lose access to life-saving reproductive health services, putting their lives and those of their babies at risk," said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem.
By September 2019, UNFPA will be forced to close 175 of the 268 health facilities it currently supports with reproductive health services. This poses a direct threat to more than one million pregnant and lactating women requiring immediate treatment for acute malnutrition and further medical assistance.
Already, the procurement of medicines has stopped.  Fourteen safe spaces and four specialized mental health facilities for women have closed.
Every two hours, a woman dies from complications of pregnancy and childbirth, and another 20 suffer injuries, infections or disabilities that could have been prevented. This is the reality faced by an estimated 6 million women and adolescent girls of childbearing age in Yemen.
The protracted conflict has resulted in the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, affecting 24 million people.  As grave violations of rights continue, support to affected women and girls is critical.  A significant increase in gender-based violence requires urgent protection, healthcare, mental health and psychosocial support, and legal assistance for survivors.
Without funding, the lives of half a million women and girls will be affected. The closure of remaining shelters, safe spaces and specialized facilities will increase the risk of intimidation and violence, and women and girls could be forced into illicit activities to survive.
As the lead agency for the combined response of 23 UN organizations and local and international NGOs, UNFPA calls for urgent funding to provide a package of the most critical lifesaving assistance for newly displaced families on the move, in hard to reach areas, or stranded in the military frontlines. The package includes dignity kits, basic hygiene supplies, and immediate ration kits.
At the end of June, the procurement of dignity kits was suspended and supplies are running scarce. Unless funding is received soon, one million newly displaced people face the probability of being unable to meet basic survival needs during the first weeks of displacement. This will further increase vulnerability and pose higher risks of exploitation, especially for women and girls.
Of UNFPA’s 2019 appeal for $110 million for Yemen’s humanitarian response, only $33 million has been received, leaving a gap of $77 million. We call on donors to provide urgent funding to enable life-saving reproductive health and gender-based violence prevention and response services for women, adolescent girls and others affected by the conflict.

Title: FAO mobilizes US$ 300 thousand to help initiate anti-locust effort in Yemen
Content: 27 August 2019
Urgent Desert Locust control operations are required to safeguard crops and mitigate the risk of infestation in Yemen, as well as to prevent locust swarms from invading neighbouring countries. To partially address this, FAO has rapidly mobilized a total of US$ 300 000 (Three Hundred Thousand) to jumpstart a much-needed anti-locust campaign.
In the first phases of what needs to become a larger-scale effort, FAO is already supporting relevant authorities to implement a number of urgent measures to support surveillance and control operations in the breeding areas. This includes purchasing equipment to increase the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture for timely control of locust in the infested areas. The organization is also facilitating survey and control activities (including capacity building).
In Yemen, breeding is expected to intensify in interior and coastal areas where the rains have been good. This will cause a further increase in locust numbers, including the formation of hopper bands and swarms.
Given the seriousness of the situation, all affected countries in the region must monitor the field conditions by mounting regular ground surveys and undertaking the necessary control measures whenever important locust infestations are detected. FAO stands ready to support governments and has already launched a general appeal to the international community to roll-out a coordinated response across the entire region.

Title: Rapid City and Neighbourhood Profiling in Yemen – developing capacity to train stakeholders
Content: 27 August 2019
The UN-Habitat and European Union joint Rapid City and Neighbourhood Profiling project in Yemen aims to support and improve the humanitarian and recovery response through providing better urban information and analysis.
Funded by the European Union, the development of City Profiles is a tool to obtain critical data and information that will enable actors to identify and address the risks and reality of the humanitarian crises, to mitigate impacts on the most vulnerable, including the displaced, and to enable affected people to determine the course of their futures.
City Profiles are instruments that can foster recovery and contribute to stabilization and peacebuilding by empowering urban communities, their leaders and members, while in turn, can also guide investments and capacity building towards this same objective.
As part of this project, and UN-Habitat’s work in Yemen, UN-Habitat, iMMAP and the Joint IDP Profiling Service (JIPS), organized a two-day Rapid City and Neighbourhood Profiling training of trainers on 5 and 6 August 2019 at the iMMAP Regional office in Amman. The purpose of the training was to train participants to run similar training and consultation workshops for project stakeholders in Sana’a and Aden.
The training focused on how to set-up and run stakeholder consultation workshops for the project in Yemen, which techniques to use, and how to conduct joint analysis. The training further focused on how to develop urban profiles and recovery planning, developing a city profile for Sana’a and Aden, lessons learned and recommendations from data collection.

Title: Second round of oral cholera vaccine reaches nearly 400 000 people in Aden, Taiz and Al Dhale’e
Content: 21 August 2019
Sana’a - A 6-day oral cholera vaccination campaign reached almost 400 000 people, including almost 65 000 children under the age of 5 in Aden, Al Dhale’e and Taiz, where high numbers of suspected cholera and acute watery diarrhoea cases have been recorded.
The first few months of 2019 saw an increase of reported acute watery diarrhoea cases in over 95% of districts across Yemen. Between January and the end of July 2019, there have been nearly 536 000 suspected cases and 773 associated deaths. Children under 5 represent one quarter of all suspected cases.
The vaccination campaign, run by local health authorities, UNICEF and WHO, was made possible thanks to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and to the World Bank’s ‘Emergency Health and Nutrition Project.’
“Amid the fighting in surrounding areas, over 800 health workers, brave men and women, risked their lives to reach communities from cholera — these are the real heroes,” said Altaf Musani, WHO Representative in Yemen.
“Thanks to the extraordinary commitment and dedication of Yemen’s local health workforce, hundreds of thousands of people from these priority districts were reached with vaccination against cholera,” said Sara Beysolow Nyanti, UNICEF Country Representative in Yemen.
Since April 2017, the cholera and acute watery diarrhoea epidemic in Yemen has caused an estimated 2 million suspected cases and 3500 associated deaths. Almost one third have been in children under 5, including 711 associated deaths. The outbreak in Yemen remains the largest cholera in the world.
Health partners throughout Yemen joined forces to control and prevent any future cholera outbreaks. UNICEF and WHO are working closely with the relevant health authorities and other humanitarian partners to respond.

Title: World Food Programme welcomes progress on key accountability measures with the Sana'a-based authorities
Content: 09 August 2019


ROME – The United Nations World Food Programme welcomes important, positive steps taken by the Sana’a-based authorities on safeguards to ensure humanitarian food assistance reaches the most vulnerable children, women and men in areas of Yemen under their control.
A document signed with the Sana’a-based authorities on Saturday 3 August 2019 and the subsequently signed technical annexes will allow WFP to work to establish an independent and accountable process to identify and register families who most need life-saving food assistance.
WFP will resume food distributions following the Eid Al Adha festival for the 850,000 people in Sana’a City who have not received food rations from WFP for the last two months.
WFP will now begin the roll-out of a smartcard-driven beneficiary management system, registering 9 million people in areas of Yemen controlled by the Sana’a-based authorities. These vital measures provide for the protection and privacy of the people we serve and the independence of our humanitarian operation.
The signed documents give a framework to ensure that WFP’s largest operation in the world is operating in an efficient and cost-effective way. For that to happen, the Sana’a-based authorities have provided written assurances that WFP will be able to bring in the staff and equipment required for a targeting and registration process. WFP staff and our partners will also be granted unimpeded access to all areas where we need to work.  Once the beneficiary selection and biometric registration process is complete, the agreement  will also allow WFP to introduce cash transfers to local people so they may purchase food from local shops, where this is available.
WFP continues to work tirelessly to ensure that hungry Yemeni children, women and men get the food assistance they need. Over the past three months, WFP continued to scale up  operations as it strived to reach a monthly target across the country of providing life-saving food assistance to 12 million people.
Yemen remains the most complex and challenging humanitarian crisis in the world. Over four years of conflict have pushed millions of Yemenis to the brink of famine. Some indicators have started to improve in a number of hard hit areas as WFP has boosted support for them. The overall situation remains precarious and the humanitarian community cannot slow the pace of assistance now.

Title: OHCHR Press briefing note on Yemen
Content: 06 August 2019
Over the past 10 days, we have documented a number of deeply worrying developments in Yemen that have had a serious impact on civilians across the country, including in Aden, Taiz, San’a, Sa’daa, Al Dhale and other areas. Armed groups affiliated with Al Qaeda and ISIS also appear to have intensified their activities in the country.
Since 27 July, the UN Human Rights Office has verified 19 civilian deaths in Taiz, Sa’ada and Aden and 42 civilians injured. The majority of the civilian deaths resulted from an attack in the Al Thabet market area of Sa’ada Governorate on 29 July, when 14 civilians were killed and 26 injured. There are conflicting reports about which party to the conflict carried out the attacks.
On 28 July, military forces and popular committees affiliated with the Houthis allegedly launched indiscriminate attacks in Al-Rawdhah neighbourhood in Taiz, killing one child and injuring three other civilians. This followed other similar attacks in previous days by Houthi-affiliated forces. There have also been reports of attacks hitting medical and educational facilities, including a 31 July attack damaging a hospital emergency department and ambulances in Taiz.
In Aden and Abyan in the south, a series of attacks took place on 1 and 2 August against a police station and military camps. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on the police station. A ballistic missile reportedly launched by the Houthis was responsible for the attack on 1 August in Aden during a military parade, while armed groups affiliated with Al Qaeda reportedly attacked another military camp in Abyan governorate on 2 August.  In apparent retaliation for these attacks, the “security-belt” forces are reportedly carrying out and enabling retaliatory attacks against civilians from the northern parts of Yemen, who are being rounded up, assaulted, harassed and forcibly displaced to the areas bordering other governorates. We have received information from multiple sources about arbitrary arrests and detention, forced displacement, physical assaults and harassment as well as looting and vandalism by the security forces against hundreds of northerners. Reports suggest that security forces searched hotels and restaurants, stopping people, demanding their identification, and rounding up those hailing from the northern parts of Yemen. We remind parties to the conflict that such arrests and forced displacements breach international human rights and humanitarian law. Parties to a non-international armed conflict may not order the displacement of the civilian population, in whole or in part, for reasons related to the conflict, unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand. We are continuing to gather information about the number of people displaced and details of the violations they have been subjected to, but initial reports suggest hundreds have already been displaced.
We also remain deeply concerned about the situation in Al Dhale, in southwest Yemen, since the escalation of military operations there in March 2019, including the use of landmines – which are by their very nature indiscriminate – as well as airstrikes, shelling and ground fighting. Since March, fighting between the warring parties has resulted in at least 26 civilians killed and 45 injured, although due to lack of access to the area, the figures are likely to be much higher than what we have been able to verify. The only water reserve in Al Dhale is reportedly under the control of the Houthis and many water pumps have stopped working or been damaged, thus cutting water supplies to parts of the population.
We urge all parties to the conflict to seek to de-escalate the situation, and to ensure that any attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure are meaningfully investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: Children are among scores of civilians, killed and injured by an attack on a market in Sa’ada
Content: 30 July 2019
Sana’a– On 29 July 2019, scores of people were killed and injured in an attack on Al Thabit market in Qatabir District in Sa’ada Governorate. Preliminary reports from local health authorities indicate that 14 people have died, including 4 children. An additional 26 people, including 14 children, have been reportedly injured. Several of the wounded are in a critical condition.
“This is a horrific attack. Scores of innocent civilians have been killed and injured,” said Ms. Lise Grande, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen. “We offer our most profound and sincere condolences to the families of people who have been killed and hurt.”
The injured, including children, have been rushed to hospitals in Sa’ada and in Sana’a for treatment. Health partners are providing medical supplies to the facilities receiving the wounded, including trauma kits to treat up to100 casualties.
“This is a terrible turn of events. For three months, the number of reported civilian casualties in Sa’ada has been falling,” said Ms. Grande. “This is a reversal of everything everyone has been working towards these last weeks and months.”
“Ending the fighting and the killing of civilians is the highest priority. Everything must be done to bring peace to Yemen,” said Ms. Grande
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the total population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Despite a difficult operating environment, 113 international and national partners worked across Yemen in the first five months of 2019, to respond to the most acute needs.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis, including 10 million people, who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs each month. As of today, the operation is only 34 per cent funded. Humanitarian agencies are appealing to donors to provide funds as quickly as possible.

Title: UNDP Administrator’s Statement: Mission to Yemen
Content: 30 July 2019
I have just returned from five days in Yemen, where I traveled to Aden, Sana’a, and Hodeidah, to meet with communities, officials, and members of the UN family.
Four years of violent conflict in Yemen has reversed decades of development progress. Fighting has killed or injured tens of thousands of civilians and displaced well over 3 million people. Eighty per cent of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance, with over 10 million on the brink of famine.
The magnitude of the devastation and human suffering that I learned about and witnessed firsthand is difficult to comprehend. War has brought the country’s economy to a halt. Infrastructure and agriculture have been decimated. The national income has been cut in half. Over a third of businesses have shuttered. 60 percent of Yemenis are without jobs. Nearly five million children do not have access to education.
Yemen is now considered to be the largest humanitarian crisis in the world.
A recent study commissioned by UNDP has confirmed that progress on socio-economic indicators has been set back by over 20 years.
Far from building on previous achievements, development in Yemen is currently in descent.
My message is therefore clear, the only viable solution for Yemen is peace.
One of the main objectives behind my visit to Yemen was to explore how development initiatives- alongside humanitarian support- can lead to peace and to discuss how the UN Development Programme, together with its partners and the international community, can work with all Yemenis to lay the foundation for a future with viable alternatives to war and chaos.
In the midst of the crisis, I saw the possibilities for a different future for Yemen.
In Aden, I discussed options for rebuilding vital government and economic institutions, with senior leaders in Government and the Central Bank, and explored how UNDP can provide technical expertise to stabilize the economy.
In each city, I met and heard from Yemeni people affected by the conflict and ensuing economic collapse. They want peace, relief, and their dignity restored. I witnessed firsthand the determination and resilience of Yeminis in turning challenges into opportunities.
Through groundbreaking initiatives with donors such as the World Bank, the European Union and the Government of Japan, and national partners such as Yemen’s For All Foundation, Social Fund for Development, Public Works Project and Sustainable Development Foundation, I met inspiring individuals from rural areas who look to us for income generating opportunities.
Individuals like Ahmed, who despite being wheelchair-bound, has not lost his optimism and determination for a better future for himself and his family and has undergone vocational training to set up a shop to repair mobile phones. And Nihayah, a recently divorced mother to a young son, who previously worked as a day labourer in farms and was unable to meet her basic needs. Nihayah has benefitted from training and start-up funding which have allowed her to establish a clothing shop in her home. Her life has improved, and her son is now able to go to school. Ahmed and Nihayah can now meet their basic needs as well as save for the future, as have hundreds of others who benefitted from the training and start-up funding package.
There is also the school in the Old City of Sana’a with their heroic headmistress and staff, which UNDP in partnership with Yemen’s Public Works Project has rehabilitated. Providing education to over three thousand girls, it is dismaying that the children and their teachers - who haven’t been paid for months - have become accustomed to the sounds of gunfire and explosions. This is one of hundreds of projects which a pioneering programme of UNDP and the World Bank is currently supporting across Yemen.
In Aden, I also visited 3500-year-old water tanks built in the mountains surrounding the city, which connect a system of canals and drains once considered to be the lifeline of the city. Due to the disruption of the waste and sewage management systems in the city, this very lifeline has now become a serious risk to the health of its residents.  Skilled Yemeni engineers, with support from a UNDP programme funded and supported from the World Bank and implemented by the Social Fund for Development, are working with communities to repair the dilapidated tanks and rehabilitate the channel to prevent cholera and other communicable diseases.
These pioneering partnerships in Yemen add a longer-term perspective of development to the current crisis response, as past conflicts have shown us that “relief now and development later” is not a model that can safeguard peace and promote prosperity once the conflict has ended.
Through the generosity of donors who have been keen to ensure the application of development perspectives in crisis response, the Yemeni people have had tangible improvements in their everyday lives.  Thanks to a pledge of $400 million from the International Development Association of the World Bank, UNDP has been able to support the access of people to jobs, education, healthcare and functioning markets in 300 districts across Yemen’s 22 governorate.
In Hodeidah, where the United Nations is working with the parties and the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to implement the Stockholm peace agreement, I visited the port- a symbol of hope for a better future for Yemen. Badly affected by the fighting and in desperate need of repairs, the port is the main lifeline for humanitarian and commercial imports into Yemen. As such, the port’s management and rehabilitation are at the core of the early implementation of the Stockholm agreement. Importing goods and the resumption of trade would allow Yemen to begin its economic recovery. UNDP is committed to supporting the much-needed repairs, to give an impetus to peace and lay the foundation for future development.
The Yemeni and international community are closely observing the progress, or lack thereof, that we will all make. Increased engagement is therefore needed on the political front to create the necessary conditions for such investments.
I have discussed this with the parties in Aden, Sanaa and Hodeidah and was encouraged by their continued commitment to make progress, with the support of the good offices of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and the United Nations Mission in Hodeidah (UNMHA).
As a development practitioner, I have seen the impact that restoring pride, dignity and functioning services make towards lasting reconstruction and peace.
As a champion for stronger linkages between relief and development, I call on the international community to stay on course, turn pledges into contributions and continue their support of Yemen and its people at this vital time in its history.
It is critical that our humanitarian colleagues in OCHA, WFP, UNICEF and the extended UN family as well as international NGOs, continue to deliver lifesaving assistance to the most vulnerable, under extremely challenging conditions.
I also call on our counterparts in Yemen to continue to create an environment that will provide us with access and enable us to implement and scale-up operations.
Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the countless Yemeni citizens and our colleagues in the United Nations and international NGOs who are engaged in humanitarian and development efforts and who I met during my visit. Their extraordinary commitment and support under extremely challenging circumstances deserves our admiration and respect.
We cannot wait for a brighter future for Yemen.
The time has come for us to put our hopes into concrete actions.

Title: IMF Staff Concludes Visit on Yemen
Content: 19 July 2019
An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team led by Koshy Mathai visited Amman during July 10-18, 2019, to meet with a Yemeni delegation including government and central bank representatives. The team also met private-sector participants. The discussions covered recent economic developments in Yemen, the outlook, and economic policies. At the end of the visit, Mr. Mathai made the following statement:
“Conflict has crippled Yemen’s economy and pushed the country into a humanitarian crisis. A sharp contraction in economic activity and hydrocarbon exports, along with a wide suspension of basic public services, have left some 17 million people in acute need of food aid and other forms of assistance. Public institutions, including the central bank, have been fragmented, contributing, among other problems, to coordination difficulties on import financing and nonpayment of salaries for many civil servants in areas outside government control.
“Macroeconomic pressures have abated recently but remain considerable. Following the sharp output declines of 2014-17, growth has moved back into positive territory, albeit now from a much lower per capita income level. Donor financing and increased hydrocarbon receipts were key factors in quelling last year’s dramatic volatility in the exchange rate and food prices, and basic food imports increased toward prewar levels, supported also by humanitarian aid. The government’s resumption of payments to a large number of workers and all pensioners in areas outside its control was a welcome step toward restoring household purchasing power. We urge the government to pay all civil-service salaries throughout the country.
“Additional donor financing, enhanced revenue collection, and further expenditure prioritization will be needed to maintain economic stability. Despite the expected increase in hydrocarbon revenues, the fiscal deficit will likely remain too large to be financed via non-inflationary means. Spending restraint while protecting priority spending, including transfers to the poor and salary payments across the country, will thus be necessary. Additional financing will also be needed, both to avoid resorting to central bank financing of the deficit and to support essential imports. The IMF is very concerned about the humanitarian and economic costs of the conflict, and is working with donors to urgently finance basic imports and support the payment of public-sector wages and social assistance.
“The government has already made significant progress in rebuilding its technical cadre and improving data collection and analysis, enabling it to take the important step of preparing a national budget for 2019—the first in five years. Further capacity building, however, will be needed and could be supported by donors in a range of areas including central bank operations and supervision, the payments system, and public financial management. Increased transparency and strengthened internal controls would also help build the confidence required to catalyze much-needed financial support from donors.
“Building on recent progress in strengthening administrative capacity, it will be critical to overcome institutional fragmentation and harmonize policy implementation across the country. Strengthened supervisory capacity over the entire financial system, including in terms of further promoting compliance with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards, will also be needed, as will improvements in statistics, public financial management, and other areas. All this would also enhance the absorption of capacity building support from donors, ensuring harmonized upgrading of the central bank systems across all its branches.
“The mission team would like to thank the authorities for the frank policy dialogue and looks forward to continued close engagement.”

Title: OHCHR Press briefing note on Yemen
Content: 12 July 2019
We are deeply alarmed by the imposition of the death penalty on 30 people by the Specialised First Instance Criminal Court of the de facto authorities in Sana’a. The 30 men – most of whom are academics, students and politicians affiliated with the Islah party that has been critical of the Houthis – were sentenced to death on Tuesday.
The UN Human Rights Office has received credible information suggesting that many of those convicted were subjected to arbitrary or unlawful detention, as well as torture and other ill-treatment in custody. They were arrested by members of the forces and popular committees affiliated with the Houthis at various points in 2016 and charged in April 2017 with allegedly participating in an organized armed group with the intention of carrying out criminal acts against the security personnel and popular committees affiliated with the Houthis, such as bombing and assassination in Sana’a, providing intelligence to aggressors, and affecting Yemen’s social peace and security.
We understand that the convictions and sentences will be appealed and call on the Appellate Court to take heed of the serious allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, and of violations of the fair trial and due process rights of the convicted people. Any politically motivated charges should be dismissed and international fair trial standards fully complied with.
The UN opposes the use of the death penalty in all circumstances.

Title: IOM helps nearly 30,000 people in Yemen rebuild shelters destroyed by floods
Content: 25 June 2019
Sana’a – Over 80,000 people in Yemen have been impacted by heavy rains and floods, since late May. Among those most affected are displaced communities whose makeshift shelters have failed to weather the storm, exposing them to the elements.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is distributing emergency aid items to flood survivors, particularly displaced families, in the worst-affected governorates: Aden, Abyan, Hajjah, Ibb and Taizz.
The world’s largest humanitarian crisis has been compounded by severe natural hazards. Every year, the people of Yemen feel the full force of extreme weather, including floods and cyclones. Over 1.1 million of the 3.65 million people displaced across Yemen are living in the five governorates, which experienced the heaviest rains this year.
As an initial response in all five governorates, IOM is distributing emergency shelter kits, which include wood, plastic sheeting, rope and tools, to nearly 30,000 people with damaged or destroyed temporary shelters. IOM is also distributing blankets, mattresses, buckets, kitchen sets and sleeping mats to help these families set up their shelters. The vast majority of those receiving emergency shelter and household kits are living in displacement sites due to the conflict.
Eight months ago, the conflict forced thirty-six-year-old father of seven, Abdullah Al-Jumai, from his home in Haradh to Shafer within Hajjah governorate. He and his family were displaced again within the Shafer locality by heavy rainfall a few weeks ago. Describing it as a tragedy, Abdullah said: “We were sleeping under trees during the rain.” He went on to say that proper shelter was all the family hoped for currently. IOM started an aid distribution to flood survivors in Hajjah on Sunday, 23 June.
A woman at an IOM distribution in Hajjah, 60-year-old Namja Isaa, described how for the past year her family, displaced to Shafer, lived in a shelter made of plastic sheets and grass. “In Yemen, we call them Aushash [hut] but it could not withstand the rain, so we became homeless,” said Namja.
Aden and Abyan governorates also experienced some of the heaviest rainfall in years. Displaced people’s shelters were destroyed, and flooding meant that what little belongings displaced families had were damaged.
IOM will continue to support flood-affected families beyond the current ongoing emergency shelter and household kits distribution, based on the needs of flood-affected communities, as assessed by the Shelter and Non-food Items (S-NFI) Cluster.
IOM is also supporting the S-NFI Cluster Common Pipeline, in partnership with the Cluster, to pre-position emergency shelter and household kits, which will enable cluster partners to support 5,780 flood-affected families across Yemen.

Title: Over 2,100 Ethiopian migrants return home from Yemen with IOM support
Content: 21 June 2019
Aden – Yesterday (20/06), a flight chartered by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) with 96 migrants on board took off from Yemen, headed for Ethiopia. This movement was the 18th flight from Aden to Addis Ababa under IOM’s Voluntary Humanitarian Return (VHR) programme since 28 May, helping a total of 2,133 stranded migrants, including 570 children, return home.
On 21 April, the authorities in Aden began detaining irregular migrants in large numbers. At the peak (between 27 April to 03 May), IOM estimates that over 5,000 people were held across three sites.  The majority of the returning migrants were detained, many for nearly two months, in a makeshift migrant detention site at the 22nd of May Stadium in Aden city.
Since April, IOM has been coordinating partners’ response to this acute humanitarian situation. IOM is providing emergency food, water, sanitation and 24-hour health services to migrants in the stadium. IOM also established a diarrhoea treatment centre (DTC) in Ibn Khaldoon Hospital to help those migrants suffering from acute watery diarrhoea (AWD).
While IOM has supported over 2,000 people to return home so far, an additional 2,000 migrants are still in the stadium, many of whom are children. In the coming week, IOM will support the voluntary return of the remaining children.
“IOM provides voluntary humanitarian return assistance to detained migrants, as a last resort, and does not support the further detention of migrants, especially children, women and vulnerable groups,” said Mohammed Abdiker, IOM Director of Operations of Emergencies.
“All governments are obliged to provide protection for all people within their borders, regardless of immigration status. This protection is extended to detained migrants, including access to food, water, sanitation, health services and safe accommodation,” he added.
Despite the conflict in Yemen, migrants seeking opportunities in Gulf countries continue to make the treacherous journey by land and sea to the Arabian Peninsula. All along the route, migrants face many challenges in accessing protection and assistance.
Abdiker reaffirmed IOM’s commitment to supporting Yemen and other governments in the region to better manage migration, ensuring the safety and dignity of migrants.

Title: World Food Programme begins partial suspension of aid in Yemen
Content: 20 June 2019
ROME – The United Nations World Food Programme has started a partial suspension of food assistance operations in areas of Yemen under the control of the Sana’a-based authorities. The decision was taken as a last resort after lengthy negotiations stalled on an agreement to introduce controls to prevent the diversion of food away from some of the most vulnerable people in Yemen.
WFP’s priority remains to feed the hungriest children, women and men of Yemen. But as in any conflict zone, some individuals seek to profit by preying on the vulnerable and diverting food away from where it is most needed. WFP has been seeking the support of the Sana’a-based authorities to introduce a biometric registration system that would prevent diversion and protect the Yemeni families we serve, ensuring food reaches those who need it most.
Unfortunately, we are yet to reach agreement. The integrity of our operation is under threat and our accountability to those we help has been undermined. WFP has repeatedly appealed to the Sana’a-based authorities to grant us the space and freedom to operate according to the principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and operational independence, which guide our work in 83 countries around the world.
Too many Yemenis have suffered for too long during this ongoing conflict. We will continue to seek cooperation from the Sana’a-based authorities and we remain optimistic that a way forward can be found. We are ready to immediately resume food distributions once we reach agreement on an independent beneficiary identification exercise and the roll out of a biometric registration system.
At this stage, with the support of the entire United Nations system, we are suspending in Sana’a city only, affecting 850,000 people. WFP will maintain nutrition programmes for malnourished children, pregnant and nursing mothers throughout the period of suspension.

Title: Community Health Workers at the centre of a joint UNICEF-EU exhibition in Brussels, Belgium
Content: 18 June 2019
Sana’a/Brussels – Together with the European Union (EU), UNICEF Yemen is launching an exhibition in Brussels, Belgium to promote Community Health Workers networks and UNICEF-EU partnership to empower women in the health sector in Yemen. The exhibition will run from 21st June to 5th July and will be freely open to the public.
The “Carry Hope for Yemen” exhibition will be built around the first aid kit blue bag carried by the health workers in their villages to provide lifesaving services to mothers and children in rural areas, raising awareness about the situation of children and the caregivers in Yemen and focusing mainly on the EU-UNICEF results achieved in the areas of health and nutrition.
Yemen is currently one of the worst countries for a child to live in as it is facing a conflict which has been ongoing for more than 4 years. A child dies every 10 minutes in the country due to preventable causes, including; diseases, malnutrition, food shortage, and lack of clean water. More than 19 million, half of them being children, are in dire need of basic health care.
Together with the EU’s Development aid (EuropeAid), UNICEF launched Community Health Workers Networks in Yemen, to bring to communities much needed health services. The community health workers offer services which include immunization, screening and referral for childhood illnesses and malnutrition.
There are currently more than 1,800 community health workers in Yemen, that have been trained by the local health authorities with the support of UNICEF and the EU. So far, 639,000 under five children received health services, including malnutrition screening and treatment and more than 353,000 pregnant and lactating women were reached with maternal health and newborn care services.
Every day, the partnership between the European Union and UNICEF supports the lives of the most affected children and families in Yemen.
The Carry Hope for Yemen exhibition will tell the stories of Community Health Workers and the bags they carry to provide lifesaving services to children and their families in rural areas in Yemen.
The exhibition will open from Friday, 21st June to Friday, 5th July 2019 at the G3 Pop Up Art Gallery (Rue de la Madeleine 51, 1000 Brussels).

Title: One woman and six newborns die every two hours from complications during pregnancy or childbirth in Yemen - UNICEF
Content: 14 June 2019

New York/ Amman/ Sana'a– One woman and six newborns die every two hours in Yemen from complications during pregnancy or childbirth, UNICEF said today in the first of a series of short snapshots on maternal and newborn health Yemen.
“Bringing life into the world in Yemen can all too often turn into a tragedy for entire families,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Decades of underdevelopment and years of intense fighting have left essential public services, including crucial healthcare for mothers and babies, on the brink of total collapse.”
The Childbirth and parenting in a war zone series, released this week, also notes that the maternal mortality rate has risen sharply since the escalation of the conflict, from five maternal deaths a day in 2013 to 12 maternal deaths a day in 2018.
Additional findings include:
Access to quality ante- and post-natal health services is key to newborn and maternal survival. In the absence of adequate services, and because of lack of access and unaffordable transport costs, community health workers are fast becoming ‘providers of last resort’ for women and children – especially in remote, rural and war-affected areas. However, they too face challenges such as insecurity and the lack of supplies and transport.
Half of all health facilities in Yemen are not functional due to staff shortages, lack of supplies, inability to meet operational costs or limited access. Those still running face severe shortages in medicine, equipment and staff, putting lives at risk.
Working with partners on the ground, UNICEF is supporting community-based service delivery and primary healthcare facilities, with a focus on continuous care before and during the pregnancy, around the time of birth and after birth for both mother and baby.
At the community level, UNICEF and partners also support community midwives and health volunteers to provide case management of common childhood illnesses and home-based maternal and newborn care.
UNICEF is calling on all parties to the conflict and the international community to:
“Antenatal care and skilled health attendance at delivery are essential to the survival of both mothers and babies,” said Fore. “As the world marks the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we renew our call for all children – in Yemen and elsewhere – to enjoy their full rights to health, education, protection and peace.”

Title: Hodeidah: Providing critical vehicles to support demining efforts
Content: 28 May 2019
Sana’a -Today the United Nations Development Programme provided our national partner, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Center (YEMAC), with 20 Hilux vehicles to support their daily demining efforts in the ports of Hodeidah, Ras al-Isa and Salif. The vehicles will be immediately dispatched to ensure the safety and security of the deminers as they work to safeguard the passage of desperately needed humanitarian aid for more than the 80 per cent of the Yemenis in need of assistance.
“Seventy per cent of Yemen’s imports and 80 per cent of humanitarian assistance passes through the ports of Hodeidah – they are absolutely crucial to commercial and humanitarian activities in Yemen,” says UNDP’s Resident Representative, Mr. Auke Lootsma. “UNDP’s efforts to support YEMAC’s productivity is critical – not only in the ports but throughout Yemen – to ensure the safety, security and well-being of the Yemeni people.”
The vehicle handover is the first of a larger vehicle procurement for YEMAC in both northern and southern Yemen. In total, UNDP has purchased 72 vehicles – including new field vehicles, trucks and ambulances – and equipment that will be evenly distributed in support of YEMAC’s country-wide operations to help ensure deminers are better equipped and better able to work within the challenging Yemen environment.
Today’s handover is a part of UNDP’s commitment to the Stockholm Agreement where the organization is playing a key role in the civilian component of its implementation – with a focus upon Mine Action, support to port operations, and recovery. “YEMAC’s work clearing the ports of Hodeidah – and UNDP’s role to ensure they are best equipped to do so – is vital to the future of the country and the welfare of the Yemeni people,” said Lootsma.
UNDP has supported humanitarian mine action efforts in Yemen since the mid-1990s with an emphasis in institution building, capacity development, technical assistance, operational support and resource mobilisation. Currently, UNDP works closely with YEMAC on clearance activities, unexploded ordnance destruction and is assisting in its overarching work.

Title: Delayed humanitarian flights leaving Yemen put migrants at risk
Content: 27 May 2019
Aden – Over 2,300 Ethiopian migrants detained in adverse conditions in Aden, Yemen, were due to return home with the International Organization for Migration’s (IOM) support this week. The eight-day operation, set to begin Saturday (25/05), was delayed by rescinded flight permissions.
Since mid-April, authorities in Aden, Abyan and Lahj governorates have detained irregular migrants – predominantly from Ethiopia – in makeshift detention sites. At the peak, around 5,000 people were held in two sports stadium and one military camp without basic services. IOM and partners have been providing critical lifesaving support like water, food and healthcare to those detained.
As part of its support package to stranded, vulnerable migrants, IOM offers return assistance from countries in crisis under its Voluntary Humanitarian Return (VHR) programme.
In Aden’s 22nd of May Stadium, IOM screened and registered 2,315 Ethiopian migrants, including 150 women and 470 children, who urgently want to return home from the conflict zone.
“IOM is offering return assistance to help protect migrants detained in Aden and we need the support of the international community to help us to get these migrants home,” said Mohammed Abdiker, IOM Director of Operations and Emergencies in Geneva.
IOM obtained approval from the relevant authorities to begin the return movement to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital, on Saturday (25/05), with one flight planned each day until 2 June. On Friday, the Coalition and the Government of Yemen postponed the departure of the first VHR flight until at least Wednesday (29/05). This five-day delay puts into question how many of the eight flights will be able to depart.
This delay threatens the safety of more than 2,300 migrants who continue to be held in conditions inconsistent with internationally-agreed standards, exposed to severe health and protection risks. Earlier this month, at least 14 migrants detained in Lahj died due to complications related to acute watery diarrhea. Armed security personnel remain present in the 22nd of May Stadium, posing safety concerns and complicating humanitarian access.
“Lives have been lost due to disease brought on by the appalling detention conditions and one young man, shot while detained, will likely never walk again," said Abdiker.
"The flight delays are putting thousands of migrants’ lives at further risk. We are urging the leaders of the Coalition and the Government of Yemen to urgently approve these flights, ensuring that all who need to go home do so with safety and dignity."
Abdiker reaffirmed IOM’s commitment to support Yemen and other governments in the region to identify sustainable responses to irregular migration.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: Strikes kill more than ten people in Taizz
Content: 25 May 2019
Sana’a – On 24 May 2019, twelve civilians were reported killed when a strike hit a fuel station in Mawiyah District, east of Taizz City in Taizz Governorate. The dead include seven children. Two other injured people are being treated in a local hospital.
“Innocent lives continue to be lost in Yemen because of this conflict,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen. “We offer our deep condolences to the bereaved families and condemn this attack, as we condemn all violations of international humanitarian law.”
This is the second such attack during the holy month of Ramadhan. Nine days ago, dozens of people, including children and health workers, were injured and killed when strikes hit Sana’a. During the first quarter of the year, more than 900 civilian casualties have been reported.
“The real numbers are almost certainly higher,” said Ms. Grande. “The parties must realise that they are accountable for every man, woman and child killed or injured in this senseless conflict. No one is above the laws of war.”
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the total population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Despite a difficult operating environment, 131 international and national partners worked across Yemen in the first two months of 2019, to respond to the most acute needs.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis including 10 million people who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs each month. As of today, the operation is only 22 per cent funded. Humanitarian agencies are appealing to donors to provide funds as quickly as possible.

Title: Hodeidah: Thousands take to the streets for Ramadan clean-up campaign
Content: 21 May 2019
Hodeidah  – Communities throughout Hodeidah are participating in a Clean-Up initiative – removing waste from the streets, during the holy month of Ramadan. From 20 May to 20 June 2019, four thousand citizens of the Mina, Hali and Hawak districts are helping to restore “life as usual” in the port city.
While 350 tonnes of solid waste are produced in Hodeidah each day, conflict has impeded basic services such as waste collection. This has caused an accumulation of waste in the city, contaminated the water supply and increased the risk of cholera – which is most prevalent during the rainy season.
Organized in collaboration with the Sustainable Development Foundation (SDF) and the District Cleaning Fund (DCF), the Ramadan Clean-Up is designed to help address the issue of waste in two ways: first, by reducing the production of waste by communities; and secondly; by improving the ability of local institutions like the DCF to deliver services.
Communities are trained to reduce the volume of waste they produce, while also participating in the collection of waste that already exists.
The DCF will benefit from additional human labour throughout the initiative; and UNDP will provide fuel and spare vehicle parts so that the DCF can repair damaged vehicles for future use.
It is estimated that 110,000 people will benefit from the initiative. The first of its kind, the Ramadan Clean-Up will serve as a pilot, to be followed by similar activities in the future.
Collective action is critical for improving living conditions, protecting public health, and reducing the risk of disease. More broadly, it is a way for communities to take ownership and “bring back normal life.”

Title: World Food Programme to consider suspension of aid in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen
Content: 20 May 2019
ROME – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is working tirelessly to meet the needs of millions of hungry Yemeni children, women and men who are threatened by a potential famine because of conflict. Our operational independence, impartiality and neutrality are paramount if we are to succeed and we need immediate and unrestrained access to the hungry so that we can reach those who need us most.
As WFP strives to deliver on our humanitarian mandate we face daily challenges due to the unrelenting fighting and insecurity in Yemen.  And yet, our greatest challenge does not come from the guns, that are yet to fall silent in this conflict - instead, it is the obstructive and uncooperative role of some of the Houthi leaders in areas under their control.
Humanitarian workers in Yemen are being denied access to the hungry, aid convoys have been blocked, and local authorities have interfered with food distribution, and – most importantly, there have been repeated obstacles placed in the way of our independent selection of beneficiaries and a request for a roll out of a biometric registration system. This would allow WFP to identify and target the most hungry and ensure that they are the beneficiaries of food assistance.
This has to stop.
In 2019, WFP aims to feed around 12 million of the most vulnerable people – nearly half of the total Yemeni populations, at a cost to the international community around US$175 million a month.  Already, many are not being reached because of the obstacles that are being put in our way.  If we are not given the access and freedom to decide who gets this vital assistance, then we will have to take the hard decision of implementing a phased suspension of our operations in Houthi controlled areas.
The conflict in Yemen has thrown up multiple challenges but until now, WFP has worked with leaders to find solutions that have ensured food gets to the hungry.  In 2017, WFP spoke out when the Saudi-led Coalition was delaying the movement of new cranes to the port in Hodeidah and mounting a blockade on the port that threatened the flow of aid to the hungry.  The Coalition leaders listened and in time, the cranes were delivered and the port was reopened to aid.
Negotiations with Houthi leaders on the question of independent access to the hungry are yet to yield tangible results.  Some of the Houthi leaders have made positive commitments and are working closely with us to create conditions that would allow for a fully independent humanitarian process of selecting the most needy and ensuring that only they receive the required assistance. Unfortunately, they are being let down by other Houthi leaders who have broken assurances they gave us on stopping food diversions and finally agreeing to a beneficiary identification and biometric registration exercise.
Earlier this month, WFP wrote to the Houthi leadership again.  This time we confirmed that WFP has reluctantly reached the conclusion that unless progress is made on previous agreements we will have to implement a phased suspension of aid.
This phased suspension of WFP operations will be taken as a last resort and we will do everything within our powers to ensure that the weakest and most vulnerable – especially children – do not suffer.  Nutrition activities that directly target malnourished children and women will continue, in order to mitigate any regrettable impact that a partial suspension may have on their health and well-being. We owe this to the people of Yemen and our international donors who support our operation.
WFP still hopes that good sense will prevail and a suspension will not happen.   The ultimate responsibility for the welfare of their people lies with the Yemeni leadership.  If WFP is allowed to deliver an operation that meets minimum international standards, we are still ready to play our part and to ensure a better future for the millions of Yemenis who are struggling to feed their families.

Title: World Bank and UNDP: Continuing strong partnership for Yemeni people
Content: 19 May 2019
Sana’a — The World Bank has renewed its pledge to continue working with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to prevent Yemen from slipping into a full-blown famine.
In the continuation of their US$300 million successful partnership, which has provided nearly 3.4 million Yemenis with access to key services and helped 173,000 mothers and children to be treated for malnutrition, the World Bank’s IDA signs another two-year recommitment with UNDP to continue the Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project (YECRP).
After four years of continuous conflict, this partnership has never been more important for the Yemeni people who are facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. With growing risk of famine and increasing rates of malnutrition, food insecurity is at its highest with 20 million Yemenis struggling to have three meals a day, while 10 million do not know from where their next meal will come.
Recognizing that humanitarian response alone isn’t enough and to preserve Yemen’s developmental gains for post-conflict recovery, the World Bank works with UNDP to support livelihoods and preserve vital and key services of water, food, health, education and safe roads. This has been possible by shoring up the national-based Social Fund for Development (SFD) and Public Works Projects (PWP) and their community networks to deliver these services across Yemen.
Building on its extensive field presence and working with local institutions in Yemen, UNDP will continue to work with the World Bank and its key partners – SFD and PWP – to stave off famine by providing support to nutrition interventions, cash for work, vital services, and small businesses to continue access to key local goods and services.
A part of its 2020-2021 Yemen Country Engagement Note, the World Bank has recommitted to the delivery of effective support to the Yemeni people for the next two years in the midst of ongoing conflict. Priorities will be preserving institutional capacity, improving service delivery resilience, and providing support to conflict-affected poor and vulnerable Yemenis. The new strategy will also focus on encouraging immediate economic growth by creating emergency jobs and supporting the private sector.

Content: 16 May 2019
Sana’a – Today, several people were killed, and dozens injured when strikes hit Sana’a City. Preliminary reports indicate that five children have died and 16 more are wounded; additional causalities, including health workers, have been reported.
“We grieve with the families of the victims and are aghast this tragedy has occurred,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen.
The injured, including children, have been rushed to hospitals for medical treatment. Partners are providing support in two of the main hospitals receiving the wounded. A Somali refugee woman and her daughter are among the injured receiving critical treatment.
“This terrible incident is a tragic reminder of all the reasons this war must stop” said Ms. Grande.
“International humanitarian law is clear,” said Ms. Grande. “Everything must be done to protect civilians. This is not optional. This is a legal, and above all moral obligation on all parties.”
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the total population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection.

Title: UNDP: Standing ready to help upgrade facilities at newly demilitarized Hodeidah ports
Content: 11 May 2019
Sana’a – As military and security forces leave Hodeidah, Ras al-Isa and Salif ports, the United Nations Development Programme is ready to help improve the efficiency and productivity of the ports.
“Hodeidah port is the lifeline for the north of Yemen,” said Ms. Lise Grande, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen.
“Upgrading the facilities at the ports is urgent,” said Ms. Grande. “It is a race against time to move food, fuel, medicines and other vital commodities as quickly and smoothly as possible to the millions of people across the country who depend on humanitarian assistance.”
As soon as redeployment is complete, UNDP will help to upgrade port facilities including watch towers, berths and the navigation channels.
“This is phase one of our critical efforts to restore normal operations at these ports,” said Auke Lootsma, UNDP Yemen’s Resident Representative. “We are drawing upon our extensive experience, as well as national and international expertise, to ensure we can fully restore the functionality of the ports as soon as possible.”
The redeployment follows commitments made in the Stockholm Agreement in December 2019, which has been supported by the UN Mission to Support the Hodeidah Agreement (UNMHA), UNDP, the World Food Program and many other UN agencies.
“Twenty million Yemenis are food insecure and hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of cholera,” said Ms. Grande. “The UN is ready to do everything we can to make the Stockholm Agreement a success.”
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion, but is currently only 20 per cent funded. The United Nations is appealing to donors to provide funds as quickly as possible.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: UN is racing against time to salvage food stocks in Hodeidah
Content: 07 May 2019
Sana’a – On 5 May, a UN technical team led by the World Food Programme (WFP) gained access to the Red Sea Mills on the eastern outskirts of Hodeidah City as part of initial efforts to salvage a stock of 51,000 metric tons of wheat flour stored at the facility. The Mills have been inaccessible for the last eight months due to intense fighting.
“Securing access to the Mills has been a long, difficult and frustrating process,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “We’ve tried and tried and tried to get into the facility. It’s a relief that we have finally been given the green light to use an existing corridor. It is very positive that the parties have taken this step.”

“Everyone knows we need the food in the Mills. It’s now a race against time to salvage supplies that can feed 3.7 million people for a month,” Ms. Grande said.
Twenty million people across the country are food insecure, including nearly 10 million who are suffering from extreme levels of hunger.
"The situation in Yemen remains deeply precarious. We know that our assistance has been critical in averting a famine in Yemen, but the scale of the need remains huge and every grain of wheat is vitally needed” said WFP Yemen Country Director Stephen Anderson.

“WFP’s emergency response in Yemen is the largest in the world,” said Ms. Grande. “What WFP does every month is heroic. WFP is already providing food assistance to nearly 10 million people and will soon be reaching 12 million people. It’s an incredible operation.”
“With so many lives at risk, we need everyone to do everything possible to ensure that all humanitarian partners have free, unimpeded and immediate access to people who need and deserve our assistance. Stopping humanitarians from doing their jobs by diverting resources or delaying funding or blocking access or interfering in assessments, targeting and monitoring is just not acceptable. The truth is that thousands and thousands of people may not survive if we can’t get to them.”
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the total population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. A total of 230 out of Yemen’s 333 districts face the risk of famine. Despite a difﬁcult operating environment, 131 international and national partners worked across Yemen in the first two months of 2019, to respond to the most acute needs.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis including 10 million people who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs each month. As of today, the operation is only 14 per cent funded. Humanitarian agencies are appealing to donors to provide funds as quickly as possible.

Title: Yemen Court must not punish faith with death – UN experts
Content: 29 April 2019
GENEVA  – UN human rights experts* have urged the de facto authorities in Sana’a to quash immediately the death sentence against Hamid Kamali bin Haydara, a follower of the Bahá’í faith.
"We cannot accept the injustice of having anyone punished by death on the grounds of his religion or belief and for belonging to a religious minority," the experts said.
"Not only would such a sentence amount to a serious violation of an internationally protected human right, but the Court would also be sending a wrong signal to the whole nation and the world if it upheld the decision of a death sentence against Haydara.
"The right to life and the right to freedom of religion or belief are non-derogable rights and must be respected at all times," the experts said.
The Specialized Criminal Court handed down a death sentence on Haydara on 2 January 2018, for "compromising the independence of the Republic of Yemen",  based on unfounded allegations of his collaboration with Israel and members of the global Jewish community, as well as for spreading the Bahá’í faith in the country. Haydara’s appeal against the decision was last heard on 2 April 2019 in Sana’a.
"The charge of ‘compromising the independence of the Republic of Yemen’ does not meet the threshold of 'most serious crimes' warranting the death penalty under international law," the experts said.
"We deplore the blatant denial of the right of individuals to choose, have or adopt a religion or belief of their choice, and are deeply disturbed by the Prosecutor’s use of his personal religious commitments as a basis to reject the validity of the case made by the appellant.
"Not only did the Prosecutor demonise and deride the Bahá’í faith in his memo, but openly threatened anyone working in Haydara’s defence to be considered as a traitor to the nation and religion.
"The de facto authorities should release Haydara promptly following the annulment of his death sentence, and desist from harassing or intimidating defence lawyers."
The experts urged the Yemeni Government and the de facto authorities to respond to their concerns and end the persecution of the Bahá’í community in Yemen.

Title: Conflict: Yemen has already lost two decades of Human Development
Content: 23 April 2019
Amman– Ongoing conflict in Yemen has already reversed human development by 21 years, according to a UNDP-commissioned study released today. The study warns of exponentially growing impacts of conflict on human development. It projects that if the war ends in 2022, development gains will have been set back by 26 years — almost a generation. If it continues through 2030, that setback will increase to four decades.
Commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Yemen and conducted by researchers from the Frederick S. Pardee Centre for International Futures, Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver, the study entitled Assessing the Impact of War on Development in Yemen considers the impact of conflict on the priorities articulated in the globally agreed Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals.
The study compares three potential quantitative modelling scenarios for the conflict ending in 2019, 2022 and 2030 against a hypothetical scenario where the conflict did not escalate after 2014. Based on the scenarios, the study attempts to quantify the impact of conflict on multiple dimensions of development, including demographic outlook, economic conditions, infrastructures, health and education.
“Human development has not just been interrupted. It has been reversed,” asserted UNDP Yemen Resident Representative, Auke Lootsma. “Even if there were to be peace tomorrow, it could take decades for Yemen to return to pre-conflict levels of development. This is a big loss for the people of Yemen.”
The study projects that, if this conflict ends in 2019, economic output losses will add up to around US$88.8 billion –a reduction of US$2,000 (purchasing power parity) in the GDP per capita. By 2030, the study estimates that 71 percent of the population will be living in extreme poverty; 84 percent will be malnourished; and estimated losses in economic output will amount to around US$657 billion—more than doubling the decrease in GDP per capita to a staggering a US$4,600 (purchasing power parity). Indirect deaths, caused by lack of access to food, health care, and infrastructure services, will be five times greater than direct deaths.
“The long-term impacts of conflict are vast and place it among the most destructive conflicts since the end of the Cold War,” states the report; and further deterioration of the situation “will add significantly to prolonged human suffering, retard human development in Yemen, and could further deteriorate regional stability.”

Title: UNOPS to operate 27 solar power modules in Dhamar Governorate
Content: 22 April 2019
A meeting held today, presided by the Senior Deputy Governor of Dhamar Governorate, Fahad Abdulhamid Al-Marwani, with the UNOPS Representative, Eng. Khaled Basalamah discussed arrangements for implementing a number of emergency projects in sectors of roads, education, health, hygiene, and water, provided by UNOPS under the Urban Cities Project for the current year.
Al-Marwani pointed out that the governorate leadership relies on UNOPS projects interventions to meet a part of the essential needs of the vital and service sectors, indicating the needs of the governorates in the context of continued displacement and resource scarcity due to the aggression and blockade, and pointing out the importance of coordination with the local authority and the concerned offices in the preparation of studies and implementation phases.
Al-Marwani urged the expeditious completion of the arrangements to start implementing the approved projects for the current year in various sectors, and he emphasized the preparedness of the local authority to facilitate the work of international and humanitarian organizations to ensure the success of their projects in the governorate.
Further, the Deputy Governor of Dhamar Governorate, Mahmood Al-Jubain, pointed out the importance of expanding the UNOPS projects during the forthcoming period to cover the various districts due to the urgent humanitarian needs, in rural areas in particular.
For his part, the UNOPS Representative, Eng. Khaled Basalamah, pointed out that the first phase projects include the operation of 27 solar power modules within health and education sectors, including 20 schools and seven health centers, rehabilitation of the waste dump and the workshop of the hygiene fund, in addition to implementing 5 projects in the sectors of public works and roads and a cleaning campaign in the city.
Directors of Executive Offices in the governorate reviewed the most important needs and projects that could be assimilated within UNOPS interventions during the current year.

Title: Japan Supports Health Care in Yemen through USD 2.5 Million Contribution to IOM
Content: 16 April 2019
Sana’a – With more than 3.6 million people displaced, a crumbling economy and an overstretched health care system, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen continues to get worse. To support communities affected by the conflict, the Government of Japan has contributed USD 2,500,000 to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to reach over 100,000 people through emergency health services.
As the conflict enters its fifth year, just over 51 per cent of health facilities in Yemen are fully functional and approximately 19.7 million people are in need of health care.
Even during peacetime, most public health facilities were strained. Today, lack of financial resources, doctors, medicine and medical equipment has caused further deterioration and the increased number of people seeking medical assistance has overwhelmed medical facilities.
With Japan’s contribution, IOM will ensure lifesaving and basic health services in two hospitals and four health care centres across five governorates: Al Mahwit, Sa’ada, Hajjah, Taizz and Shabwah. Through this project, IOM will improve access to a full package of primary health services, as well as referrals to emergency secondary and tertiary level care, for the most vulnerable communities in remote locations.
“We are sincerely concerned about the continuous deterioration of the health situation in Yemen due to the prolonged conflict,” said a representative from the Embassy of Japan to Yemen.
“This assistance to IOM comes to alleviate Yemeni people’s suffering in the current difficult situation, as part of a new package of humanitarian and stabilization efforts of Japan to the Yemeni people, amounting to approximately USD 32.8 million.”
“This contribution from the Government of Japan is coming at a vital time for the people of Yemen, as they are facing increased numbers of cholera cases,” said David Derthick, IOM Yemen Chief of Mission.
“The country’s health care system is almost at breaking point, while health needs continue to grow. As humanitarians, it is our duty to alleviate this immense suffering to whatever extent possible. These funds will support our health assistance in some of the hardest to reach areas in Yemen,” he added.
The Government of Japan and IOM have a long history of partnership in responding to humanitarian crises around the world. In 2016, IOM implemented a large-scale Government of Japan funded project centred on providing humanitarian assistance to displaced and conflict-affected Yemenis in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and health care.
IOM provides health care to people in Yemen through mobile responses and by supporting public health facilities across several governorates. In 2018, the Organization conducted 688,279 medical consultations for displaced people, conflict-affected communities and migrants.

Title: Statement Attributed to the Special Envoy of The Secretary General for Yemen Martin Griffiths
Content: 09 April 2019
Amman - I am deeply saddened to hear of the tragic deaths of civilians, the majority of whom were young female students attending school, in Saewan area in Sana’a, on 7 April.
I would like to offer my sincere condolences both to those affected by this tragic loss of life, and to Yemeni civilians across the country who continue to suffer the devastating impacts of the conflict.
This loss of life shows the terrible impact that the conflict continues to have on society’s most vulnerable and on the country’s infrastructure and essential services.
I strongly urge all parties to make every possible effort to put an end to civilian suffering and allow young Yemenis to grow up in peace and safety. Only an inclusive political solution will end this cycle of violence and destruction.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: Tens of civilians wounded and killed in Sana’a
Content: 08 April 2019
Sana’a –Preliminary reports indicate that on 7 April as many as eleven civilians, including five students, were killed and scores of civilians injured in Shu’aub District in Sana’a City.
“These are terrible, senseless deaths and injuries and we offer our deep condolences to the families of the victims.” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “Every effort must be made to understand the circumstances that led to this tragedy.”
“Protecting people and protecting civilian infrastructure are core principles of international humanitarian law,” said Ms. Grande. “Even as we are struggling to address the worst food security crisis in the world and one of the worst cholera outbreaks in modern history, these principles are being violated.”
“The people who are the most vulnerable and who need our help and compassion the most are the people paying the highest price for this terrible conflict” said Ms. Grande. “This is wrong, wrong, wrong.”
During 2018, humanitarian organizations reported an average of 45 incidents of armed violence each week. Thousands of civilians were killed last year, including more than 950 children.
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the total population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and starvation and 7 million people are malnourished.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis including 10 million people who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs every month. As of today, the YHRP is 6 per cent funded.

Title: UNDP seeks to improve conditions in prisons
Content: 03 April 2019
Sana’a – Today correction facilities in Dhamar, Hodeidah, Ibb and Sana’a governorates received 7,000 mattresses provided by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Rule of Law (RoL) Project in Yemen.
Assessments carried out in abovementioned governorates have shown that there are needs to improve the conditions of the prisons on overcrowding, hygiene and sanitation in order to prevent such as Scabies and other diseases. . As an immediate humanitarian response to the correction facilities in Yemen, UNDP replacing and providing mattresses, prisoners will be healthier and will have more suitable living conditions.
With funding from the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office (PBSO), the Rule of Law project provides support to prisoners and detainees for better living conditions
“The Rule of Law project helps the authorities and partners fulfill their responsibility to meet the required standards such as the improving the hygiene and sanitation through the provision of mattresses and other necessary items. The mattresses are the first step in ensuring that the conditions of the prisoners are being improved. But we must also ensure that the standards go beyond ensuring proper shelter and nutrition; prisoner’s rights must also encompass health and psychosocial support,’’ says Surayo Buzurukova, Team Leader Governance and Peace-Building implements the Rule of Law project.
UNDP’s RoL project aims to improve the living conditions and treatment of detainees and assists with renovations of prison infrastructure like sanitation, water, psychosocial services, health and literacy. It also helps ensure the human rights of detainees by responding to protection needs and supporting prisons. These actions help prevent compromised human rights due to issues associated with frail state institutions, and budgetary and security constraints.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: Innocent civilians wounded and killed during attacks on hospitals in Sa’ada and Taizz
Content: 27 March 2019
Sana’a – At least seven civilians were killed and eight injured as a result of an airstrike yesterday on a hospital in Kitaf District in Sa’ada Governorate. Reports from the area confirm that insecurity is making rescue efforts difficult.
Three days ago, one of the main public hospitals in Taizz City was forced to close because of significant damage caused by intensified fighting. At least two civilians have been killed and five injured during fighting and attacks in Taizz City and Al Ashrafia areas in the Al Mudhaffer District.
“International humanitarian law is unequivocal on this point,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “Parties which resort to arms are required to do everything possible to protect hospitals and health facilities. This is not a voluntary commitment—it is a fundamental responsibility.”
“Cholera is starting to spread like wild-fire across the country. In the past three months, we’ve seen 200 deaths and more than 110,000 suspected cases,” said Ms. Grande. “It’s unconscionable that facilities are being destroyed just when people need them the most.”
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the total population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and starvation and 7 million people are malnourished.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires US$4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis including 10 million people who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs every month. As of today, the YHRP is 5 per cent funded.

Title: Griffiths to Yemeni women conference: "We have to walk an uphill"
Content: 27 March 2019
The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, took part this morning in the first day of the Yemeni Women Conference “Mediators for Peace”, organized by UN Women in Amman.
Addressing the opening of the conference, Griffiths extended thanks to UN Women for organizing this conference, and for all the Yemeni women who traveled to take part in this important event. The Special Envoy stressed the important role of Yemeni women in reaching an inclusive peace. He highlighted the contribution of the Women Technical Advisory Group, which worked closely with him during the Sweden Consultations, and will continue to work in the upcoming rounds of consultations.
The Special Envoy reiterated his conviction that the inclusion of women brings a better understanding of the conflict in Yemen and is crucial for a successful peace process. He expressed hope to see increased women representation at the formal level in future consultations. “We have to walk an uphill, with regard to women inclusion as well as other issues,” said Griffiths.
The Special Envoy also stressed his keenness to ensure a better inclusion of women, youth and civil society representatives through different tools, other than the formal participation in official forums.
The Yemeni Women Conference “Mediators for Peace”, which is organized by UN Women, brings together 100 Yemeni women, representing all walks of the Yemeni society, to discuss over two days the role of Yemeni women in peace-making and peace-building in Yemen.

Title: Overcoming adversity: UNDP supporting to Yemeni communities
Content: 18 March 2019
Aden – Seed grants for 12 community initiatives and 400 micro-businesses have been provided by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Yemen, in partnership with For All Foundation (FAF) and Oxfam. The projects helped nearly 407,000 people gain improved access to services such as schools, health centers and solar projects. They took place in two geographic areas in Yemen: Aden (Crater and Attawahi districts) and Lahj (Tuban and Tor Albaha districts) and were made possible through funding from the Government of Japan under the Yemen Livelihoods and Human Security Project.
To ensure transparency, the initiatives and micro-businesses were selected by a committee of representatives from UNDP, the International Labour Organization (ILO), implementing partners and local authorities from the targeted districts.
The 12 community initiatives selected were based upon criteria such as enhancing community protection and services that the community itself referred to as important. UNDP supported the initiatives by helping the communities provide access to services in the targeted districts through improved access to water, sanitation facilities, safe roads and solar energy.
UNDP, through implementing partners, supported 400 people from the targeted districts to develop micro-businesses intended to positively impact their communities. All participants received an USD $800 seed grant to establish community-based businesses – the majority of whom are women and youth directly affected by the trauma of conflict and war.
Participants were provided with vocational skills building training and expected to develop business proposals based upon their skills, experience and interests. The top areas of interest were solar energy, sewing, hair dressing, beekeeping, mobile maintenance and midwifery. Additionally, the participants were provided with business-advisor mentorships to help them successfully establish their businesses.
“This programme has changed my life! I have always hoped to have an opportunity to support my family and to be able to develop my skills. I have wanted to become a hairdresser for as long as I can remember, and with this seed grant, I can finally do it,” noted Hana Ahmed Hussien, a 27-year-old participant from Attwahai.
Through the Japanese funding, the Yemen Livelihoods and Human Security project was able to target Aden’s and Lahj’s most vulnerable individuals and neighborhoods. The key areas of focus included: (a) identification of needs and opportunities for affected communities to return to normal; (b) restoration of disrupted livelihoods of the crisis-affected population; and, (c) strengthening of community-based protection mechanisms with a focus on women and youth.

Under the auspices of the Governor of Abyan, Major General Abu Bakar Hussein Salem, and in coordination with the National Mine Action Program, the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) conducted on Monday, at the Lecture Hall, Water Department Building in Zinjibar, an awareness raising workshop on the hazards of mines and war remnants.
The workshop was attended by the general managers of the Planning and International Cooperation Office in the governorate, Mr. Waddah Hammas, Public Works office, Mr. Khaled Al Homaikani, the Endowment and Guidance Office, Mr. Fahmi Babarade, the General Manager of Zinjibar district, Mr. Ghassan Sheikh, the Education Manager in Zinjibar, Mr. Nader Al Shuhairi, social figures, religious leaders and civil society activists.
The General Manager of Zinjibar district addressed the audience on the importance of this workshop. He reminded the audience that Abyan witnessed two devastating wars motivated by political feuds that have had a destructive effect on the governorate and left daunting challenges that require the solidarity of everyone to overcome the ramifications of these wars, including the challenge of land mines. He added that passive behaviors and personal interests must be abandoned, and everyone must cooperate for the interest of Abyan that have been portrayed by some as an unsafe place but today it enjoys safety and security. The safety and security were only achieved because of the proactive and positive measures taken by the local authorities led by the Governor of the Governorate who succeeded in establishing the pillars of security in the governorate in cooperation with all the noble people of Abyan.
In turn, the Manager of the Public Works Office in Abyan, said that important projects are now being implemented in the city of Zinjibar in the fields of health, education, cleaning and demining by international organizations including the World Bank. After that, the consultant with UNOPS, Mr. Ahmed Al Hemyari, provided a description about the process of demining and raising the awareness of local people to avoid mine-contaminated areas as defined by the demining teams. He also explained different safety methods that have to be followed by local people to avoid mine risks.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: Scores of innocent civilians wounded and killed in attacks in Hajjah Governorate
Content: 11 March 2019
Sana’a, 11 March 2019 – Reports from Hajjah Governorate indicate that scores of civilians have been killed by strikes on houses in Kushar District during the past two days. Medical sources report that 22 people have died, including 12 children and 10 women. As many as 30 people have been reportedly injured, including 14 children aged between 1 and 18. Many of the injured children have been sent to hospitals in Abs district and in Sana’a for treatment and several require possible evacuation to survive.
“We condemn these deaths and injuries unequivocally,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “And we share our deep condolences with the families of the victims.”
“It is outrageous that innocent civilians continue to die needlessly in a conflict that should, and can be solved,” said Ms. Grande.
“A higher percentage of people in Yemen are hungry and suffering than in any other country,” said Ms. Grande.
Hajjah is one of the worst impacted provinces. More than a million people are hungry and thousands of new cholera cases are being reported across the governorate. “We fear that thousands of civilians are trapped between the parties and lack the basic services they need to survive,” said Ms. Grande.
“We’re doing everything we can to reach the people who need help in Hajjah and throughout the country. In Hajjah, we’re distributing emergency supplies and helping people to access safe drinking water and we’ve dispatched emergency Mobile Medical Teams,” said Ms. Grande.
“We desperately want to help people but we are facing serious problems. We need access, visas, specialized equipment and approvals for our programmes,” said Ms. Grande. “We are asking all parties to the conflict to help us do our life-saving work.”
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 80 per cent of the total population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and starvation and 7 million people are malnourished.
The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) requires USD 4.2 billion to assist more than 20 million Yemenis including 10 million people who rely entirely on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs every month.

Title: Donors pledge over $2.6 billion to ramp up humanitarian aid in Yemen
Content: 26 February 2019
Geneva – International donors today pledged US$2.62 billion to finance urgent and life-saving humanitarian aid to millions of people in Yemen in 2019. The pledges were announced in the Swiss city of Geneva during a high-level event convened by the United Nations and co-hosted by the governments of Switzerland and Sweden.
Yemen is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Fourteen million people are in acute need and another 10 million people require some form of humanitarian assistance or protection.
“The international community came together today to show support and solidarity with the people of Yemen. With your support, humanitarians across Yemen will reach even more women, men and children who are in such dire need,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said. “Echoing millions of suffering Yeminis, I urge the parties to continue negotiations and to choose the path to lasting peace. The UN and the wider international community are here to support you.”
Pledges were made by 40 countries and other donors to support humanitarian deliveries of food, nutrition, shelter, medicines, health services, protection and other essential relief in Yemen in 2019. The pledges, when committed, will help pay for the implementation of the UN-coordinated 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) which seeks $4.2 billion, and other humanitarian activities. Securing full funding for the YHRP remains a priority for the rest of the year.
“The time for peace has come,” said Simonetta Sommaruga, Vice President of the Federal Council of Switzerland, underlining Switzerland’s support to the UN peace process.
“The Stockholm Agreement is an important first step in that direction. Now, it’s crucial to build on the momentum it initiated," said Ms. Sommaruga, calling on all the parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law.
“The Stockholm Agreement concluded in December also has a strong humanitarian rationale and impact. It has to be implemented, and full and unimpeded humanitarian access granted, for assistance to reach the most vulnerable people throughout the entire country,” said Margot Wallström, Sweden's Minister for Foreign Affairs.
In addition to the pledging event, the governments of Sweden and Switzerland hosted a panel discussion on the Challenges of Food Security and the Role of the Economy with opening remarks by Peter Eriksson, the Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation, and moderated by the Head of the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit (SHA), Manuel Bessler.
At a pledging event in April last year more than $2 billion were pledged for humanitarian action in Yemen. The payment of these pledges ensured that aid groups could scale-up delivery as needs kept growing throughout 2018.

Title: WFP gains access to vital wheat stocks needed for Yemen's hungry people
Content: 26 February 2019
Sana’a – The United Nations World Food Programme has hailed a breakthrough in its emergency operation in Yemen after managing to reach the Red Sea Mills in Hodeidah for the first time in six months.
WFP has been appealing to Yemen’s warring sides for access to the mills which contain vital stocks of wheat. The facility lies close to a front line in the strategically located port city.
“Today’s visit to the Red Sea Mills is a crucial step forward but we need sustained access to the mills to begin the process of assessing the stock and moving the viable wheat to the Yemenis who desperately need it,” said WFP Country Director Stephen Anderson.

“This visit was the product of long negotiations between both parties facilitated by the UN’s Redeployment Coordination Committee. I thank everyone involved for their commitment to and respect for WFP’s mission to feed Yemen’s hungry.”

WFP lost access to the Red Sea Mills when intense fighting broke out in Hodeidah city in early September 2018. At the time, the mills contained 51,000 metric tons or a quarter of the agency’s in-country stock - enough wheat to feed 3.7 million people for one month. Properly stored wheat can last in silos for over a year.
In recent months, WFP has been using other wheat stocks as well as importing grain by sea and overland from Oman to cover the food needs of the population. WFP is currently scaling up to reach 12 million severely food insecure people in Yemen.
WFP and other members of the humanitarian community are attending a major pledging conference in Geneva today to mobilise resources for the crisis in Yemen. Some 20 million people – 70 percent of the population – are struggling to meet their daily food needs. WFP requires US$1.5 billion to ensure uninterrupted food assistance in Yemen throughout 2019.

Title: Yemen: Saving lives while keeping hope alive is critical
Content: 26 February 2019
New York  -  In  urging countries to support the humanitarian appeal for Yemen, the head of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) stressed that relief now and development must go hand in hand to avoid a bigger crisis in the long run.
“Past conflicts have shown that ‘relief now and development later’ is not a model that can safeguard the peace and promote prosperity once the conflict has ended,” said Achim Steiner, Administrator of UNDP.  “For Yemenis to prosper in the long run, and to have hope for their future, we must direct aid in a way that saves lives while also maintaining access to jobs, education, healthcare, and functioning markets.”
After four years of continuous conflict, Yemen is the worst humanitarian crisis today.  80% of the population requires some form of humanitarian assistance or protection and ten million people are a step away from famine and starvation. In addition to this humanitarian crisis, the economy is close to collapse, and people cannot go to school, access healthcare, or earn an income.
With $300 million USD funding from the International Development Association of the World Bank and in partnership with local institutions, UNDP works to buttress national institutions to bolster the economy and livelihoods through large cash-for-work projects, support to small business, and labor-intensive infrastructure repair schemes in over 300 districts across the country’s 22 governorates.
“This effort constitutes a sea change in how aid organizations intervene in conflicts to help those in need,” Steiner continued.  “Not only is it a large programme, it is also innovative in that it provides development funds and builds resilience in communities by keeping public services open, supporting small businesses that help local communities cope with a run-down economy, and directly paying farmers and fishermen to keep producing, even in the absence of functioning markets.”
Thanks largely to this financing, UNDP has been able to team up with local institutions to help millions of Yemenis earn money through “cash-for-work” programmes.
“With impartiality written into our mandate, this helps us to operate across the existing political cleavages and frontlines to prevent the country’s fraying social fabric from dissolving. By working with local institutions, we are extending a lifeline to vital services, empowering Yemenis to take ownership thereby giving dignity back to people.”

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: USD 4.2 billion needed to provide life-saving assistance to 21.4 million people in Yemen in 2019
Content: 25 February 2019
Sana’a – The United Nations and humanitarian partners launched on 18 February the 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) which seeks US$4.2 billion to provide lifesaving assistance to 21.4 million people this year. This is the largest consolidated humanitarian appeal for Yemen ever launched.
“Four years of continuous conflict has turned Yemen into the worst humanitarian crisis of our time,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “The level of suffering is shocking. Eighty per cent of the entire population—24.1 million people—requires some form of humanitarian assistance or protection. Ten million people are a step away from famine and starvation and seven million people are malnourished.”
“The largest humanitarian operation is underway in Yemen; millions of lives have been saved and hundreds of thousands of Yemeni families have been helped to survive,” said Ms. Grande. “Each month nearly ten million people are receiving food assistance and nutrition partners are helping to identify and cure a higher percentage of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition than in any comparable operation globally.”
“Last year, humanitarians were able to stem the largest cholera outbreak in modern history, reducing the number of new cases from one million the year before to 311,000,” said Ms. Grande.
“This year is going to be tough. This is why humanitarian partners are going to do everything possible to help civilians in Yemen survive violence, access food, and receive the nutrition, health, WASH, shelter, education and protection support they are entitled to under international humanitarian and human rights law,” said Ms. Grande.
“We are grateful to all of the donors who generously support this operation,” said Ms. Grande. “But this year humanitarians are going to need more funding than ever before. All us hope that 2019 is the year of peace for Yemen. If it is not, and the conflict continues, millions of innocent people will suffer, and many will die.”
The 2019 YHRP strategy revolves around five priority objectives: helping millions of people overcome hunger; reducing the outbreak of cholera and infectious diseases; promoting the dignity of displaced families; decreasing the risk of displacement and violence against civilians; and preserving the capacity of public sector institutions to deliver life-saving basic services.

Title: Griffiths to Al-Arabiya: "Phase one of redeployments in Hudayda should start immediately"
Content: 23 February 2019
The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, stressed the importance for the parties in Yemen to immediately start implementing phase one of the redeployments in Hudayda. In an interview with Al-Arabiya’s Diplomatic Avenue, he mentioned that “the two parties sat down for two days with general Michael Lollesgaard and they agreed on these redeployments. We are still looking for that process to start. I have every confidence that this will start very soon.
Griffiths stressed the importance of granting humanitarian access to the Red Sea Mills, which currently stores up to 51,000 metric tons of wheat, sufficient to feed 3.7 million Yemenis for a whole month.
The Special Envoy emphasized his confidence that the two parties demonstrate the political will necessary to turn agreements into facts on the ground, highlighting that there are signs of civilian life returning to Hudayda, in comparison to the situation before reaching the ceasefire.
On the Prisoner Exchange Agreement, Griffiths explained that there is a proposal being discussed with the parties to release a first batch of prisoners very soon, stressing that the commitment of the parties, as well as the Office of the Special Envoy and ICRC is to work on the release of all prisoners and detainees, based on the principle of “all for all”.
Griffiths mentioned that he is working towards reconvening the next round of consultations in the near future. “After we see that tangible progress on Hudayda, which shows that promises made at consultations lead to action…then I think we should not hesitate to go swiftly to the next round of consultations, and it should happen as soon as is practical at that point.”

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: Nine civilians are killed and at least 13 injured in attacks in Hodeidah and Hajjah
Content: 22 February 2019
Sana’a – Reports from Hodeidah confirmed that on 19 February, 8 civilians were killed and another 10 people injured when an artillery shell landed on Al Azeeb market in the Al Mateenah area to the west of At Tuhayat District. Unconfirmed reports indicate that one woman was killed, and three children injured when a house was hit the following day in At Tawayah in Kushar District in Hajjah Governorate.
“We offer our deepest condolences to all of the families impacted by these tragedies,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen.
“These attacks are unconscionable,” said Ms. Grande. “The country is facing the worst food security crisis in the world and yet the killing continues. Parties to the conflict are obliged to do everything possible to protect civilians.”
UN partners confirm that between 1 January and 14 February, fighting has resulted in 271 civilian casualties, including 96 fatalities, across Yemen.
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian, 80 per cent of the entire population, 24.1 million people, requires some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. Ten million people are one step away from famine and starvation and seven million people are malnourished.
On 18 February, the UN and partners launched the 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) which seeks US$4.2 billion to assist up to 19 million people, including 12 million people who will receive emergency food assistance every month. This is the largest consolidated humanitarian appeal for Yemen ever launched.
On 26 February, the United Nations and the Governments of Sweden and Switzerland will convene the third High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen to mobilise support for the humanitarian response in Yemen.

Title: New European Union funding to boost UNFPA’s life-saving services
Content: 20 February 2019
Sana’a – The European Union has contributed EUR 6 million to UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, to provide emergency assistance, life-saving reproductive health and protection services to women and girls in Yemen. The funds, which will help scale up UNFPA programmes across seven governorates directly affected by the conflict, bring the total support from the European Union for UNFPA’s response in Yemen to EUR 8 million since July 2018.
“Women and girls are disproportionally at risk as fighting erupts and basic services collapse,” said Christos Stylianides, the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management. “The EU is committed to providing life-saving assistance and relief to those most in need, and our latest humanitarian contribution to UNFPA will ensure that critical sexual and reproductive health services—as well as services for victims of sexual violence in conflict—continue.”
The latest contribution will enable UNFPA to expand the Rapid Response Mechanism that it currently leads, and help to procure and distribute 30,000 female dignity kits, which include personal hygiene items and culturally appropriate clothing. It will also help deliver WFP’s ready-to-eat food and UNICEF’s basic hygiene kits to more than 450,000 who may be displaced in the coming months.
Between January and December 2018, UNFPA’s overall response in Yemen reached more than a million women and girls with reproductive health and protection services. With the new EU funding, UNFPA will be able to reach an estimated 700,000 women and girls with life-saving emergency obstetric care and emergency supplies, including support to 32 health facilities. With only one third of health facilities providing reproductive health services across the country, this contribution will significantly help reduce the risk of death among pregnant women who develop complications during childbirth, as well as among their babies.
“The crisis in Yemen continues to take a devastating toll. More women and girls are being displaced; more women and girls are reaching out for protection services; and more pregnant women are in need of urgent emergency obstetric care,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. “We are therefore extremely thankful to the European Union for this generous contribution, which will allow us to help hundreds of thousands of women and girls in need of these life-saving interventions.”

Title: Japan supports UN-Habitat with USD 800,000 for emergency shelter and to rehabilitate housing for vulnerable in Yemen
Content: 20 February 2019
Al Hudaydah-  Japan is contributing USD 800,000 to the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in Yemen to provide shelter for those displaced by conflict and to rehabilitate damaged homes belonging to some of the most vulnerable population.
The project will benefit around 310 vulnerable families, living in conflict-affected neighbourhoods and internally displaced people in in Al Hudaydah Governorate in west Yemen.
The ongoing conflict in Yemen has caused devastation with 22.2 million people in need of assistance including two million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).  Al Hudaydah, the main city of the Governorate, has been a focus of fighting as it is a main port. Over 47,000 families have been registered as displaced in the area with many moving to centres in old schools or disused government buildings where the lack of sanitation facilities and clean water threatens to lead to renewed cholera outbreaks.
Even for those who have remained in their homes, living conditions in the city are poor with no electricity in many areas and water shortages. Houses have been badly damaged by the fighting.
The project will provide clean water and sanitation facilities for IDP families living in the districts of Al-Khawkhah, Al-Garrahi and Al-Hali which host the largest number of displaced people in the Governorate.   Some of the unsafe and damaged apartment buildings and housing units where vulnerable families live will be repaired using environmentally-friendly and cost-effective construction material.
The project is expected to benefit around 1,200 women and girls and create work for  1,600 people a day.

Title: Japan helps to protect women and girls in Hodeida with funding to UNFPA
Content: 14 February 2019
Sana’a– The Government of Japan donates $607,142 in support of UNFPA’s drive to provide life-saving protection services to women and girls affected by the emergency in Hodeida.
Intense fighting in Hodeida and western coastal areas of the country since June 2018 has displaced more than 800,000 people, more than half of them being women and girls. Displaced women and girls tend to suffer most from lack of privacy, threats to safety and limited access to basic services, making them ever more vulnerable to violence and abuse.
This funding will help UNFPA to provide protection services to more than 5,000 vulnerable women and girls who are either displaced within Hodeida or stranded between frontlines. Protection services include psychosocial support through community centres and outreach teams, medical services, access to shelters and legal support.
“We are witnessing a large increase in women and girls seeking protection services in Hodeida and neighbouring governorates,” stated Anjali Sen, UNFPA’s Representative to Yemen. “We are extremely grateful to the Government of Japan for their commitment towards helping women and girls who have suffered so much hardship and trauma to be able have access to comprehensive care and support services they urgently need.”
The Government of Japan has been a key partner to UNFPA’s humanitarian response, supporting the Fund’s interventions and services to women and girls across Yemen.
“The Japanese Government and its people are pleased to continue its partnership with UNFPA to provide protection and relief to women and girls who continue to be among the most vulnerable in Hodedia and across the country, and to help them live with dignity and respect,” stated the Embassy of Japan in Yemen.
UNFPA’s support to the humanitarian situation in Yemen also responds to the needs of women and girls for reproductive health services.

Title: Joint Statement on Yemen by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen and Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator
Content: 11 February 2019
The urgency of United Nations access to the Red Sea Mills in Hodeida is growing by the day.
The World Food Programme (WFP) grain stored in the mills - enough to feed 3.7 million people for a month - has been inaccessible for over five months and is at risk of rotting. At the same time, the United Nations is in the process of scaling up to provide food assistance to nearly 12 million people across Yemen who struggle to meet their daily food needs. Our main concern is for their survival and well-being.
We are encouraged by recent engagement of all sides, working with the United Nations on the ground, to create the necessary conditions for the team to reach the mills without further delay. We acknowledge the confirmation from Ansar Allah of their commitment to implement the Hodeida Agreement. We appreciate their earlier efforts to re-open the road leading to the mills which have been carried out under difficult and dangerous circumstances.
We emphasize that ensuring access to the mills is a shared responsibility among the parties to the conflict in Yemen. With safe, unfettered and sustained access, the United Nations can make this urgently needed food available to people in need.

They furthermore have reaffirmed their readiness to do their utmost to achieve this shared objective, recognizing the urgent need to reunite detainees with their families.
The Committee has made important progress in moving the release process forward, including by providing additional information on the status of individuals included in the lists of prisoners.The Committee’s current session will remain open to provide the parties an opportunity to continue working together to enhance the level and quality of information, to enable the expected finalization of the lists in the near future.
The Sub-Committee on Dead Bodies and Human Remains held its first set of meetings and agreed to a joint plan of action based on specific principles and a timeline to complete the exchange of bodies.
OSESGY and ICRC will continue to support the parties’ efforts in implementing the agreement, including by providing technical assistance.

Title: Statement by Mark Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator
Content: 07 February 2019
New York - I am deeply concerned that the United Nations has been unable to access the Red Sea Mills in Hodeida since September 2018. Enough grain to feed 3.7 million people for a month has sat unused and possibly spoiling in silos at the mills for more than four months, while nearly 10 million people across the country remain just a step away from famine. No-one gains anything from this: but millions of starving people suffer.
Last month, two silos were hit by mortar shells landing in the compound of the mills, which is located in an area controlled by the Government of Yemen. The resultant fire destroyed some of the grain – probably enough to feed hundreds of thousands of people for a month. These events are to be deplored.
Access to the mills grows ever more urgent as time passes and the risk of spoilage to the remaining grain increases.
To date, forces affiliated with Ansar Allah have declined to authorize the United Nations to cross front lines into Government-controlled areas to access the mills, citing security concerns.
Discussions continue with all parties, and I appreciate the genuine efforts that have been made on all sides to find a solution. But it remains elusive. I implore all parties, in particular Ansar Allah affiliated groups, to finalize an agreement and facilitate access to the mills in the coming days.
The United Nations and its humanitarian partners are scaling up to reach 12 million people with emergency food assistance, which is a 50 per cent increase over 2018 targets. In December, the World Food Programme reached more than 10 million people – a record achievement. We can save huge numbers of people, most of them in areas controlled by Ansar Allah. But we need more help to do that from the authorities who control these areas.

Title: Rapid City Profiling Towards Early Recovery in Yemen
Content: 06 February 2019
Amman - At the Consultation meeting organized by UN-Habitat in Amman, Yemeni high-level Participants from national, governorate and city levels discussed and agreed upon the selection of cities in Yemen that will develop city and neighbourhood profiling. The European Union – that funds this important project – encouraged a balanced coverage in the selection of cities.
UN-Habitat organized on Monday 28 January, a consultation meeting in Amman at Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Organization Head Quarters, to launch the project on “Rapid City and Neighbourhood Profiling Towards a Development Oriented Urban Recovery Process in Yemen”, funded by the European Union. The meeting discussed the objectives, methodology, coordination mechanism and the expected results of the project. The participants also discussed and agreed upon the selection of the following 5 cities in addition to Sana’a and Aden; Ta’iz, al-Hudaydah, Sa'ada, Al-Hawtah and Zinjibar.
The overall objective of the project is to ''better target and coordinate humanitarian, recovery and development investments, and strengthen the resilience of stakeholders and affected populations in select cities to cope with the impacts of the conflict “.
The project is expected to achieve the following results:
These efforts are complemented by another EU-funded UNESCO project to help Yemeni youth reconstruct damaged buildings using local traditional techniques. The preservation of the cultural heritage and diversity of Yemen and the provision of job opportunities to Yemeni urban youth are priorities for the European Union in Yemen.
The Vice Minister of Public Works Dr. Mohammed Ahmed Thabit conveyed the greeting of HE Prime Minister to the participants and expressed the appreciation of the Government and people of Yemen for the European Commission funding and UN-Habitat for implementing the project. He emphasized on the importance of continuous and close coordination with the Government of Yemen at the national and local levels.
The Head of the EU Delegation to Yemen Ambassador Antonia Calvo Puerta said: "We expect all participants to this workshop and beneficiaries of this project to work elbow-to-elbow, despite any political differences, to bring back the beauty and splendor of Yemen. If you follow this spirit of dialogue, of talking to each other - which is deeply embedded in Yemeni culture – your cities, towns, neighborhoods and its people will have hope in the future of the country. Everybody should be allowed to participate freely and bring their contribution for a peaceful and bright new future for Yemen, and the EU is thankful to all those who contribute to making this happen."
UN-Habitat Deputy Regional Director Dr. Erfan Ali said; "Our meeting today is a key event to activate and steer “the City Profiling” project that represents the start of UN-Habitat Programme in Yemen and the base for proper planning for recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction in Yemen cities in accordance with the concept of “Building Back Better”. Dr. Ali also thanked all the participants and Yemeni national and local authorities for their part in assuring the meeting success. He also valued the role of the EU for funding and supporting the project."
The impact of the conflict in Yemen is mainly urban. Even though key cities have faced different levels of destruction, secondary and tertiary cities have become ports for “reverse” population movement transforming them into hosting areas for IDPs. This influx is putting additional strain on existing services and infrastructures that are already scarce or depleted. In the context of a protracted crisis in Yemen, key challenges should be addressed pertaining to peace and stability. Once the conflict is terminated, the country will have to undergo a nationwide reconstruction operation, which should take into consideration avoiding past mistakes in order to build cities and towns that are safer, more inclusive, resilient and sustainable. Hence, it is vital to apprehend urban challenges today and derive immediate, medium and long-term responses towards recovery for Yemen.

Title: Griffiths to Asharq Al-Awsat: "We are proceeding with our work for the full implementation of the Stockholm Agreement"
Content: 28 January 2019
The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, mentioned that there is a political will now more than ever to end the conflict in Yemen. He added, in an interview with Al-Sharq Al-Awsat newspaper, that “ we are all on the same page that the way to do this is through the negotiations’ table, and not the battlefield. After four years of war, I think the political leadership of the two parties is convinced that war will not resolve this conflict. Also there is a consensus in the international community as well as in the region on that.
On the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement, Griffiths clarified that extending the timelines for implementation was expected, explaining that the initial timelines were ambitious, and the situation on the ground is more complex. He pointed out that the two parties have demonstrated the political will, and have been constructively and seriously engaged for the full implementation of the Agreement.  He added that what is important now is to stay the course, and to continue working with the two parties till we see the full implementation of the Stockholm Agreement.
The Special Envoy also mentioned that he is planning to convene another round of consultations soon, explaining that all the parties are on the same page that we need to see progress in implementing what was agreed in Sweden before convening the next round of consultations. He added that it is important not to lose sight of the big picture necessary to resolve the conflict in Yemen. He explained that a framework that will draw a road map towards a political agreement will provide a basis for the end game; that is the political solution for the conflict in Yemen.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: At least eight civilians are killed and 30 wounded in an IDP centre in Haradh
Content: 27 January 2019
Sana’a– On 26 January, a collective centre for internally displaced people (IDP) was shelled in Haradh District, Hajjah Governorate, killing 8 people and wounding 30 others.
“This is shocking,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “We share our deep condolences with all of the families who have been impacted by this senseless attack.”
“Any attack on a civilian site is unconscionable and a clear violation of international humanitarian law,” said Ms. Grande. “Parties to the conflict are obliged to do everything possible to protect civilians. The people who have fled their home to IDPs sites have lost so much already. An attack like this cannot be justified—ever.”
In the past two months, tens of civilians have been killed in Hajjah Governorate and hundreds of families have been displaced, mainly in Haradh and Hayran districts. The centre that was attacked on 26 January is located near an area where 6 children and 2 women were killed in another incident on 11 January.
More than a million people in the Governorate are currently food insecure. In December, more than 1.13 million people received emergency food and livelihood assistance. Partners are aiming to reach an additional 230,000 this month.
The UN and partners requested USD 2.96 billion through the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan to support millions of people in need across the country. To date, USD 2.57 billion, 87 per cent of the resources required, has been received.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen: Fire in the Red Sea Mills in Hodeidah is a blow to millions of hungry people
Content: 25 January 2019
Sana’a – Reports from Hodeidah indicate that a fire at the Red Sea Mills on the eastern outskirts of Hodeidah City has damaged two silos. While the circumstances are being confirmed, it appears that the fire started as a result of mortar fire.
WFP currently has 51,000 metric tons of wheat stored at the Red Sea Mills, a quarter of its incountry wheat stock and enough to feed 3.7 million people for a month. WFP has been unable to access the Mills since September 2018 because of fighting.
“The loss of this wheat comes at a terrible time,” said Ms. Lise Grande, Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “More than 20 million Yemenis, nearly 70 percent of the entire population, are hungry.”
“The situation in Yemen is heart-breaking. A quarter of a million people are in a catastrophic condition, facing near starvation if assistance doesn’t get to them,” said Ms. Grande. “This is the first time we are seeing conditions like this. We need this wheat.”
Stephen Anderson, WFP’s Country Director said, “We are very concerned that some of our wheat stocks at the Red Sea Mills have been damaged. WFP urgently needs to get access to the Red Sea Mills so we can assess the level of damage and begin transporting the unaffected wheat stocks to areas of Yemen where it is desperately needed.”
WFP is providing food assistance to nearly 10 million people across Yemen and is scaling-up operations to reach 12 million.
The UN and partners requested USD 2.96 billion through the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan to support millions of people in need across the country. To date, USD 2.57 billion, 87 per cent of the resources required, has been received.

The committee, which includes representatives of the Government of Yemen and Ansar Allah, as well as the Office of the Special Envoy and the International Committee of the Red Cross, discussed over two days the steps taken so far to implement the prisoner exchange agreement, and agreed on timed steps to be taken for maintaining progress in fulfilling the provisions of the agreement.
The meetings witnessed positive, constructive and frank discussions on the implementation of the agreement that was reached between the two parties prior to the Sweden Consultations. The two parties took the first step in implementing the agreement by exchanging the lists of prisoners and detainees and providing responses on the exchanged lists.
It is worth noting that the prisoner exchange agreement was the first agreement signed between the two parties since the outbreak of the war in Yemen. The actual start of exchanging prisoners and detainees will represent a glimpse of hope for thousands of Yemeni families awaiting to know the fate of their loved ones, who have gone absent throughout the years of war.
The Office of the Special Envoy hopes that the positive engagement of both parties will speed up the implementation of this agreement, which will contribute to confidence-building between the two parties on other issues.

Title: CERF allocates $32 million to enable life-saving assistance in Yemen
Content: 11 January 2019
New York  - Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock and the Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP) David Beasley today announced a US$32 million contribution from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support critical services to enable the scale-up of the life-saving humanitarian response in Yemen.
The CERF allocation will allow WFP to ramp up humanitarian logistical operations, including increases in humanitarian air cargo, transport more humanitarian workers, provide more accommodation spaces, including in Hodeida, and expand emergency telecommunications. This will support the work of UN agencies as well as NGOs engaged in the humanitarian relief operation.
“Across Yemen, courageous humanitarians are already helping millions of people, but the needs are even greater. The World Food Programme is scaling up to increase its assistance from 8 million people a month to 12 million a month and this contribution from the Central Emergency Response Fund will help make that happen,” Beasley said.
The scale-up in the humanitarian operation aims to reach the most vulnerable people in priority districts, including internally displaced people, with the full range of life-saving assistance that is required in the world’s largest humanitarian emergency. The rapid infusion of funds complements funding from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund in support of front-line responders.
“To avert the worst in Yemen, all parties to the conflict must facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need,” said Lowcock. “WFP provide outstanding logistical support, including transport, accommodation and communications support for many aid agencies, and this allocation will finance an urgent extension of those services.”
Beasley and Lowcock also welcomed recent decisions in Sanaa to provide more visas for humanitarian workers, to investigate allegations of theft of food aid and punish those responsible, to ban the sale of food aid intended for Yemenis with no income and to put in place more effective targeting and monitoring systems.
Lowcock commented “Having more humanitarian workers in Yemen will both allow us to reach more needy people and ensure help gets to the neediest without diversion. We will continue to work closely with all parties to ensure the relief effort is as effective as possible.”
In 2018, the CERF provided $50 million to the humanitarian response in Yemen. For 2019, the UN-coordinated Humanitarian Response Plan is expected to require some $4 billion to provide assistance and protection to more than 24 million people. The Secretary-General will convene a high-level pledging conference in Geneva on 26 February, co-hosted by the governments of Sweden and Switzerland.

Title: Training 25 YEMAC staff: Positively impacting safety and security in Yemen
Content: 20 December 2018
Aden-- The United Nations Development Programme began a mine action training programme for 25 staff from our national implementing partner, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (YEMAC). The four-week, 20-day, programme will help build the deminer’s capacity in identifying and neutralizing various types of Unexploded Ordinances commonly found in Yemen.
The training, which will run through 14 February, has been strategically created around the provision of extensive theoretical and practical modules on various topics including: (a) International Mine Action Standards; (b) proper use of demining and explosive ordinance disposal equipment; and, (c) exercises within battle area clearance. It has been made possible through the funding of our partners – the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – and implemented by the the Danish Demining Group, a part of the Danish Refugee Council.
UNDP Yemen Mine Action Advisor, Steven Robinson, indicates that “the training is part of a longer-term plan to help YEMAC in addressing the needs of the Yemeni people in being able to effectively, safely and efficiently remove the unexploded ordnance that plagues the country.”
For approximately 10 years, UNDP has supported YEMAC with activities ranging from providing equipment to supporting mine action-related training initiatives. UNDP continues to be committed to supporting YEMAC in their ongoing efforts toward clearing Yemen of existing explosive remnants of war.

Title: Yemen Women Union in partnership with UN Women Yemen marks the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence campaign
Content: 13 December 2018
The Yemen Women Union (YWU) organized an Open Day to mark the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence Campaign under the slogan "Inspiring Women for a Better Life and a Happier Family"  #HearMeToo, in cooperation with UN Women Yemen
Speaking at the event, Ms. Fathia Mohammed Abdullah Obaid, Chairwoman of the YWU, noted that in Yemen, the 16 Days Campaign was unfolding in a situation where war is profoundly affecting women’s development efforts and degrading women's rights.
“Yemeni women are most affected by the ongoing war and suffering in the country. For this reason, all of us must cooperate to organize advocacy and awareness programmes centered around women’s issues. This approach will enable us to move away from stereotypes and empower women economically, politically and socially,” she said.
“This is a rallying moment, with calls to listen to and believe survivors. Together, we must end the culture of silencing,” said Ms. Obaid.
The YWU took part in the 16 Days campaign by implementing several programmes and activities to end violence against women. Ms. Obaid praised the efforts of UN Women in advocating for gender equality and the empowerment of women in Yemen.
“The YWU plays a major role in advancing the rights of women in Yemen. Violence against women is a global issue impeding equality, development and peace. The promotion and protection of women’s fundamental human rights must be incorporated into humanitarian response programmes,” said Bushra Eshaq, Programme Specialist at UN Women.
The YWU Open Day was supported by UN Women as part of its overarching goal to support women and girls in Yemen and was organized in cooperation with international and local partners, to promote enhanced gender equality and the economic, political and social empowerment of women. Success stories were presented of beneficiaries from YWU activities, together with an overview of UN Women’s programming in Yemen, and dance and musical performances highlighting the important role of women in society. The Open Day brought together women’s movements, survivor advocates and women human rights defenders, united in the goal of ending violence against women and bringing a message of peace to Yemen.

Title: UNFPA expands emergency obstetric care services at Al Thawra Hospital in Hodeida
Content: 28 November 2018
Sana’a– United Nations Population Fund delivered life-saving reproductive health equipment and medicines to Hodeida city, leading to the opening an expanded maternity wing in Al Thawra Hospital; the only referral hospital in Hodeida
Al-Thawra Hospital which serves as a major maternal and neonatal care facility with up to 500 deliveries a month, including more than 200 caesarean sections, has been directly impacted by the on-going fighting in recent weeks. UNFPA has supported the hospital to ensure uninterrupted provision of maternal health services with the establishment of a 300 square meter maternity ward, which includes a fully equipped operating theatre, infant incubators and other essential life-saving equipment and medicines. In addition, more than 40 staff in the maternity and neonatology sections of the hospital are being supported by UNFPA through incentives and operational support to ensure the continuity of these services.
“Al Thawra Hospital is a lifeline for women who may face complications during pregnancy and childbirth in Hodeida and surrounding governorates. We will continue to do our best to ensure maternal health services are provided to women and girls who need it the most, but our support wouldn’t be impactful without the heroic efforts of the health workers who risk their own lives to save other,” said Anjali Sen, UNFPA Representative in Yemen.
UNFPA supports 34 health facilities in Hodeida alone and 214 health facilities across Yemen, to provide essential reproductive health services to women and girls.
These interventions are supported by contributions from the European Union Humanitarian Aid, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund.
UNFPA, through the 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, is appealing for $44.5 million for reproductive health and protection services for women and girls affected by the on-going crisis. Only $27 million has so far been mobilised and face discontinuation of these critical services from January 2019, if more resources do not become available.

Title: Bachelet urges States with the power and influence to end starvation, killing of civilians in Yemen
Content: 10 November 2018
Geneva – UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Saturday expressed outrage at the “unconscionable toll” that the escalation of hostilities in Al Hodeidah was taking on an already “deeply frightened and starving” population in Yemen. Bachelet urged the Saudi-led Coalition, the Houthi forces and all those supplying arms to the parties to the conflict to take immediate steps to end the suffering of civilians in Yemen.
“The Saudi-led Coalition and pro-Hadi forces, the Houthi forces – and those who supply arms or other support to the parties to the conflict – all have the power or the influence to stop the starvation and killing of civilians, to give some reprieve to the people of Yemen,” Bachelet said.
“Violations by one party to the conflict do not give carte blanche to the others to fight back at all costs. Even wars are regulated by law – all parties to the conflict are bound to respect international humanitarian law and human rights law as applicable.”
According to information received by the UN Human Rights Office, at least 110 airstrikes were carried out in Al Hodeidah, Sa’ada and San’a between 31 October and 6 November, with further intensification since then. Coalition warplanes have been hovering at low altitude in Al Hodeidah City since Thursday morning, as Houthi forces fire anti-aircraft missiles and mortars, and violent street clashes continued. At least 23 civilians have been confirmed dead in Al Hodeidah since 24 October, but the real toll may be much higher. Some 445,000 people have been internally displaced in Al Hodeidah since early June.
There are also serious concerns about the fate of 900 detainees in the Central Prison and six pre-trial detention facilities in Al Hodeidah City. The Central Prison was hit on Monday morning by two mortar shells, injuring five people and cutting off power and water to the prison. Armed confrontations are also reportedly taking place very close to the main Al Thawra hospital in Al Hodeidah.
The High Commissioner called for an immediate end to the military escalation, which also risks exacerbating the catastrophic food insecurity of some 14 million people across the country. She urged the Saudi-led Coalition to immediately remove restrictions on the safe and expeditious entry into Yemen of indispensable humanitarian supplies and other goods.
“The parties to the conflict must allow the free, regular and unimpeded passage of food and other humanitarian relief and must not take actions that would deprive civilians of their rights to food and health,” she said.
“I call on all those with involvement or influence in the conflict to facilitate the access to humanitarian relief that the people of Yemen so desperately need.
“I also remind States that the Geneva Conventions stipulate that all States, including those not involved in the armed conflict, have the obligation to take measures to ensure respect for the Conventions by parties to a conflict. Conditioning, limiting or refusing arms transfers is one measure,” Bachelet added.
The UN Human Rights Office has documented that between 26 March 2015 and 8 November 2018, there have been a total of 17,640 civilian casualties in Yemen, including 6,872 dead and 10,768 injured. The majority of these casualties - 10,852 resulted from airstrikes carried out by the Saudi-led Coalition.

Title: Statement by UNFPA’s Director for the Arab region: Yemen famine, the worst in recent history, manmade
Content: 01 November 2018
Cairo– The famine looming over Yemen may be the worst in the world’s recent history, and may put an estimated 2 million malnourished pregnant and lactating women at increased risk of death.
Lack of food, displacement, poor nutrition, disease outbreaks and eroding healthcare have heavily affected the health and well-being of 1.1 million malnourished pregnant and lactating women, causing numerous cases of premature or low-birth weight babies, severe postpartum bleeding, and extremely life threatening labor processes.
Nearly half of the health facilities no longer function in Yemen, including those providing reproductive health services that are supposed to diagnose and treat these women.
Working with limited funding, UNFPA’s support to 184 health facilities that offer reproductive health services may stop if additional resources do not become available.

Title: Senior UN human rights official concludes visit to Yemen, urges warring parties to prevent renewed fighting
Content: 30 October 2018
Geneva/ New York/ Sana'a – Ten days before the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a senior UN official has been telling leaders on all sides of the Yemen conflict that “virtually every article in that noble document is being flagrantly and brutally disregarded."
At the end of a visit to Aden and Sanaa, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Andrew Gilmour urged the warring parties to do “absolutely everything humanly possible” to prevent renewed fighting in the port city of Al Hudaydah. Renewed fighting would plunge millions more Yemenis into an even deeper crisis, and could contribute to what may turn out to be a massive famine.
He underlined the utter unacceptability of any party to a conflict deliberately creating massive humanitarian suffering as a tactic of war, and urged the immediate removal of restrictions on delivery of emergency food and medical supplies. He echoed a strong statement by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet earlier this month.*
Accountability for international crimes was an essential step forward, urged Gilmour, who also reiterated the need to restore law and order in the entire country. He said that the current breakdown of rule of law has had a terrible impact on people’s rights to life, security, freedom from arbitrary arrest and torture, freedom of expression (especially of journalists) and freedom of religion (especially among the Bahai community), as well as essential social and economic rights, including to food, education and health.
Assistant Secretary-General Gilmour was deeply moved by the testimonies of the Mothers of the Detainees whom he met in Aden, and who recounted harrowing and tragic tales of missing husbands, sons and brothers. He requested the Government in Aden and the de facto authorities in Sanaa to end unlawful detention and release the names of all persons in their custody. This would help family members have a better idea of whether their loved ones were still alive. He also urged improvements in the terrible conditions of detention throughout the country, and discussed with the ministers and authorities in both parts of the country regarding technical assistance and training that could be provided to them by OHCHR.
In all meetings, he underlined the international community’s demands to end the practice of recruiting children. While welcoming strong declarations against the practice, he urged practical steps on the ground to end it.
On conflict-related sexual violence, Gilmour said he was aware that it was an acutely sensitive topic and that he believed it was significantly under-reported in Yemen, owing to the stigma attached to it and the fear that the victims themselves would suffer retribution. He urged all sides to make it “crystal clear to absolutely everyone that any instances of rape and other forms of sexual violence would be rigorously investigated and all perpetrators held accountable and punished”.
Gilmour was shown large numbers of buildings wholly or partly destroyed by aerial bombardment, including some of major historical interest, indicating that this destruction appeared to involve major violations of cultural rights, as well as many others.
The UN Human Rights Council recently extended the mandate of the Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts on Yemen for another year, and Gilmour urged all sides to allow it unrestricted access to areas under their control and to cooperate fully with it.
The UN Human Rights Office will establish a sub-office in Aden in early 2019 to strengthen cooperation with the Official Government of Yemen and civil society, and to monitor and report allegations of human rights violations in Aden and the south of the country, including arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, sexual violence, and ill-treatment and abuse in detention facilities.
Gilmour expressed OHCHR’s deepest admiration for Yemeni human rights defenders who “despite enormous threats to their security and lives, continue to show extraordinary courage and compassion in order to investigate violations and campaign for improved rights”.

Title: UNFPA rushes emergency supplies for cyclone-affected South-east Yemen
Content: 15 October 2018
Sana’a– UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund is dispatching emergency supplies to assist communities affected by Tropical Cyclone Luban that hit Socotra island and coastal areas of south-east Yemen on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, nearly 500 families were displaced to schools and other settlements due to Cyclone Luban. These numbers are expected to increase as meteorologists predict torrential rains and possible flooding and landslides.
As part of the rapid response mechanism, led by UNFPA, cyclone-affected families are receiving rapid response kits immediately after displacement. Supplies include, ready to eat food provided by WFP, basic hygiene kits provided by UNICEF and female dignity kits provided by UNFPA.
“We are doing our best to provide immediate relief items to families being displaced, in particular to address the hygiene and health needs of women and girls. We are deeply concerned for the health of hundreds of pregnant women who are at extreme risk,” stated UNFPA’s Representative to Yemen, Ms. Anjali Sen.
Some 1,250 rapid response kits have been pre-positioned in severely affected areas. In addition, mobile medical teams and critical reproductive health supplies are on stand-by to help families who are forced to flee their homes. The response is supported by contributions from the European Union Humanitarian Aid, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund.

Title: UN experts call for immediate release of Bahá’ís
Content: 10 October 2018
Geneva– Apostasy and spying charges brought against 24 people in Yemen, mostly from the Baha’i minority, must be dropped and discriminatory practices based on religion or belief should be outlawed, UN experts said.
On 15 September 2018, criminal proceedings were initiated against the 24 individuals among whom at least 22 are Bahá’ís, including eight women and a minor at Sana’a Specialized Criminal Court. The defendants were not investigated nor were they informed by the prosecution of the pending charges against them prior at the start of the trials.
The charges include apostasy, the teaching of the Bahá’i faith, and espionage, the latter punishable with the death penalty if convicted.
“We are very concerned at the criminal prosecution of these persons based on charges connected to their religion or belief,” said the UN experts. “We are particularly concerned that some of the charges include crimes that carry the death penalty.”
On 29 September 2018, five of the indicted individuals, who remain in detention appeared before the court. The judge ordered that the names of the remaining 19 indicted individuals be published in a local newspaper.
“We reiterate our call to the de facto authorities in Sana’a to put an immediate stop to the persistent persecution of Bahá’ís in Yemen and to release those arrested due to their religion or belief,” the UN experts said, adding that international human rights obligations apply to de facto authorities exercising effective control.
The next hearing is scheduled 40 days following the court hearing of 29 September 2018.

Title: Time to recognize Yemeni women’s efforts to bring peace to their war-torn country
Content: 05 September 2018
Yemen has been locked in a devastating conflict that has killed or injured almost 60,000 people and displaced 3 million more. Yemeni civilians are facing indiscriminate armed attacks, a severe cholera outbreak and the looming threat of famine.
Risks facing women are even greater as gender-based violence is on the rise. Yet despite these grave risks, Yemeni women are also playing an active role in supporting peace and stability within their communities. They are leading humanitarian and conflict resolution activities at the local level to address the harsh impacts of fighting and to try to prevent further violence.
UN Women’s latest report, Women on the Frontlines of Conflict Resolution: Community Voices from Syria, Iraq and Yemen looks at how women in the region influence and shape local processes for conflict and dispute resolution. By showcasing Yemeni women’s diverse contributions to local mediation and peace, the report provides a dynamic image of women’s engagement for peace. Yet, these efforts are often dismissed as insignificant or irrelevant to international peace and security.
The report calls on the international community to recognize and support women’s contributions to local mediation and conflict resolution, and to improve the linkages between community peace initiatives and national peace processes.
This failure to adequately recognize women’s role in community conflict resolution in Yemen and across the region marginalizes their voices, and discounts the contribution that women’s skills, experiences and expertise in conflict resolution can bring to dialogue at both the national and international levels.
“Women in Yemen and the region are undeniably at the forefront of resolving conflict and seeking peace in their own communities. These efforts must be better linked to national peacemaking processes.” Said Mohammad Naciri, Regional Director of UN Women for Arab States. “The failure to hear their voices and harness their expertise will only make peace more elusive”

Content: 07 August 2018
Amman – I am alarmed by the military escalations in Aden today, including reports of clashes in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace. I am also deeply concerned by the recent rhetoric encouraging violence against Yemeni institutions.
Escalations of violence will contribute to instability and suffering in Aden and will deepen Yemen’s political and social divisions.
I call on the parties involved to abandon violence and engage in dialogue to resolve differences. I also urge all those with influence to de-escalate the situation and ensure the protection of civilians.

Title: Yemeni Women’s Pact for Peace and Security (Tawafaq) Gathers in Amman
Content: 08 March 2018
Amman– Members of Tawafaq, the Yemeni Women’s Pact for Peace and Security, concluded an eight-day gathering in Amman last Tuesday with a clearer understanding of their role in Yemen’s peace process.
The gathering dovetails with International Women’s Day, which this year emphasizes the power of rural and urban activists in transforming women’s lives towards peace.
The 56 members attending Tawafaq’s third regular gathering represent a wide array of political and social groups from rural and urban areas, but are united in calling for an end to the war.
“I am honoured to be working with this amazing group of women, who are carving out a new way for women to be included in the peace process. They provide an example of how individuals can cross enormous ideological and political divides to reach consensus. It is an example to us all,” said Marta Colburn, Country Programme Manager, UN Women Yemen.
Members outlined a strategy for a number of possible scenarios in the next period in Yemen, and the steps they will take to push for peace and for inclusion in the peace process in each eventuality.
Lise Grande, the UN’s Resident Coordinator / Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, attended the gathering on the last day and called this planning exercise “invaluable”.
“Peace processes that include women have a far greater chance of delivering lasting peace than peace processes that do not include women. The discussions Tawafaq members have had and the work they have done here is a vital step in the journey to lasting peace in Yemen,” said Ms. Grande.
“The UN promises you that there will be a unified, single effort to bring peace to your country and to address the humanitarian suffering.”
The Tawafaq project is part of UN Women’s programme to advocate for Yemeni women's increased participation in and leadership of official peace processes, and to enhance gender equality perspectives in peacebuilding and reconstruction processes in the country. These efforts are in support of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, which reaffirms the role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts.
Tawafaq’s activities are implemented through UN Women’s Yemen office with funding from the Governments of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

Title: New Gender Alert highlights need to support women and girls in the humanitarian response in Yemen
Content: 31 July 2015
Since March 2015, open conflict amongst rival factions has spread across Yemen culminating in the on-going Saudi led coalition’s bombing of targets in Houthi controlled sections of the country. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports 21.1 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, including 1.26 million internally displaced people. According to a new Gender Alert on the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, approximately 20 to 30 per cent of displaced households are female headed, increased from about nine per cent before the current crisis. This is due in large part to many men and boys having been recruited to fight, injured or killed.
The new alert from the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Reference Group on Gender in Humanitarian Action, reports 10,500 refugees and migrants that have arrived by sea since the beginning of the ongoing conflict – primarily from Ethiopia and Somalia. Those making the sea crossings – and particularly women and girls – are vulnerable to abduction, attacks, drowning, exploitation and sexual assault.
Women are disproportionately affected by the current crisis due to restrictions of mobility, decision making power and lack of access and control over resources. They also have poor access to information, whether it is regarding their rights, or helpful information such as hygiene promotion material. Due to insecurity,  lack of access and shifting regional and tribal variations of gender equality, a detailed picture of the current plight of crisis affected women and girls across the country has yet to be established.
The Gender Alert emphasizes how essential it is that the World Bank and the Islamic Development Bank planned damage and loss assessment (and any other needs assessment) reflect gender in their scope and analysis and are based on accurate sex and age disaggregated data, so that the needs and vulnerabilities of the women, men, girls and boys of the crisis affected population are adequately identified and addressed.
UN Women – together with the World Food Programme and the Women’s Refugee Commission – is a co-chair of the IASC Reference Group which is made up of UN and non-UN agencies, NGOs and civil society organizations and promotes the integration of gender equality and women’s empowerment in global humanitarian efforts.
