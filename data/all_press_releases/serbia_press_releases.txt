FAO Technical Assistance Programme for emergency response after the 2023 floods completed
Belgrade, April 26, 2024 – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of the Republic of Serbia announced today that the distribution of the financial support within the FAO Technical Assistance Programme for Emergency Response after floods in 2023 has been completed.
Under the FAO emergency response programme and in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of the Republic of Serbia, financial support in the form of vouchers worth RSD 66 000 each, was distributed to the most vulnerable farming households that suffered damage after last year's floods. The vouchers will enable vulnerable farmers to purchase goods and inputs for agricultural production, including seeds, planting material, fertilizers, small agricultural tools and equipment, spare parts, and materials for the repair of agricultural machinery.
Support was provided to farmers in Trstenik, Varvarin, Ćićevac, Kuršumlija, Brus, Ćuprija, Ražanj, Aleksinac, Doljevac and Rekovac. In these ten municipalities, 327 beneficiary households with more than 1 300 members received assistance to restore production after last year's natural disasters.
Floods last year in Serbia hit hard 56 municipalities, predominantly located in central and south Serbia, causing extensive damage to both infrastructure and agricultural lands. Many smallholder farmers engaged in labour-intensive production who are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, were directly impacted by the floods.
With the aim of providing the necessary support to farmers facing difficulties, FAO, under the Technical Assistance Programme for Emergency Response and in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of the Republic of Serbia, has stepped forward to help farmers recover from flood damage.

Title: New UN report calls for trillions more in development investment to rescue Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 10 April 2024
Bold actions needed to scale up SDG investment and reform global financial system
UNITED NATIONS, 9 April 2024 – A new UN report today says financing challenges are at the heart of the world’s sustainable development crisis – as staggering debt burdens and sky-high borrowing costs prevent developing countries from responding to the confluence of crises they face. Only a massive surge of financing, and a reform of the international financial architecture can rescue the Sustainable Development Goals.

The 2024 Financing for Sustainable Development Report: Financing for Development at a Crossroads (FSDR 2024) says urgent steps are needed to mobilise financing at scale to close the development financing gap, now estimated at USD 4.2 trillion annually, up from USD 2.5 trillion before the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, rising geopolitical tensions, climate disasters and a global cost-of-living crisis have hit billions of people, battering progress on healthcare, education, and other development targets.
“This report is yet another proof of how far we still need to go and how fast we need to act to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” said UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed. “We are truly at a crossroads and time is running out. Leaders must go beyond mere rhetoric and deliver on their promises. Without adequate financing, the 2030 targets cannot be met.”

With only six years remaining to achieve the SDGs, hard-won development gains are being reversed, particularly in the poorest countries. If current trends continue, the UN estimates that almost 600 million people will continue to live in extreme poverty in 2030 and beyond, more than half of them women.
“We’re experiencing a sustainable development crisis, to which inequalities, inflation, debt, conflicts and climate disasters have all contributed,” said UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Li Junhua. “Resources are needed to address this, and the money is there. Billions of dollars are lost annually from tax avoidance and evasion, and fossil fuel subsidies are in the trillions. Globally, there is no shortage of money; rather, a shortage of will and commitment.”

According to the report debt burdens and rising borrowing costs are large contributors to the crisis. Estimates are that in the least developed countries debt service will be USD 40 billion annually between 2023 and 2025, up more than 50 per cent from USD 26 billion in 2022. Stronger and more frequent climate related disasters account for more than half of the debt upsurge in vulnerable countries. The poorest countries now spend 12 per cent of their revenues on interest payments -- four times more than they spent a decade ago. Roughly 40 per cent of the global population live in countries where governments spend more on interest payments than on education or health.

While investment in SDG sectors had grown steadily in the early 2000s, major sources of development funding are now slowing down. For example, domestic revenue growth has stalled since 2010, especially in LDCs and other low-income countries, in part due to tax evasion and avoidance. Corporate income tax rates are falling, with global average tax rates down from 28.2 per cent in 2000 to 21.1 per cent in 2023, due to globalization and tax competition.
Meanwhile, Official Development Assistance from OECD countries and climate finance commitments are not being met. While ODA increased to an all-time high in 2022, reaching USD 211 billion, from USD 185.9 billion in 2021, much of the growth came from aid to refugees living in donor countries, and the total amount is inadequate for development. Only four countries met the UN aid target of 0.7 per cent of GNI in 2022.
The report concludes that the international financial system, which was set up at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, is no longer fit for purpose. It proposes a new coherent system that is better equipped to respond to crises, scales up investment in the SDGs especially through stronger multilateral development banks, and improves the global safety net for all countries.
The report points to the UN Summit of the Future in September 2024 as a crucial opportunity to change course. It highlights the June 2025 Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) as the critical moment for countries to commit to closing the development financing gap and invest in achieving the SDGs.

FfD4 is an opportunity for countries to:

“Without global cooperation, targeted financing, and, crucially, the political will, the world will not achieve the SDGs,” said Deputy Secretary-General Mohammed. “The clock is ticking. Between now and next year’s FfD4 Conference, we have a once-in-80-year opportunity to comprehensively reform the financial architecture, and a last chance to correct course before 2030. History will not be kind to those with the power to act who fail to do so, while the clock winds down on the planet and its people.”

Title: Architectural Expert Emphasizes the Need for Women's Safety in Urban Planning
Content: 06 December 2023
Following the UN Women research on violence against women and girls in public spaces that showed that 45 percent of women in Serbia are afraid of rape in public spaces, UN Women Serbia in cooperation with the Institute of Architecture and Urban and Spatial Planning of Serbia organized five thematic workshops aimed at improving safety of public spaces. The workshops were organized from 31st May to 8th September 2023 in the framework of the project “Safeguarding Women and Girls in Serbia”, funded by the British Embassy in Belgrade. Nataša Danilović Hristić, PhD in Architecture and Urban Planning, Senior Research Associate at the Institute of Architecture, Urban and Spatial Planning of Serbia, that was project coordinator, explains the importance of these workshops and results that were achieved.
Who were these workshops intended for and what was discussed?
Workshops were differently tailored for spectrum of multidisciplinary professionals and experts - decision makers on national level, local authorities, urban companies, public communal companies and services that take care of the use and maintenance of space, police forces, faculties and NGOs. Architects, urban planners, spatial planners, landscape architects, traffic engineers and security experts made up the majority of the audience. The workshops included theoretical introduction to the topic of safety, looking at space from a "women's angle", practical exercises and creating a set of ideas that can make open public spaces in cities safer for women and girls, as well as public debate about the obstacles in our legal framework that are making harder the implementation of these measures in urban planning.

What are the biggest challenges when it comes to urban planning and women's safety?

The main challenge is certainly to introduce the topic of gender sensitive attitude and women’s safety into the list of mandatory conditions that an urban space must fulfill. Our goal was first to point out the problem and the different experiences and perspectives that women and men have of the living environment. Traditionally, the house was a space mainly used by women, while public spaces were more of a male domain. But things have changed a long time ago. In our culture we have conquered public spaces since women of all ages are active, they go to school and work, go out for fun, go shopping, they look after children in parks, use public transport, commute and hang out outdoors. If women feel safe and comfortable in all spaces at all times, others will too. That's why urban planning, focused on public safety and well-being of all citizens, must include the issue of women's safety.
What are the characteristics public spaces that are unsafe for women and girls?
Neglected, unmaintained, unsightly, isolated or dark public spaces are characterized as unsafe and their appearance provides an opportunity for violent acts to happen. Such spaces could be or are used for various criminal activities and security threats. If we know that something like that happened or there is a chance to happen, we will create a mental map that eliminates certain space or path from our direction of movement and that leads to limited mobility. Finally, because of the surroundings, we are forced to restrict our stay in the open space, to adapt to the circumstances and to depend on others.
How can we make public spaces safer for women and girls?
Vibrant spaces, pleasant and inspiring for staying outdoors are the key to success. They must be clean, tidy and undamaged. The use of surveillance cameras or increased patrolling is an example of a measure with a limited and not always positive effect. Instead, we suggest spontaneous "neighborly" monitoring of space, limited height of the structures, orientation of living spaces and others that are in frequent use towards open spaces, urban furniture that is resistant to vandalism, artistic design of exterior elements, appropriate greening, adequate night lighting, good and adaptable network of the public transportation and similar preventive measures. The spectrum of possible architectural and technical intervention is really wide and diverse.
The final result of workshops and whole project, but also kick off for future actions is the “Roadmap for Implementing Urban Safety Measures in Urban Planning Process”.  What does it contain and why is it important?

It is a proposal for public policy making and is intended primarily for decision-makers. The roadmap contains recommendations, assesses and evaluates the possible effects, proposes amendments to the existing legal framework and gives suggestions for improving the methodology of drafting plans. The aim is to help formulate and implement an appropriate public policy for safer urban spaces, in line with other acts and laws relevant to this topic. We created it as a set of steps or alternative paths that allows us to get faster to the main goal. Some of the steps that we propose are broader education, formation of the knowledge base, making of the Manual for architects and urban planners, improvement of public policy including data collection and citizens’ participation.

Could you list some of the most important proposals for the amendment of legal acts?
We concentrated on the Law on Planning and Construction, which is the most important for our profession. First of all, new terms such as ‘’urban safety’’ and ‘’gender sensitive space” should be included in it. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the topic of unhindered movement and access should be applied not only to persons with disabilities, children and the elderly, but also to women. Other legal document, The Rulebook on the Content, Method and Procedure of Creating Spatial and Urban Planning Documents prescribes the content of the plans in more detailed way. We think that it is important to have data on number and structure (gender, age, etc.) of residents in the area of planning to make spaces that will be adequate for all citizens living there.

In what way was UN Women support helpful?
There must always be someone to make the first step, to pull and push others towards the goal, to have a vision of a different and better society. We are very grateful to UN Women for starting the initiative in which we gladly participated, gave our best and shared our knowledge. It must be constantly repeated that the question of women's safety does not exclude anyone, it actually benefits everyone. Every proposed measure is reviewed precisely in this sense. We sincerely believe in this project and are additionally filled with optimism since we saw the positive reactions of the participants at the workshops and their desire to act immediately towards changes.

Title: Migration, Environment and Climate Change (MECC) nexus in the context of Serbia
Content: 04 December 2023
IOM Serbia is launching a project with the support of IOM Development Fund (IDF) aiming to investigate yet insufficiently researched issue of migration, environment, and climate change (MECC) nexus in the context of Serbia.
Climate change, environmental degradation, natural hazards, human-induced disasters, and their impact on people’s lives have globally come to the forefront of issues requiring urgent action and development of mitigating and/or adaptation measures. Human mobility, although an age-old phenomenon closely interlinked with environmental and climatic factors, has started to attract growing attention in the context of climate change, bringing the rediscovery of the concept of “environmental migration”.
This is due to the fact that human mobility is expected to scale up as intense weather-related events become more frequent and affect livelihoods. Also, migration is being increasingly acknowledged as an effective and viable adaptation strategy in the face of environmental and climate change.
There is no legally agreed upon definition of environmental migrants and migration. The one put forward by IOM is as follows: Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, for compelling reasons of sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their homes or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their country or abroad.
As outlined in the 2022 Report of the Sixth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) “increasing adaptive capacities minimises the negative impacts of climate-related displacement and involuntary migration for migrants and sending and receiving areas. This improves the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made, ensuring safe and orderly movements of people within and between countries.”
Being a signatory of relevant international treaties, Serbia has confirmed its commitment to contributing to global efforts against climate change and made considerable efforts in fulfilling its responsibilities and achieving the set goals. However, the connection between climate change, environment, and human mobility in the context of Serbia remains yet to be explored. To investigate this connection in the context of Serbia and ensure that the national stakeholders have improved understanding of this issue, IOM Serbia has developed a pilot project supported by the IOM Development Fund (IDF).
Within this initiative, IOM Serbia will bring together relevant sectoral representatives and academia in a capacity building training in Belgrade, laying the foundations of a fruitful discussion on human mobility types in the context of environmental and climate change relevant in Serbia, and exchange of relevant knowledge and expertise. Disaster displacement, evacuation, labour migration, migrants in vulnerable situations in transit are some of the mobility pathways to be discussed during the training, with particular concern for vulnerability of affected populations, communities, and the overall society.
Further action in this regard will be made as such efforts contribute to scaling up climate change adaptation, further enabling empowered and informed decisions on human mobility by individuals, communities, and governments.

Title: UN Serbia and Government Reflect on the Third Year of Successful Collaboration for Sustainable Development Under Current Strategy
Content: 29 November 2023
BELGRADE, 29 November 2023 - The United Nations team in Serbia gathered with the Government of Serbia to review the progress towards the implementation of United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2021-2025. The meeting was aimed to present key results achieved in the strategy's third year of implementation that contributed to notable progress in the joint advancement of Agenda 2030 and the EU accession agenda.
The joint effort focuses on three strategic areas: green transformation, human capital, and the Human Rights/Gender and the Rule of Law agenda. The total value of the cooperation is estimated at €320 million over a five-year period, with an increase to €85 million in 2023, mainly driven by the emphasis on the green agenda. As of the end of September, over 70%of this budget has been utilized, and full annual budget delivery is expected by the end of the year.
Francoise Jacob, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Serbia, stated, “The United Nations team in Serbia brings a wealth of knowledge, norms, values, and standards from across our global institution in the areas of social, environmental, and economic development. Each step we take towards building a better future for all is a step away from conflict, suffering, and loss. Together with our national counterparts, we will continue to advance the realization of Agenda 2030 with a people-centered approach to development. We aim to promote values of solidarity, unity, equity, and to accelerate fundamental transformations in our economic and social models.”
She highlighted that the concerted efforts made in 2023 promoted an integrated approach to the multifaceted challenges Serbia is facing.
Serbia’s Minister of European Integration Tanja Miščević expressed gratitude to the UN team for bolstering the citizens of Serbia towards sustainable prosperity. Miščević praised UN's work in pushing forward on critical transformations, especially in challenging times of geopolitical conflicts and pandemic strife. She added, "We are deeply convinced that a well-planned recovery can support Serbia's path towards achieving sustainable development goals by 2030."
Marina Ivanović, Chief of the United Nations Department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed her appreciation for the efforts in implementing the SDGs by 2030, saying, "Given the significance of the Agenda's objectives and the efforts made for their realization, Serbia, as part of preparations for the Sustainable Development Summit, has adopted binding areas that will be the focus of the Serbian Government's activities in the upcoming period. These include activities on youth, education, science, agriculture, energy, health, as well as combating climate change."
All parties agreed that well-coordinated collaboration and integrated multi-sectoral strategies were needed in reaching the common goals. The UN Serbia team is committed to advancing Agenda 2030 with a people-centered approach and promoting values of solidarity, unity, and equity.
The steering committee meeting was a testament to the successful collaboration between the UN and Serbia in developing and implementing sustainable solutions that have positively impacted multiple sectors within the country; a trend that is set to continue into 2024.

Title: Presentation of New Solutions for Preservation of Biodiversity in Protected Areas
Content: 31 October 2023
Sremski Karlovci, 28 September 2023 – Today, in the Environmental Centre “Radulovački”, a presentation has been held of 13 solutions by civil society organisations for the improvement of different plant and animal species and prevention of the negative impact of climate change in protected areas all over Serbia. Thanks to the European Union (EU) and the Government of Switzerland, the CSOs were allocated financial support amounting to 190,000 USD to implement these solutions. The event has been organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, within the “EU for Green Agenda in Serbia” project.
“Protection of biodiversity has become a European priority, and now we are also supporting Serbia to make improvements in biodiversity one of its priorities. Institutions and local self-governments need to work together with civil society and the private sector so as to preserve rare and endangered species and utilise natural resources in a sustainable way. The EU supports civil society and citizens in their efforts to renew and protect nature and biodiversity, within the initiative for implementation of the Green Agenda in Serbia,” said Head of Cooperation of the EU Delegation in Serbia Nicola Bertolini.
The solutions selected via a public call would contribute to the improved living conditions of different animal species – from fish and birds, to bears and wolves – as well as to the education of the population living in the immediate vicinity of the protected areas concerning the importance of preservation of nature.
The State Secretary in the Ministry of Environmental Protection Ivana Hadži Stošić said that preservation of biodiversity was crucial for the future.
“We all need to take on responsibility for the preservation of our natural heritage, since only together, we can protect our natural wealth. I, therefore, wish to thank all the civil society organisations for the ideas that bring different kinds of support to the managers of the protected areas to help them solve the challenges of preserving biodiversity. Our cooperation creates a synergy that is crucial for the success of preserving the biodiversity in Serbia. Through partnership and joint efforts, we can secure that the protected areas remain vital and our rich biological diversity be preserved for future generations,” said Hadži Stošić.
The presented solutions offer a series of practical measures for the preservation of the endangered bird species (owls, griffon vultures, bee-eaters) and their natural habitats, by for example, installing artificial nests and structures for rehabilitation of injured animals. Furthermore, the organisations would deal with the revitalisation of steppe habitats, by improving water management in swamp habitats and decreasing the risk of fires in the protected areas. All these activities will be realised by the end of the year.
“These solutions are highly important in improving the country’s resilience to climate changes, as well as for sustainable economic development. Preservation of the protected natural habitats and the numerous species living in them, helps us have purer air and water, contributes to the soil’s higher fertility, as well as to the absorption of the greenhouse gases from the atmosphere,” highlighted Deputy Resident Representative of UNDP in Serbia Bojana Balon.
The participants of the event made a tour of the Karlovac Dunavac, a part of the Special Natural Reserve of “Kovilj-Petrovaradin Marshes”. The tour was organised by the Vojvodina Environmental Movement whose solution for landscaping and development of this protected area is among the awarded.
The “EU for Green Agenda in Serbia” project is implemented by the United Nations Development Programme with technical and financial support from the European Union, in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and in cooperation with the Embassy of Sweden and the European Investment Bank (EIB), where additional funding has been provided by the governments of Sweden, Switzerland, and Serbia.

Title: Serbia Hosts Second Biotech Future Forum, Showcasing Sustainable Innovations
Content: 19 October 2023
Belgrade, 19 October 2023 – International conference “Biotech Future Forum”, organised by the Government of the Republic of Serbia in cooperation with the World Economic Forum, Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and with the support of the BIO4 Campus, has been opened today in the Palace of Serbia.
This year’s second edition of the Forum gathers more than 500 participants from more than 30 countries, and more than 40 speakers – representatives of governments, academia, scientific and research institutions, and economy.
Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabić emphasised at the opening ceremony of the Forum that positioning of Serbia as a biotech centre has been one of the main goals of the Government.  She said that the foundation for this had already been placed by investing into strengthening of the ecosystem of innovations, consisting of scientific-technological parks, the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Artificial Intelligence Institute, the digitalisation-support infrastructure, such as the Data Centre in Kragujevac, as well as by creating a stimulating environment for the development of IT companies.
“In addition to cooperation with industry and bringing biotech giants to Serbia, it is crucial for us to provide support to our science and scientists, with the aim for the great scientific achievements developed in our universities and institutes to contribute to the growth of science and economy not only in Serbia, but also globally. Serbia will soon become the home of the BIO4 Campus, a new European centre for the development of biotechnology and bioengineering, which would gather more than 1000 PhDs in more than 300 laboratories, and contribute to further strengthening of Serbian economy and its competitiveness,” said Brnabić.
This year, the organisation of the “Biotech Future Forum” is once again supported by the World Economic Forum, within which the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Serbia was also established.
“Rapid advancements in biotechnology underscore the potential it has to revolutionize our lives and economies by overcoming the world’s most pressing challenges in health and sustainability. Recent developments in technology, in particular, Generative AI, have shown great promise in accelerating and improving not only drug discovery processes, but revolutionizing biotechnology as we know it,” said Managing Director of the World Economic Forum Mirek Dusek.
He added that Serbia was not only the first country to join the Global C4IR Network from the region, but also the founder of the first Centre focusing on biotech and AI in healthcare. “As such, the Centre plays a crucial role in not only building out Serbia’s biotech ecosystem, but leading across the global network on the policies, programmes and systems required to cultivate responsible biotechnology advancement and opportunities,” concluded Dusek.
“Serbia continues to demonstrate real leadership with its commitment to drive and harness all the benefits and the potential of technological innovation and progress and to do so responsibly. Rapid technological advances are accelerating the potential of biotech to help tackle important challenges – from facilitating more affordable access to even higher quality healthcare, to helping us improve food security and sustainability,” OECD Secretary General Mathias Cormann said. “In designing policies, it will be important to get the balance right – to ensure policy responses and regulation provide appropriate levels of certainty, stability, and security while facilitating further innovation and growth,” added Cormann.
The “Biotech Future Forum” involves a number of panels covering the fields of biotechnology, bioinformatics, bioengineering and biomedicine. In his video message at the Forum’s opening, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner pointed out that the role of science in creating sustainable future is emphasised in the UN Resolution on the International Decade of Science for Sustainable Development, which was supported by the Republic of Serbia.
“There is a vital need to ensure ethical and responsible use of new technologies as well as equitable access and distribution of the benefits of biotech across communities and regions. UNDP has recently supported the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Serbia to help create a legal framework for biotech research that respects citizens’ privacy and lays the foundation for responsible A.I. usage,” said Steiner and emphasised that the priority in using the power of biotechnology should be finding solutions to the challenges of climate change.
“Projects like the BIO4 Campus in Serbia -- currently in development with UNDP support-- will provide cutting-edge science and research infrastructure for the next generation of biotech scientists and entrepreneurs,” concluded Steiner.
The Minister of Science, Technological Development and Innovation Jelena Begović PhD said that the “Biotech Future Forum” represents the key event for the scientific, but also business community in Serbia and the region. “We gather experts, researchers, decision-makers, investors and companies in order to build together an ecosystem that would actively aid in addressing local and global challenges via biotechnology. This forum offers a chance for an exchange of ideas and creation of partnerships, and it is truly an inspiration for the further development of science and innovations, but it also considers what kind of a future is in store for the humanity with the development of new technologies.”
“We continue to promote the importance of research and investment in biotechnology, so that we could all together contribute to the progress of our society and economy, and enable better quality of life for all our citizens in the future,” emphasised Minister Begović.
A special programme at this year’s Forum entitled “Green Showroom“, is dedicated to green biotechnology, sustainable solutions and innovations that lead to a “greener” and ecologically sustainable future.

Title: EU PRO Plus Programme Launches "Creating a Greener Future" Art Competition for 2024
Content: 17 October 2023
EU PRO Plus Programme has today published an award-winning art competition for high school pupils from 99 cities and municipalities[1] in the regions of Šumadija and Western Serbia and Southern and Eastern Serbia on the theme "Creating a Greener Future". With this competition, the Delegation of the European Union in cooperation with the Ministry of European Integration continues a more than decade-long tradition of rewarding talented students and encouraging them to be active members of their communities.
This year's theme should encourage young people to channel their creativity towards shaping a greener future for all. Through artistic expression, they should present their skills and future occupations in circular economy by showing in their works which of their own activities and innovative solutions can contribute to a sustainable future and circularity in their communities. Therefore, we want to remind the young people that they are those who bring positive changes in the future while encouraging them to present activities that will contribute to reducing waste, recycling, reusing old things and overall changing our habits in order to protect the environment and achieve sustainability.
The high school pupils, as well as the general public, will be able to vote online, through the EU PRO Plus programme website, and thus choose 12 works from a narrow selection of the 20 best works, previously selected by the internal jury. Online voting opens after the contest closes and lasts for five days. The audience's voice will be the fifth member of the jury who will choose the 12 best works that will be on the pages of the EU PRO Plus programme Calendar for 2024.
The authors of the 12 winning works will receive valuable prizes, laptops and tablet computers and mobile phones, while the school that proves to be the most engaged in organisation of the internal school contest, during which the works for participation in the competition will be selected, will be awarded a laptop and a projector.
The Competition is open by 17 November 2023, and all information and Competition propositions are available on the website 2024 EU PRO Plus Calendar Art Competition.

Title: Additional State Efforts To Support the Mental Health of Young People in Serbia
Content: 16 October 2023
Six ministries sign a Memorandum of Understanding.
Belgrade, 16 October 2023 - Today, at the second International Conference focusing on the mental health and psychosocial support of young people - 'Don't Leave Us For Later' - six ministries signed a Memorandum of Understanding. The goal is to enhance the mental health support system for children and young people in Serbia. This Memorandum clarifies the allocation of resources and the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders in child, adolescent, and young people's mental health protection. The signing parties include the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Tourism and Youth, the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veterans, and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Human and Minority Rights and Social Dialogue, as well as the Ministry of Family Care and Demography of the Republic of Serbia.
Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Representative in Serbia, stressed that every child has the right to good mental health and well-being. This is especially important in light of the findings from the 'U-Report' survey conducted in August of this year, which revealed that approximately 47 percent of respondents noted that young people refrain from seeking help because they fear it may be perceived as a sign of weakness, and they are concerned about being judged. The survey further indicated that nearly half of the young people surveyed, or 46 percent of them, turn to social media and the Internet as their primary source of information on how to maintain good mental health. Only five percent of them consider teachers, and seven percent consider health workers as individuals they can confide in regarding their problems.
“In a strong show of unity, six key ministries have come together to sign the Memorandum of Understanding, reinforcing their dedication to enhancing the emotional well-being of children, adolescents, and youth in Serbia. This collective commitment is more than just an agreement; it's an investment in our future – a recognition that investing in individual mental health is an investment in our community's resilience. Together, we are building a more peaceful and prosperous society, one where the well-being of our youth becomes the cornerstone of our strength,” said Deyana Kostadinova.
Prof. Dr. Slavica Djukic Dejanovic, the Minister of Education, stressed the crucial need to bolster the crisis response system and ensure that adolescents and young people have universal access to mental health care services throughout the country.
“It's essential for both the system and society to acknowledge young people because undetected mental health issues can impact their community interactions and relationships. Strengthening intersectoral cooperation and coordinated efforts among relevant institutions is of immense importance for early recognition and timely response. We must collaborate to raise awareness about preserving mental health in the community. Conference participants unanimously agreed on the vital role of interdepartmental cooperation and efficient resource coordination for the mental health of children and young people,” emphasized Prof. Dr. Slavica Djukic Dejanovic, Minister of Education.
“The mental health and well-being of children and young people should be a top priority in public health, particularly in preventing mental disorders. In our country, the dominant approach to supporting young people with mental health issues still follows a medical model. However, globally, there is a growing emphasis on a 'step-by-step' approach, which provides services in various sectors and at different levels, focusing on psychosocial support. By signing this Memorandum, we can ensure support for our youth across all levels and systems where children and young people are present. By using a consistent narrative and key resources when working with young people, we can ensure they receive support that is accessible and effective. This work requires dedicated specialists, time, and the right conditions for providing psychosocial interventions, as advocated by the UNICEF, Orygen, and the Institute for Mental Health project. Investing in children and young people is an investment in the future of our society,” highlighted Prof. Dr. Milica Pejovic Milovancevic, Director of the Institute for Mental Health.
Prof. Dr. Fabio Scano, World Health Organization Representative in Serbia and Special Envoy of the Regional Director for the Western Balkans, pointed out the importance of innovative approaches to support the preservation of mental health and well-being of children and young people.
“Latest data show that life satisfaction and self-rated health declined between 2018 and 2022 among youth in European Region. I am proud to say that WHO in Serbia is already supporting MoH in strengthening mental health professionals in primary health centers and schools, to be able to develop and implement appropriate and sustainable public health responses to the needs of young people,” pointed out Prof. Dr. Fabio Scano, WHO Representative in Serbia.
As a result of the implementation of the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) programme in Serbia, young people have been given access to reliable information and professional support through the interactive online platform svejeok.rs, which has been visited by more than 90,000 people since 2021.
"We are glad to see here teachers, psychologists, health experts, social workers, youth workers. Because you are really an important link in our upbringing. It is important to us that we have the opportunity to have our voices heard - to be able to express our opinions, needs and fears, but also to present the needs of young people. Because together we can change the system,” believes Gabi Petkovic, from UNICEF's Youth Board.
The Ambassador of the Kingdom of Norway, Kristin Melsom, pointed out the similarities between the problems of young people in Norway and Serbia when it comes to the mental health of young people. She said that Norway provides continuous support to the topic of mental health of young people in Serbia through cooperation with the Government of Serbia and UNICEF.
In order to involve professionals from different sectors in working with young people, UNICEF, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, defined a minimum package of services for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support for young people in Serbia.

Title: Inaugural meeting of the Regional Group of Readmission Specialists
Content: 16 October 2023
In an effort to tackle the increasing focus on readmission and return issues, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) gathered regional experts in Belgrade from October 16th to 18th.
The working sessions during the regional meeting covered several key topics, including enhancing regional cooperation in readmission, establishing cooperation with countries of origin of irregular migrants, collaboration with the European Union, and launching a digital system for managing readmission cases (eRCMS) to facilitate digital cooperation between the EU and the Western Balkans. Additionally, there were discussions on capacity-building for institutions involved in readmission and returns. The sessions were moderated by representatives from Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The establishment of the Regional Group of Experts on Readmission is part of the sub-regional WBCAP project, which IOM is implementing with the support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Denmark.
The meeting in Belgrade marks the initial step in creating a platform for the exchange of knowledge, experiences, and the development of a sustainable and efficient system for managing returns in the Western Balkans.
The project has been in progress since 2021 in response to a significant increase in irregular border crossings in the Western Balkans, amounting to a 136% rise, posing a substantial challenge for the region at that time.
The meeting was inaugurated by Her Excellency Susan Shine, the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Denmark to Serbia, and was attended by diplomatic representatives from other countries, EU delegates, and other distinguished guests. In addition to the Danish Ambassador, introductory remarks were given by Donatella Bradić, Acting Head of IOM Mission in Serbia, Miroslav Panić, Acting Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Serbia, and Žarko Laketa, Director of the Service for Foreigners' Affairs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The entire event is expected to contribute to the improvement of migration and readmission management systems in the Western Balkans and the development of a sustainable return system while respecting the human rights of migrants in accordance with international standards.

Title: Celebrating World Food Day in Serbia: A call for urgent action on water. Leave No One Behind
Content: 16 October 2023
World Food Day is one of the most celebrated UN days of the UN calendar, with observances held in over 150 countries worldwide. World Food Day takes place annually on 16 October and promotes awareness of hunger and action for the future of food, people, and the planet.

This year’s World Food Day has the theme “Water is Life, Water is Food. Leave No One Behind.” It celebrates one of the planet’s most precious resources: water, and its central role in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Water is essential to life on Earth, and it provides the foundation of our food. It covers the majority of the Earth's surface, makes up over 50 percent of our bodies, supports livelihoods, and produces our food. Indeed, agriculture accounts for 72 percent of global freshwater withdrawals. But like all natural resources, fresh water is not infinite. We all need to stop taking water for granted and start improving the way we use it in our daily lives: the food we eat, and how that food is produced.
FAO encourages all international and national partners and development actors to come together for joint water action to improve the way we use water resources in our daily lives.
What can governments do to manage water sustainably for the future of food?
• Prioritize water in policies and planning;
• Understand water challenges;
• Build national water roadmaps and strategies;
• Invest in capacity development and innovative solutions;
• Manage water resources in an integrated way that takes into account all uses from fisheries to forestry, agriculture and other sectors;
• Engage in the Global Dialogue on Water Tenure to shape principles for responsible governance of water resources.
What can researchers, civil society and private sector actors do to manage water sustainably for the future of food?
• Foster innovation and support initiatives to produce goods with less water;
• Inform water and agriculture policies and advise decision-making processes, advocating for change, accountability and inclusion;
• Share knowledge, data and skills;
• Understand where water comes from and where it goes;
• Cut down pollution in businesses.
What can farmers do to manage water sustainably for the future of food?
• Use and dispose of pesticides and fertilizers correctly;
• Manage water more efficiently, starting with regularly checking and repairing leaks or overflows and insulate the pipes for energy savings;
• Adopt sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices to improve efficiency;
• Share water-gathering duties equally between men and women, boys and girls, so all have time for other activities, including school.
What can all of us do to manage water sustainably for the future of food?
• Choose fresh and seasonal fruits and vegetables – they usually take less water to produce;
• Reduce your food waste. It means less water goes to waste;
• Save water. This includes using less energy, since much of it is generated using water;
• Shop sustainably;
• Don’t pollute water, and take part in clean ups if you can.
Nabil Gangi, Officer-in-Charge for the FAO Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia, remarked on World Food Day that  “integrated and sustainable water resources management can become the direct accelerator of at least three out of five pillars of the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans, namely Pillar 2 on Circular Economy, Pillar 3 on Depollution: Air, Water and Soil, and Pillar 4 and Sustainable Food Systems and Rural Areas, with the links to the remaining two pillars on Decarbonisation and Climate Resilience, and Biodiversity: Protection and Restoration of Ecosystems. This year’s World Food Day campaign looks at practical and actionable solutions to produce more food and other essential agricultural commodities with less inputs, especially less water.”
On World Food Day, reflect on the importance of water to our lives and what can be done to improve access to and management of water resources.

Title: World Food Day: National Dialogue in Niš Calls for Bolstering Action for Sustainable Food Systems in Serbia
Content: 13 October 2023

Niš, 13 October, 2023 - In Serbia, one-fifth of the workforce is employed in the agricultural sector, while 40% of the population lives in rural areas. Recognizing the complexity of the food system, from production to consumption, there is a need to strengthen collaboration across sectors, exchange information, and share experiences to tackle existing challenges, including food loss and waste, water, air, and land pollution, poverty, biodiversity loss, and climate change.
In pursuit of innovative solutions and outlining remaining gaps for creating sustainable food systems, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Management, the National Association Serbia Organika, and the Chamber of Commerce of Serbia, brought together representatives from small businesses, government institutions, educational organizations, policy makers, private sector, and civil society at the National Dialogue in Niš.
The event was organized as part of a series of dialogues for implementation of the National Pathways for Food System Transformation, that is mainly focused on "those parts of society with the least resources and information and the most challenging access," as defined at the UN Food Systems Summit held in July 2023 at the UN Headquarters in New York.
"We must harness the power of knowledge to improve food systems that ensure safe, accessible food for all, while preserving natural resources and combating climate change," said Vedrana Ilić, Assistant Minister at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Management of Serbia.
"This year's global theme is water - essential for all living beings on Earth and for food, energy, and industry production. Without water, there is no development, no progress, no future. We must encourage society to undergo systemic changes in thinking, culture, and resource management, and each one of us must do our part to ensure that no one is left behind," she added.
Recognizing the importance of food system transformation for rural, economic, and social development, Serbia participated in the UN Food Systems Summit and renewed its commitments to reshape infrastructure for rural development, especially for irrigation and storage, accelerate innovation and digitization in the sector, promote sustainable production and consumption, and invest in innovative ways to finance small farmers.
"Today, we face challenges like climate change and pollution, but we also have knowledge and new opportunities provided by digitization, science, and innovation. We must harness our capacities, increase funding, and strengthen partnerships to make the sector more competitive and resilient. FAO will continue to work on promoting organic agriculture, nature-based solutions, biodiversity conservation, and the swift implementation of National Pathways for safer and more sustainable food systems in Serbia," said Aleksandar Mentov, National Programme Coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
Some of the main questions raised at the event were: Why is the preservation of water resources crucial for food systems? How can we provide more support to women entrepreneurship? In which ways are innovative food production solutions beneficial for small entrepreneurs? How can quality education enhance food safety? What is our impact on agriculture in the context of climate change, and what can be done on different levels?
In line with this year's global theme of World Food Day, under the slogan "Water is Life. Water is Food. Let No One Be Left Behind," participants highlighted the importance of preservation and responsible use of water resources, especially in agricultural production. The conclusion was that improving water management systems requires data, innovation, investment, and technologies to enable more efficient water use by farmers and the private sector - preserving this valuable resource.
The importance of supporting women entrepreneurship through promoting gender equality and closing the gender gap in women's economic participation, educating youth about food safety, and the significance of innovations in agricultural production for small producers and the development of solutions based on science and digital technologies were all emphasized. These actions aim to improve production, nutrition, and a healthier environment.
About World Food Day
World Food Day is celebrated every year, marking the anniversary of FAO and is one of the most significant international days of the UN, calling for global action to transform food.
This year's theme, "Water is Life. Water is Food. Leave No One Behind," highlights the 2.4 billion people living in areas with insufficient water access and the 600 million who depend on food systems related to water, facing pollution, ecosystem degradation, and the impacts of climate change.
The day is celebrated in over 150 countries, aiming to inspire governments, businesses, civil society organizations, and the public to work together to combat hunger and raise awareness about responsible water management for our food systems.

Title: Enhancing Digital Investigations to Combat Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling
Content: 12 October 2023
In an effort to stay ahead of evolving criminal modus operandi in human trafficking and migrant smuggling, IOM Serbia convened a specialized training in Belgrade on 12th and 13th October, bringing together key actors involved in counter-trafficking and counter-smuggling responses in Serbia.
Led by experts Branko Stamenković, prosecutor for high-tech crime, and police captain Miloš Đorđević from the Police Department in Niš, the training addressed the pressing need to adapt investigative approaches in light of rapid advancement of digital technologies. Criminal networks have increasingly turned to digital platforms, magnifying the scope and impact of these crimes and enhancing their ability to engage in human trafficking and migrant smuggling.
Understanding evolving tactics and global legal tools is crucial to leverage the potential of new technologies to effectively fight human trafficking and migrant smuggling. As traffickers increasingly exploit digital tools, including social media, mobile applications, and online gaming platforms, to perpetrate their crimes, the training provided a timely and crucial intervention. The participants were presented with the evolution of modus operandi, cyber-crime impacts, and international legal instruments in effectively combating these illicit activities.
With advancements in technology, opportunities have also emerged for all actors engaged in counter-trafficking responses to monitor illegal activities, analyze data, and effectively combat these activities. Through a multi-sectoral approach, participants were presented with new techniques to advance digital investigations including the basics of high-tech crime and international legal cooperation in the field, equipping them with invaluable skills for strengthening investigations and intelligence gathering.
The training, supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark through the project “Western Balkans Joint Actions against Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Human Beings” implemented by IOM, marked a significant step towards a more informed, skilled, and coordinated response to these complex and pressing challenges.

Title: 28 Innovations to Decarbonize the Economy and Alleviate Energy Poverty
Content: 06 October 2023
Belgrade, 6 September 2023 – 28 companies in total, from all over Serbia presented today their innovative solutions for decarbonization, just green transition of the economy and support to energy deprived households. These solutions’ goal is to contribute to energy efficiency, utilisation of renewable energy sources, and more efficient use of natural resources, as well as to enable the creation of “green” jobs and alleviate energy poverty. The teams behind these solutions will work with mentors in order to develop their ideas for implementation in practice, while the most successful will also be co-financed.
The event was organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with the support of the Government of Japan and in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Mining and Energy of the Republic of Serbia.
Japanese Ambassador to Serbia, His Excellency Akira Imamura said that the solutions by these companies showed the importance of engaging the business community, as green transformation and decarbonization could not be attained without it.
“Their proposals are unique and evidence a great variety of solutions when it comes to energy sources, including biomass, solar and heating energy, and human power even. Also, many of these have been designed to utilise innovative business models and thus benefit vulnerable segments of the society, including small enterprises, local populations, and women,” added the Japanese Ambassador to Serbia.
“In order to secure for the green transition to also be just, in addition to implementing innovations, it is also necessary to provide adequate support to the most vulnerable individuals and groups,” said Yakup Beris, UNDP Resident Representative. “Together with the companies, we will work on enabling energy vulnerable households to replace individual fossil fuel facilities and transition to cleaner and renewable sources of energy. Simultaneously, we will map energy vulnerable households in the country, so as to help the Serbian Government to use these data in adopting new measures and improving the existing legislation, so as to alleviate energy poverty,” clarified Beris.
State Secretary in the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Sandra Dokić stated that, compared to 2015, Serbia adopted three times more ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) when it comes to decreasing emission of the greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as the Low-Carbon Development Strategy which indicates clear guidelines for decarbonization of the economy. Dokić also expressed her expectation for these 28 solutions to contribute to the decarbonization of the economy and attainment of the defined goals.
“It is highly important that these private and public companies, as well as one local self-government unit, proposed ideas that contribute to decarbonization, but also general protection of the environment. We find support by international partners to be important, as well as a good response by the actors for whom these projects have been intended, so that we may succeed in the green transformation of Serbia,” said Dokić.
The innovative solutions presented at the event included the idea by the “Elektropionir” Energy Cooperative from Belgrade, which, together with the “Organela” organic farm, plans to utilise solar power in the process of organic food production, where networking of energy and agricultural cooperatives would be especially important for the fulfilment of this idea.
The “Toyo Tire Serbia” company will recycle tires to make street furniture, whereby the harmful impact of tire waste to environment would be decreased. The family company which produces heating, cooling and ventilation solutions, “KGH Inženjering” from Zaječar plans to install solar panels and connect them to the flower greenhouse operated by the family members, as well as air-to-water heat pumps to supply heating and cooling for business premises.
The “Join” Company from Novi Pazar which produces jeans, plans to build a solar power plant, as well as to install filters to purify smoke from the boiler room chimneys, which would prevent polluting particles to be released into the atmosphere. The solution by the “Beo čista energija” Company enables the shutting down and rehabilitation of the Vinča landfill, by building a facility for the energy utilisation of waste and landfill gases.
This event was organised within the project entitled “Innovative and Just Green Transition in Securing Systemic Energy Security and Decreasing Energy Poverty” implemented by UNDP in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Ministry of Mining and Energy of the Republic of Serbia and with the support by the Government of Japan.

The goal of this project is to show young people how important their voice is, while also supporting them in articulating that voice and showing what they can do when they mobilize together. Peer support is crucial because they can relate more to us and vice versa, since we know better what bothers them and what difficulties they face.  It is easier for them to open up to us. On the workshop I participated, we were focused on environmental issues as those issues are proved to be high on young people’s list of priorities and concerns. We found that they were fully engaged in these topics once we started to learn ad work together and they had no reservations regarding the potential to stop and decrease the negative environmental trends in their local municipality.
I think that young people are generally aware of the importance of the topics of human rights, gender equality, but they are not encouraged to get to know more about these issues or get involved in fighting for their rights, which is a big problem as they do not get used to being active citizens.
Regarding challenges young people face, I think the biggest one is the lack of support both from our political system, and also people around them as they face a lot of cynicism about making an impact. They would be more interested to engage if they were not discouraged so much by their environment, since they have the potential to change how we see political life and get things moving in the right direction. For that, they need all the support and encouragement they can get from all of us. We need to show them that we want them to raise their voice and speak their opinions which will be equally valued as any other opinions.
Also, youngsters have a lot of enthusiasm and will to learn and get better, their hope in change is what gives them an extra power to change things. It’s important to talk about these topics with peers, and make them realize how important it is to be active and speak your mind on various social issues. As a member of UN Youth advisory group I believe that the UN can do great things by creating programs such as this one that really encourages youngsters and gives them resources to try to actually make an impact and change society for the better.
The Peer Mentoring Program is implemented by UN Women and UNFPA with the support of the Italian Embassy in Belgrade and endorsed by the Ministry of Tourism and Youth of the Republic of Serbia.

Title: Cooperation with private sector and diaspora, from Knjaževac to Switzerland -Where Style Meets Sustainability
Content: 28 September 2023
The heart of this collaboration lies in the small Serbian town of Knjaževac, where the production of these distinctive bags takes place. However, the impact of REVERSAYA extends far beyond this modest municipality. The final products will be sold on both Serbian  and Swiss market. The proposed initiative has the potential to trigger processes that, with good media promotion and experience in the realisation of this project, could attract other investors from the diaspora.
In the coming months, Sisters Code Atelier has exciting plans to propel the brand to new heights on both the national and international stages. Look forward to the opening of pop-up stores in both Belgrade and Zurich, along with high-profile events such as iEmerging Talents Milano during Milano Fashion Week. This venture not only elevates the quality of the brand but also creates the conditions for the long-term expansion of production and employment, particularly in a municipality such as Knjaževac.
REVERSAYA represents more than just a collection of bags; it embodies the spirit of making a positive impact. It is a fusion of fashion, sustainability, and community development that aims to leave a lasting mark. We invite you to join us on this exciting journey, where style meets sustainability, and where businesses become beacons of hope for local communities.

Title: Protected Region of Vlasina enhanced with 47 km of Scenic Hiking Trails
Content: 23 September 2023
Coca-Cola System and UNDP together stimulate sustainable development of the Vlasina region.
Surdulica, 23 September 2023 – The tourist offer of the protected region along Vlasina Lake is enriched, as of today, with 47 kilometres of rebuilt and landscaped hiking trails, thanks to the initiative titled “Vlasina – Pure Love” which is jointly realised by Coca-Cola System and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in cooperation with partners. The aim of the initiative is to improve the economic and social development of the Vlasina area, along with the preservation of the environment.
The importance of the “Vlasina – Pure Love” initiative for the development of the location was recognised and institutionally supported by the municipality of  Surdulica, the Surdulica Tourist Organisation, as well as the Minister’s Cabinet for the development of underdeveloped municipalities.
"The ‘Vlasina – Pure Love’ project is an example of how we can work together to enhance the natural beauty and economic sustainability of a region. Coca-Cola System, UNDP, Surdulica local self-government, Tourist Organisation of Surdulica, and Hiking Union of Serbia, with the support of the Ministry that I lead, work on the improvement of the Vlasina Lake ecosystem, supporting local entrepreneurs and enabling tourists to enjoy this marvellous destination. The Vlasina has always been the jewel of the region and our country, but today, due to this project, it dazzles brighter than ever before,” said the Minister without portfolio in charge of improving the development of underdeveloped municipalities, Novica Tončev.
In cooperation with the Mountaineering Association of Serbia, the already existing hiking trails leading to the mountaintops of Čemernik and Vrtop were renovated, while one new, tourist-educational trail was also made. More than 80 information boards were installed, which acquaint the visitors in a catchy and interactive way, with rare, protected, and autochthonous species of plants and animals in the region of Vlasina.
“These 47 kilometres of trails are much more than a walking and recreation opportunity. I am certain that, with these trails, we open a possibility for a faster and stronger economic development of Vlasina. When I see so many nature lovers in one place, I am more than certain that together we can conquer any peak, overcome any challenge, and support a better future of this exquisite area,” said General Director of Coca-Cola HBC Serbia, Svetoslav Atanasov.
The Acting Deputy of the Resident Representative of UNDP in Serbia Bojana Balon emphasised that sustainable, community-based tourism supports local economic development, taking account of the protection of nature and preservation of local culture and tradition. “The renovated trails would attract more visitors to Vlasina, which would stimulate the development of small and medium enterprises – from hospitality professionals to manufacturers of authentic souvenirs. Improvement of the tourist offer of the Lake of Vlasina in a sustainable way, together with the Coca-Cola System in Serbia, our national and local partners, we contribute to further economic and social development of this part of Serbia and improvement of the quality of people’s lives,” said Balon.
Simultaneously with the opening of the trails, the Lake of Vlasina was the site of the central event in the biggest hiking happening in Serbia, Rosa Hiking Day. Today, at the event organised by the Hiking Union of Serbia, the trails of Vlasina have been walked by more than 400 visitors and lovers of nature, including 350 school children from the cities of Southeast Serbia. This year’s Rosa Hiking Day, with the slogan “One Step Closer to Health”, has inspired almost 15 thousand people to be physically active, at a total of 93 locations all over Serbia.
“The Rosa Hiking Day is a day when we wish to inspire and stimulate Serbia to live healthier and to raise awareness of citizens concerning active and regular walking as the main precondition necessary in preserving one’s health, which as such is also supported by the Institute of Public Health of Serbia. Additionally, the goal of this event is socialisation, as well as the development of tourist potentials through landscaping and utilisation of the existing hiking trails across Serbia,” said President of the Mountaineering Association of Serbia Iso Planić.
The trails around the Lake of Vlasina would be digitised in the following period, and the visitors would be able to explore them via the online platform “Staze Srbije” (Trails of Serbia).

Title: Serbia's Commitment to Sustainable Development: Building on Progress, Acting on Necessity
Content: 19 September 2023
Op-Ed by UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia, Francoise Jacob on the occasion of the UNGA 78 and SDG Summit in New York.
This week, heads of state of 193 countries will gather in New York for the annual General Assembly of the United Nations. 2023 marks the mid-point to agenda 2030 and the ambitious objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals, as set out in 2015. The goals outlined the shared responsibility of each state towards building a better, safer, and more sustainable future for all, while preserving the integrity, richness, and diversity of our planet.
Since early 2020, our world and humanity have been caught in multiple crises with global impacts, such as the COVID19 pandemic, conflicts in Ukraine and the Sahel, extreme weather events with catastrophic consequences on lives and economies, inflation and energy related tensions, increased flows of refugees and migrants fleeing violence and famine. In that context, on September 19, the United Nations organizes the SDG Summit, on the side of the General Assembly. Its main objective is to recognise areas of progress in sustainable development, to highlight the wide gaps remaining in terms of fighting inequalities, climate change, pollution and loss of biodiversity. The summit will provide an opportunity to focus on accelerators that can really transform societies and economies.
In the past 3 years, Serbia embraced several such transition and acceleration initiatives.  The country now has a national pathway towards sustainable food systems, that looks at how to make food production, distribution, and consumption more in line with sustainability principles: a reduced carbon footprint, elimination of polluting agricultural practices, reduced destructive impact on biodiversity, increased equity for farmers, better health for people. Equally important is the Transforming Education initiative, which looks at how we can build a more inclusive education system, address the risk of increased violence at school and in society, prepare our children to contribute meaningfully to climate and environment actions by becoming responsible citizens.
Other global initiatives taken up by Serbia include the digital transformation and the energy transition. Serbia has led some promising projects in such areas, including in renewable energy and biotechnology. The digitalization of the economy and society, as well as the green transformation and energy transition must be shaped so that the more vulnerable segments of the population are not negatively affected. Such just transition addresses the specific needs of the poorest segments of the population, those directly impacted by mine closure, those at risk of energy poverty or increased pollution – and should be built in coherence with more targeted social protection mechanisms.
Intersectoral effectiveness is an essential accelerator to transformation – the capacity of ministries, national and local governments to work better and more intelligently together. It also means a greater focus on bringing the different stakeholders around the negotiation table, particularly when new laws are being developed and formulated, or when services are being developed in municipalities. In this regards, we hope that Serbia’s future National Development Plan will highlight the opportunities for greater coordination and synergies between sectors and stakeholders. Good engagement between state and non state actors, such as civil society and the private sector, are necessary to build effective and inclusive systems. Civil society and local representatives can provide a wealth of perspective from communities and citizens, while the private sector has the financial and technical capacity to tremendously accelerate any transformation.
Serbia has the right size and capacities to make such transition a success within the next 12 to 15 years, providing that local and national political leaders shape a vision that harnesses the energy of all. Such vision, based on a healthier and safer future, more solidarity and equity, and a greener world, would directly contribute to greater social cohesion. On that note, discrimination based on gender, ethnic groups, sexual preferences, or being a refugee, remains one of the worst impediments to building a resilient and inclusive society, and Serbia needs to continue its efforts to transform and implement all relevant laws and practices.
We have to shift the narrative of our future from one of threats to one of opportunities. With intelligence, flexibility and resilience, together we can build such a different world based on shared wealth, solidarity and peace. The SDG Summit is a great opportunity for us to come together, exchange ideas, and reaffirm our commitment to sustainable development. We hope that Serbia will become a driving force in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.

Title: UN Conference on Media Freedom and Safety of Journalists Promotes Human Rights and Democracy in the Region
Content: 15 September 2023
SARAJEVO, 15 September 2023 - On the International Day of Democracy 2023 and marking the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights brought together over 60 professionals from the region at a conference on media freedom and the safety of journalists, in Sarajevo. Participants discussed defamation lawsuits and similar practices targeting journalists, hate speech against journalists, and violence against women journalists.
Journalists, editors, journalists’ associations, trade unions, media experts, lawyers, representatives from the academic community, governments, and national human rights institutions, gathered from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia to exchange experiences and good practices to tackle pressing challenges affecting the media community in the region.
“Freedom of opinion and expression is a cornerstone of democracy that cannot be taken for granted”, said Ingrid Macdonald, Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina when opening the conference.
Edin Forto, Minister of Communications and Traffic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, warned that ”If we do not protect media freedom, we will lose a free media space, which will prevent us from joining the European Union.” He highlighted the need for transparent media ownership and to address the challenges posed by artificial intelligence to the freedom of expression. Duška Jurišić, Deputy Minister for Human Rights and Refugees of Bosnia and Herzegovina underscored the critical role of media in shedding the light on human rights violations.
"Media freedom is an indicator of the level of human rights protection," said Borka Rudić, Secretary- General of the BIH Journalists Association, noting that violence against journalists had increased by 154% in the last year. She pointed out that from May 2022 to mid-September 2023, the association registered 150 different forms of human rights violations against journalists, including hate speech, death threats, and gender-based violence, especially hate speech and harassment of female journalists. Rudić highlighted that authorities are proposing or adopting laws that are not in line with international human rights standards, nor with the conditions that Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to fulfill if it wants to join the European Union.
Jovana Kisin Zagajac, a lawyer from Banja Luka, stressed the importance of holding prosecutors accountable when they fail to prosecute hate speech, while Jelena Zorić, a journalist from Serbia, called attention to the increasing number of verbal attacks on journalists and the necessity for collective action and public awareness to combat hate speech. Leila Bičakčić, Executive Director of the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIN), expressed concern about female journalists leaving the profession due to attacks they face and urged for proactive measures against hate speech. Duška Pejović, a journalist of the national broadcaster in Montenegro, called for an end to misogynist and homophobic statements, and emphasized the importance of solidarity between journalists and of building networks of journalists.
Participants in the conference expressed concern about the recent criminalization of defamation in the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the impact this could also have in the region. Journalists also recognized the need to unite if they are to tackle the significant challenges they face to safely and freely exercise their profession.
Journalists and media organisations from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia taking part in the conference affirmed their commitment to promoting human rights and media freedom, upholding high standards of professional journalism, and countering hate speech, in the pursuit of a more inclusive and democratic society.
The conference was organised under the Global Media Drive for media freedom and safety of journalists, supported by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and implemented by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Title: New Equipment and Support for 30 Primary Schools - Students and Teachers a Step Closer to Digital Education
Content: 14 September 2023
New Equipment and Support for 30 Primary Schools - Students and Teachers a Step Closer to Digital Education.

Belgrade, 14 September 2023 - As many as 30 primary schools across Serbia received nearly 2,000 electronic devices in order to adapt teaching to digital education, and a large number of students, including the most vulnerable, were provided learning and psychosocial support. These are just some of the results of the three-year The Bridging the Digital Divide in Serbia for the Most Vulnerable Children project, which was implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Serbia and UNICEF, with the financial support of the European Union, as a response to the need for distance learning triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the state of emergency.
From November 2020, when the project was launched, until the end of the project in September 2023, 30 primary schools across Serbia received a total of 1,890 tablets and 60 laptops, and pedagogical assistants received another 250. Yettel ensured internet was available on all devices, through the provision of internet cards and modems. Learning support was provided to 5,500 students in 30 schools and more than 900 teachers attended trainings to improve their pedagogical and digital competences.
Anamarija Vicek, State Secretary in the Ministry of Education, emphasized the importance of the project's results for the further development of support for digital education.
“With the support of the project, not only did we equip 30 schools that were part of the project with digital equipment, but a significant number of students who needed the most support in learning received this help. We are grateful to UNICEF for the support it provides us through this and other projects,” said Anamarija Vicek, State Secretary in the Ministry of Education.
As part of the project, psychosocial support was also provided. Following training sessions, professional associates included more than 17,000 students in numerous preventive, promotional and intervention activities, both at the school and local levels in 10 municipalities. In addition, the National Network of Psychologists and Pedagogues, as an integral part of the project, organized webinars to support schools and local networks of professional associates.
The EU funded the project through a €2 million grant and was implemented in 30 local self-governments across Serbia.
“Children and vulnerable persons are two categories of population that will always have the EU’s highest attention and support. I am very happy that through this project we succeeded in supporting underprivileged students and their schools in facing the learning challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic, thus reducing the gap between privileged and marginalized students. Digital education is not just a technological advancement, it is a powerful tool for social inclusion and breaking the cycle of disadvantage. The EU will continue to support actions leading to a more inclusive and equitable society, including through a forthcoming dedicated campaign on bridging the digital divide for another vulnerable group – our seniors,” said Plamena Halacheva, Deputy Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Serbia.
During the presentation of project results, Yosi Echeverry Burckhardt, UNICEF Serbia Deputy Representative, stated that better student success, greater motivation to learn, a sense of well-being at school and self-confidence in relation to school expectations are just some of the project’s achievements.
“The Bridging the Digital Divide in Serbia for the Most Vulnerable Children project was initially born as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were children without access to digital devices or the internet, making it exceedingly difficult for them to engage in remote learning. In response, the Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the EU, UNICEF, schools, and numerous partners, united to support the most vulnerable children. Now, as we emerge from the pandemic, the solutions we've collectively crafted not only address immediate challenges but also serve as foundations for future education system reforms,” said Yosi Echeverry Burckhardt.
Significant progress has also been made in terms of supporting the further development of digital education – a new server system has been procured and installed in the Office for Information Technologies and eGovernment, while more than 2,000 teachers have successfully completed training to administer Moodle, a distance learning management software. In addition, the My School platform has been migrated to new servers, and through the development of more than 40 new online courses, it has a new purpose of providing quality resources for teachers and students.
As part of the project, the Ministry of Education created a national aggregator of open educational resources where 6,600 descriptions of TV lessons recorded during the pandemic were entered. In this way, the availability of classes has been significantly eased, and key strategic directions in the field of digital education development in Serbia have also been developed.

Title: Improving the Work of Preschool Institutions Sets the Path for Transformative Education
Content: 05 September 2023
Unveiling Results and Vision for Advancing Preschool Education: 'Years of Ascent’ Programme and Beyond.
Belgrade, 5 September 2023 - There is a need for further systemic action, long-term investment, cross-sector coordination, and motivated professionals to work with children in order to ensure that all children have access to quality, inclusive preschool education, was the conclusion of today’s conference.  The conference also saw the presentation of results achieved in the support provided to preschool institutions in introducing the new 'Years of Ascent' programme for preschool education and care.
Support for preschool institutions was provided through the four-year project of the Ministry of Education ‘Inclusive Preschool Education and Care’ financed by the World Bank, which was implemented in cooperation with competent state institutions, civil society organizations, the Institute for Pedagogy and Andragogy of the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade and UNICEF.
The State Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Anamarija Vicek, pointed out that the Ministry, in cooperation with relevant organizations and partner institutions, is intensively working on implementing measures and activities that contribute to the expansion of children's access to quality preschool education.
“We are committed to supporting families in fulfilling their childrearing role, enhancing the professional competencies of staff, and strengthening cooperation with various stakeholders, including schools, cultural institutions, healthcare providers, the social protection system, and local self-governments. Together, our collaborative efforts are focused on establishing an inclusive preschool education and care system that is accessible to all children and open to families, other education levels, and the local and broader communities,” said State Secretary Vicek.
Progress in the improvement of preschool education and care was achieved through the construction and reconstruction of facilities, as well as by strengthening the capacity of professionals to implement a new approach focused on learning through play and quality relationships between children and adults. Also, the importance of learning at an early age was promoted, and improvements in terms of inclusiveness were achieved through grants to support the inclusion of children from vulnerable social groups.
One of the partners of the Ministry of Education in this project is UNICEF in Serbia, which in cooperation with the Institute for Pedagogy and Andragogy of the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade developed and implemented a support programme centered on a new approach emphasizing learning through play and fostering quality relationships between children and adults. According to the data of the Final Study on the quality of work of preschool institutions, parents feel welcome and consider that preschool is a good place for children where friendship is encouraged and nurtured, but it is also a place for building quality relationships between children of different ages, as well as between children and adults.
UNICEF Representative in Serbia, Deyana Kostadinova, emphasized that universal and equitable access to quality and inclusive preschool education lays the foundation for a transformative educational journey.
“Serbia has championed this cause in its strategic and legal frameworks and through the strong commitment by the Government. And we have seen the positive effects. Through the implementation of innovative reforms driven by the new preschool curriculum, we are working to ensure that every child gains access to quality preschool education. But remaining challenges still need to be tackled - especially regarding children from vulnerable backgrounds, including Roma children and children with disabilities. In fact, what is needed is systemic action - sustainable reform requires solid institutions, motivated staff, strategic coordination, and strong collaboration,” believes Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Representative in Serbia.
The World Bank, together with the Ministry of Education and UNICEF, is supporting efforts to improve the cognitive skills of Serbian children in early childhood, which is key to build Serbia’s human capital and the productivity of the workforce.
“Investing in the early years of a child’s education is one of the smartest things a country can do. It’s an investment that can deliver better learning, health and behavioural outcomes for every child,” said Nicola Pontara, World Bank Country Manager for Serbia. “We are delighted to be able to improve the access to good quality early childhood education; and to do so by involving teachers and families in the process, so that children are empowered and feel understood and free to learn actively and flexibly in interactive environments.”
The new programme concept is designed to facilitate children's learning in their natural environments, including through their daily routines, play, and exploration. To implement this approach, over 95 percent of professionals working in both public and private preschool institutions and primary schools have undergone training. Additionally, employees in public schools have received support through mentoring and horizontal knowledge exchange. Equally vital is the support for connecting with professionals from primary education through the 'On the Common Path of Learning' training programme, ensuring a seamless continuum of assistance for children and families.

Title: Promoting Social Cohesion: Empowering Migrants through Community Activities in Serbia
Content: 22 August 2023
In recent years, Serbia has found itself at the crossroads of mixed migration routes, with numerous migrants seeking shelter, assistance or protection within its borders. To support the wellbeing of migrants in reception and asylum centers, the Serbian Commissariat for Refugees and Migration IOM has initiated a range of recreational, creative, social, and informal learning activities and workshops in these centers. The activities are organized in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and suported by Switzerland.
With a focus on enhancing the quality of time spent in the centers, these activities have proven to be instrumental in fostering social cohesion, improving everyday life, and promoting a sense of community among migrants living in these centers. Currently active in four locations, they have engaged more than 2565 beneficiaries from diverse backgrounds.
Among many useful hobbies for creative expression and skill-building , migrants are engaged in tailoring clothing items such as t-shirts, tracksuits, underwear, and winter hats. This not only provides a practical skill but also offers a means of empowerment . Repairing personal clothing, making towels, and other essential hygienic items used in an eveyday life, also contributes to a sense of self-sufficiency and resourcefulness.
However, these activities go beyond individual skill development. As part of a broader strategy to enrich community-based services and facilitate the integration of migrants into local communities, the initiative includes partnerships with nine civil society organizations. These partnerships were established through Call for Proposals of the International Organization for Migration's (IOM)in cooperation with the Comissariat for Refugees and Migration and the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs. The selected projects and programs enable:
This broader approach aims to not only benefit migrants but also create positive ripples within local communities. With active involvement from five Reception and Asylum Centers and 10 local communities, the projects are contributing to the development of harmonious relationships and shared experiences between migrants and locals.
In summary, the proactive efforts to enhance the lives of migrants in Serbia are creating a positive impact on both individuals and communitiesby providing opportunities for skill-building, creative expression, and intercultural interaction, these initiatives are not only supporting the well-being of migrants but also promoting social cohesion and inclusivity within local communities. As the projects continue to unfold, they stand as a testament to the transformative power of collaboration, empathy, and community-driven action.

Title: EU supports the improvement of economic infrastructure with 4.6 million Euros
Content: 25 July 2023
The European Union (EU) will support the improvement of business infrastructure in 18 local self-governments[1] in the region of Šumadija and Western Serbia and Southern and Eastern Serbia.
The grants worth over 4.6 million Euros are being provided through the EU PRO Plus programme, which is implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of European Integration, for projects of construction or reconstruction and infrastructural equipping of industrial zones, tourist zones, as well as for development technical documentation for the development of economic infrastructure.
"Together with the European Union, we are working to create conditions for economic growth, and this support should contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of local self-governments and their ability to implement projects. In 18 cities and municipalities with the European Union grants, economic infrastructure in industrial zones will be improved, as well as tourist infrastructure, which will create conditions for new investments and new jobs, all leading to a better standard of living for citizens," said Tanja Miščević, Minister of European Integration.
"By supporting these projects, the European Union contributes to the improvement of the business and investment climate in Serbia, strengthens competitiveness and creates conditions for achieving better economic results. It is expected that these projects will contribute to over 300 million Euros of new investments and the creation of around 4,500 new jobs within five years after their implementation, while we focused special attention on supporting the economic development of less developed parts of the country", said the Ambassador of the European Union to Serbia, Emanuele Giaufret.
Of the total allocated funds, 3.1 million Euros will be used for infrastructure equipment, i.e. construction of roads, transformer stations, improvement or construction of communal infrastructure in industrial zones in Valjevo, Šabac, Ćuprija, Preševo and Mionica, reconstruction and equipment of the former textile plant in Bosilegrad, while the regional Smart Centre will be completed in Novi Pazar. The EU will support projects aimed at the development of sustainable tourism in Knjaževac, Aleksinac, Mali Zvornik and Kraljevo with over one million Euros, while Bajina Bašta, Surdulica, Loznica, Paraćin, Zaječar, Kosjerić, Lajkovac will receive support in the amount of over 423,000 Euros to develop technical documentation for development of economic infrastructure, i.e. for the preparation of projects for building permits, project execution designs and feasibility studies. The local self-governments themselves, in proportion to the level of development, provided funds for co-financing in the amount of more than 2.7 million Euros.
These 18 projects were selected through a Public Call conducted by EU PRO Plus in two phases in the period from 26 September 2022 to 29 January 2023.

Title: Opportunities for sustainable investment in Serbia presented in the UN Headquarters
Content: 19 July 2023
New York, 18 July 2023 – Minister of Science, Technological Development and Innovation in the Government of the Republic of Serbia Dr Jelena Begović, presented the "UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Investor Map" for Serbia, at an event held as a part of the High-Level Political Forum in the United Nations (UN).
Dr Begović presented the Map at the event titled “Turning Financing Frameworks into Action”, jointly organised by the UN missions of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Indonesia, Swedish Agency for International Development and Cooperation (SIDA) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
“I believe that the Republic of Serbia is somehow a leader in the region, but if I may as well add, also on a wider scale, globally,” said Minister Begović and added that the Map was developed for the crucial sectors that require investment if we wish to attain the SDGs defined for 2030, so as to make the world a better place.
“Serbia identified the five key sectors, including agriculture, food production, infrastructure, renewable and new energy resources, and information technology, and these are the fields that contribute to improving the living conditions on the entire planet,” said Dr Begović.
The UN SDGs Investor Map had been jointly developed by the Government and UNDP Office in Serbia which also provided support to the institutions of the Republic of Serbia in organising this event.
UNDP Resident Representative in the Republic of Serbia Yakup Beris said that, by presenting the Map in the UN, Serbia also presented itself as a country dedicated to accelerating sustainable development, in line with the Agenda 2030.
“The SDGs Investor Map helps Serbia present its opportunities for sustainable investments to worldwide investors. UNDP will continue to support the Government, business sector and investors, so as to accelerate sustainable development which in turn contributes to the economic growth of the country, protection of environment and wider social welfare”, said Beris.
The Map for Serbia was developed in accordance with the UNDP methodology which had been previously applied in more than 30 countries worldwide. UNDP, the Government and competent institutions determined the sectors and fields which represent profitable opportunities for sustainable investment. Due to this map, investors from all over the world may find information concerning the fields and sectors in Serbia where the most attractive investment opportunities are present in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, as well as with the national developmental needs and priorities of Serbian Government.
The Map identifies five sectors with opportunities for sustainable investment: food and beverages, renewable energy sources and alternative energy, infrastructure, technology and communications and healthcare.
Within these sectors, the total of 13 most attractive areas for sustainable investment were singled out: production of fresh fruit and vegetables, organic agricultural production, production of solar energy and building of wind farms, development and application of smart technologies in agriculture, as well as development and application of sophisticated software products and services, provision of waste management services, construction and management of harbour infrastructure, construction of energy-efficient residential buildings, construction and management of tourist infrastructure, as well as production and delivery of pharmaceuticals, development and provision of specialised healthcare services and implementation of biotechnology in medicine.
Potential investors can also find out from the Map what amounts of investments need to be made in individual projects in the field, what investment return they may expect and within what timeframe, how this type of investment is aligned with the national development priorities, as well as about specific SDGs to which their sustainable investment may contribute.
The Map is available at: https://sdginvestorplatform.undp.org/country/serbia.
This event was organised within the High-Level Political Forum which was held in the UN Headquarters in New York 10-19 July, under the patronage of the UN Economic and Social Council, and its main topic was accelerating recovery after the Coronavirus pandemic and implementation of 2030 Agenda for sustainable development.

Title: Innovations Towards Energy Independence
Content: 14 July 2023
Approximately twelve kilometres from downtown Belgrade, next to the Nikola Tesla airport, in the Radiofar settlement with no amenities such as paved streets, city water and sewer, or gas grid, Zoran Radeljić started making cutting edge solar panels that are almost entirely (97%) exported into the European Union (EU). These last-generation solar panels are easily adapted to all roof types and can be mounted quickly and relatively simply.
Major costs in electricity production and the prospect of their further increase due to the EU decision to introduce taxes on products that involve carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in their production motivated Zoran to innovate. He constructed a 1178kW solar power plant for the purposes of his production plant, to meet all of his company’s energy needs and reduce CO2 emissions to approximately 336 tonnes annually. This amount equals the sequestration capacity of 16,800 trees.
Finding alternatives for on-site energy generation from renewable sources without adequate infrastructure was one part of this innovative endeavour. Another one was that Zoran found a way to utilise solar power during the night and in winter to produce heating and electricity.
- Our idea was to make a facility that is unique at regional level, a building that will be energy independent and that will receive all the energy it needs to conduct its business from renewable sources. We wanted to show a practical example of what we otherwise recommend to our customers and associates.
In order to fully transition to solar power, Zoran set up an auxiliary system in the plant to enable it to obtain heating and electrical energy coming from the sun throughout the year.
- These systems make the building self-sufficient. It produces the amounts of heating and electricity it needs throughout the year, Slobodan Jerotić, energy expert and ‘EU for Green Agenda in Serbia’ mentor, said.
Producing electricity from solar power depends on the season of the year and the day and night cycle. Most energy is produced during the summer because there’s most insolation and the days are long, while less electricity is produced during the winter because days are shorter, and consumption is higher. The electricity that produced and not consumed immediately is handed over to the electrical grid in this case, and when the production of electricity from own capacities is insufficient the building is supplied with electricity from the grid, which mostly happens during night - for lighting, and during the winter - for the purposes of operating production machines and charging electric vehicles’ batteries.
Most heating energy is produced during the summer when consumption is low. Seasonal reservoirs to store this energy were made in the plant, enabling the functioning of the supply system during the winter.
- Water is the reservoir fluid; it is heated throughout the year and used in winter to heat the facility through floor heating, as Zoran Radeljić explained.
- These systems streamline the way energy is utilised, Jerotić insists.
The local community will also benefit from Zoran’s business.
- Based on an agreement we made with mechanical engineering high schools and the Belgrade Faculty of mechanical engineering, we are ready to educate people whose jobs are tied to energy production from fossil fuels so they can be requalified and reoriented towards jobs such as solar system mounters, programmers, and engineers who could do projects, Radeljić said.
- These people will then be able to work installing solar panels, installing solar thermal panels and other green energy and green economy jobs, Jerotić added.
Therefore, this plant will contribute to the just green transition in Serbia and the development of the Serbian economy.
- This company can give a sizable contribution to reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) if individual households and the industry recognise this kind of investment and set aside some initial funds to be able to afford it. What is certain is that these investments pay off. Not only will we have savings in energy consumption, but we will also make a positive impact in terms of enhancing environmental protection - Sandra Dokić, state secretary with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, said.
Decarbonisation of the industry and society at large, i.e. the gradual phasing out of fossil fuels and transitioning to renewable energy sources are some of the crucial steps to slow down climate change that affects Serbia and the Western Balkans region with droughts and floods.
***
“Reducing CO2 emissions in solar collector production” by Master Team DOO was selected as one of the sixteen best innovative solutions to accelerate the green transformation of the economy within the “EU for the Green Agenda in Serbia.” This initiative, technically supported by the European Union and conducted in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, is implemented by UNDP in cooperation with the Embassy of Sweden and the European Investment Bank (EIB), with additional funding provided by Governments of Sweden, Switzerland, and Serbia. Co-funding from European Union funds in the amount of €42,000 was secured for the implementation of this innovative solution, in addition to mentorship support.

Title: UN launches campaign, calling for renewed global ambition and action for the Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 12 July 2023
Public mobilization comes ahead of critical halftime Summit in September at UN in New York.
New York, 5 July 2023 -  The United Nations, today, is kicking off a communications campaign to rally for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap for people and planet adopted by world leaders in 2015.  Ahead of a critical UN Summit in September, the campaign aims to amplify an urgent call for ambitious new action, showcase the Goals as the blueprint for sustainable progress globally, and galvanize the global public around this shared agenda for our common future.
At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the SDGs is in peril. For the first time in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects.
The 2023 SDG Summit will gather world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 18-19 September to reaffirm their collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to leave no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the world back on track to achieving the SDGs.
Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and countries worldwide, the UN campaign aims to re-energize the conversation about the Goals.
"The successive crises of the past 4 years have distracted the attention away from the critical transformations required to ensure a sustainable future for the people and the planet. Agenda 2030 and the sustainable development goals are a fantastic tool and framework to re-focus our efforts and ambitions and turn challenges into opportunities. The UN in Serbia promotes a people centered approach to development, to reduce inequalities, promote well-being and prosperity, in harmony with nature." - UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia.
Building off the color wheel brand of the SDGs, the campaign uses a dynamic new visual system for its messaging to build momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the SDGs.
One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to take action on the SDGs through the UN’s ActNow initiative across all 17 Goals. From using public transportation, to fundraising for schools or speaking up for equality, the platform lists steps that everyone can take to accelerate progress on the SDGs and create better lives on a healthier planet for all.
A curated group of high-profile influencers, the Circle of Supporters, will galvanize their communities to take individual action on the SDGs and to impress upon decision-makers the urgency to act now.

Title: Serbia participated in the United Nations Interregional Conference on Labor Migration
Content: 11 July 2023
Serbia participated in the United Nations Interregional Conference on Labor Migration, held in Rabat, Morocco on 11-12 July, 2023 within the scope of GCM Talks organized by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Some of the main topics discussed were options and pathways for regular migration to facilitate labor mobility and decent work taking into account demographic and labor market realities, as labor mobility plays an important role in finding long-term solutions for countries of origin and country of destination.
The meeting on “Good Practices and Challenges in Bilateral Labor Migration Agreements, Including Skill Mobility Partnerships” was held in Rabat, Morocco on 11-12 July, 2023 within the scope of GCM Talks organized by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). This event was attended by member states of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Migration Network such as Germany, Egypt, Spain, Georgia, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Portugal, Serbia, Tunisia, Chad and Turkey. Republic of Serbia was represented by advisor at Ministry Of Labor, Employment, Veterans And Social Affairs, from Department For Labor And Employment.
Namely, the Interregional Conference presents a combination of global and regional consultations and exchange of experiences in order to support member states from the United Nations system that are interested in continuing discussions on how to implement the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM), i.e. how to best approach the exchange of  good practices and identify challenges and shortcomings related to the implementation of bilateral agreements on labor migration.
This important event also served as a platform for strengthening cooperation, encouraging an inclusive labor market and promoting the full participation of migrant workers in the formal economy in accordance with the goals set by the Global Compact on Migration. States championing the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, together with countries with years of experience and expertise in implementing bilateral agreements on labor migration, including partnerships for skills mobility, have engaged in cross-regional consultations and exchange of experiences on how to the best way to implement certain aspects of the GCM.
Among the topics discussed were options and pathways for regular migration to facilitate labor mobility and decent work taking into account demographic and labor market realities, as labor mobility plays an important role in finding long-term solutions for countries of origin and country of destination. It was  particularly pointed out that the Republic of Serbia has a long tradition in regulating the legal position of migrant workers and that it takes place through the implementation of bilateral agreements on social security, bilateral agreements on temporary employment and the application of the provisions of the Law on Employment of Foreigners. One of the reasons for the conclusion of a greater number of bilateral agreements is not only the large number of our migrant workers who went to work temporarily in the countries of Western Europe, but also in the very legal nature of those agreements, which lies in the principle of equal treatment of domestic and foreign citizens in terms of conditions for acquisition and use of rights in the field of social security.
The process of amending the Law on the Employment of Foreigners has begun, focusing on the introduction of a single permit for residence and work, the possibility of submitting a single permit via email and from abroad, and the complete digitization of the procedure. The Qualifications Agency plays a key role in recognizing qualifications and deficient occupations in Serbia, providing professional support for foreigners and stateless persons in the process of recognition of foreign qualifications for the purpose of establishing an employment relationship. The country is also developing a methodology for determining skills and occupations in short supply.

Title: Youth Wellbeing - Our Mission, Their Strength: World Population Day Marked Today in Serbia
Content: 10 July 2023
Sremski Karlovci - United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) marked World Population Day today in the Eco center Radulovacki in Sremski Karlovci
World Population Day marking holds great significance as it addresses the momentous milestone reached last year, when the global population surpassed 8 billion in November 2022. The primary objective of this event was to convey a joint message on the significance of youth well-being and youth participation in the development of their communities, as well as to emphasize the importance of multisectoral cooperation in achieving the full potential of every young person in Serbia.

„We need to talk more about the needs of young people, their problems and expectations, and find mechanisms to listen to what they recognize as important. I am happy that a large number of partners joined us today, because only through joint action and dialogue can we create solutions tailored to young people and for young people“- stated Borka Jeremic, Head of Office of the UNFPA in Serbia.
Following up to the World Population Day global theme centered around gender equality in a world of 8 billion, the event also served as a platform to foster discussions on the vital role played by gender equality and youth engagement.
In her video message, Darija Kisic, Minister for Family Welfare and Demography and Co-Chair of the Coordination Body for Gender Equality of the Republic of Serbia, highlighted the importance of working on population issues in the country. “ Our task is to look beyond the numbers and invest in people and their potential. Every person of our country is equally valuable, and everyone contributes to its development”- stated Kisic.
It is estimated that young people make one fourth of the global population. „The Ministry of Tourism and Youth recognizes young people as a heterogeneous category and invests efforts in improving the position of youth from the local to the national level, striving for young people to be recognized, included, asked for opinion and their contribution recognized as significant. We see the well-being of young people as the most important resource for the development and progress of the entire society, as well as for facing demographic challenges.“- stated Ivana Antonijevic, Assistant Minister at the Ministry for Tourism and Youth.
This year also marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the growing population this is the momentum to reflect and accelerate action to ensure that all human rights are realised and respected.
“Serbia is at a turning point for the management of its demographic resilience. There are so many economic and development opportunities for this country, as it embraces the green agenda, and prepares for the EU accession. The UN work in Serbia aims to create a sustainable, inclusive, and peaceful world, to reduce inequalities, eradicate discrimination, and advance human rights. We work increasingly with and for the young population, to create opportunities and space for a meaningful engagement on political, economic, social and environmental matters. By doing so, we invest in our future”, stated Francoise Jacob, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Serbia.
Mr. Luca Gori, Ambassador of Italy to the Republic of Serbia and Mr. Christian Schilling, from the Embassy of Germany to the Republic of Serbia highlighted the role of youth engagement and life skills development as a key to strengthening demographic resilience in a world of 8 billion. During the event, young artist Iva Lorens gave a short musical performance and personal testimonial reflecting on the relevance of youth wellbeing and gender equality.
After the ceremonial part, two workshops that foster youth wellbeing and youth engagement in promotion of human rights and community development took place. Workshops are part of the Joint Programme “Peer Mentoring Program for promotion of human rights, gender equality and increased youth participation in Serbia” implemented by UNFPA and UN Women with the support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Republic of Italy , and by the Government of Germany through GIZ Program “Prospects for Young People in Rural Areas in Serbia”.
The event is a part of the Human Rights 75 Initiative to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Title: United Nations Population Fund and the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality Signed Memorandum of Understanding
Content: 07 July 2023
Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for Serbia, John Kennedy Mosoti, and the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality, Brankica Janković, signed a Memorandum of Understanding in order to continue cooperation in relation to protection against discrimination and promotion of equality, especially among social groups that are at greater risk of discrimination.
“This memorandum creates an excellent basis for our further joint efforts and represents the continuation of long-standing successful cooperation with the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality. Next year marks the 30th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action. Therefore it is important that we jointly strengthen our efforts and work to create an environment in Serbia where all citizens can fulfill their full potential”, said John Kennedy Mosoti.
According to Brankica Janković, the cooperation of the Commissioner, as the central independent state institution responsible for protection against discrimination, and UNFPA will be realized through a series of activities.
“These activities will be implemented in order to improve the position of our older citizens, to whom we are committed at the national and local level, in order to educate and involve young people in combating discrimination through the network of peer educators of the Youth Panel, as well as to improve the rights of women and girls in the field of sexual and reproductive health and ending online violence through the bodyright campaign.
The fight for equality and respect for human rights concerns the whole society and must be placed highly on the list of priorities of public policies because society is only as strong as its weakest members,” Commissioner points out.
Every year, about 30 cases of femicide occur in Serbia, and according to available research, about 60% of women in Serbia experience some kind of violence from the age of 15.
Also, one out of every five women in Serbia uses modern contraception, and special efforts need to be invested in educating young people, the Roma population and other groups. Surveys show that 78% of female respondents feel unsafe in the virtual sphere, even though they spend more than three hours online daily.
On the other hand, every fifth person in Serbia is older than 65, with projections that in 2041 this share will increase to 24%. According to the results of the report on the position of older persons conducted by the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality with the support of UNFPA, more than half of older people in Serbia feel discriminated. Continuous action needs to be taken to promote and protect the rights of everyone while ensuring that no one is left behind.

Title: Recognizing Uzice, Raska, and Osecina's Dedication to Enhancing Air Quality
Content: 03 July 2023
Belgrade, 3 July 2023 - At the final event of the "Schools for Better Air Quality" project held today in the Botanical Garden in Belgrade, UNICEF Serbia and the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities, with the support of the Government of Norway, awarded the City of Uzice and Municipalities Raska and Osecina for the greatest progress in 2023 in undertaking actions to reduce air pollution, which were implemented with cooperation and in consultation with young people at the local level.
The winning municipalities were chosen from 15 local self-governments participating in the project. The City of Uzice won the first prize - a solar power plant of 7 KW of installed power, while Raska and Osecina, which won second and third place, were awarded a total of 11 air purifiers. Donated equipment will be installed in facilities or institutions that work with children and/or young people.
Air pollution is one of the world’s largest health and environmental problems. 90% of the world's population breathes polluted air. Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to air pollution because their bodies, organs and immune systems are still developing. Air pollution damages health during childhood and increases the risk of diseases later in life, and children under five are the most vulnerable, as they take in more air proportionally to their weight than adults.
"Many scientific pieces of evidence point to the fact that decisive actions are necessary if we want to prevent irreversible consequences for the environment - there are many environmental problems in modern civilization, and air pollution is certainly one of the basic ones. Good air quality is essential for people's health and well-being, and unfortunately, children are the most vulnerable group. I hope that after two years of hard work within the 'Schools for Better Air Quality' project, we have managed to contribute to the process of solving this important issue that concerns us all," said Nebojsa Cvejanov, Program Coordinator at the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Belgrade.
Within this innovative project, the first of its kind in Serbia, during the previous two years the education of children and young people on the topic of air quality was encouraged, as well as the inclusion of young people in the adoption of national and local policies on this topic. Furthermore, the importance of air quality monitoring was pointed out, and 15 local self-governments received support for strengthening the capacity to improve policies in the area of air quality management, with a special emphasis on the inclusion of young people in the processes of creating local policies.
"The greatness of this project is that it clearly showed that young people in Serbia are aware of the problem of pollution and at the same time are interested in contributing to the preservation of the environment. Therefore, it is important that local governments, strengthened by the experience gained through the activities of cooperation with young people within this project, continue to show them their trust, by providing them with sustainable ways to express their opinions and at the same time encouraging them to be part of actions and solutions for a clean and healthy environment. Only such an environment is a prerequisite for all children and young people to enjoy their rights and realize their full potential," believes Lidija Kesar, Climate Change and Clean Air Officer at UNICEF Serbia.
Miodrag Gluscevic, Programme Director for Sector for Urban Development at Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities, emphasized that local self-governments are one of the key actors when it comes to environmental protection, as well as improvement of air quality at the local level and that the inclusion of young people has brought a new quality to the process of creating and implementing public policies on the local level.
"Through the 'Schools for Better Air Quality' project, young people got the opportunity to be the bearers of change for better air quality and to become key partners of local governments in solving this problem. Likewise, local self-governments have shown great interest when it comes to youth initiatives and their involvement in the development of local policies," said Gluscevic.
This comprehensive project has been implemented by UNICEF with the financial support of the Government of Norway, and with the support of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Tourism and Youth, and in partnership with the Institute of Nuclear Sciences Vinca, the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities, the Digital Serbia Initiative (DSI), the Internet Society of Serbia, the Petlja Foundation, the Centre for the Promotion of Science (CPN) and the organizations Connecting and Junior Achievement Serbia, and in cooperation with local communities.

Title: The first Eco gym in Serbia opened in Vršac
Content: 27 June 2023
An innovative solution for promoting sustainable exercise.
Vršac, June 27, 2023 - With the support of the European Union, the first Eco gym in Serbia was opened yesterday at the city lake in Vršac. This unique recreation area has 12 exercise machines made from wood that once floated down the Sava River. Thanks to this gym, the citizens of Vršac will be able to exercise both in nature and in harmony with it. The goal is to raise the awareness of recreationists in this way about the importance of reducing waste and preserving the environment.
The eco-gym was designed by sports professor Marko Ćirić and was realized together with the Center for the Promotion of Youth Entrepreneurship, thanks to the technical and financial support of the European Union within the "EU for Green Agenda in Serbia" initiative.
Antoine Avignon, the Chapter 27 Desk Officer at the EU Delegation to Serbia, pointed out that the people of Vršac benefit greatly from the Eco gym because they can exercise outdoors, next to the City Lake.
"At the EU, we believe that environmental protection comes with citizens' awareness, and this eco-gym is the first ever built in Serbia. It is a place where citizens can exercise, stay healthy, and practice a circular economy. Here, thanks to the creativity and hard work of Marko from Eko Gym, and the financial support from the EU for Green Agenda in Serbia with UNDP and Team Europe, the wood is picked up from rivers as debris and reused in fantastic outdoor sports equipment. Welcome to the first sustainable gym in Vršac!" said Avignon.
"When the water level is high, various waste and fallen trees float down the river, and the water carries them to the shores. I often stay on the Sava where I have a raft, and in that part, I regularly clean the river. On the other hand, I am oriented towards sports. As a coach, I wanted to use my sports knowledge and experience to create something that will contribute to the exercisers while raising their environmental awareness. Our goal is to inspire individuals to prioritize their own fitness as well as the well-being of our planet," explains Ćirić.
It takes two months to prepare the wood from the river for processing. After they collect it, it is dried and processed in a workshop in Belgrade, where exercise equipment is made. Nothing is thrown away, as the ground on which the gym is placed is made from the remains of wood produced during the construction of the equipment (mulch). In this way, by using wood from the river, the saving of natural wood resources is achieved, and environmental awareness of the importance of river cleaning is raised.
"This innovative idea shows how the principles of entrepreneurship and the circular economy can be combined to promote sustainable solutions in the field of sports. The Eco gym is not only to encourage physical activity but also to raise awareness of the importance of environmental protection and efficient use of resources. I invite all other innovators to apply to our Challenge Call for Proposals for innovative solutions for the green transition of the Serbian economy, which is open until the end of 2026," says Radovan Nikčević, Project Manager of the "EU for Green Agenda in Serbia".
Compared to the classic mechanical one, the Eco Gym offers greater opportunities for exercise with its combined equipment. It is intended for all ages, whether recreational or professional athletes because each of the devices has the possibility of adding a load of 50 kg. Also, each device has instructions on how to use it correctly. The authors of the Eco Gym plan to make creative playgrounds for children and parks for dogs from river wood in the same way.
The project "EU for Green Agenda in Serbia", with the technical and financial support of the European Union and in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, is implemented by UNDP in cooperation with the Embassy of Sweden and the European Investment Bank (EIB), with additional funding from the Governments of Sweden, Switzerland and Serbia.

Title: UNODC World Drug Report 2023 warns of converging crises as illicit drug markets continue to expand
Content: 26 June 2023
Vienna, 26 June 2023: Continued record illicit drug supply and increasingly agile trafficking networks are compounding intersecting global crises and challenging health services and law enforcement responses, according to the World Drug Report 2023 launched by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) today.
New data put the global estimate of people who inject drugs in 2021 at 13.2 million, 18 per cent higher than previously estimated. Globally, over 296 million people used drugs in 2021, an increase of 23 per cent over the previous decade. The number of people who suffer from drug use disorders, meanwhile, has skyrocketed to 39.5 million, a 45 per cent increase over 10 years.
The Report features a special chapter on drug trafficking and crimes that affect the environment in the Amazon Basin, as well as sections on clinical trials involving psychedelics and medical use of cannabis; drug use in humanitarian settings; innovations in drug treatment and other services; and drugs and conflict.
The World Drug Report 2023 also highlights how social and economic inequalities drive – and are driven by – drug challenges; the environmental devastation and human rights abuses caused by illicit drug economies; and the rising dominance of synthetic drugs.
The demand for treating drug-related disorders remains largely unmet, according to the report. Only one in five people suffering from drug-related disorders were in treatment for drug use in 2021, with widening disparities in access to treatment across regions.
Youth populations are the most vulnerable to using drugs and are also more severely affected by substance use disorder in several regions. In Africa, 70 per cent of people in treatment are under the age of 35.
Public health, prevention, and access to treatment services must be prioritized worldwide, the report argues, or drug challenges will leave more people behind. The report further underscores the need for law enforcement responses to keep pace with agile criminal business models and the proliferation of cheap synthetic drugs that are easy to bring to market.
Reacting to the findings of the report, UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly said “We are witnessing a continued rise in the number of people suffering from drug use disorders worldwide, while treatment is failing to reach all of those who need it. Meanwhile, we need to step up responses against drug trafficking rings that are exploiting conflicts and global crises to expand illicit drug cultivation and production, especially of synthetic drugs, fueling illicit markets and causing greater harm to people and communities.”
The right to health is not granted to many people who use drugs.
Large inequalities in access and availability of controlled drugs for medical use persist, particularly for pain management. The disparity is particularly prevalent between the global North and South and across urban and rural areas, making some people feel the negative impact of drugs more than others. Some 86 per cent of the world’s population live in countries with too little access to pharmaceutical opioids (as controlled under the 1961 Single Convention) – mainly low and middle-income countries.
Some impoverished and vulnerable populations, such as those in the tri-border area between Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, are trapped in rural areas with a high prevalence of drug-related crimes. Their remote locations make it exceedingly difficult for them to benefit from treatment services, resources, or the rule of law.
The drug economy in the Amazon Basin is exacerbating additional criminal activities – such as illegal logging, illegal mining, illegal land occupation, wildlife trafficking and more – damaging the environment of the world’s largest rainforest. Indigenous peoples and other minorities are suffering the consequences of this crime convergence, including displacement, mercury poisoning, and exposure to violence, among others. Environmental defenders are sometimes specifically targeted by traffickers and armed groups.
While the war in Ukraine has displaced traditional cocaine and heroin routes, there are signs that the conflict could trigger an expansion of the manufacture and trafficking of synthetic drugs, given the existing know-how and the large markets for synthetic drugs developing in the region.
In the Sahel, the illicit drug trade finances non-state armed and insurgency groups, while in Haiti, drug traffickers take advantage of porous borders to bolster their businesses, fueling the country’s multiplying crises.
While new research on the use of controlled drugs such as psychedelics to treat mental health conditions and substance use disorders shows promise, the report cautions that the fast pace of developments could jeopardize efforts to enact policies that place public health concerns over commercial interests. Without well-designed, adequately researched frameworks in place, there may be too little access for those who need treatment – potentially causing patients to turn to illegal markets – or conversely, the psychedelics may be diverted for non-medical use.
The cheap, easy, and fast production of synthetic drugs has radically transformed many illicit drug markets. Criminals producing methamphetamine – the world’s dominant illegally manufactured synthetic drug – are attempting to evade law enforcement and regulatory responses through new synthesis routes, bases of operation, and non-controlled precursors.
Fentanyl has drastically altered the opioid market in North America with dire consequences. In 2021, the majority of the approximately 90,000 opioid related overdose deaths in North America involved illegally manufactured fentanyls.
The 2023 opium harvest in Afghanistan may see a drastic drop following the national drug ban, as early reports suggest reductions in poppy cultivation. The benefits of a possible significant reduction in illicit opium cultivation in Afghanistan in 2023 would be global, but it will be at the expense of many farmers in the country who do not have alternative means of income generation. Afghanistan is also a major producer of methamphetamines in the region, and the drop in opiate cultivation could drive a shift towards synthetic drug manufacture, where different actors will benefit.

Title: Fair of Green Ideas, Projects and Innovations
Content: 05 June 2023
Marking the World Environment Day.
Belgrade, 5 June 2023 – Withing the European Green Week 2023, the Delegation of the European Union to Serbia, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with partners, marked the World Environment Day 2023. On this occasion, the “Fair of Green Ideas, Projects and Innovations” was held at the "Cvijeta Zuzorić" Art Pavilion in Kalemegdan. The Fair showcased the best so far supported and implemented projects and investments for the green transformation of the Serbian economy and society. The event also gathered representatives of the business and banking sector, relevant national institutions, civil society and academic community, embassies and international institutions.
„The purpose of the EU Green Agenda for the Western Balkans is to reduce fossil fuels dependency and move to renewable energy sources, preserve and better use natural resources, reduce environmental pollution, preserve nature and biodiversity, ensure rural development and sustainable food supply systems. I believe that by working together we can bring benefits to society. There is no planet B and certainly there is no time to stand still, particularly at these turbulent times. A lot of hard work is ahead of us: regulations, their implementation, investments, and dialogue as the key actions of the future. Greening the economy also means greening the mindset, and I am inviting citizens to get engaged and informed about the different events during the European Green Week, but also afterwards, because the world needs all of us to be actively engaged“, stated Ambassador and Head of the EU Delegation to Serbia, H.E. Emanuele Giaufret.
The Minister of Environmental protection Irena Vujović used this opportunity to invite units of local self-government which have developed their air quality plans or have achieved significant progress in planning air quality, to apply to the public call which will co-finance air protection measures by up to 50% of the total project value, in order to improve air quality in their units of local self-government.
„By organizing this Fair we wanted to gather all innovators who, with the support of the UNDP and our partners, are making an active contribution to the green transformation of Serbia, in order to inspire others to take the same track. Since they have been implemented in practice, these green solutions are already having positive impact on the environment and public health. At the same time, these companies and their products are becoming more competitive in the export markets, and thereby they contribute to sustainable economic growth and creating new green jobs“, stated Yakup Beris, UNDP Resident Representative in Serbia.
More than 40 authors of green solutions participated at the Fair, coming from the public and private sectors, civil society, research institutions and local self-governments. They answered questions asked by the visitors about the development of their green innovations, from concepts to successful projects which contribute to reducing GHG emissions, moving on to renewable energy sources, reuse of waste to produce new products, improving air quality and preserving biodiversity.
The Fair also featured three panel discussions, on topics which are key for implementing the EU Green Agenda for the Western Balkans in Serbia
The first panel, which was opened by H.E. Anika Ben David, the Ambassador of Sweden to Serbia, underlined the importance of harmonizing the environmental legal and policy framework in Serbia with the EU acquis, particularly in the context of Serbia’s accession to the EU.
The second panel, opened by the Swiss Ambassador to Serbia, H.E. Urs Schmid, underlined the relevance of encouraging the culture of innovations and applying modern technologies and sustainable practices to accelerate the green transition.
In view of the relevance of access to funding for the success of the green transformation, the third panel, for which the keynote speaker was Alessandro Bragonzi, Head of Regional Representation for Western Balkans at European Investment Bank (EIB), who presented different options for investments and financial mechanisms and models that can contribute to implementing green solutions in practice.
Bragonzi emphasized that EIB Global, a dedicated arm of EIB, is assisting Serbia to  make progress on its way to EU accession, including with respect to Chapter 15 on energy and Chapter 27 on environmental protection and climate change: „We are one of the key global financiers of climate and sustainability projects. In 2022, the share of EIR investments into these sectors grew to EUR 36.5 billion, which is 58% of our annual lending. It is out ambition with our Climate Action Plan to mobilise up to EUR 1 trillion in green investments by the end of this decade.“
He added that the involvement of the private sector is key to increasing green investments: „However, a survey conducted by the EIB, the EBRD and the World Bank shows that companies in the Western Balkans still lag behind in this respect compared to similar countries. Although 10% of companies are reporting losses suffered from extreme weather conditions, only 21% of companies invest in energy efficiency, while 59% do not see such investments as a priority. The survey showed that they need to enhance their environmental strategic priorities, enhance management involvement and access to funding. The project ’EU for Green Agenda in Serbia’ which we support together with the UNDP and other partners in Serbia is certainly the right way forward with respect to supporting green investments and the energy transition of the economies in the region“, said Bragonzi.
After the panels, commercial banks presented their offer of green financing, and in cooperation with the Serbian Chamber of Commerce, they organized B2B business meetings in order to forge new partnerships.
Along with the official program, an exhibition was staged in front of the „Cvijeta Zuzorić́“ Art Pavilion, in form of a fashion installation featuring dresses made of recycled jeans, by designer Ana Trošić Trajković, demonstrating how textile industry waste can be reused to produce new garments, instead of ending up on landfills. Visitors could exercise in the outdoor eco-gym, where exercise equipment is made of waste trees captured from the Sava river, and they could play a quiz and win prizes for correct answers about environmental protection. In addition, by entering the climate capsule of the Centre for the Promotion of Science the visitors could see scientific facts, art interventions and multimedia content and learn what is the future ahead of us if we do not respond adequately to climate change.
Within the marking of the World Environment Day, a photo exhibition was opened with photographs and descriptions of green ideas, projects and innovations along the Sava Promenade in Kalemegdan, which will last until 11 June.
This exhibition and the „Fair of Green ideas, Projects and Innovations“ were organized within the project “EU for the Green Agenda in Serbia”, implemented by the UNDP with the technical and financial support by the European Union and in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and cooperation with the Embassy of Sweden and the European Investment Bank (EIB), with additional funds provided by the governments of Sweden, Switzerland and Serbia.
This event was part of the European Green Week 2023, which is held between 3 to 11 June, with the focus on developing skills that we need to create sustainable, resilient and socially equitable communities. This week will demonstrate the overall support of the EU to the field of environmental protection in Serbia, as well as its cooperation with national and local partners.

Title: Serbia: UN expert alarmed by rise in hateful rhetoric after mass shootings
Content: 05 June 2023
GENEVA (5 June 2023) – Serbia must take immediate and effective measures against hateful and divisive rhetoric in public discourse which fuels violence in society, a UN expert* said after two mass shootings in Belgrade killed 17 people, including eight children, and led to mass protests earlier this month.
“The shootings have traumatised the entire country,” said Irene Khan, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression. “It is unconscionable to use this tragedy as yet another occasion to stir up hatred, demonising and vilifying independent media, human rights defenders, political opponents and others critical of the government.”
Khan noted that thousands of people took to the streets to demand accountability for the crimes committed, better arms control, and robust action against “hate speech” and incitement to hatred and violence in tabloid media.
“Rather than promoting justice and accountability, recent speeches – including by members of the Government – appear to have encouraged harassment and even physical attacks against opposition politicians, journalists and activists,” said Khan.
During her official visit to Serbia in April, Khan had expressed serious concerns about the tabloid press and populist media outlets promoting and amplifying toxic statements by politicians and public officials, and the failure of the media regulatory body to take action against the media.
“Freedom of expression is a fundamental right that must be protected at all times but international law is clear that it is not a license to harass, intimidate or threaten critical voices,” said Khan.
“The current climate of political discourse in Serbia is deeply disturbing. The Government of Serbia must immediately investigate and sanction intimidation, threats and incitement to violence, especially by government officials, and ensure that all institutions and organs of the State follow the United Nations guidelines on combating hate speech while upholding freedom of expression,” said Khan.
ENDS
*Ms. Irene Khan was appointed UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 17 July 2020. Ms. Khan is the first woman to hold this position since the establishment of the mandate in 1993. She teaches at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva and was previously Secretary General of Amnesty International from 2001 to 2009 and Director General of the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) from 2012 to 2019.
The Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures’ experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity.

Title: Network of Companies "For Refugees" Launched
Content: 01 June 2023
The network “For Refugees”, which gathers representatives of the private sector with the aim of providing support for the integration of refugees and improving their living conditions in Serbia, was presented today at the conference “The role of the private sector in the refugee integration “.
The initiative was launched by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in Serbia and IKEA Serbia, and membership in the network was signed by eight companies and business associations, among which are some of the largest employers in Serbia and key actors in the retail, tourism-catering and other industries, as well as sectors that provide capacity building and business consulting services.
Members of the network have the opportunity to support refugees in one or more ways: employment and internships, training, product and expert time donations, advocacy, as well as supporting projects that help forcibly displaced people.
“People who were forced to flee their countries and are starting their lives from scratch in Serbia deserve the support of the entire society. The private sector can make an important contribution to building a better life for refugees, but refugees can also support the private sector – with their skills, talents, diverse knowledge and experiences,” said Soufiane Adjali, UNHCR Representative to Serbia, adding:
“We are convinced that participation in the network we are launching can help not only refugees, but also member companies – to further improve operations, dedication to local communities, diversity and inclusion, as well as the achievement of sustainable development goals. We are immensely grateful to the partners from IKEA Serbia, as well as to the representatives of the private sector who became the first members of the network. We invite all socially responsible business actors to join our initiative and be there for refugees, one of the most vulnerable groups in society“.
To the greatest extent, refugees who received protection in Serbia come from Ukraine, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, as well as from Cuba. Both refugees and asylum seekers in our country have, among others, rights to education and employment.
“Employing refugees is necessary for long-term and successful integration. They want to work and build a new life for themselves and their families, and companies can play a significant role in enabling refugees to fully contribute to the community and local economy. The current narrative around refugees is often based on fear of the unknown, which is why, with the help of our partners from UNHCR, we want to change this perception. By launching the initiative “Acquiring the Skills for Employment” three years ago, we organized a series of activities aimed at the inclusion of refugees in the labor market and the opportunity for them to acquire skills and valuable work and life experience. Until now, through the project, we have organized a paid three-month internship for 28 people, out of whom we have employed 16 “, said Nikola Simonović, manager of this project at the IKEA company.
According to UNHCR data, in Serbia, the most urgent needs of refugees and asylum seekers are dignified employment (38 percent), medical services (25 percent), as well as more adequate or affordable housing (22 percent).
Clothing is the most urgent need for three percent of them, the same as food, banking services, equipment for starting a business, and a passport. More than a third of respondents stated that their quality of life had improved over the past year, while slightly more than half stated that it remained the same.
All companies interested in joining the “For Refugees” initiative can find out more information about the network and how to join on the official website of UNHCR in Serbia, www.unhcr.rs.
Refugees are people who have been forced to flee their countries due to conflict or persecution. According to the 1951 Refugee Convention, a refugee is a person who “due to a well-founded fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, membership of a certain social group or political opinions, is outside the country of origin and is unable or, due to such fear, is unwilling to be under the protection of that country”. For the first time in history, the number of people forced to flee last year exceeded 100 million on a global level.

Title: Ministry of Defence of Serbia Completes First Gender Coach Programme
Content: 26 May 2023
A high-level military official of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) of the Republic of Serbia successfully completed UNDP SEESAC’s the first Gender Coach Programme (GCP) launched in December 2022  to support senior leaders in strengthening their capacities for integrating the gender perspective into the defence sector. By completing the programme, the MoD of Serbia demonstrates its firm commitment to implement the recommendations of the recently launched Regional Baseline Study on Integrating a Gender Perspective in Military Education and Training.
The programme was implemented through six one-on-one monthly sessions encompassing a wide array of topics related to gender in the military. It covered the basic concepts of gender equality and gender-based discrimination with examples from the military context. The programme also enabled discussion about the data contained in regional knowledge tools developed by Ministries of Defence in the Western Balkans with support of SEESAC: the 2nd Regional Study on The Position of Women in the Armed Forces in the Western Balkans and the Regional Handbook for Combating Gender-Based Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, and Abuse as well as the findings of the Regional Youth Perception Survey on how to integrate the gender perspective in recruitment policies. Finally, the programme included information and examples on integrating gender in military education and training.
This tailored coaching programme builds on the results of a similar programme implemented in the Swedish Armed Forces since 2007 and the results and experience with the Gender Coaching Programme delivered by SEESAC in the Western Balkans. In the past three years, five high-level officials completed the basic Gender Coach Programme – one from Bosnia and Herzegovina, three from Montenegro and one from North Macedonia, while one official started with the advanced Gender Coach Programme in Montenegro.
High-ranking officials who successfully finish the programme are equipped to play a pivotal role in advancing gender equality within their ministry and armed forces through capacity development, relationship building, as well as increased knowledge and awareness of gender perspectives in the military.
This programme is organised within the scope of the second phase of SEESAC’s project financed by the Governments of Norway and the Slovak Republic Strengthening of Regional Cooperation on Gender Mainstreaming in Security Sector Reform in the Western Balkans, which provides support for mainstreaming gender in the security sector reform, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security.

Title: Mitigating the Impacts of Climate Change in Serbian Agriculture
Content: 23 May 2023

Agriculture remains one of the most affected sectors by climate change. Droughts, floods, hail, and changes in precipitation have a major impact on agricultural population and hamper rural and economic development. In Serbia, agriculture makes up 15 percent of total employment, thus investing in the sector's resilience is crucial for boosting incomes and ensuring food security.
What can be done to make agriculture more resilient to climate change?
To answer this question the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) brought together representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of Serbia, academia, advisory services, and farmers at this year’s agricultural fair in Novi Sad, to share their expertise and knowledge. Participants identified ten actions and steps that could be taken to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change and increase competitiveness of the sector:
1. Strengthening multisectoral cooperation
Through joint and coordinated work, competent ministries, local self-governments, academia, research institutions, farmers and advisory services can help develop comprehensive resilience strategies and find solutions for sustainable rural development and implementation of measures adapted to the local level, for strengthening agricultural resilience.
2. Incorporating practical training and education
Practical training and knowledge-sharing programs can equip students and farmers, but also decision-makers, with the necessary skills and techniques to adapt to climate change and implement sustainable practices on their farms.
3. Establishing appropriate support mechanisms
Developing tailored financial and technical support mechanisms on the local level, helps farmers access all the necessary resources and advisory services, which in turn enhances their capacity to cope with climate change.
4. Investing in climate smart agriculture
Allocating resources to support climate-smart agricultural practices, such as precision agriculture, agroecology and efficient technologies for irrigation and protection of crops from natural disasters, enables farmers to mitigate climate risks, increase productivity and reduce the negative impact on the environment.
5. Building resilient infrastructure
Maintaining existing and building new infrastructure, such as drainage and irrigation canals, hydroaccumulation, agricultural roads, can reduce the risks of natural disasters such as floods and drought.
6. Addressing soil degradation
Physical, chemical and biological soil degradation leads to a decrease in infiltration and retention of water and a decrease in soil fertility. Proper processing, adequate application of fertilizers and protection products, balanced irrigation regime, preserve the foundation of agriculture and ensure sustainable production and food safety.
7. Highlighting the importance of adequate production conditions
Recognizing the needs of plants and animals and providing advice on optimal growing conditions, including proper water management, access to quality production materials, and regular pest and disease control, enables farmers to maintain productivity despite the negative impact of climate change.
8. Providing support to farmers’ organizations
Strengthening farmers' organizations and empowering farmers to collectively adapt to climate change and enable easier access to information, better resource management and allocation, and create new market opportunities.
9. Introducing the issue of climate change into the legal framework
Integrating climate change considerations into agricultural policies, regulations, and legal frameworks ensures a systematic approach to address climate risks and provides a framework for sustainable agricultural practices.
10. Leading by example
Governments, institutions, and influential partners can set an example by implementing sustainable agricultural practices, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting climate resilience, inspiring others, and driving wider adoption of climate-friendly practices across the agricultural sector.

The panel discussion was organized as a part of the project “Strengthening disaster resilience in agriculture”, funded by the European Union and implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of Serbia.

Title: Bodyright Campaign Continues to Raise Awareness of Technology-Facilitated Gender Based Violence in Serbia
Content: 19 May 2023
Just like walking down the street in the real world, we need to be safe in the virtual world. Having your image taken, manipulated, and shared without permission violates privacy, dignity, and autonomy and can be a devastating experience.
Therefore, the UNFPA initiated the bodyright campaign to raise awareness about the widespread technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) and its consequences. It also urges decision-makers, tech companies, and all relevant stakeholders to improve the protection mechanisms and support systems.
Research shows TFGBV affects all countries worldwide and that 85% of women have experienced or witnessed online violence perpetrated against other women. In comparison, 57% of women have had their videos or images online abused or misused. Furthermore, the latest research in Serbia showed that more than 78% of young girls in Serbia do not feel safe in online space even though they spend at least 3 hours per day online. Also, more than 74% of girls that participated in the research said that they have never been a part of any awareness-raising campaign on technology-facilitated gender-based violence. This information indicates that youth in Serbia does not have sufficient information on forms of TFGBV, on ways they can protect themselves, and who can support them if they have to face it, even though many forms of TFGBV are still not formally recognized.
The bodyright campaign was launched in Serbia in November 2022. The same year, UNFPA in Serbia localized a youth-friendly and gender-sensitive glossary on TFGBV. The glossary in Serbian tries to resolve terminological inconsistencies.
As a continuation of the bodyright campaign, UNFPA and the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality implemented the first Training of Trainer program for peer-to-peer youth education for selected youth groups.
After the Training of Trainers, participants will be mentored to implement some form of peer-to-peer educational activity on TFGBV and protection mechanisms in up to 6 municipalities in Serbia.
During May 2023, the first local workshops on bodyright will be held in Vranje, Bujanovac, and Kragujevac.

Title: Progress in the implementation of the SALW Control Roadmap reviewed in the High Level Meeting
Content: 18 May 2023
The European Commission, in close cooperation with the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the European External Action Service, hosted a high-level meeting in Brussels on 16 May 2023 to discuss the implementation of specific actions of the EU action plan on firearms trafficking, including the Western Balkans SALW Control Roadmap.
The meeting gathered Ministers of Interior and representatives of Ministries of Foreign Affairs from the Western Balkans, representatives of EU member states, Moldova and Ukraine, and key international organisations, with the aim to review progress and discuss the way forward.
In the Western Balkans a number of firearms incidents involving victims is in decrease since 2019, but majority is still committed with illegal firearms. Since 2018, over 22,500 pieces of firearms were seized, over 136,000 voluntary surrendered and over 52,000 pieces of firearms destroyed. Progress was made in harmonisation of legislation with the EU acquis as well as in strengthening the capacities of authorities for detection and investigation of firearms related crimes. Progress in the implementation is closely monitored by SEESAC.
“We share a common objective - to increase the European security, to protect all of our citizens - be it here, in the European Union, and also, and I want to stress it, in our future Member States.”
Josep Borrell Fontelles, High Representative of the EU/Vice-President of the European Commission
“You have not made only your own homes safer, you have made the whole of Europe safer.”
Ylva Johansson, European Commissioner
“Worldwide, armed violence is still alarmingly prevalent. More human rights abuses are committed with small arms than with any other means. We have witnessed tragic events in the region recently, which resulted in the loss of 17 lives and left 21 injured, and these must serve as a grim reminder of the imperative to continue efforts in reducing the misuse and proliferation of firearms and in addressing the root causes of violence in our societies.”
Ivana Živković, UNDP Director of Regional Bureau for Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States

Title: UN Serbia and Chamber of Commerce and Industry Sign Declaration to Advance Sustainable Development in Serbia
Content: 11 May 2023
Belgrade, 11 May 2023 – The United Nations and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry today signed a Declaration of Intent to work together to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals in Serbia. The Declaration was signed by Francoise Jacob, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia, and Mihailo Vesovic, Director of the Chamber's Department for Strategic Analysis, Services and Internationalisation.
The two parties will work together in areas of mutual interest to encourage businesses to adopt responsible practices; advocate for policies that support sustainable economic development, social progress and environmental sustainability; build the capacity of businesses and other stakeholders to make the SDGs the foundation of their mission and business model; and leverage relationships with development banks and other international financial institutions to promote responsible investment for sustainable development.
Francoise Jacob, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia, said: "The private sector has a unique ability to drive innovation, mobilise resources and create jobs that can contribute to sustainable development. The private sector must also operate in a responsible and sustainable manner, taking into account the social and environmental impacts of its actions. We are pleased to establish this partnership with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia and look forward to addressing the complex challenges of sustainability together. This include sharing knowledge, expertise and resources to develop innovative solutions that benefit both the private sector and society as a whole".
Mihailo Vesovic, Director of Division of Strategic Analysis, Services and Internationalization of the Chamber of Commerce, said: "The Sustainable Development Goals are about reducing poverty and improving economic growth, and the private sector is the key driver in achieving these goals. Today, we sign this cooperation agreement with the intention of jointly promoting and working towards sustainable economic growth and development. In the coming period, we will focus our activities on assisting companies to improve their competitiveness, on innovative and "green" solutions, on promoting sustainable production and ethical values, and on creating a business environment that is conducive to the activities of both local companies and foreign investors, while ensuring solidarity with those who need help the most”.
The signing of the Declaration of Intent marks an important milestone in the cooperation between the United Nations and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia, and will serve as a platform for future cooperation in support of the SDGs. The Declaration of Intent is a testament to the commitment of the two organisations to work together to promote sustainable development in Serbia and contribute to the global efforts to achieve the SDGs.

Title: Here Is What You Should Know About Firearms Surrender in Serbia
Content: 09 May 2023
Updated on 22/05/2023
Following two mass shootings that occurred in Serbia last week, the Minister of Interior issued an order on surrender of unregistered weapons and ammunition.
Almost 33.500 pieces of firearms, over 1.319.000 bullets, and 6.333 explosive devices were surrendered within the thirteen days of the voluntary firearms surrender action, according to the Ministry of Interior.
People who possess firearms without the proper documentation can hand them over to the authorities without suffering legal consequences and free of charge. If they wish, people can surrender their legal weapons, too.
This action will take place until 8 June 2023, until when the citizens can hand their firearms out in each police station from 07:00 until 19:00 daily.
Apart from personally surrendering firearms, citizens can contact the closest police station and invite police officers to collect firearms and explosive devices from the invited address.
The citizens are not obliged to show identification when handing over the firearms.
Since it is very dangerous for explosive devices to be inadequately transported, for example by public transportation, citizens who possess any explosive devices in their apartments, houses or other premises are warned not to bring such devices personally to police stations, but to call 192 so that experts can take them over.
The order aims to reduce the number of illegal firearms in the country and improve public safety.
The campaign is supported through the Support for Enhancing the Fight Against the Illegal Possession, Misuse, and Trafficking of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in the Western Balkans project, funded by the European Union through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II).

Title: From Pepper Waste to Beauty Products
Content: 02 May 2023
28 April 2023, Medveđa – What is the connection between ajvar (pepper spread) and cosmetics, and how pepper waste could be used to make soap or facial mask were among the things learned by all those attending today’s workshop organised by the "Zavičaj u tegli" (Home in a jar) enterprise and the "Bio Ideas for Sustainable Development" association, held in the village of Gazdare.
This free of charge training was organised with the support of the "EU for Green Agenda in Serbia" project and the Municipality of Medveđa, with a wish to emphasise, in this area where growing pepper for the production of ajvar is the predominant activity, the importance of decreasing the amount of bio-waste in protecting the environment, as well as for economic empowerment and promoting quality of life for women in rural areas and underdeveloped parts of Serbia.
"The production of 1 kg of ajvar results in generating 1 kg of pepper waste. Our idea is to reuse this waste and thus prevent it from reaching landfills. Simultaneously, we enable local women entrepreneurs and farms to generate additional income from this new product," said Jelena Miletić, founder of the "Zavičaj u tegli" company.
Ana Mitić Radulović, coordinator of the project in the field of circular economy within the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) says that this manner of reusing biological waste is inventive and highly useful, as all the waste generated in producing ajvar is recycled, and adds: "On top of that, social and women’s entrepreneurship is thus developed, and a network of mutually connected actors oriented towards one another is created, which is all in line with the principles of circular economy and sustainability."
Participants of the workshop were acquainted, theoretically and in practise, with the entire process of producing cosmetics out of pepper waste, from collecting and drying, thus getting the new raw material, to making natural soap and facial masks.
"This activity is highly interesting and nice and it means so much to me as it enables me to make money in the period when there is not much else to do. Since we live in villages, in the winter and during other periods when there is no other work to be done, this additional income is very welcome. The women I work with belong to the category of hardly employable. These are women who have lost their jobs and now have problems in finding another job, or whose pensions are really low. We here socialise, and it is great, in addition to this social component, to be able to do something useful and get income that would help our families," said Dragana Stojković from the village of Gazdare, who has been cooperating with the "Zavičaj u tegli" company for three years now.
The workshop organised in the village of Gazdare is one of the activities within the project entitled "Industrial Symbiosis – an Innovative Strategy in Sustainability of Women Social Entrepreneurs’ Operation", that were awarded, in addition to 15 innovative green transition solutions, within the "EU for Green Agenda in Serbia" initiative. This initiative is implemented by the United Nations Development Programme, with technical and financial support by the European Union, in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and in cooperation with the Embassy of Sweden and the European Investment Bank (EIB), where additional funding has been provided by the governments of Sweden, Switzerland and Serbia.

Title: Girls Harnessing Digital Skills to Become Innovators in the Tech World
Content: 28 April 2023
International Girls in ICT Day Marked
Belgrade, 28 April 2023 – On the occasion of the International Girls in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Day, United Nations Development Programme, in partnership with the Ministry of Education and in cooperation with the Petlja Foundation, organised educational workshops and lectures for female students of high schools and universities.

The aim of this daily programme, which was held on the premises of the Makers Space of the Centre for the Promotion of Science, was to stimulate girls and young women to explore different opportunities offered by information and communications technology and acquire new digital skills in order to continue with their education and further develop their careers in ICT.
"This is just one of many opportunities to remind us of the importance of strengthening girls and young women to engage with and participate in ICT, since information technologies are a part of our lives, as you are very well aware of. Even children in kindergarten use information technologies today. Younger generations possess more digital literacy than their elders, and we therefore work simultaneously on the development of your digital competences, but also on those of your teachers. According to statistics, Serbia is a country with a significantly larger representation of women and girls, not only in ICT, but also in other areas of STEM, when compared to the global average but also the European average, which is good, but does not mean that we do not have to continue with our efforts and further support women and girls in joining these fields," said Assistant to the Minister of Education for International Cooperation and European Integrations, Aleksandar Jović.
"Due to the swift technological development, we witness the birth of many new professions that did not exist just ten or twenty years ago, yet they are in great demand today. Digital skills are necessary for everyone, regardless of their future professions. We therefore wish to motivate and support as many girls as possible to acquire new skills in ICT, which would help them in their further education, as well as in selecting their future professions and advancing their careers," said Jelena Ružičić, UNDP Portfolio Manager for Digital Innovations.
Around 20 girls attending the Ninth Grammar School "Mihailo Petrović Alas", Sixth Belgrade Grammar School and IT Grammar School had the opportunity to attend the workshop titled "Creative Coding: When Technology Draws", facilitated by Aleksandra Jovanić, assistant professor at the Faculty of Fine Arts, and on this occasion become aware of the connections between algorithms and art, as well as encode their own works of digital art. Also, 25 young women studying faculties of natural sciences and mathematics, social sciences and humanities and technical and technological sciences, attended the lecture by Srđan Verbić, professor at the FEFA Faculty, entitled "Visual Disentanglement of Data", thereby learning more about the ways in which data are used in decision-making in today’s society, as well as why the manner in which data are presented is highly important for their understanding.
The International Girls in ICT Day is marked each fourth Thursday in April, and this year’s slogan has been "Digital Skills for Life". The message conveyed by the slogan is that girls and women need new skills to become not only users, but also creators in the digital world.
The event was organised within the project entitled "Building Key Computer Competences – Towards the Workforce of the Future", implemented by UNDP in partnership with the Ministry of Education, and with the support by the Government of the Republic of Serbia.

Title: Great Interest of Serbian Innovators for Green Transition
Content: 24 April 2023
Belgrade, 24 April 2023 – More than 160 public and privately owned enterprises, research institutions, civil society organisations, associations and local self-governments have submitted their business solutions for the Challenge for Innovative Solutions for the Green Transition of Serbian Economy, launched in February this year within the “EU for the Green Agenda in Serbia” project. This call for proposals which will stay open until the end of 2026, has the aim of supporting innovative solutions in all five key areas in the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans.
Innovative business solutions have been proposed in the fields of decarbonisation (decreased dependency on fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy sources), circular economy (preservation and more efficient use of natural resources), environmental and air pollution reduction, protection and conservation of nature and biodiversity and development of rural and sustainable food supply systems.
For all the candidates that fulfilled conditions contained in the call for proposals and passed the first round of the selection process, an Info-Day has been organised where they would receive additional information pertaining to future steps in applying for mentoring and technical support in further development of the proposed project ideas. The solutions which turn out to have the greatest potential of achieving ecological, economic and social benefits, would also be provided co-funding schemes to support their implementation in practice. It is expected that the selected proposals would contribute to the implementation of the Green Agenda and facilitate fulfilment of the obligations and aims in the process of Serbia’s accession to the European Union.
The great turnout that the call has attracted is a result of joint efforts by the domestic and international partners in stimulating innovation and accelerating the green transition of Serbian economy and society.
This Challenge for Innovative Solutions Call for Proposals has been published within the project “EU for the Green Agenda in Serbia”, implemented by the United Nations Development Programme with the technical and financial support by the European Union and in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and cooperation with the Embassy of Sweden and the European Investment Bank (EIB), with additional funds provided by the governments of Sweden, Switzerland and Serbia.

Title: UNFPA report identifies rising population anxiety, urges radical rethink of how countries address changing demographics
Content: 19 April 2023
New data reveals population anxieties are widespread and governments are increasingly adopting policies aimed at raising, lowering or maintaining fertility rates. But efforts to influence fertility rates are very often ineffective and can erode women’s rights, according to UNFPA's State of World Population report, released today.
The landmark report “8 Billion Lives, Infinite Possibilities: the case for rights and choices” calls for a radical rethink of how population numbers are framed – urging politicians and media to abandon overblown narratives about population booms and busts. Instead of asking how fast people are reproducing, leaders should ask whether individuals, especially women, are able to freely make their own reproductive choices – a question whose answer, too often, is no.
“Women’s bodies should not be held captive to population targets,” says UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. “To build thriving and inclusive societies, regardless of population size, we must radically rethink how we talk about and plan for population change.”
A staggering 44 per cent of partnered women and girls in 68 reporting countries do not have the right to make informed decisions about their bodies when it comes to having sex, using contraception and seeking health care, and an estimated 257 million women worldwide have an unmet need for safe, reliable contraception.
History has shown that fertility policies designed to increase or lower birth rates are very often ineffective and can undermine women’s rights. Many countries have rolled out programmes to engineer larger families by offering financial incentives and rewards to women and their partners, yet they continue to see birth rates below two children per woman. And efforts to slow population growth through forced sterilization and coercive contraception have grossly violated human rights.
Family planning must not be used as a tool for achieving fertility targets; it is a tool for empowering individuals. Women should be able to choose if, when and how many children they would like to have, free from the coercion of pundits and officials.
“The alarmism that dominates public discourses on fertility rates poses real risks: It threatens to distract us from finding constructive solutions to serious but solvable problems. And it risks becoming a rationale for denying the rights and bodily autonomy of women and girls,” said Florence Bauer, Director of UNFPA’s Regional Office for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
The report strongly recommends governments institute policies with gender equality and rights at their heart, such as parental leave programmes, child tax credits, policies that promote gender equality in the workplace, and universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. These offer a proven formula that will reap economic dividends and lead to resilient societies able to thrive no matter how populations change.
Key Facts and Figures from the 2023 State of World Population:
1. Twenty-four per cent of partnered women and girls are unable to say no to sex and 11 per cent are unable to make decisions specifically about contraception, according to data from 68 reporting countries.
2. A survey of eight countries showed people who had been exposed to media or conversations about the world’s population were more likely to view the global population as being too high.
3. Global demographics are changing rapidly: Two thirds of people are living in low fertility contexts, while eight countries will account for half the projected growth in global population by 2050 (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania), dramatically reordering the world’s ranking of most populous countries.
4. Blaming fertility for climate change will not hold the greatest carbon emitters to account. Out of 8 billion people, around 5.5 billion do not make enough money, about $10 a day, to contribute significantly to carbon emissions.
5. A recent UN study says greater gender parity in the labour force would do more to sustain economies in ageing, low-fertility societies than setting targets for women to have more children.

Title: Serbia: UN expert calls for political will to translate laws into concrete action to protect freedom of expression
Content: 06 April 2023
BELGRADE/GENEVA (6 April 2023) – Serbia must ensure that legal reforms are accompanied by effective implementation of laws and political will to combat dangerous rhetoric against minorities, journalists and activists, said Irene Khan, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression.
“I am encouraged by the government’s plans to reform media laws in line with international standards but also alarmed by the toxic public discourse, from politicians or public officials and amplified by tabloids, scapegoating the media, human rights defenders, ethnic minorities, LGBTI and those critical of the government,” Khan said at the end of her official visit.
“When journalists are labelled as foreign agents, traitors or enemies of the State, it undermines public trust in the media, increases the likelihood of attacks against journalists and chills media freedom and democratic debate.”
“Freedom of expression is not a license to harass, intimidate or threaten critical voices,” the UN expert said. “I urge the government to ensure that all institutions and organs of the State implement the constitutional and legal framework upholding freedom of expression while combating hate speech and disinformation.”
“Given the role that tabloids play in spreading hate speech, I am concerned that the electronic media regulatory body (REM) is failing to take appropriate action against the violators, failing to promote pluralism in media content, and allowing smear campaigns and harassment to continue.”
“Serbia must ensure that REM is independent, effective and accountable,” the expert said.
In order to ensure the safety of journalists, the expert urged the authorities to take measures to speed up investigations and legal proceedings related to threats and attacks.
“I call on the authorities to investigate and prosecute the longstanding cases of the journalists killed in Serbia. Killing journalists is the most egregious form of censorship. Impunity must not prevail.”
Finally, she stressed that the adoption of laws alone was not sufficient to protect freedom of expression. “What is needed is strong, unequivocal political leadership from the commitment to international standards. The legal commitments of the government must be translated into action.”
During her visit, Khan also travelled to Kosovo.*
Welcoming the pluralistic media landscape in Kosovo, she encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen media freedom. “I urge the authorities to fully implement the law on languages and call on the international community to ensure adequate support to independent Serbian language media,” she said.
The UN expert called on the authorities in Kosovo to complete the investigation of past killings and enforced disappearances of journalists and ensure justice.

Title: Newly Equipped Development Counselling Unit Brings Hope to Families of Children with Developmental Disabilities in Kraljevo
Content: 05 April 2023

Kraljevo, 5 April 2023 - As part of the cooperation between UNICEF and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Serbia, the newly equipped Development Counselling Unit was officially opened in the Primary Health Centre in Kraljevo. The goal is to enable timely support for children with disabilities and difficulties and their families through the work of an intersectoral team for family-oriented early interventions.
“Our first contact was unbelievable because for the first time I encountered unexpected support and, above all, understanding. After we completed our interview, and our transformation began, my family's life changed dramatically. Home visits were of great importance, as well as other activities, which I carried out according to the planned programme. I was at the end of my strength, but family-oriented early interventions are the best thing that can be provided to families facing similar problems,” believes Sandra Pesic, mother of a child who was involved in the PORI program.
According to experts' estimates, around 60,000 children under the age of 6 in Serbia need early intervention services, and it has been proven that if they are recognized in time, developmental difficulties can be overcome before starting school in as many as 70 percent of children.
“The national programme for the improvement of early childhood development foresees that in every district there is at least one development counselling unit that provides support to families of children with difficulties and developmental disabilities up to the age of 6, in their own space and through mobile teams and tele-counselling. In previous years, in cooperation with UNICEF, we managed to improve the capacities of health centres and development counselling units in 15 out of 25 districts in Serbia, in a total of 19 municipalities. Kraljevo is one of them and I congratulate them on the results achieved. We will continue to work together on the expansion of this network of counselling units, providing legislative and financial support for their sustainability and quality, and on increasing personnel capacity, so that services are available to every child and family that needs support,” said Dr Jelena Jankovic, Assistant Minister of Health for the Sector of Public Health and Programme Health Care.
The family-oriented model of support takes place primarily through work in the field and home visits in the family and in preschool, that is, in the peer community, as the most natural environment for the child in which he or she learns best and progresses in development.
“Early intervention connects systems and experts from health, education and social welfare sectors, respecting the strengths and needs of parents. It also provides the necessary and intensive support to the child and family. To achieve these goals, well-equipped, modern, and sustainable services and competent professionals are necessary. Our goal is to, together with relevant ministries and partners, create conditions that will enable the services provided by developmental counselling units and early intervention teams to reach every child with developmental disabilities and their parents in Serbia, in all 25 districts in our country,” said Dr Jelena Zajeganovic Jakovljevic, UNICEF Serbia’s Health and Early Childhood Development Specialist.
The new development counselling unit is equipped with furniture, digital equipment, and didactic materials, which enables high-quality work with young children and their families. It is planned that the development counselling unit in Kraljevo will grow into a regional centre for supporting children and families from Kraljevo, Vrnjacka Banja and Raska.
“We believed that the most modern and effective approaches in working with children with developmental difficulties and disabilities, the so-called PORI services, should be brought closer to children and parents who need them and made available where they live, grow, play and learn with their peers - in their home, preschool, and local community. We combined resources and experts from the health centre, preschool and centre for social work to include as many children and families as possible and to respond to as many of their needs as possible with a uniform team approach,” stated Dr Mirjana Krcevinac, Acting Director of the Kraljevo Primary Health Centre.
In addition to UNICEF Serbia, the Ministry of Health, and the City of Kraljevo, the development counselling unit has also been equipped thanks to the support of the private sector. As many as 30 companies from Kraljevo and its surroundings provided financial support and donated funds to UNICEF so that the development counselling unit could be equipped in accordance with the most modern standards. In addition to companies from the local community, the furnishing of the development counselling unit was also supported by H&M.
“Virdzinija d.o.o. is a family company that has been dedicated for years to improving the quality of life of its employees and their families, as well as the entire local community. We firmly believe that the principle of helping the community in which we operate is one of the most important business principles, while humanity and caring for the most vulnerable are key to coping with everyday difficulties together. We live in times of great crises and challenges when sustainable business is the most important thing. And there is no sustainability if we forget that children also have rights and that we, as businesspeople, are also responsible for helping them realize their rights. We gladly accepted UNICEF's invitation and decided to participate in the implementation of such an important project. The opening of the development counselling unit in Kraljevo, which will support children with developmental disabilities, shows how solidarity can change the course of one's destiny. We are very pleased that, together with other companies from Kraljevo and the surrounding area, we have united, through cooperation with UNICEF, to ensure that children and families from our region receive necessary support. The Virdzinija d.o.o. company continues to spread the culture of solidarity and remains committed to the creation and development of a healthy and strong community so that the entire society can grow and prosper,” said Aleksandar Trifunovic, owner of the company Virdzinija d.o.o. from Kraljevo.
UNICEF and the Ministry of Health, together with the Ministries of Education, Social Protection, Family Care and Demography, have so far supported the implementation of family-oriented early intervention services in 19 cities and municipalities in Serbia. More than 500 professionals from health and social protection systems and preschool institutions were trained, of which 120 are involved in direct work with families. More than 3,000 children and their families received support in the previous year, of which more than 240 were included in intensive family-oriented early intervention services. All these centres received digital equipment, some assistive technologies, and didactic materials.
Through the campaign Dad, Mom, we are with you!, UNICEF raised 12 million dinars thanks to donations from citizens and companies, of which more than 2 million dinars were invested in equipping the development counselling unit, preschool and centre for social work and training of the PORI team in Kraljevo.

Title: The Power of Small Associations in Big Health Battles
Content: 28 March 2023
In 2015, melanoma of the skin was the 11th most common malignant tumour affecting women and men in Serbia, while one in eight women in Serbia will develop breast cancer during their lifetime. In both cases, if detected at an early stage, the tumour is almost completely curable. Because of the need for facilitation of preventive care for patients, non-governmental organizations Jedna uz drugu, Kolibri za porodice and Omladina Jazas Novi Sad started their initiatives. These organizations help women at risk of breast cancer, people with HIV and young people to get the necessary services, knowledge and skills so that they can protect their health in the best possible way. The importance of these initiatives was also recognized by the Regional Programme on Local Democracy in the Western Balkans 2 (ReLOaD2), financed by the European Union and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
"Women rarely want to talk about their painful experience. It's seen as shameful," says Ruža from Hajdukovo, a village near Subotica, who beat breast cancer nine years ago. However, Ruža bravely shared her experiences from day one with the intent to help other women. "I still told everyone about it, but outside of my family and close friends, I didn't get much support."
In the villages around Subotica, the associations Jedna uz drugu and Kolibri za porodice noticed this phenomenon and decided to educate their fellow citizens about the importance of open conversation and mutual support in the prevention of breast cancer. Thanks to their workshops, held in Serbian and Hungarian, over the last few months, more than 150 women and four men received valuable advice.
"We noticed that in rural areas there is less conversation about this, that there are certain social barriers. With these workshops, we wanted to break the taboo. It is a process and we have started it, but there is still a lot of work ahead of us. We cannot prevent breast cancer, that is not our mission. But we can train women to take care of themselves and see a doctor on time, because if they do that, breast cancer is more likely curable," says Nora Gajda, from the Kolibri za porodice association.
These workshops were held from November to February in four villages around Subotica: Hajdukovo, Kelebija, Čantavir and Bajmok. They were intended for both patients and their family members, as well as for everyone who is interested in learning about ways to prevent this disease. Participants learned from experts about ways to prevent malignant diseases, about healthy lifestyles, nutrition, risk factors, as well as how to properly perform breast self-examination.
Edina Huber is a young mother from Kelebija who participated in the workshop. "I didn't have any health problems, but I thought this would be useful and it was. I also invited many women to join and most of them responded, mainly young mothers. During the workshop, we learned to make healthy sweets, which encouraged me to reduce my sugar intake. I also learned to do a proper self-examination, as well as exercises that we should do regularly, and I plan to incorporate that into my everyday life as well".
Ruža from Hajdukovo, from the beginning of the story, pointed out another important advantage of the workshops. "I am very sorry that nine years ago I didn’t have the information that I needed, since the doctor's advice was quite limited In addition to the advice and knowledge you gain, which is certainly important, there is another important thing, and that is support. These are big changes for a woman. My family gave me support, but there wasn't much outside of the family. I had a doctor and medicine, but I always wondered - where is the help for the soul. That support, mutual conversations and exchange of experiences, the optimism you get from women who have gone through this agony or are going through it side by side with you - that's what I didn't have nine years ago."
It was around this idea of mutual support and making it easier to go through the process after breast cancer is discovered that the associations Jedna uz drugu and Kolibri za porodice were founded. Nora notes that both organizations rely on the cooperation of women who came together. "We serve as a bridge that connects a woman or a family in need, with an institution or any other support or help that she needs. To tell her what is the easiest way to get to a doctor, to empower her or give her the support from another woman who went through it all. Our task is to also fill in the gap in the organised support. These associations also conducted a survey for women to find out what kind of support they need. The survey singled out the need for psychological workshops, because not all women cope with the fact that they have breast cancer in the same way. That is why the plan for the future is to organise psychological workshops, not only for sick women, but also for family members and all those who have a sick person in their life, so that they can understand easier what they are facing and be able to support them better.
One hundred kilometres south of Subotica, in Novi Sad, the Omladina Jazas Novi Sad association carries out a different but equally noble mission every Saturday afternoon. Their goal is to contribute to the early detection of melanoma and other forms of skin cancer through preventive examinations. Everyone who is interested, including people who are HIV positive, has the opportunity to undergo professional skin screening in an informal atmosphere at the skin consultation centre, as part of the "What does my skin tell me" initiative.
"I saw a post on Facebook, so I came to check my moles, which I have a lot of, and make sure everything is okay. Honestly, I didn't go to the doctor because it's not easy to make an appointment and the waitlists are long. This screening turned out to be a great opportunity, it's Saturday afternoon, we're free, and here we do everything we need to quickly. I shared the post with my friends, and one of them came here with her son. I think there should be other preventive health check-ups like this," says Jelica, a user who got screened at the skin clinic.
Milana, Marko and Miloš from the association Omladina Jazas Novi Sad started this initiative due to the increase in cases of skin cancer, which, when detected in the initial stage, are almost 100% curable. "Young people are not educated enough, and sometimes they feel uncomfortable to go to a skin examination because of acne or some other skin problems. This is especially notable with people who are HIV-positive and already do not trust the health system", explains Miloš Nišavić, a specialist in dermatovenerology who performs the screenings, and adds that it is especially important to examine them because certain skin problems can indicate HIV infection. "It is sometimes difficult for them to find a doctor that would treat them continuously because stigma among health workers still exists. While carrying out these examinations, we realized that there are a lot of people who are interested so we don't turn down anyone, everyone is welcome".
"I came to get the screening because I don't know what is and what is not harmful to the skin , and I take good care of my health. My conclusion is that the aesthetics of the skin is often more important to young people than the function, which is why we have cases of excessive exposure to the sun. I think it's important that we all know the consequences and take care of our health, which should be a priority," says Damjan, a user of this service.
The screening is designed so that patients first express their observations about pigment changes on the skin through a questionnaire, and then get a detailed examination from a dermatologist who advises them on wearing sun protection and doing skin self-examinations. During the examination, they can stay as long as they want and have the freedom to ask anything about the condition of the skin.
"This is, in a way, a space between state health institutions and the patient. In order to have a regular skin examination, a young person must go to a selected general practitioner, who will then assess whether they will be referred to a dermatologist, and make an appointment, that the patient has to wait for. . We skip that step. Patients can do a screening here if they have any doubts and want to consult. If there is nothing suspicious, the patient will not schedule an appointment with a dermatologist in a state health institution, and this way we achieve a double benefit - the patients received a service and cleared their doubts, and the health system is relieved. It is a kind of decentralization of health services. Let's not forget the patients who get examined in private institutions, so the financial aspect also plays a role in everything," says Dr. Marko Davidović.
In addition to screening, this organization also educates on sun protection and skin self-examination as part of the same initiative, as well as organise workshops that help young people develop life skills and strengthen self-confidence in order to face problems or discrimination due to their appearance.
"Young people receive a lot of information that they sometimes apply immediately without thinking. Our goal is to educate them properly and teach them to to think critically about skin protection, because they will one day pass on this knowledge and will not overexpose their children to the sun," adds Milana Božulić, youth worker and president of the organization.
The initiatives "Healthy mother - healthy family" and "What my skin tells me" received support for implementation within the Regional Programme on Local Democracy in the Western Balkans 2 (ReLOaD2), financed by the European Union and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). . These activities contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, especially Goal 3 - Good health.

Title: Kragujevac Embraces "Leave No One Behind" Tool - UN Resident Coordinator and UN Human Rights Team Partner to Enhance Inclusion and Human Rights Understanding at Local Level in Serbia
Content: 24 March 2023
Kragujevac, 24 March 2023 – To ensure the advancement and protection of human rights at the local level in Serbia, UN Resident Coordinator and UN Human Rights Team partnered with the Ministry for Human and Minority Rights and Social Dialogue and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize an event centered around the Human Rights 75 Initiative and the Leave No One Behind Tool in the city of Kragujevac.
The tool was presented to local self-governments representatives, members of parliament of the Šumadija administrative district, decision-makers and students, to enhance their understanding and knowledge of the human rights and LNOB Tool and the associated pledge to leave no one behind.
„The Government of the Republic of Serbia is committed to building a just society that proposes good laws and policies aimed at all segments in the complex structure of our society. Especially for vulnerable, invisible, and sensitive groups, because a just state should build such measures and policies that will create a society in which no one is left behind”, said Minister for Human and Minority Rights and Social Dialogue, Tomislav Žigmanov.
“International community and UN that have established the platform for sustainable development with the key principle ‘Leave No One Behind’ are aware of this and Serbia is the first country in the world that had ratified this toll that we will present to communities outside of Belgrade, to see how local self-governements can build policies, take measures for groups that have additional needs and that are often left behind in wider policies,” explained Žigmanov.
“Within the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development, implemented by the United Nations, ad new ‘Leave No One Behind’ tool has been developed, with the aim to fulfil the needs of all and especially to involve vulnerable groups that are in need of assistance and support”, highlighted Francoise Jacob, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia.
Jacob also reminded that this year UN marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was agreed upon by politicians and intellectuals in 1948, and is the most important document defining human rights, translated to 500 languages.
“This year, we want have visits and discussions with politicians, communities, students and point out to everyone the essence of the Declaration - which is the importance of the existence of human rights. We want to activate all political actors and all other members of the community develop awareness that human rights are always important, regardless of the year when the Declaration was adopted, and should be fought for every day because this fight is permanent”, she added.
The event was attended by more than 40 members of the local parliament and approximately 50 professors and students from the Faculty of Law. This initiative generated considerable interest among the participants for its further application. It is noteworthy that the organizers have planned to conduct similar events in several other universities and local self-governments throughout the current year.

Title: First Fair for Gifted Children and Youth in Šabac
Content: 21 March 2023
To mark the International Day of Gifted Pupils, March 21, the City of Šabac organised the first Fair for Gifted Children and Youth that gathered all 20 primary and secondary schools from the territory of the city along with four institutions and organisations engaged in education. The manifestation was organised within the project "Science Centre - Factory of Ideas for the 21st Century" funded by the European Union in cooperation with the Ministry of European Integration through the EU PRO Plus programme.
"We are sending a great image from the City and the Fair for Gifted Children and Youth which we, thanks to the support of the European Union, have organised with our partners, the preschool institution "Naše dete", the Centre for Professional Development, the Educational Association "Sunce" and the Association of Teachers. We are jointly implementing a project that involves the establishment of a Science Centre for talented children in order to provide them conditions to develop, and receive the support required to achieve top results", said the Mayor of Šabac Aleksandar Pajić.
As the Mayor added, the City allocates substantial funds in the education sector and support to educational institutions, because education is a pillar of development of society and investing in knowledge pays the best interest.
With the European Union grant in the amount of almost 180,000 Euros and a significant co-funding of the City of Šabac of around 280,000 Euros, the building of the Science Centre will be completely reconstructed with equipped cabinets for physics, biology and chemistry, multimedia classrooms, internet cafes, as well as 14 three-bed rooms for accommodation of children from all over Serbia, who will be able to attend thematic programmes for talented children. The Fair is one of the activities that the City of Šabac organised as part of the project in order to contribute to its sustainability.
"Today's Fair for Gifted Children and Youth, where all our educational institutions and organisations are present, is a kind of talent show of all our gifted young people. We want to draw the attention of the public and bring this topic into the light so that young, talented and creative people get full support for the development of their capacities and talents", said Ana Marinković, Head of the Department of Social Activities of the City of Šabac.
As Dragana Novaković, Infrastructure Sector Manager in the EU PRO Plus programme said the "Science Centre - Factory of Ideas for the 21st Century" is recognised and supported as a project through which the City of Šabac plans to provide organised, systemic and long-term support to gifted children and all project activities, including today's fair, serve to encourage the development of the most gifted youth.
"The EU does not see its interventions in infrastructure through the EU PRO Plus programme as just an investment in "cement and bricks". In the selection of projects, the focus is always on the overall wellbeing of the society through enabling better access to social services for the local population. In this case, in Šabac, it is an investment in the youngest, in developing their skills and knowledge, but also their readiness to step into the world of adults and make it better for their fellow citizens", said Dragana Novaković.

Title: Family’s support encourages women to report violence
Content: 16 March 2023
Results of the research on the causes of insufficient reporting of domestic violence presented.
Belgrade, March 16, 2023 – Fear of the perpetrator, shame due to the experienced violence, fear of condemnation from those close to them, an unfavorable economic situation and distrust in institutions are the main reasons why women do not report domestic violence. What would encourage women to report violence is support from family and friends, institutions, as well as financial support. These are the findings of the research "Why do women not report domestic violence?", presented today by the institution of the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
"The results of this research make it clear where the visible, but also invisible obstacles are. Women in Serbia predominantly do not justify domestic violence, but they believe that the problem of violence should first be solved within the family. That is why we as a society must create an environment in which being a survivor of violence does not imply stigma, condemnation or revictimization, but involves the support of everyone, from the closest family members to society as a whole", said Brankica Janković, Commissioner for the Protection of Equality.
"We must not allow women who have survived violence to remain without adequate economic and psychosocial support, which is why all institutions from the system of protection against violence must have a greater degree of cooperation and make additional efforts so that the citizens of Serbia gain greater trust in them", added Janković.
"For the effective prevention of gender-based and domestic violence, timely recognition, detection and reporting of violence are crucial. That is why, from the very beginning of the implementation of the Law on Prevention of Domestic Violence, the Ministry of Justice placed great emphasis on education and specialized training, attended by over a thousand participants - representatives of the judiciary, but also of other institutions responsible for the prevention of violence”, said the Minister of Justice Maja Popović.
Over 70% of women who lost their lives in partner and domestic violence had previously never reported it to institutions. The results of this research show us that the responsibility for reporting violence cannot lie solely on women," said Yakup Beris, Resident Representative of UNDP in Serbia, and added: "Institutions should respond to violence by taking into account the specific circumstances of individual cases, while families and local communities should recognize and better understand violence, in order to become the first line of support for survivors. At the same time, the media should report responsibly in order to avoid further traumatization of survivors, and to educate the public that domestic violence is a social and not a private problem.”
The research "Why do women not report domestic violence?" was conducted by the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CeSID) from November 10 to December 5, 2022, on a representative sample of 1,004 women over the age of 18, including women facing multiple discrimination.
Of the total number of respondents, 35% have experienced some form of violence. 47% of them did not turn to any institution for support after the experienced violence, and 28% turned to someone from their personal environment.
When asked to state justified reasons for reporting violence, the largest percentage of women opted for serious physical injuries (73%), violence against children (64%), as well as threats of violence directed at them or family members (62%). Only 3% stated that in no case was it justified for a woman to report violence.
When it comes to protection from domestic violence, women have the most trust in safehouses, healthcare and the police, and the least in municipal free legal aid. Respondents also stated that if they experienced violence, they would first turn to family members (38%), the police (28%), and friends (9%).
This research was conducted within the project “Integrated Response to Violence against Women and Girls in Serbia III”, implemented jointly by UNICEF, UN Women, UNFPA and UNDP in partnership with the Government of the Republic of Serbia and with support of the Government of Sweden.

Title: Western Balkans SALW Control Roadmap Multi-Partner Trust Fund Launches Its Third Call for Proposals
Content: 15 March 2023
The United Nations' Western Balkans SALW Control Roadmap Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) opens its third call for proposals for the offices of the two Participating UN Organizations - UNDP and UNODC - covering the region.

This open call addresses the overarching concerns of trafficking, illicit possession and misuse of firearms in the Western Balkans.
The proposals should be developed in support of the implementation of the Western Balkans SALW Control Roadmap in line with the SALW control strategies/roadmap action plans of respective jurisdictions and in close coordination with SALW Commissions.
The offices of the Participating UN Organizations are invited to submit project proposals by 16 May 2023.
To learn more about the call and access its documents, please click here.
The Western Balkans SALW Control Roadmap Multi Partner Trust Fund ensures a donor coordinated approach of the UN in support of the Roadmap implementation. The work of the MPTF is possible thanks to the generous contributions by Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and Norway which amount $ 24,181,024 in total. The MPTF also benefits from the strong support of the European Union.
Through Roadmap support, the Trust Fund contributes to the achievement of SDG 16 that promotes just, peaceful, and inclusive societies, given that illicit arms flows are amongst the factors that give rise to violence, insecurity, and injustice. It also contributes to the achievement of SDG 5 that aims at achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, specifically by promoting gender equality and stronger women’s participation in all aspects of the SALW Control, as well as by tackling gender based violence.

Title: On the occasion of International Women's Day, The Coordination Body for Gender Equality and UNFPA emphasize that older women's mental health is as important as physical health.
Content: 10 March 2023
Slightly more than two-thirds of older people in Serbia feel lonely, and every other older woman in the region has survived some form of gender-based violence, according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) results.
Informal caregivers, who continue to carry the brunt of caring for older people, face mental health challenges themselves. Research done by UNFPA and the Serbian Red Cross showed that mild and moderate depression was present in about 20% of informal caregivers, while 7% of them were in severe depression.
Today's conference on the mental health of older women at the Faculty of Medical Sciences in Kragujevac, organized by the Coordination Body for Gender Equality, UNFPA, the City of Kragujevac, and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Kragujevac, draws attention to the importance of preserving the mental health of older women and how it can be achieved.
At the conference, experiences from practice on the mental health of older women were presented, as well as examples of good practices and initiatives implemented in the City of Kragujevac. In addition, participants had the opportunity to participate in discussions, share experiences and ideas, and learn more about available resources and support programs.
The conference also promoted the Corner for Healthy Aging work and the exhibition of handicrafts prepared by women from the Institution for Adults called "Small bees” (Male pčelice) and Gerontological Center Kragujevac, as part of occupational therapy. In the end, two doctors on site informed interested older citizens about mental health topics.

Title: The Secretary-General - OpEd for International Women's Day - 8 March 2023
Content: 08 March 2023
Around the world, progress on women’s rights is vanishing before our eyes. The latest forecasts estimate that on our current track, it will take another 300 years to reach full gender equality.
Today’s cascading crises, from the war in Ukraine to the climate emergency, affect women and girls first and worst. And as part of the global pushback against democracy, women’s rights over their bodies and autonomy over their lives are being questioned and denied.
Two statistics make our failure very clear:
Every ten minutes, one woman or girl is murdered by a family member or intimate partner.
And one woman dies every two minutes during pregnancy or childbirth. Most of those deaths are entirely preventable.
On International Women’s Day, we must commit to doing better. We need to reverse these horrific trends and stand up for the lives and rights of women and girls, everywhere.
This is one of my core priorities and a central plank of the work of the United Nations around the world.
From South Sudan to Myanmar, we are supporting women and girls in crisis and making sure their voices are heard in peace processes.
The Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, recently visited Afghanistan with a message for the authorities: women and girls have fundamental human rights, and we will never give up fighting for them.
This year, International Women’s Day focuses on closing gender gaps in science, technology, and innovation. Globally, men are 21 percent more likely to be online than women — and over 50 percent more likely in low-income countries.
But even the richest countries lose out because of gender-based stereotypes and historic bias. In the tech industry, men outnumber women two to one.  In Artificial Intelligence, it’s five to one.
Big data is the new gold, and the foundation of today’s political and business decisions. But it often ignores gender differences – or turns a blind eye to women altogether.
We should all be alarmed by products and services that bake in gender inequality right from the start, and digitize patriarchy and misogyny.
The Silicon Valleys of this world must not become Death Valleys for women’s rights.
Medical decisions based on data from men’s bodies can not only harm women; it can be deadly.
Discrimination against women in science and technology is the result of centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and damaging stereotypes. Women account for just three percent of Nobel Prize winners in scientific categories since 1901. And women online – including scientists and journalists – are often targeted for sexist hate speech and abuse designed to silence and shame them.
But they will not be silenced. Women and girls everywhere are demanding their rights, and their words reverberate around the world.
We need action on several fronts to make sure women and girls can make their full contribution to the world’s knowledge through science and technology.
We must break down barriers — from discriminatory data to stereotypes that push girls away from studying scientific subjects at an early age.
Decisionmakers of all kinds must broaden women’s participation and leadership in science and technology, through quotas if necessary.
They should be creative, widening the recruitment pipeline and hiring for skills. And they must be persistent. Gender equality will not happen by itself; it has to be prioritized and pursued. This approach is getting results at the United Nations, where we have our own strategy for gender parity among our personnel.
We also need action to create a safe digital environment for women and to hold accountable both the perpetrators of online abuse, and the digital platforms that enable them.
The United Nations is working with governments, civil society, the private sector and others on a Code of Conduct aimed at reducing harm and increasing accountability on digital platforms, while defending freedom of expression.
Women’s rights are not a luxury that can wait until we solve the climate crisis, end poverty and create a better world.
Investing in women and girls is the surest way to uplift all people, communities and countries, and to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Together, let’s work for a more inclusive, just, and prosperous world for women and girls, men and boys, everywhere.

Title: Serbia’s future depends on investing in children and young people
Content: 07 March 2023
Kopaonik, 7 March 2023 - “Poverty experienced in childhood has particularly severe effects on children’s development and life prospects. The impact on the individual child is huge, but neglecting children additionally fails to build the human resources needed for sustained economic prosperity of the country”, Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Representative in Serbia, concluded at the Human Capital for Growth and Productivity in Serbia panel at the Kopaonik Business Forum.
The panel was moderated by Nicola Pontara, the World Bank Country Manager for Serbia, while the other participants included Svetlana Kisić from the Serbian Association of Economists, Richard Record, World Bank Lead Economist for the Western Balkans, and Xiaoqing Yu, World Bank Director for the Western Balkans.
By 2030, the proportion of the population aged 65 or above in Serbia is likely to increase from an already high 21 per cent to 24 per cent. The latest census shows that Serbia’s population has decreased by almost half a million in the last 11 years.
Serbia took measures to address this challenge through current policies to boost fertility rates. As lower-income households tend to have higher fertility rates and are more likely to respond to financial incentives for family planning, the new labour market entrants will increasingly come from poor and vulnerable backgrounds. Estimates suggest that by 2030 some 30 per cent of new labour market entrants in Serbia will be from vulnerable and minority backgrounds.
“UNICEF’s poverty projections on the impact of the war in Ukraine show that in 2023 absolute child poverty will increase in Serbia with nearly an additional 28,000 children living below the absolute poverty line.
These figures require a strong and urgent response if we want to ensure that Serbia will have human capital able to contribute to the country’s growth and prosperity. Now is the time for action! This means the implementation of policies that provide children, independently of their origin and background, with good education opportunities that ensure effective and affordable health care, and support to vulnerable households with effective poverty-targeted and social protection programmes. It means investing in every child!” stated Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Representative in Serbia.
The ongoing economic crisis will make raising public spending a challenge. It will thus be essential to at least protect current expenditure levels in human development and focus on closing equity gaps. Reforms in the size, structure and efficiency of public expenditures could help Serbia to overcome the challenges of ageing, low productivity, and inequality.

Title: Small Arms Control as Precondition for Peace, Security and Development
Content: 05 March 2023
In post-conflict contexts, managing stocks of arms can be key to preventing the resurgence of violence. Effective and transparent control over small arms contributes to peacebuilding, community security and development.
On the International Day for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Awareness, UNDP recommits to its efforts towards armed violence reduction, people-centered security and mainstreaming small-arms control in development efforts and policies.
UNDP’s work on small arms control is an integral part of the support to the security sector. Good practices for arms control through the people-centered approach to security have been introduced, for example, in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Cote d’Ivoire.
In post-conflict and fragile settings, institutions need support in managing their stock of arms. In Central African Republic and in partnership with UNMAS, UNDP operationalized new standards for arms and ammunitions storage.
Nine countries across the Sahel and Mano River benefitted from UNDP’s regional programme on small arms and light weapons (SALW) in West and Central Africa in 2022, with the support from the EU and Germany. Activities included rekindled partnership with the Economic Community for Central African States (ECCAS), sensitization and advocacy, strengthening of cross-border management systems, collection and destruction of arms and ammunitions.
UNDP's regional programme SEESAC works to strengthen the capacities of national and regional stakeholders to control and reduce the proliferation and misuse of small arms and light weapons (SALW) in South-Eastern and Eastern Europe. Over the past 20 years, regional cooperation processes have been established under SEESAC’s helm: expanding know-how and driving coordination of action and standardization of practices in SALW control on both strategic and operational levels.
SEESAC’s achievements include:
SEESAC has also been entrusted with monitoring and coordinating the implementation of the Western Balkans SALW Control Roadmap – the most comprehensive regional SALW control exercise globally, as well as with programmatic coordination and monitoring of 16 UNDP and UNODC-run projects funded through UN’s Western Balkans SALW Control Roadmap Multi-Partner Trust Fund currently wielding a budget of over US$ 24 million.
The scope of work has expanded to include the advancement of gender equality in the security sector reform and the Women, Peace and Security agenda. SEESAC supports governments in developing signature solutions rooted in strong partnerships, local ownership and regional coordination. Proved successful, these solutions and standardized approaches have been replicated in the Caribbean and the European Union (EU).
This year will see the expansion of SALIENT – Saving Lives Entity – a global project dedicated to supporting Member States in tackling armed violence and illicit small arms and light weapons as part of a comprehensive approach to sustainable security and development. Implemented in partnership between UNDP and the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), SALIENT started in 2021 in three pilot countries: Cameroon, Jamaica and South Sudan.
In Jamaica, the control over small arms has improved due to legislative review, capacity building and youth sensitization to reduce violence in schools. In Cameroon, following an awareness raising campaign, the Ministry of External Relations will work on the action plan of the National Commission on SALW. In South Sudan, where political and security challenges delayed project operations, efforts are made to include women in decision-making and implementation of the disarmament process.
In 2023, new countries will be selected to ensure global coverage. SALIENT is financially housed in the UN Peacebuilding Fund with contributions from the governments of Finland, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. SALIENT is implemented through UNDP’s Global Programme for Strengthening the Rule of Law, Human Rights, Justice and Security for Sustainable Peace and Development.

Title: 16 solutions for the Green Transition
Content: 20 February 2023
760,000 EUR secured to implement the best ideas.
The EU Delegation to the Republic of Serbia (EU), the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) today presented certificates and financial awards to the authors of 16 new business solutions to accelerate the green transition of the Serbian economy. Thanks to the EU funds, these solutions have received financial support totalling EUR 726,000 so they can be implemented this year.
The award-winning solutions were proposed by public and private companies, civil society organisations, research institutions, and local self-governments. They were selected as the best out of 140 proposals submitted in four Public Calls in 2022.
"We are here today to celebrate innovation and to recognise companies with the best ideas for the green transition of the Serbian economy. Thanks to the "EU for Green Agenda in Serbia" project, the best 16 solutions for green transition of Serbian economy have been selected," said Emanuele Giaufret, Ambassador and Head of the EU Delegation to the Republic of Serbia. His Excellency Giaufret added: "Serbian companies have ingenuity and creativity to take country to greener and healthier future. These solutions can only have a positive impact on the environment as well as on the health and wellbeing of the people across Serbia. We are glad that EU funds go directly into green investment to innovative Serbian companies."
"The sustainable economic development of Serbia, with full respect for the environment and the well-being of all citizens, is one of the main priorities of the Government of the Republic of Serbia and the Ministry of Environmental Protection. In addition to the efforts we invest in improving the strategic and legislative framework, for the successful implementation of the green transition we also need specific innovative solutions for our economy, such as those that were awarded today," said Sandra Dokić, State Secretary at the Ministry of Environmental Protection.
The practical implementation of the award-winning solutions will help reduce GHG emissions, switch to renewable energy sources, reuse waste to make new products, improve air quality, and preserve biodiversity.
Thanks to the shift to a business model that protects the environment and human health, Serbian companies will be more competitive in export markets, thus contributing to sustainable economic growth and enabling the creation of new green jobs.
"Serbian companies have shown that they understand the economic, social and environmental benefits of the green transition, and are willing to actively participate in this process," said Yakup Beris, Resident Representative of UNDP in Serbia. "In order to give the largest possible number of interested parties the opportunity to develop and implement their innovative "green" ideas, today we have opened a new perennial Public Call for the green transition of the Serbian economy and society," Beris added.
The new Public Call is open for proposals for business solutions from all five priority areas of the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans: decarbonisation (reducing dependence on fossil fuels), circular economy (conserving natural resources), reducing environmental pollution, protecting and conserving nature and biodiversity, and developing sustainable food supply systems and rural development. The Call remains open until the end of 2026.
Today's event was part of the project "EU for the Green Agenda in Serbia", implemented by UNDP with financial support from the European Union, in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and in cooperation with the Embassy of Sweden, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Government of Switzerland. The total value of this initiative is 16.5 million euros, of which 8 million euros is provided by the EU and the rest by the governments of Sweden, Switzerland, and Serbia.

Title: The Developmental Counselling Unit in Subotica received a vehicle for home visits to children with developmental difficulties and disabilities
Content: 08 February 2023
Vojput donated 4 million dinars and provided full equipment to the Developmental Counselling Unit.
Subotica, 8 February 2023 – The Developmental Counselling Unit in Subotica received today a vehicle for home visits to families of children with developmental difficulties and disabilities up to 6 years of age living in the Subotica region. Owing to the donation of the Vojput company in the amount of 4 million dinars, this Developmental Counselling Unit has already received a digital library and furniture, and, with the vehicle delivered today, the Developmental Counselling Unit is equipped to provide cutting-edge services for children showing signs of developmental delays.
“The Counselling Unit in Subotica was established back in 1961 as a Psychopaedagogical Counselling Unit, and it was named the Developmental Counselling Unit in 1991. Every year, it provides support to about 1,500 children up to 6 years of age and their families, bilingually, in Serbian and in Hungarian. We work continuously to improve our work and, since September 2021, we have been part of the innovative intensive Family-Oriented Early Intervention programme. We intend to gradually include as many children as possible in the innovative programme as the Family-Oriented Early Intervention Team progresses. We are immensely grateful to UNICEF and to the Vojput company for their support and the donation of a vehicle that will enable a professional step forward for experts and work in the family and kindergarten environment, where the child learns, plays and lives, thus significantly improving the quality and accessibility of support for all children and their families“, said Erzebet Kiskarolj, Team Coordinator for Family-Oriented Early Intervention in Subotica.
According to experts’ estimates, in Serbia, about 60,000 children up to 6 years of age need early intervention services, and it has been proven that, if detected on time, developmental difficulties can be overcome before the child starts school in as many as 70% of children. Last year, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and other partners, UNICEF launched the Dad, Mom, We Are with You! campaign to equip teams for family-oriented early interventions in developmental counselling units across Serbia, from Subotica to Vranje, with assistive technology, computers and digital equipment for remote work, didactic materials, furniture tailored to the needs of children and parents and home visitation vehicles.
“By introducing family-oriented early interventions in the work of our developmental counselling units, we ensure that cutting-edge approaches to working with children, based on neuroscientific evidence, are available to families in Subotica and in towns and municipalities across Serbia. The goal is for every child to have access to support during childhood when development occurs most rapidly in order for children to reach their full potential, which is indeed always the greatest wish of every parent. That is why early intervention brings together systems and experts from the sectors of health care, education and social protection and, recognising parents’ strengths and needs, provides necessary and intensive support to children and their families. In order to achieve the goal, well-equipped, modern and sustainable services and competent professionals are needed. We would like to thank the Ministry of Health for their commitment to achieving this goal and our reliable partner Vojput for helping us to equip the Developmental Counselling Unit in Subotica and enable the full implementation of modern approaches in the daily practice of counselling units“, said Jelena Zajeganovic-Jakovljevic, Health and Early Childhood Development Specialist in UNICEF Serbia.
UNICEF and the Ministry of Health have worked together systematically since 2010 on promoting early childhood development. The goal is to establish an intersectoral approach to providing family support in line with cutting-edge scientific practices that place children with developmental difficulties and disabilities and their parents in centre of attention of experts.
“Investing in the earliest years of a child’s life is proven to be the most worthwhile investment for the health and future of society and that is why, back in 2016, we adopted the National Programme for the Promotion of Early Childhood Development. This programme provides for at least one developmental counselling unit in every district providing support to families of children with developmental difficulties and disabilities up to 6 years of age, both in the area where the unit is located and via mobile teams in smaller surrounding localities. In previous years, in cooperation with UNICEF, we succeeded in improving the capacity of primary health care centres and developmental counselling units in 15 out of 25 districts in Serbia. We will continue to work together to expand this network of counselling units, to secure legislative as well as financial support to ensure their sustainability and quality in order for the services to be available to every child and family in need of support. I would like to congratulate Subotica on the successful long-standing work of its developmental counselling unit, which will now be even more complete with the addition of the vehicle for field work. I hope that this standard will soon be rolled out across Serbia and increase service accessibility, especially for children who live outside major cities. I would like to thank the donor for helping to procure the vehicle. I would especially like to thank UNICEF for its great commitment to uniting numerous partners around the same goal“, said State Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Prof. Ferenc Vicko, PhD.
The donation to the Developmental Counselling Unit in Subotica, where the Vojput company is based, is an example of how the private sector can support the development of the local community in which it operates.
“Vojput has supported the local community for years and we believe that the principle of giving back to the community in which we operate is one of the most important business principles. Because the even development of the community as a whole can create a long-term perspective for a society in which every child has the same opportunities and every person enjoys equal rights. In the times of crises and major challenges in which we are living, the economy should accommodate the most vulnerable members of society and I confirm our continued commitment to be there for and to support children and UNICEF, which identifies where there are needs that must urgently be met“, said Goran Jankovic, Director of the Vojput company.
UNICEF and the Ministry of Health, together with the ministries in charge of education, social protection, family welfare and demography, have so far supported the implementation of family-oriented early interventions in 19 towns and municipalities in Serbia (15 districts in total) out of the planned 36. More than 500 professionals from the health care and social protection systems and preschool institutions have been trained, 120 of whom are engaged in direct work with families. More than 2400 children and their families received support during 2022, of which more than 200 are engaged in intensive family-oriented early intervention services. All these centres received part of the digital equipment and didactic materials, and 3 developmental counselling units, including the one in Subotica, also received furniture.

Title: From the narrative of threats to the narrative of opportunities - Op-Ed by Francoise Jacob, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia
Content: 03 February 2023
2022 was a tumultuous year. We learned once again that our strength, as humanity, lies in our capacity to sustain rapid changes, adapt, and respond to multiple crises and to some extent, manage uncertainties. 2022 also reminded us that we need to accelerate fundamental transformations in our economic and social models, anticipate risks and take robust preventive actions. The global nature of the poly-crisis that we are facing - from the Covid19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and its impact on food security and the cost of energy, the renewed nuclear threat, climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution - has contributed to increased inequalities within countries, and between countries.
In 2022, Serbia showed a high degree of resilience to multiple stresses. While inflationary trends increased, the country remained self-sufficient with local food production. Rising energy costs were mitigated by the local coal production (still a whopping 70% of the energy mix), as well as supportive measures by the government. These impacted favorably households’ and businesses’ bills for power, heating, production, and transport. Legislative changes and innovations continued, although at a slower pace than in 2021. Ahead of COP27, Serbia endorsed its updated National Determined Contribution, laying the ground for more dedicated actions to fight climate change. With the development and publication of the Leave-No-One-Behind tool1 that will be mainstreamed through all legislation, Serbia made a strong commitment to one of the key principles of Agenda 2030, as an attempt to fight inequalities more systematically. The most vulnerable and invisible segments of the population are still facing hardship in many areas of life, be it housing conditions, access to decent work or specialized social protection services. GDP grew at 2.3%2, and the fiscal situation of the country remains stable overall. Foreign investments increased, in both traditional industries (agrobusiness) and high technological ones (biotech in particular)3. The construction sector expanded with both large public infrastructure projects and real estate development in main cities. At the regional level, initiatives to facilitate mobility, trade and investment have moved forward but have been shadowed by divisive narratives across the region.
The protracted election proceedings, which started late January 2022 with candidates’ campaigns and ended by October with the appointment of a new cabinet, was an impediment to the reform process in several sectors. Coupled with the energy crisis, this slowed down legislative and implementation actions towards several sensitive or complex files, including on the green transformation and other environmental related challenges such as air pollution. At the same time, citizens’ main concerns shifted away from environmental and public health matters, focusing mostly on rising costs of living generated by global trends as well as by the influx of foreigners in Belgrade and Novi Sad primarily.
Serbia consistently condemned Russia actions at the UN general assembly and in the UN human rights council but stayed short of full alignment with the EU foreign policy, most specifically as regards to the economic sanctions. This political position was shaped by dissenting and polarised opinions in country about the war in Ukraine, pragmatic security and energy concerns, a tradition of non-alignment, and the absence of a tangible timeframe for EU accession. Tensions between Belgrade and Pristina rose throughout the second half of the year, culminating in late December, and posing new challenges to the EU-facilitated dialogue. Confrontations on the ground, withdrawals of Serbs from public institutions, and other symptoms of instability diverted some political energy and attention action away from other priorities, including sustainable development.  Looking forward, Serbia remains at the center of diplomatic efforts to secure improved regional stability and cooperation.
Mixed migration movements increased in 2022. The number of estimated migrants and refugees who entered Serbia doubled from 2021, reaching over 110,000 (not including Russians and Ukrainians) – most of them transiting towards the European Union. Hosting conditions are adequate in country and opportunities exist for resettlement; slow asylum procedures, and high-risk crossing paths continue to pose a threat for individuals and families, with a persistent risk of illegal trafficking of the most vulnerable ones. Serbia has significantly augmented and aligned its legislation related to human rights, discrimination, gender equality and gender-based violence with EU and UN standards; yet incidents challenging fundamental rights and freedoms and inciting hate have taken pace throughout the year with EU and UN standards little condemnation.
In this complex environment, the United Nations in Serbia accelerated its own pace of action on the three strategic priorities agreed with the government of Serbia: the green transformation, building on the human capital, and strengthening the Rule of Law and Human rights agenda. Together with our national counterparts, we will continue to advance the full realisation of Agenda 2030 with a people-centered approach to development, and to promote values of solidarity, unity, and equity. More than ever, a renewed commitment to multilateralism is essential to tackle global and regional threats, restore peace, adjust and guide the course of our common destiny, with hope and perseverance.

Title: United States donated new equipment to the health station in Mali Mokri Lug
Content: 02 February 2023
2 February 2023
Today, the USAID Serbia Mission Director Brooke Isham and UNDP Serbia Resident Representative Yakup Beris together with the Acting Director of the Primary Health Care Center (PHCC) ‘Zvezdara’ dr Aleksandra Mitrovic visited the premises of the pediatric ward in the health station Mali Mokri Lug. Thanks to a donation from the American people, these premises have been fully equipped with medical devices to improve the health care of the youngest population in this local community.
The USAID donation consists of scales for measuring height and weight, blood pressure measuring devices, stethoscopes, ECG device, accessories for small surgical interventions, as well as necessary small equipment such as thermometers, neurological hammers, and furniture. This equipment will be used for physical examinations of children with acute and chronic diseases, as well as for preventive examinations and vaccination.
USAID Mission Director in Serbia, Brooke Isham said that this donation is part of the more than $12 million dollars in assistance that the U.S. Government has provided to help Serbia to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and provide better health services for its people, and added: “I think it is important to note that much of the support for health services we provided to Serbia – like the fourteen ambulances, the various types of equipment like x-ray machines and oxygenators and the renovated facilities here and at facilities like Batut and INEP and throughout the country – can, and will, continue to be used by Serbian healthcare professionals for years to come.”
“All citizens have a right to quality and accessible health care, and distance cannot be an obstacle. In the last eight months, we opened the ORL Outpatient Unit in Mirijevo and two Diabetic Counseling Units. At the initiative of citizens of Mali Mokri Lug, and with the support from USAID and UNDP, today we opened what is the most important for our youngest- pediatric ward", said Primary Health Care Center ‘Zvezdara’ Acting Director dr Aleksandra Mitrovic.
“Available and quality health care is one of the key elements that show us the level of development in a society, in addition to access to education and standard of living”, said UNDP Serbia Resident Representative Yakup Beris, and added: “The COVID-19 has further reminded us of the importance of quality and accessibility of health care. Thanks to partnership with the USAID, UNDP was able to assist Serbia to fully recover from the COVID-19 crisis and to become better prepared for similar challenges in the future.”
This donation of equipment to PHCC ‘Zvezdara’ is a part of the "Together against COVID" project, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The project was realized in partnership with the Government of Serbia, which has identified investments to help strengthen healthcare and research facilities as priority areas for support.

Title: Cervical Cancer. Cancer that can be prevented.
Content: 23 January 2023
Belgrade, January 23, 2023 - The European Cervical Cancer Prevention Week, celebrated from 23 to 29 January this year, was marked in Serbia.

According to data from the Cancer Registry of the Institute for Public Health of Serbia "Dr. Milan Jovanović Batut," in 2020, 1,087 newly diagnosed women were registered in Serbia, and 453 women died of this malignant disease.
Based on the latest estimates of the European Information System for the year 2020, Serbia ranks fifth in Europe after Montenegro, Romania, Estonia, and Lithuania, with an incidence rate of 26.3 per 100,000 women. Cervical cancer death rates are also high at 9.1 per 100,000 women.
Traditionally, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in cooperation with the Institute for Public Health of Serbia, the Ministry of Health, and the Committee for International Cooperation of Medical Students - Serbia, organized educational and health-promotion activities in four dormitories in Belgrade that lasted throughout the week.
These activities aimed to raise awareness of the importance of regular preventive examinations and the understanding that primary and secondary prevention measures can almost entirely prevent this disease: timely immunization against the Human Papillomavirus and regular controls and preventive examinations.
The beginning of European Cervical Cancer Prevention Week kicked off with a press conference on Monday, January 23, while public actions in student dormitories continued until Friday, January 27. Dr. Verica Jovanovic, director of the Institute for Public Health of Serbia "Dr. Milan Jovanović Batut," prof. Dr. Ferenc Vicko, State Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Prof. Sanja Radojevic Skodric, director of the Republic Fund for Health Insurance, Prof. Dr. Ana Banko from the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology of the Faculty of Medicine in Belgrade, Dr. Jelena Mitrovic in front of HC Simo Milošević and Ms. Borka Jeremić, head of the UNFPA office in Serbia spoke at the press conference.
This year's celebration of the European Cervical Cancer Prevention Week is particularly significant because, since the middle of last year, the vaccine against HPV infection has been available for all girls and boys aged 9-19 from health insurance funds.
The Population Fund of the United Nations in Serbia will continue to work on the dialogue between different actors in order to understand the message that with HPV vaccination, regular preventive examinations, and the promotion of health literacy and life skills, this disease can be prevented.

Title: The best innovations in the field of circular economy in Serbia rewarded
Content: 21 December 2022
With the support of the Global Environment Fund (GEF), the Ministry of Environmental Protection and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) awarded today the authors of 21 best innovative ideas for the further development of circular economy in Serbia. The awarded innovations come from the public and private companies, local self-governments, civil society organisations and scientific institutions, that have been selected through previously organised public calls. They will contribute to decreasing greenhouse gases (GHG) emission and more efficient use of energy and resources.
On this occasion, the Minister of Environmental Protection, Irena Vujović, said: “The linear economic model based on the principle “take-make-use-dispose” is unsustainable, as the natural resources are limited, thus making the transition to circular economy a necessity,” and added: “The Government of Serbia has adopted the Circular Economy Development Programme for 2022-2024, which recognizes circular economy as a tool for Serbia’s green transition.”
“The high turnout to the public calls for innovations in this field shows that a wide circle of actors in Serbia recognises the importance of saving natural resources and energy, reusing and recycling materials and products and decreasing the amount of waste. The solutions that we awarded today will have a positive impact on the environment, while also bringing economic profit through new jobs and higher competitiveness of Serbian companies, for the benefit of all citizens in Serbia”, said Yakup Beris, UNDP Serbia Resident Representative.
Nine innovations received financial support totalling at 746,000 USD to be implemented during the next year. They include ideas for saving electrical energy by using new technologies, producing energy from bio-waste, using organic waste for producing compost, fertilisers and new materials, using hazardous waste for the production of a high-quality fertiliser, as well recycling of textile, paper, cardboard and cigarette packs in making new products. The funds recipients are: Nektar d.o.o, DETO d.o.o. Pančevo, Elixir Zorka - mineralna đubriva d.o.o.

Title: The Sixth National Conference on Early Development and Parenting
Content: 14 December 2022
Parents support their children's development.
Belgrade, 13 December, 2022 - Investing in family support during early childhood is necessary for a fair, accessible and high-quality support system that enables the optimal development and inclusion of each child, and we have a road ahead of us to create the conditions for quality services for the early development of children provided by visiting nurses, pediatricians and development counseling centers, in cooperation with preschool and social institutions in the community, to reach every parent in Serbia. That is the conclusion of the sixth National Conference on early development and parenting entitled "We are rooting for parents" , organized by UNICEF Serbia through a cooperation program with the Government of the Republic of Serbia.
In the previous period, the Government of the Republic of Serbia and UNICEF introduced and tested innovative parenting support practices in the first, and most important years of a child's life, through the models of Playful parenting for all families and Family-Oriented Early Intervention (PORI) for families of children with developmental disabilities.
"By joining forces, we achieved significant progress in improving the quality of services for the youngest children and their families. Through cooperation with relevant ministries, we supported 50 percent of districts in Serbia to provide innovative, intersectoral and family-oriented early intervention services for children with disabilities and developmental disabilities. Moreover, in one fifth of the municipalities in Serbia, we have strengthened primary health care services, as well as preschools, and social services, so that every new mother and father is reached with play and learning support. This shows that Serbia is as an example of good practice regionally and globally! However, the time has come to move away from piloting new services in selected localities toward improved standards of all services that can reach young children and their parents in every town and village across Serbia. This requires significant commitments to embed good practices into systems – from amendments in legislation to equitable allocation of financial resources and  investing in professionals," said Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Representative in Serbia.
Through UNICEF's regional program "Mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on children and families in the Western Balkans and Turkey", the European Union has invested 660,000 US dollars to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of children and families in Serbia.
"The pandemic tested all of our children and their parents, as learning and playing opportunities were confined to the home. However, to vulnerable children and families, the challenge of the pandemic was far bigger, where accessing support systems became more difficult. The EU joined forces with UNICEF in order to assure the continual provision of core services to vulnerable children and their families in the recovery response to COVID-19, including public health, education, early childhood development, and child protection systems. The EU has contributed €6 million to inprove the resilience of institutions which support children and caregivers in the region and supports children widely through many edcuation programmes.," said Emanuele Giaufret , Ambassador and Head of the Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Serbia.
Research shows that in Serbia 17 percent of children under the age of five are exposed to risks to their optimal development, and that they have difficulties or disabilities in development, and therefore need additional support. That is why, in the previous year, the Family-Oriented Early Intervention (PORI) model was expanded from five test locations to 13 new ones, 40 new institutions were included in the program and more than 500 professionals were trained, 120 of whom worked directly with families. Since January of this year, more than 2,400 children have been included, 200 of them with intensive support.
"The Ministry of Family Care and Demography, in partnership with UNICEF, is committed to strengthening support for parents in the period of early childhood, through improving the availability and quality of services for parents," said Minister Kisić. As she added, organized and systemic parenting support contributes to good mental health and well-being of both children and their parents, prevention of violence and neglect in childhood, optimal realization of each child's potential and reduction of risky behaviors throughout life.
According to her, the Ministry will, in the coming period, emphasize policies and measures that contribute to and promote gender equality in parenting and empowering fathers, and through the organization of parenting schools for dads.
In partnership with the Government of the Republic of Serbia, UNICEF continues to strengthen the capacities of health care, education and social care systems to support the early development of children and provide quality services to parents that help them in this important role. The "Playful Parenting" program has been operating in 34 cities and municipalities since 2022 and brings together over 100 institutions and 1,000 practitioners in the field of children's health and early development. The innovative polyvalent patronage services have so far reached more than 20,000 parents, of which 30 percent are fathers. Also, training packages were developed and accredited, which trained more than 400 visiting nurses.
The State Secretary of the Ministry of Health, Assistant Professor Aleksandar Stefoski , PhD, pointed out that the Ministry of Health and UNICEF cooperate on several projects, including the strengthening of pediatric and outpatient services. "The first three years are the most important in the development of every child, so support for parents during this period is extremely important. Primary health care will be in focus in the coming period. Thus, development counseling centers will be available to every child and every parent. It is a good way to notice a delay in children's development in time," said Stefoski .
In addition to the parents' decision that the child with developmental difficulties live a dignified and quality life, it is very important for the families of these children to receive adequate support from the environment and the system as soon as possible.
"The words that came from a doctor showed me all that my child can do. She told me that I should let him live like anyone else - with human feelings and a brain, regardless of the developmental problem. The word 'developmental' means that there is a possibility for progress. With those words, the doctor spread her wings for us to develop together as a family. That's why support is crucial - it provides a good starting position for further early development, early interventions, but also an easier life path for the whole family," said Nikolina Radosavljević, mother of a child with developmental disabilities.
In order to overcome the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the improvement of services was also aimed at the introduction of an innovative way of working - video counseling for families. In order to provide early interventions, basic digital equipment was provided for all institutions in the new 13 municipalities, and mobile phones and the Internet were provided for patrol services in 37 health centers. Materials were also created for professionals and parents about video counseling that helped them stay connected even during the intense period of the pandemic and isolation.
A significant contribution to the development of improved systemic parenting support services was provided by the European Union through the UNICEF regional program "Mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on children and families in the Western Balkans and Turkey", the LEGO Foundation through the project "Encouraging parenting through play", and the economic sector in Serbia.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Sixth National Conference on Early Development and Parenting will be included in the Cooperation Plan of UNICEF and the Ministry of Health and other ministries that care for children and families for the period from 2023 to 2025.

Title: 8th Anniversary of #IBelong campaign marked
Content: 13 December 2022
Belgrade, 13 December 2022 – The Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government, the Ombudsman and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) held a joint conference to mark the eight anniversary of UNHCR global campaign #IBelong to eradicate statelessness across the world.

The Minister of Public Administration and Local Self-Government, Aleksandar Martinović PhD expressed satisfaction with the big progress achieved in resolving the challenges of legal invisibility in the Republic of Serbia, stressing that the cases of persons not being recorded in birth registries are but an exception now. According to him, the implementation of numerous joint activities paved the way to systemic solutions for unimpeded registration at birth. Many other rights related to status of persons have also been improved.
He noted that special attention was paid to registration of newborns of undocumented mothers into birth registries thus efficiently removing risks of statelessness. The Minister said that the future cooperation would focus on resolving the outstanding challenges and preventing emergence of the new cases of legally invisible persons, particularly among the members of Roma community.
Ombudsman Zoran Pašalić stated that the number of legally invisible persons in the Republic of Serbia decreased significantly but that there remain children and citizens not recognized by the system. He added that the situation of the inhabitants of informal settlements is grave and that they are at risk of statelessness.
Pašalić called on the relevant authorities to invest additional efforts to alleviate the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic that persist in the social and economic segment of the life of Roma community in the informal settlements.
Stefanie Krause, Representative a.i. UNHCR Serbia noted that the number of undocumented Roma in Serbia decreased significantly since the onset of the global #IBelong launched in 2014 by the UN Refugee Agency. This is thanks to the efforts of all the relevant institutions of the Republic of Serbia, primarily the excellent cooperation with the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government and the Ombudsman.
As she said, UNHCR is satisfied with the progress and notes that Serbia may well become one of the first countries in Europe to eradicate the risk of statelessness over the next two years – by end of the IBelong campaign.
Under the framework of three memoranda of understanding, the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government, Ombudsman and UNHCR have been investing joint efforts to resolve this issue since 2012. The event today also marks the beginning of a media campaign directed at members of the Roma community who attended an information session at the conference today and who shared their experiences from working in informal settlements.

Title: Social Policy Workshop of the Joint SDG Programme - Social protection and needs of the most vulnerable population groups
Content: 12 December 2022
Belgrade, 12 December 2022 - To enable the exchange of knowledge and policy implications in combating poverty in Serbia, the Policy Workshop on “Extending Social Protection to families in Serbia with enhanced shock-responsiveness” was held today with the participation of decision makers and practitioners from key government ministries and agencies at the central and local level, as well as representatives from civil society, academia, the UN Serbia Team and the donor community.
As the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic recession is stalling due to the Ukraine crisis, vulnerable and marginalized communities in Serbia are facing specific challenges. Bearing the brunt are families with young children, women-headed households, older persons living alone or in older households, refugees, asylum seekers, persons at risk of statelessness and internally displaced persons, those living in rural or remote areas, or with a minimum income. There is already ample anecdotal evidence that discretionary spending and choices related to the quality of food consumed and education among these groups are already being affected.
“Rising food and energy costs may drastically influence the living standards of children in Serbia. They may also make the share of essential spending in the total budget higher and all other non-essential spending lower. Education costs might decrease and significantly negatively affect children from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. UNICEF, UNFPA and UNHCR stand ready to support the Government of the Republic of Serbia in introducing shock-sensitive social protection measures that will hopefully respond to the current crisis, but also help the country better respond to future shocks,” said Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Representative in Serbia.
Sub-groups of older people, particularly in rural and remote areas, are reported to be stretched in meeting their needs for food, hygiene, or medicines.
“Through the assessment of the impact of poverty on older persons, we obtained valuable data especially when it comes to their discrimination, social isolation and poverty. Through group discussions with the most vulnerable groups of the population and one-time financial assistance to 70 households with older people, with special focus on single headed older households, in addition to helping them ease the consequences of crises, we managed to identify people who are outside the social protection system, who live on the edge of existence, and remain invisible and left behind,” said Borka Jeremic, UNFPA Head of Serbia Country Office.
Recent crises have caused displacement on an unprecedented scale. Migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers often face recurrent and seemingly insurmountable barriers in accessing social protection as a right. Social protection is anchored in international human rights principles and is a key policy tool for building resilience, combating poverty and improving economic and social outcomes among vulnerable individuals and families. It can protect people from life-cycle contingencies and external shocks that might otherwise cause them to fall into poverty.
“As a part of the national social protection system, forcibly displaced people have a right to social assistance and protection in Serbia. Within the UN-joint program, UNHCR has provided recommendations on how to further strengthen their access to these rights and the overall shock-responsive social protection framework. Refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced and stateless people should be strongly included in it, as some of the most vulnerable social groups in Serbia. This would mean providing them timely emergency assistance and safeguarding their well-being in case any specific challenges arrive, such as the Ukraine crisis and COVID pandemic,” stated Stefanie Krause, UNHCR Representative a.i.
Through this Joint UN Programme, support will be provided to the Government of Serbia to strengthen the national social protection and shock-responsive policy framework and increase adequate budget resources for the protection of the most vulnerable population groups.
“I am happy that not only representatives of the state and international organizations participated in this workshop, but also civil society because the work on the implementation and promotion of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs is the business of all actors – from state authorities to each individual. Only by creating partnerships, through a holistic approach, can we succeed in our intention to take advantage of the development opportunity offered to us, to establish a higher degree of democracy, gender equality, equality, individualism, and cooperation in society,” said Prof. Dr Slavica Djukic Dejanovic, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia responsible for the 2030 Agenda.
The UN Joint Programme “Extending Social Protection to families in Serbia with enhanced shock builds on the experience of the UN in in Serbia in addressing social protection and the needs of the most vulnerable groups.
About the project:
UN Joint Programme Extending Social Protection to families in Serbia with enhanced shock-responsiveness focuses on strengthening shock-responsive social protection system to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the consecutive crisis that hit the country.
Its aim is to (i) strengthen the data response on the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable groups to feed into the introduction of legislative changes for adaptive social protection system (ii) apply the shock-responsive social protection principles to provide support for the 170 most vulnerable families. The project is implemented jointly by UNICEF (lead agency) and UNFPA, with the participation of UNHCR and in close partnership with the Special Advisor to the Prime Minister on Agenda 2030, Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs, other line-Ministries, Local Self Governments, Statistical Office, Red Cross and World Bank. The total project value is $289.200, funded mainly by the UN Joint SDG Fund.

Title: A mobile app for Serbian language learning won first prize in UNHCR’s high school project
Content: 11 December 2022
Belgrade 12 December 2022 – Following almost a year of implementing the initiative “In their Sneakers,” which UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, had developed with high schools across Serbia, the best solutions were announced, and accompanying prizes were presented today. UNHCR, together with the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Serbia, which has supported the project throughout, once again reiterated the importance of providing support to those in need, in this case, forcibly displaced people.
“Although some surveys might indicate a worrying level of xenophobia among your generation, after seeing your lovely projects, I can now rest easy. UNHCR and all our partners in the Government of Serbia, CSOs, and other organizations stand ready to support you on your journey to maturity and to form your own attitudes based exclusively on evidence-based data,” said Stefanie Krause, UNHCR Representative a.i.
After a detailed assessment of all received project proposals, the jury unanimously decided to award first prize to the team of the Mathematical Grammar School from Belgrade, which had developed a mobile app that eases the way in which non-Serbian speakers can master the basics of this language.
“Bearing in mind the practical use of this solution in the everyday lives of people to whom the Serbian language is not their mother tongue, this initiative has emerged as exceptional and worthy of the most prestigious recognition during the project implementation,” states the jury’s explanation.
“Sezai Suroi” Secondary School team from Bujanovac positioned itself with a series of inclusive activities, starting off with a visit to Presevo Reception Center, then a joint class of local pupils and their refugee peers, to the organization of an exhibition in Bujanovac town center on the occasion of World Refugee Day. Thus this team was awarded second prize.
The third prize was, however, given to a team from the town in the vicinity of another reception center, that in Sombor. “Veljko Petrovic” Grammar School from Sombor had also conceived numerous inclusive and creative activities encompassing direct communications with people from the Reception center. The added value to the project was the fact that a refugee boy from Ukraine was included, first as an interviewee for the project and then in the capacity of an equal member.
Musical performances, sketching workshops, as well as other creative activities were filmed diligently, resulting in a short movie with the substantial potential to be further used in other awareness-raising initiatives about refugee inclusion.
Given the outstanding creativity demonstrated by the Computing Grammar School from Belgrade, the jury decided to award them with special recognition. This team had developed a concept for a board game meant to encourage empathy among its players, thus demonstrating an unusual and out-of-the-box approach to the topic.
UNHCR recognizes all project proposals to be pertinent for refugee protection in the Republic of Serbia. Therefore symbolic prizes were given to other participating teams as well – those from Novi Sad, Bajina Bašta, Kruševac, Obrenovac and Negotin.
The “In their Sneakers” Project represents a continuation of UNHCR’s activities with young people in Serbia as a reflection of the organization’s utter belief that youth has the potential to bring about positive change and to create a more inclusive society with equal chances for all, particularly those forced to flee their homes due to wars and persecution.

Title: Serbia and Kosovo*: End politicisation of transitional justice processes, says UN expert
Content: 02 December 2022
Serbia and Kosovo* must end politicised tactics that hamper truth, justice and reconciliation efforts aimed at addressing the legacy of grave human rights violations during the 1998-99 armed conflict in the region, a UN expert said today.
BELGRADE (2 December 2022) – Serbia and Kosovo* must end politicised tactics that hamper truth, justice and reconciliation efforts aimed at addressing the legacy of grave human rights violations during the 1998-99 armed conflict in the region, a UN expert said today.
At the end of an 11-day official visit to Serbia and Kosovo, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Fabián Salvioli, raised concerns about the lack of cooperation among authorities in Belgrade and Pristina in the transitional justice process.
The UN expert noted in his statement that questions about the fate and whereabouts of missing persons and the pursuit of criminal justice for war crimes have dominated the transitional justice process in Serbia and Kosovo since the end of the conflict. He welcomed initiatives adopted by relevant authorities for truth-seeking and justice, but noted that progress had been “alarmingly slow”.
“Lack of cooperation often driven by political agendas have brought progress to a halt,” the Special Rapporteur said.
Salvioli urged Serbia and Kosovo to intensify efforts to bring perpetrators of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law to justice, regardless of their ethnic affiliation. “The search for missing persons and cooperation between Serbia and Kosovo, including in the Working Group of Missing Persons, must be resumed without further delay,” he said. “The families of missing persons find themselves hostage to political interests and to the unwillingness of authorities, who fail to take steps to end their suffering.”
The UN expert also warned about restrictive legal frameworks in Serbia and Kosovo which hamper access to reparations by all victims of the conflict. “I call on relevant authorities in Belgrade and Pristina to improve their respective legal frameworks to ensure that all victims can access reparation without discrimination,” the expert said.
He expressed concern about the insufficient recognition and commemoration of the harm suffered by all victims to the conflict. “The acknowledgement of suffering and dignity of all victims is vital to an effective process of transition and reconciliation,” the UN expert said, urging authorities to ensure transmission of their stories to current and future generations through school curricula and textbooks, cultural activities and the media.
“The legacy of past violations with all its complexities must be adequately and comprehensively addressed to move the process of social reconciliation forward. Victims must be placed at the very centre of this process,” Salvioli said.
The Special Rapporteur observed the extensive use of ethnocentric, nationalistic and biased narratives about the conflict in fields of education, memorialisation, culture and the media in both Serbia and Kosovo. “The manipulation of past events and the concomitant exaltation of nationalistic and ethnic-related sentiments for political motivation, is short-sighted, ill-advised and an act of public irresponsibility which can lead to the recurrence of violence,” he said.
He urged authorities to ensure that narratives and history textbooks do not become sources of future conflicts.
During his visit, the UN expert met government officials, civil society and human rights representatives, survivors of war crimes, families of victims, and representatives of the international community. He also visited mass grave sites, former concentration camps, and memorials dedicated to remembering the past.
The Special Rapporteur will submit a full report on his visit to the Human Rights Council in 2023.

Title: National report on inclusive education presented
Content: 23 November 2022
Progress achieved in inclusion of children from vulnerable groups.
Belgrade, 23 November 2022 - Although conditions are in place for children from vulnerable groups to have equal access to education in the Republic of Serbia, there is still more work to be done on their full inclusion. The groups of children who most often have problems with inclusion and staying in inclusive education are children with developmental and/or other disabilities, as well as members of the Roma community and children of a lower socioeconomic status. These are just some of the conclusions of the National Report on Inclusive Education, which was presented today at the National Assembly, at the meeting organized by the Ministry of Education, UNICEF and the Delegation of the European Union to Serbia. The findings of this report will be the starting point for planning and implementing measures of importance for the development of this sector.
The process of transforming education into inclusive education in the Republic of Serbia began in 2009, with the entry into force of the Law on Foundations of the Education System, and many visible results have been achieved since then. The legislative, strategic and institutional framework has been largely reformed in areas relevant for the realization and protection of the rights of children from vulnerable groups, including changes in the field of education and anti-discrimination, as well as capacity-building for the implementation of inclusive education at the level of educational institutions, and at the local and national level. The reforms have also intensively continued through the adoption of the new Education Development Strategy until 2030.
“Since the introduction of judicial reforms in 2009, continual progress has been made in the implementation of inclusive education, primarily through an increase in the number of children from vulnerable groups at schools and preschools, in which the quality and capacity for implementation of inclusive education have been improved, as well as in the creation of an additional support system for children and students and their families. The number of children under the age of 3 included in preschool education programs is increasing, and in the school year of 2020/2021, for the first time in the past ten years, it was higher than 30 percent. The number of students exercising the right to an individual educational plan is continuously increasing, the number of primary school students at schools for children with developmental disabilities is decreasing as education at regular schools becomes accessible and good quality, while the number of students with developmental and other disabilities in secondary education is increasing to provide them with qualifications for the labor market. At primary schools, 17,000 students are being taught according to individualized teaching and learning programs, unique for each student. The number of personal assistants has increased, and this service is used by over 1,800 children with developmental and other disabilities, and support to these students.is also provided by 260 teaching assistants at schools. The Republic of Serbia has largely reformed the legislative, strategic and institutional framework, and although significant progress has been made, the data from the report indicate that certain challenges still remain, so in the coming period we must continue to work systematically on improving inclusivity of the education system,” said Branko Ružić, Minister of Education of the Republic of Serbia.
The inclusion of every child in the teaching and learning process is one of the main goals of the European Union's support to the process of reform of education in Serbia. For this purpose, the European Union has invested more than EUR 100 million in this sector since 2003.
“Serbia has made great strides in the past 13 years since a strong commitment to inclusive education was made. However, today’s report also indicates that there are children who are still left behind for various social or economic reasons. Keeping all these and other different needs in mind, education systems need to keep evolving to become flexible enough and ready to embrace every child, youth, or adult on their lifelong learning pathway and for this all stakeholders must be engaged. Quality and inclusiveness are among the fundamental strategic priorities that the EU strives to in its education system, and it will continue to provide coordinated support to Serbian education system as well,” said Emanuele Giaufret, Ambassador and Head of the Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Serbia.
The Delegation of the European Union to Serbia and UNICEF have been supporting the efforts of the Ministry of Education in improving inclusive education in the Republic of Serbia for years. This process particularly pertains to supporting the development of legal, strategic, institutional, human and technical capacities for planning, implementation, coordination and monitoring of inclusive education and its promotion as quality education for every child.
Data from the new external evaluation cycle show that among the most poorly achieved indicators are those that directly or indirectly show the inclusivity level of schools, and that there is significant room for improving various aspects of work of educational institutions. At the local level, there is often a lack of appropriate models and mechanisms that enable, support and improve the educational and social inclusion of children from vulnerable groups.
“The National Report on Inclusive Education is a good guide for how to proceed. Improving the capacities and empowering teachers and schools as agents for change is the first step. When teachers are motivated and skilled to include all children into their classes, the level and standard of learning increases – both for children with and without disabilities. When children learn in a mainstream class in mainstream schools where diversity is celebrated, education delivers its best outcomes for all students. In this way, social inclusion is enabled, while discrimination and education segregation are prevented, resulting in a decrease of school drop-out,” believes Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Representative in Serbia.
Accessible, quality, and fair education is only possible if all children, including those from vulnerable social groups, are included in a school system that provides them with quality support to learn what they need for life. The essence of inclusive education is to find the most effective way to give every child full support to learn together with their peers and develop the skills they need to progress. This is an investment in the present and the future - an investment in the children of today and in those who will shape our society in the future.

Title: U.S. donated new equipment for healthcare and research facilities in Serbia
Content: 23 November 2022
Belgrade, 23 November 2022 – Today, U.S. Ambassador Christopher R. Hill and UNDP Resident Representative Yakup Beris officially handed over life-saving new medical analysis equipment to the Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering (IMGGE). This equipment will help the Institute to strengthen Serbia’s capacity to detect, treat and mitigate coronaviruses and other infections.
The donation includes four devices for research and analysis of human and viral genomes and a digital PCR system for the precise measurement of viral particles in samples. It will enable accurate diagnostics and adequate treatment for patients with COVID-19 and other infections, early recognition of high-risk patients in need of hospital care, mapping of particularly susceptible individuals in the population based on genetic markers and faster development of new, innovative therapies and vaccines. The value of the donation is $605,000.
On the occasion of the handover of the donation today at IMGGE, Jelena Begović PhD, Minister of Science, Technological Development and Innovation, said: "With this initiative and donation, the United States has contributed to the strengthening of scientific and research capacities in Serbia, primarily for tackling the current pandemic, as well as to the empowerment of the Center for genome sequencing and bioinformatics within the Institute, which will have an impact on the improvement of diagnostics, treatment of other diseases and development of new technologies".
“There is no field more complex, challenging, and full of hope for the future as biotechnology”, said Ambassador Mr. Christopher R. Hill and added: “So many doors will open as a result of the research at this Institute in the future. These results will directly lead to longer and more healthy lives for all of us.”
The Director of IMGGE, Ivana Strahinić PhD, highlighted that the new equipment will primarily allow them to continue sequencing and comparative monitoring of mutations in the human genome and SARS-CoV-2 strains, which will enable the identification of high-risk patients and determination of adequate therapy. Dr Strahinić reminded that the Institute is an authorized institution for performing molecular diagnostics of rare diseases in Serbia, and added: "Until now, our capacity to perform a large number of molecular genetic analyses on a monthly basis was limited. The new equipment, procured within this initiative, will allow us to increase the number of analyses, but also to start introducing new ones that have so far been done only abroad. Additionally, the new equipment will significantly improve the level of molecular diagnostics and the introduction of personalized approach in the treatment of cancer, rare diseases, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, raising the standards of treatment to the highest level. Future research will be focused on genetic predispositions for tumor development, as well as on pharmacogenomic, epidemiological and population studies as a basis for designing new drugs. This will enable effective introduction of personalized therapy in Serbia and the region. The new equipment will also speed up the implementation of the ongoing project related to the sequencing of the first 1000 genomes of the population in the Balkans," added Dr Strahinić.
“This USAID donation enables research that gives us a glimpse into the potential of biotechnology, said Mr. Yakup Beris UNDP Serbia Resident Representative, adding: Benefits of using biotech in medicine, agriculture and tackling environmental degradation – are clear. This innovative approach integrating several disciplines - could help us simultaneously achieve multiple Sustainable Development Goals. UNDP in Serbia will continue to support the Government, academia and others - to develop bio-tech enabled solutions. In parallel we need to prepare adequate regulation, to ensure that these new technologies are developed, tested, and used for the benefit of the whole society, leaving no one behind”.
The donation of equipment for IMGGE is part of the $2.75 million "Together against COVID" project, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Government of Serbia.

Title: UNDP Special Report on Human Security Presented at 5th International Academic Human Security Conference in Belgrade
Content: 07 November 2022
Mr. Heriberto Tapia, Senior Researcher at the UN Human Development Report Office, and the lead author of UNDP’s 2022 Special Report on Human Security presented the document at the fifth International Academic Human Security Conference in Belgrade, Serbia on 4-5 November 2022. The conference promoted the Human Security concept among scientists and researchers from around the world.
The report underlines that human security is at the core of the severe and interlinked threats we are facing today. New data and analysis in the 2022 Special Report, New Threats to Human Security in the Anthropocene, show that people’s sense of safety and security is at a low in almost every country, including the richest countries, despite years of upwards development success. To tackle this, disconnect between development and perceived security, the report calls for greater solidarity across borders and a new approach to development.
Addressing the conference participants, Mr. Yakup Beris, UNDP Serbia Resident Representative, said that UNDP in partnership with the Government supports the country and society in dealing with multiple crises – from poverty to climate change, energy, health, gender-based violence, regional confidence-building to the long-term challenge of depopulation. UNDP, through SEESAC, has also been actively supporting the governments in Southeast Europe to combat illicit possession, misuse, and arms trafficking, and promote gender equality in security sector reform with the aim to increase safety in the region.
The conference, organized by the Faculty of Security Studies of the University of Belgrade and the Institute of International Politics and Economics, gathered more than 75 participants from 26 countries including international organizations representatives, government officials, and leading academic scholars.
This year’s conference entitled “Innovation, Research, and Knowledge in the (re)configuration of Human Security”, was supported by UNDP SEESAC within the second phase of SEESAC’s Strengthening of Regional Cooperation on Gender Mainstreaming in Security Sector Reform in the Western Balkans project.

Title: Media - an important ally in ending gender violence
Content: 27 October 2022
A debate on ethical media reporting on violence against women.
Belgrade, October 27, 2022 – A public debate on media reporting on violence against women was held today at UN House in Belgrade. The aim of this discussion was to answer to the question of how media reporting can contribute to the creation of a society in which violence is unacceptable and victims receive appropriate protection.
The discussion was officially opened by Brankica Janković, Commissioner for the Protection of Equality and Yakup Beris, UNDP Serbia Resident Representative.
“It is the responsibility of all of us not to stay silent and not to accept widespread relativization and sensationalism, but to raise awareness about violence against women being the worst and most shameful form of the violation of human rights. It cannot be tolerated nor justified, but must be combated and sanctioned “, stated Brankica Janković, Commissioner for the Protection of Equality.
The Commissioner pointed out that media have an important role in eliminating stereotypes dominant in the patriarchal culture, and added: “Unfortunately, we still see disputable wording of news titles and inappropriate photographs, and that is why I urge journalists and editors not to be motivated by the fight for clicks, viewers and number of copies sold in these cases, but to keep in mind that this is about the life of someone’s wife, mother, sister or daughter.“
Yakup Beris, UNDP Serbia Resident Representative stated: „Recognizing the important role media have in society, their power to place certain topics in focus and shape public opinion, UNDP, together with other sister UN agencies, supports journalists to report ethically on violence against women. In partnership with national and local public institutions and media, we are contributing to the achievement of gender equality and to building an environment where violence against women is not tolerated. “
Members of the group ‘Journalists against violence’, Jovana Gligorijević (Vreme weekly), Ana Manojlović (Radio Television of Serbia) and Iva Paradjanin (Tampon zona podcast), stated that it is of great importance that editors understand that violence against women is a specific topic and journalists with special training and experience should be sent to report on it. They also pointed out that journalists should be encouraged to receive additional training on this topic.  They added that media should use reporting on concrete cases of violence to shed light on the entire phenomenon, its causes and consequences, not only for the survivor, but for the wider community.
„We are making an effort, and I think we’ve achieved to respect the guidelines pointed out so many times by civil society organizations dedicated to this topic and journalists from group ‘Journalists against violence‘. We pay special attention not to cause secondary victimization in any way. Unfortunately, not all employees have had the chance to participate in trainings for journalists on how to report on this sensitive topic. However, we do have many who have, and who always react when there is news about a femicide or violence against women and provide guidelines on how to approach the topic and place information in the proper way. We try to deal with the problem of violence against women as a phenomenon and provide solutions. That is how we select our interviewees”, stated Igor Božić, Program Director of N1 Television.
Editor-in-Chief of Kurir, Aleksandar Đondović pointed out that Adria Media Group has introduced the position of the Manager for Ethical Standards and in doing so made a step towards self-regulation.
“In the last two and a half years, we have worked systematically on the improvement of ethical standards in Kurir, and achieved results also include reporting on violence against women. Permanent work with the editorial office, above all, continuous staff training, has contributed to improved results year after year, and it is my great pleasure to say that improvements have been noticed, besides employees, by our readers, but also colleagues from other media and associations. Our goal, as a ‘premium tabloid’ paper, is to show that it is possible to be current, fast, attractive, while respecting ethics”, Đondović added.
Dragan Kecman, Editor-in-Chief of the Story magazine stated that ’lifestyle’ media for women approach the topic of violence against women with increased seriousness, and that in the recent years great changes have occurred in the way concrete cases of violence on the public scene are reported on.
„Unfortunately, this is a topic lifestyle media deal with mainly when the perpetrator or survivors belong to the jet-set, music or film scene and there is a lack of will to interest readers in learning more about the topic through interviews with psychologists or representatives of institutions. What I find wrong in my field of work, is that we tend to quickly forgive and forget convicted perpetrators of violence who are public figures and we approach them as if nothing happened”, Kecman added.
On this occasion, Marija Janković, photo editor of the “Vreme” weekly opened the photo and illustration exhibition “An image for change”. It includes works that represent the problem of violence against women in an ethical way. The exhibition, placed at the UN House until December 10, 2022, represents a selection of works from the database for free use by media, available at: https://novinarkeprotivnasilja.org/en/no-base/
The Group „Journalists against violence“ developed Guidelines and training for journalists to help them report ethically on violence against women in all segments of their work– from how they behave in the field, to approaching survivors of violence, witnesses, as well as to the selection of interviewees and formulations they use when writing texts and titles.
The discussion was organized within the project “Integrated Response to Violence against Women in Serbia III”, implemented jointlyby UNICEF, UN Women, UNFPA and UNDP in partnership with the Government of the Republic of Serbia and with support of the Government of Sweden.

Title: Merging strengths in the region for free media and safer journalism
Content: 20 October 2022
Journalists and stakeholders from Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia come together to discuss how to advance media freedom and safety of journalists.
Budva, Montenegro – 18 -19 October 2022
Freedom of the media and safety of journalists were at the heart of a two-day regional meeting of 30 journalists, editors, researchers and civil society representatives from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia in Budva, Montenegro.
Facilitated by UN human rights teams in the three countries and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, participants discussed how to ensure an enabling and conducive environment for journalists and other media personnel so that they can safely, freely and effectively investigate and report on issues of public interest in a professional manner.
Protection for journalists in the region was highlighted as insufficient, with many attacks and threats remaining unpunished. Participants underlined the importance of better institutional responses and the need to improve laws and policies and guarantee better implementation.
They shared good practices, of associations and unions which are playing a critical role in advocating for the rights of journalists, and of existing mechanisms like commissions dealing with attacks against journalists and hotlines to report threats and attacks and to elicit rapid responses. They also shared experiences of how they engage in the important work of fact-checking.
“Information is oxygen for a well-functioning democracy”, said Dragiša Janjušević, State Secretary in the Ministry of Public Administration, who noted the importance of access to information and highlighted the commitment to increased transparency in the new 2022-2026 Strategy on Public Administration Reform.
Looking forward, participants recommended a number of actions like improving the status of journalists, their labour conditions and social protection; empowering them to more effectively stand up for their rights through continuous training and capacity building; making more use of United Nations human rights mechanisms; specialized trainings for the police, the judiciary, and other institutions to ensure accountability for threats and attacks against journalists and to prevent Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPP) against them; and establishing independent mechanisms to allocate more and transparent funding for the media.  “Freedom of the media should become an important political question, so that it can be truly realized and existing impunity can end”, one participant said.
Participants asked the UN to advocate with decision makers to respect and protect a free media, to provide technical support, training on hate speech and its boundaries with the freedom of expression, and facilitate exchanges between journalists in the region. “UN international human rights treaties and relevant action plans provide important guidelines for all media organizations, and we should work harder to promote them through a strategic effort between the media and the UN,” one participant said.
Participants clearly recognized the need for more cross-border collaboration to better address and counter incitement to hostility, violence, and discrimination, as well as hate speech, both online and offline, noting how this is especially affecting women journalists.
Acting General Director Neđeljko Rudović of the Media Directorate in the Ministry of Culture and Media informed of ongoing efforts to improve the legal and strategic framework to guarantee freedom of the media. “We are not a free people if we do not have a free media”, Mr. Rudović emphasized.
Through interventions from the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders, the Vice Chair of the UN Human Rights Committee, and OHCHR in Geneva, participants heard how they can engage with UN human rights mechanisms as part of their own protection and advocacy strategies to promote and protect media freedom, access to information, and the safety of journalists.
The meeting was organized under the joint OHCHR-UNESCO Global Drive on Media Freedom, Access to Information, and Safety of Journalists, which is funded by the Kingdom of the Netherlands. representatives of the OSCE and the Council of Europe, based in Montenegro, attended as observers.

Title: Every Fifth Adolescent Reports Feelings of Nervousness – There Is a Need to Strengthen Psychosocial Support for Children and Adolescents
Content: 19 October 2022
How to Improve the Mental Health and Wellbeing of Children and Young People in Serbia.
Belgrade, 19 October 2022 - As many as 17 percent of children and young people in Serbia noticed a deterioration in their mental health during the pandemic, every sixth adolescent aged 16 to 17 is at risk of poor mental health, and more than 21 percent report a feeling of nervousness on a weekly basis. These are just some of the findings presented at today’s conference How to Improve the Mental Health and Wellbeing of Children and Young People in Serbia. The event was organized by UNICEF in cooperation with the Government of the Republic of Serbia and other relevant institutional partners and civil society organizations.
The conference brought together local and international experts, representatives of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Dr. Laza Lazarevic Institute for Mental Health, and the Clinic for Psychiatric Diseases. The event was also attended by representatives of health centres, schools, and centres for social work from Kragujevac, Subotica and Zrenjanin, where services are being developed and will focus on psychosocial support and mental health of young people.
Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Representative in Serbia, opened the event, emphasizing that UNICEF, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Serbia, is working on the development of innovative ways to strengthen and improve the system for mental health protection and psychosocial support for well-being children and young people.
“Good mental health care for children and adolescents starts with community mobilization and building resilient societies. Strengthening the multi-sectoral support systems and processes within existing structures and establishing referral pathways across primary health care, social welfare and protection, and education is a crucial step in this process. UNICEF stands ready to support the Government of Serbia in establishing a multisectoral system that enables the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children, adolescents, and their parents and caregivers. Stigma and prejudice related to mental health problems are pervasive. That’s why we should encourage adolescents to open up and talk about how they feel, to turn to someone for help if they need it, and to involve them in the process,” said Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Representative in Serbia.
One of the outcomes of the conference is the formation of a network of dedicated professionals, decision-makers, and young people. They will contribute to further strengthening the development of the mental health protection system and psychosocial support for children and adolescents in Serbia.
"Our education system is designed to provide young people with knowledge, skills and attitudes relevant to various life situations that require their functional application. One of the cross-curricular competencies is a responsible attitude towards health, and topics on healthy lifestyles and habits are provided in the teaching and learning programs for each class, within the programme contents of compulsory subjects, project teaching and free teaching activities.
On the other hand, the education system is established to respond to acute situations of risky behaviours, but what is more important, our schools also implement a range of activities that prevent such undesirable behaviours. Schools, not only undertake measures of increased educational work for all students, but also work to strengthen the family and its educational role in order to provide adequate parental support to children.
Parents and schools, and their two-way and constructive cooperation, are crucial for an adequate response. The most important thing is to educate young people about the importance of mental health and influence the removal of stigma that can lead to discrimination and prevent children and young people from seeking help from professionals. They need to be encouraged to share what they are thinking and feeling with their parents, teachers and other professionals. It is important, first of all, to build trust and establish an open relationship that will enable an open conversation with young people about the problems they face and how the community can help,” said Slavica Djukic Dejanovic, Advisor to the Prime Minister and to the First Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia
Other specific expected outcomes are the expressed commitment of decision-makers to revise relevant programmes, improve knowledge about the latest scientific findings and approaches to support the improvement of the mental health of young people. In addition, the establishment of an interdepartmental group for the implementation of programme monitoring activities is expected, as well as reducing the stigma that affects adolescents, parents, and young people.
“While the importance of promoting and protecting the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents is obvious, we also need to address mental health across society including workers, elderly, people living with chronic diseases, victims of violence, among others. We need science behind everything, we need to hear from the community what the problems are and to provide support according to these insights,” Fabio Scano, WHO Representative for Serbia and Special Envoy of the WHO Regional Director for the Western Balkans.
When it comes to the National Programme for the Protection of Mental Health in the Republic of Serbia for the period 2019-2026, it emphasizes the necessity of improving the mental health of particularly sensitive groups, such as young people. The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Serbia, in cooperation with UNICEF, is working on the development of innovative ways to strengthen and improve the system for mental health protection and psychosocial support for the well-being of this group of citizens.
“It is up to all of us, who want to contribute to the field of mental health, to make an effort to listen to our young people, to find the right path together and build a quality support network, to help parents and to influence the development of empathy from an early age and be the ones who will take the time to listen and ask, How are you?. Our campaign asks the question: How are you? Really and we may not immediately get a completely honest answer to this question, but it is of great importance that we do not forget to ask it again,” said Milica Veljkovic, member of UNICEF’s Youth Mental Health Network.
Overall efforts are aimed at developing mental health awareness and strengthening the capacity of experts for early detection of signs of disorders and crises, providing, and monitoring the effectiveness of mental health care services and psychosocial support for young people. Improving access to various age-appropriate services, identifying the need to change relevant policies during the piloting of this programme, as well as its future implementation across Serbia is a priority.
UNICEF Serbia plans to create sustainable solutions in cooperation with the private sector and the business community in order to create a support system for young people and adolescents in Serbia who face mental health issues.
UNICEF Serbia and Maybelline have joined forces and are starting a campaign so that young people facing challenges will receive professional support. Thanks to the support of Maybelline, young people will be able to chat with experts about their problems every day from 18:00 to 22:00 via the svejeok.rs website.

Title: EU PRO Plus 2023 Calendar Competition "What is your Super Skill?"
Content: 17 October 2022
The European Union (EU) programme for local development - EU PRO Plus has today opened an award-winning art competition for high school students from 99 cities and municipalities in the regions of Šumadija and Western and Southern and Eastern Serbia on the topic "What is your Super Skill?". With the support of the EU and the Ministry of European Integration, the competition has traditionally been organised for more than a decade now with a view to encouraging creativity and to motivating them to be active in their communities.
This year's theme, which follows the decision of the European Commission to declare 2023 the European Year of Skills, should encourage young people to recognize and present their talents and interests in and out of school in an artistic format, as well as to find out what kind of education in the country and abroad  would help them to transform their talents into professional skills, which will respond to the new needs of the labor market and which they would apply in their future professions.
The high school pupils, as well as the general public, will be able to vote online, through the EU PRO Plus programme website, and thus select 12 works from a narrow competition of the 20 best works, previously selected by the internal jury. Online voting opens after the competition closes and will last for five days. The “voice of the audience” will participate as the fifth member of the jury and with that vote, the jury members will choose the 12 best works that will be found on the pages of the EU PRO Plus programme calendar for 2023.
The authors of the 12 winning works will receive prizes, laptops and tablet computers and mobile phones, while the school that proves to be the most engaged in organisation of the internal school contest, during which the works for participation in the competition will be selected, will be awarded a laptop and a projector
The competition is open until 20 November, 2022, while the propositions  are available on the EU PRO Plus website.

Title: National Dialogue – World Food Day
Content: 17 October 2022
As part of activities related to the World Food Day (October 16), established in 1945, by the United Nations when the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) was founded, a National Dialogue was held in Belgrade, organised by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, FAO and the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Belgrade.
The main topic of the dialogue was „Leave No One Behind“, with the aim to raise awareness about food security towards more efficient production, quality nutrition, improvement of environment and daily habits. Participants spoke about how we can transform our food systems by implementing sustainable and holistic approaches that include long-term sustainable development, inclusive growth and greater resilience.
Vedrana Ilić, Assistant Minister of Agriculture highlighted the following:
Food is a basic right connected to wellbeing and health of all people, and as we expect that by 2050 global population will reach 10 billion, our imperative must be to produce more food for more people and to do so in a sustainable manner.
We have to take advantage of strength of knowledge to improve food systems, to ensure secure and accessible food for all and at the same time to foster natural resources and fight against climate change.
In my personal opinion, sustainable food systems are created by development of best agricultural practices, implementation of green technologies, improvement of food distribution systems and reduction of food waste.
Dr Fabio Scano, a.i. of the UN Resident Coordinator, WHO Serbia Representative and Special Envoy of the Regional Director for the Western Balkans stated the following:
Working on food systems means much more than working on agriculture and food production, overweight and obesity. It means to bring all the dots that matter that connect nature, farmers, business, health and science together to build a better, healthier and greener world.
Dr Dušan Živković, Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture noted:
The problem of food and the quality of food that we consume is a question more pressing than ever. The Faculty of Agriculture aims to contribute to education at all levels, from farmers to students, through cooperation with institutions and all in accordance with promotion of sustainable approach to food and principles of green agriculture.

Panel participants agreed in the end, that it is necessary to ensure the sustainability of food systems, which is primarily reflected in finding solutions for the production of a sufficient amount of healthy food in such a way that the basic economic, social and ecological assumptions used for production do not threaten the nutrition and life of future generations.

Title: On World Food Day, let’s strengthen our resolve to work together so that no one is left behind
Content: 16 October 2022
Op-Ed by Vladimir Olegovich Rakhmanin
FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Europe and Central Asia
Every year on 16 October, the observance of World Food Day is led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). It is a day to reflect on what we can do, collectively, to end hunger. It is a day for us to work for the 3.1 billion people around the world who cannot afford a healthy diet and the 828 million people who go to bed hungry each day. It is a day to decide what can be done to end the famine and malnutrition that are leading to loss of lives and putting at risk a healthy future for our children – globally, as well as in Europe and Central Asia.
Although we have made progress towards building a better world, progress has slowed down recently. The world has faced many global crises in the past two years that resulted in too many people being left behind. The COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather events disrupting food production, rising food and energy prices and conflicts have affected our region, too. Hunger and malnutrition are rising and more people are falling into poverty. It is time, now more than ever, for us to work together to build a new era of hope, for everyone, everywhere.
We must take actions to ensure that everyone has access to safe, affordable and nutritious food at all times. But we must act together. Lasting change can only come from concerted, determined collective action.
One important and pervasive shift that FAO is leading is that of transforming food systems and facilitating market access and integration. This initiative will work to transform food systems to be more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient and more sustainable, for better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life for all. Our agrifood systems hold great potential for a more equitable and prosperous future, as they are interlinked to many areas of our lives and economy – from agriculture to natural resources, to energy, to health to name a few.
Here in Europe and Central Asia, the sustainable development of agrifood systems is affected by the socio-political transitions underway. In the region, FAO is supporting the development of national and regional trade policies to create more sustainable agrifood systems.
But to achieve this goal we must act as a global society. We need to support countries at risk of hunger, malnutrition and famine, helping them to transform agrifood systems, funding humanitarian appeals and boosting resilience. Greater priority must be given to increasing local nutritious food production, preserving natural resources and to valorizing local traditions and culturally significant land and agroecosystems maintained by farmers with traditional knowledge.
Collectively, we need to empower the most vulnerable, including smallholder producers, by investing in agrifood systems. This means finding ways to offer improved access to training, incentives, science, data, technology and innovation, putting smallholders at the center of this transformation. Innovation and digitalization of agriculture can accelerate achieving better livelihoods for smallholder farmers by giving them access to important local information, such as on weather, soil conditions, irrigation, recovery with insurance after such events as flooding, local market prices for crops and pest control. In Europe and Central Asia under the regional initiative to empower smallholders, family farms and youth, FAO is supporting the development of digitally skilled rural communities. The goal is to help smallholders gain diversification of incomes and can enable both on- and off-farm employment and business opportunities for today and the future.
Decent employment is fundamental to human dignity. We need decent rural employment and services, while fostering gender equality and supporting rural communities. At the same time, governments need to provide timely and well-targeted social protection programmes that protect the most fragile.
Let this World Food Day be a reminder of the need to accelerate these efforts, and strive for a future where no one is left behind, and where everyone has access to healthy and affordable food.

Title: SEESAC and Ministry of Internal Affairs of Republic of Serbia Work Together to Enhance Fight Against Trafficking and Illicit Possession of Firearms
Content: 14 October 2022
Supported by the European Union, SEESAC organised a workshop on the development of Standard Operating Procedures for the Criminal Police and the Firearm Focal Point of Serbia in Aranđelovac on 10-14 October 2022. The workshop aimed at enhancing the authorities’ capacities to counter trafficking, misuse, and illicit possession of firearms.
The need for such a workshop has been identified in the recommendations and conclusions presented in the Needs Assessment Report on Capacities of the Criminal Police of Serbia to counter illicit trafficking and possession of firearms which is a result of a field visit and a detailed assessment of the Criminal Police that SEESAC conducted in Serbia in July 2021.
Additionally, as a further step of the support to the enhancement of capacities of the criminal police of Serbia, funds are allocated for the procurement of the equipment assessed as needed and related training.
These activities are being organised with the support provided through the EU Council Decision 2019/2111 in support of arms control activities in South East Europe in the framework of the EU Strategy to combat the illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition.

Title: Serbia gets Disaster Risk Register
Content: 13 October 2022
More than 50 experts at an international conference in Belgrade.
Belgrade, 13 October 2022 – The two-day conference titled “Disaster Risk Reduction – Models and Practices at International and National Level” was opened today in Belgrade, organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Emergency Management Sector of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Serbia and the Faculty of Security of the University of Belgrade, and with the support by the European Union (EU). In order to provide answers concerning the ways to make our society less vulnerable to emergencies such as floods, landslides, earthquakes and forest fires, the conference has gathered more than 50 renowned experts from Serbia, the region and European countries.
Head of Operations in the EU Delegation to Serbia, Sakelaris Hourdas said that the disaster risk reduction project, implemented by UNDP, also envisages reconstruction of the facilities for training of civil protection units in Kraljevo, as well as new buildings for the headquarters of the Emergency Management Sector.
“The same building could also house the 112 Hotline Centre, so as to provide more efficient and urgent help to citizens. Accordingly, in 2021, the EU funded preparations for the establishment of the Single European Emergency Number 112, its detailed design and analysis, thereby establishing necessary steps in order to make this service fully operative and in line with the EU standards. Moreover, the project offered a series of workshops and study visits to different emergency hotline centres in EU member states to the Emergency Management Sector. We hope that competent authorities would priorities the activation of the 112 number in the following months,” said Hourdas.
Assistant to the Minister of the Interior and Chief of the Emergency Management Sector, Luka Čaušić, pointed out that this sector, as well as the entire Ministry had worked extensively on developing their capacities, primarily through adoption of a series of laws and bylaws pertaining to risk reduction, prevention, preparation and response to weather-related and other disasters.
“Through a series of strategic projects, including continuous employment of new Sector staff, support to the establishment of voluntary firefighting associations and development of civil protection units, and renewal of fire brigades’ vehicle fleet through the obtainment and production of domestic firefighting vehicles, the Ministry has largely improved the situation in this field, and would continue to invest more and more efforts in this direction. Climate changes are indisputably unrelenting, and it is no longer the question of if, but rather when such emergencies will occur, and it is therefore highly important to have all the systems of protection and rescue, as well as the entire society activated and involved, so that we could be ready for the oncoming challenges,” said Čaušić.
UNDP Deputy Resident Representative in Serbia, Anas Qarman, highlighted the importance of strengthening the measures of prevention and improvement of readiness for action in emergencies.
“In order to decrease the amount of material damage and the number of lives that may be put at risk due to disasters, it is necessary to achieve coordination of efforts by the national and local institutions, civil protection services and business sector. Furthermore, we need to utilise relevant findings of the academic community and exchange experiences with other countries, which is actually the aim of this conference,” added Qarman.
Representatives of the Emergency Management Sector of the MoI of Serbia and Republic Geodetic Authority (RGA) revealed to the public the Disaster Risk Register. This interactive digital database, established on the RGA’s Geoportal, offers all the citizens of Serbia the data concerning risks on concrete locations. This would help them become better informed when making decisions concerning the selection of a place to live or invest money in, as well as to timely undertake prevention measures. Furthermore, due to the Disaster Risk Register, decision-makers will have real-time data at their disposal, which would contribute to the improvement of urban planning, as well as of the velocity and quality of intervention in the moments of crises.
The second day of the conference (14 October) would involve discussions concerning adequate prevention measures that may increase the readiness of the economy, healthcare system and local self-governments for emergencies. Another topic for discussion would involve the manner in which building of the society’s resilience to climate changes may contribute to the reduction of emergency risks.
These issues will be talked about by representatives of the competent authorities of the Republic of Serbia and countries in the region, local self-governments of Serbia and Czech Republic, international organisations such as the World Bank, World Health Organisation and the FAO – United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation, as well as professors and researchers of universities from Serbia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Greece, Denmark and Sweden.
The main conclusions from the conference will be used to develop a monograph which would become a part of the regular curriculum of the Faculty of Security in Belgrade. This would contribute to the improvement of the quality of education for future professionals in the field.
The “Disaster Risk Reduction – Models and Practices at International and National Level” conference is held as a part of the initiative “EU for Serbia Resilient to Disasters”, financed by the European Union and implemented by UNDP. The goal of this initiative is to help Serbia in decreasing its vulnerability to disasters and increasing its resilience to climate changes.

Title: Additional $4.9 Million Support for a “Greener” Serbia
Content: 10 October 2022
More than 80 solutions from all over the country selected for green transformation of the economy and society.
Belgrade, 10 October 2022 – Today, as a part of the initiative “EU for Green Agenda in Serbia”, a presentation has been held for more than 80 innovative solutions selected for further support, so as to be implemented in practice and contribute to a quicker green transformation of the Serbian economy and society. These solutions arrived in response to 4 public calls that were issued, in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in cooperation with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and European Investment Bank (EIB).
Today, at the media conference organised to present the selected “green” solutions, a new partnership was announced with the Government of Switzerland, as well as additional financial support by Switzerland to the “EU for Green Agenda in Serbia” initiative and its implementation.
“We expect that the allocated national and donor funds for implementation of the innovative solutions submitted in response to these public calls, would encourage and stimulate other donors, as well as the banking and economy sectors and, to join us on the path of Serbia’s green transformation,” said Sandra Dokić, Assistant to the Minister of Environmental Protection.
She noted that a sustainable economic development of Serbia, paying particular attention to the environmental protection and wellbeing of all , was among the top priorities of the Serbian Government and the Ministry of Environmental Protection. She underscored that, the Government had adopted new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in August of this year to decrease the emission of greenhouse gases and that Serbia had thus shown its clear orientation towards decarbonisation of its economy and society.
“Switzerland is dedicated to combating climate change, both in Switzerland and all over the world. Through this contribution of $4.9 million and additionally planned $2.2 million especially dedicated to decarbonisation, Switzerland joins the common efforts of the Serbian Government, the donor community and the private sector, to combat climate change,” said Richard Kohli, Director of the Swiss Cooperation Department in Serbia.
“On the path towards climate neutrality, every effort matters! We have no time to waste, the entire planet is involved in this race to prevent catastrophic climate scenarios,” asserted Nicola Bertolini, Head of the Cooperation Department of the EU Delegation in Serbia, and added:
“Today we have two important pieces of news concerning our support to the Green Agenda in Serbia: we welcome the financial support by Switzerland to our initiative for accelerating green transition of the economy. Furthermore, we are announcing the results of 4 public calls. The participation was very good, with more than 140 applications, while the investment needs reached around 75 million euros. However, important efforts are still ahead and Serbia needs to make them, including adopting and implementing the Air Protection Programme 2022-2030, in order to protect the environment and health of the citizens.”
Responding to these public calls for solutions to increase energy production from renewable resources, decrease energy consumption, stimulate a circular waste-free economy, decrease pollution and improve the quality of air, renew forest ecosystems and implement greening of urban areas – as many as 140 solutions were submitted in just 5 months, from March to July this year. Public and private companies, local self-governments, science research institutions and civil society organisations from cities and municipalities from all over Serbia, proposed their innovative solutions for the implementation of the Green Agenda in Serbia.
Out of these applications, the jury of experts selected 83 proposals for the implementation of which would in practice contribute the most to the decrease of emission of greenhouse gases, dependence on fossil fuels, saving of energy and natural resources, as well as to the protection of people’s health and preservation of the environment. Additionally, these solutions would contribute to the greater competitiveness of Serbian companies in export markets, facilitate sustainable economic development and result in opening of new green professional positions.
“Swedish Government have cooperated for years with the Government of Serbia and the Ministry of Environmental Protection, but also with LSG representatives, NGO and industrial sectors, in improving environmental conditions and implementing climate reforms. We joined the initiative for the implementation of the Green Agenda in Serbia in order to support Serbia’s accession to the EU, especially through working on Cluster 4 and Chapter 27. The solutions submitted to address these challenges show that there are many actors in Serbia who wish to invest in green transition and become pioneers of this change in Serbian economy and society,” said Ida Reuterswärd, First Secretary of the Swedish Embassy in Serbia.
She also welcomed the Swiss Government’s joining the “EU for Green Agenda in Serbia” initiative and assessed that this would contribute to the improvement of the legislative framework, implementation of innovative solutions that would serve as inspiration to others, as well as to increased investing in the green transition.
“As the climate bank of the European Union, we wish to be a global driver of energy efficient and climate-oriented projects. The “EU for Green Agenda in Serbia” project is in line with these ambitions and we are glad to be able to help Serbia in transitioning to a green and sustainable economic model. Simultaneously, we believe that innovations are at the core of every economic transition, and this project confirms it, as it deals with a wide range of climate-related and environmental issues, which would consequently contribute to the advancement of Serbia and its citizens,” said Paul Hickey, urban and regional development specialist of the European Investment Bank.
Anas Qarman, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative in Serbia, pointed out that in the following period, the selected teams would undergo training and mentoring, and exchange experiences in order to prepare their innovative ideas as best they can for implementation in practice. “The best of them would receive initial funding, to the total amount of $6.4 million, due to the funds of the “EU for Green Agenda in Serbia” initiative and the additional resources provided by the Government of Switzerland. In order to enable as many of the innovative ideas as possible to receive the necessary financial support, UNDP would enable all the selected teams to present their project ideas to commercial banks and the donor community,” said Qaraman.
The selected solutions envisage the treatment of significant amounts of waste and wastewater from industrial facilities, the application of new technological solutions for a decreased consumption of resources and energy in industry, as well as an increased share of renewable energy resources such as sunlight and biomass.
Additionally, the selected innovations in the field of the circular economy include the collection, separation and recycling of different waste (organic waste, plastic, paper, metal, rubber, construction waste) for the purpose of further processing into new products (i.e. compost, fertilisers, cosmetic products), or in producing biogas.
Simultaneously, implementing all the proposed solutions for the renewal of forest ecosystems would result in a forested surface equalling 712 football fields.
In the field of fighting air pollution, the implementation of all the proposed ideas in practice would result in a higher quality of air for 2,300,000 citizens of Serbia.
The complete list of all the selected solutions from all four fields of the Green Agenda covered by the public calls thus far is available at this link.

Title: UN urges Europe to boost environmental ambition to fight planetary crisis
Content: 05 October 2022

Nicosia, Cyprus, 5 October 2022: Despite progress in certain areas, governments in the pan-European region must show far greater ambition in tackling climate change, protecting ecosystems and managing and tackling waste and pollution, stresses a new UN assessment presented to European ministers today.
The 7th pan-European environmental assessment, was today presented at the 9th Environment for Europe Ministerial Conference, the United Nations’ highest body on environmental policy in the region – covering 54 countries across the European Union, European Free Trade Association members, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
The joint report by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) calls for greater action to tackle the triple planetary crisis affecting climate, nature and pollution, whose effects are taking their toll more than ever on the lives and wellbeing of people in the pan-European region.
“The findings of this assessment almost halfway through Agenda 2030, must be a wake-up call for the region,” said UNECE Executive Secretary Olga Algayerova. “The historic drought the region faced this summer announced what we should expect in years to come and shows that there is no more time to lose. As highlighted in the report, the UN has developed multiple tools and approaches to cut pollution, step-up environmental protection, reduce resource use and foster the shift to a circular economy. Their implementation must be significantly accelerated. This will require urgent and bold political commitment and behavioural changes from all of us before it is too late”.
“We know what we need to do, and we must act together. As citizens feel the pinch and are facing higher energy bills than ever before, as they see record temperatures and their water reservoirs shrink, and the continent is confronted with other profound challenges, countries must show that there is a plan,” said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen. “The science is unequivocal. The only way forward is to secure a clean and green future. This assessment can be a guide for lowering emissions, a healthier environment for people and for nature, and better waste management and cleaner air”.
Greater efforts needed to tackle air pollution
Some progress has been made in the past years through the implementation of policies to tackle air pollution, but increased effort is needed, as air pollution remains the greatest health risk in the region. The report notes that between 2009 and 2018, 41 European countries recorded a 13% reduction in premature deaths due to long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Yet PM2.5 concentration continued to exceed the 2005 World Health Organization air quality guideline of 10 µg/m3 — 10 millionths of a gram per cubic metre of air — and the subsequent stricter 2021 limit of 5 µg/m3 across the entire region.
In response, the assessment calls for additional measures, including the use and further sharpening of the best available techniques to prevent emissions of particulate matter, NOx and hydrocarbons by the industry, and to reduce emissions from traffic by implementing emission standards known as Euro-6 and Euro-7. All countries should align ambient air quality standards with latest WHO guidelines.
Rising GHG emissions must be slashed
While all countries in the pan-European region have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, net emissions are still rising. Reductions, mostly achieved in the western part of Europe (2014–2019), are offset by the increase in emissions in the rest of the region.
The use of renewables increased in 29 countries in 2013-2017, but the region still largely relies on fossil fuels – accounting for some 78% of total final energy consumption. The share of renewables in the energy mix is rising more slowly than overall energy consumption in the region.
Governments should therefore eliminate or reform harmful subsidies and incentives (all countries in the region continue to implement fossil fuel subsidies) and develop effective incentives to deepen decarbonization by shifting promotion of investments towards renewable energy.
Cooperation remains key to address water challenges
The region’s river basins, lakes and aquifers are subject to multiple stresses, and climate change is delivering additional challenges for freshwater quantity and quality such as floods, droughts, water-borne diseases and biodiversity changes in aquatic ecosystems. Pollution and urban and industrial wastewater discharges remain significant and persistent organic contaminants are of public health concern. Together with reinforced measures to conserve water, improve efficiency of its use (such as through precision agriculture in irrigated crop production) and to harness nature-based solutions for water retention basins, the potential of non-conventional water sources such as recycled water should be explored.
Threatened land and marine ecosystems require concerted action
The status of ecosystems remains a cause for concern, with no evidence of a clear positive overall trend in the region, warns the assessment. Protected areas in the pan-European region have almost tripled over the past 30 years and an overall increase in forest area in the UNECE region of 33.5 million has been observed. Governments should ensure that trends in forest areas remain positive and take additional measures to safeguard the remaining primary and intact forests and their ecological functionality.
While marine protected areas have grown in area by 66% and terrestrial ones by 22% over the past five years, overall biodiversity loss continues to occur. Governments should eliminate or reform subsidies and incentives for products and activities that lead to biodiversity loss, and develop incentives to mainstream biodiversity conservation across sectors and policies.
A circular and a more efficient economy will help address growing waste and resource use
Even where a strong political commitment for a circular economy exists, such as in the European Union and other Western European countries, the amount of waste generated continues to grow. Recycling rates differ significantly among countries and are particularly low in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Municipal waste recycling rates above 45% exist only in a few EU countries and Switzerland. E-waste collection and recycling are highly deficient across all subregions.
In response, the assessment urges governments to step up waste prevention in production and consumption and repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing, including through financial incentives such as tax relief. A pan-European e-waste management partnership would enable the recovery of valuable resources.
Over the past half-century, the extraction of minerals has tripled globally, with the extraction and processing of natural resources accounting for over 90% of biodiversity loss and water stress and about 50% of climate change impacts. Governments in the region should adopt a circular – or resource efficient – economy approach and strengthen management of raw materials, including for example through the application of the UN Framework Classification for Resources and the UN Resource Management System.
Strengthened disaster resilience required
About 65% of the region’s population is covered by local disaster risk reduction strategies. Only 15 countries in the region reported that all their local authorities are implementing such strategies under SDG target 13.1; while 23 countries – which jointly represent a quarter of the region’s population ­– do not report on that target.
Green financing needed
As a share of GDP, public spending on environmental protection (with a maximum of around 0.8%) is much lower than environmental tax revenues, implying that revenues from environmental taxes are not earmarked for reducing environmental damage. Governments should therefore favour the development of green finance and consider spending on environmental protection in the wider context of environmental and public finance.
Sustainability must be at the heart of infrastructure development
Sustainable infrastructure investment has been recognized as one of the ways of achieving the greatest positive impact in the post-COVID pandemic recovery. However, most countries in the region have yet to develop mechanisms to incorporate sustainability considerations (such as climate risk) and externality accounting (e.g., the cost of pollution, ecosystem services, or biodiversity protection) into the cost-benefit analysis of large infrastructure projects. Existing tools offered by UNECE and UNEP can remedy this.
Education for Sustainable Development and a shared data system can strengthen environmental governance
The environmental governance system in the pan-European region remains fragmented in terms of applied policies, institutions, the harmonization of legislation and participation in multilateral environmental agreements. Gaps also remain in the implementation of good environmental governance, including in relation to public participation, transparency, responsiveness, effectiveness and efficiency.
Among solutions, the assessment points to further capitalising on the potential of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) to endow populations with capacities to play an active role in environmental governance.
The assessment also notes that while, the final review report on the establishment of the Shared Environmental Information System found that such national systems have been successfully established in all countries in Europe and Central Asia, that they vary in form and use and remaining gaps need to be addressed.

Title: International Day of Older Persons: Exhibition “Beauty of Ageing #2” to dispel stereotypes about older people
Content: 30 September 2022
Ahead of the International Day of Older Persons, Citizens Association "Strength of Friendship" - Amity, Photo Association of Serbia and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on 30th of September, 2022, opened a photo exhibition "Beauty of Aging 2" at Parobrod Gallery, Belgrade.

In our society, there are a large number of prejudices and myths about older age that contribute to the creation of a negative image. This stands in the way of healthy aging and makes it difficult for the older people to use their existing potential, lead a responsible, independent life, and also affects the relationships with older people. A negative image can lead to discrimination and marginalization of older people. It is necessary to nourish a positive attitude towards older people and encourage mutual appreciation and respect, which will have a positive impact on their quality of life, but also on the proper psychosocial development of children and young people.
With this photo exhibition, we want to dispel at least some of the prejudices and myths and to convey that older age is one of the normal developmental stages in an individual's life, but with a different arrangement of priorities, goals and opportunities compared to younger age.
Borka Jeremić, Head of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Office in Serbia, reminded that the increased share of older people is, among other things, a consequence of healthier and longer lives. "We must be aware of the contribution of older persons in our society through invaluable resources such as knowledge, skills and experience. With initiatives like this one, we create new narratives and break stereotypes about aging in Serbia", said Jeremić.
Nadežda Satarić, president of the Amity association, reminded of the contributions that older persons make to the family and society and thereby contribute to sustainable development, and pointed out the necessity of improving the protection of their human rights.
Miroslav Predojević, secretary of the Photo Association of Serbia, emphasized that the authors of the exhibited photos gave us a personal experience of the reality related to older people and their interests. So we too can look forward to the BEAUTY OF AGING, which everyone present here would like to experience themselves. It is an "ordinary person" who is not pulled out of a situation, but the author of the photograph follows them  in the moment, which is their current reality.
471 photos from 94 authors were submitted to the Competition for the best photo created in Serbia on the topic "Beauty of Ageing", which was announced in August 2022, from which the jury selected 75 works from 44 authors for this exhibition.
The "Beauty of Ageing 2" exhibition will be open to visitors until Friday, October 14, 2022, weekdays and Saturdays from 10 am to 10 pm.

Title: Improvement of social services at local level with the EU support
Content: 22 September 2022
The European Union through EU PRO Plus programme, implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of European integration, will support the improvement of social services in 23 local self-governments in the regions of Šumadija and Western Serbia and Southern and Eastern Serbia. With 521,629 Euros, the EU will support 20 projects to be implemented by civil society organisations independently or in partnership with local self-governments in order to improve the quality and sustainability of social services available at the local level.

"Support to the vulnerable groups and provision of quality social services are among the joint priorities of the Government of Serbia and the EU, while both local self-governments and civil society organisations play a major role in achieving this goal. The fact that as many as 18 projects will be implemented in partnership between local administrations, public institutions and civil society is particularly encouraging, as they will work in a coordinated manner to provide adequate social services to children, the elderly, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups at the local level," said Jadranka Joksimović, Minister of European Integration.
"Improving social inclusion and achieving equal rights, including the availability of social services to all citizens, are what the EU stands for in all its activities. By supporting these projects, we encourage local partnerships that will improve the quality and scope of social services for vulnerable groups, primarily social protection services, as well as education and health care," said the Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Serbia, Ambassador Emanuele Giaufret.
The projects were selected within the Public Call for Strengthening Social Services, open from 14 January to 7 March 7, 2022 and the implementation of which was supported by the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs. Out of a total of 90 project proposals received, 20 projects, which were evaluated as the best, will receive support in the amount of 10,000 to 30,000 Euros for activities that will, among other things, focus on improving services aimed at children and young people, including the services of a personal companion of a child, neurofeedback therapy, day care centres for children with disabilities and behavioural problems, day care centres for street children, as well as home care services for adults and the elderly, personal assistance for people with disabilities and other services.
The approved projects, in addition to improving the readiness and resilience of primarily public institutions but also other social service providers for possible future emergency situations and periods of crisis, should also contribute to reducing the negative impact of Covid 19 on the quality of life of vulnerable groups.
The list of approved projects is available here on the website of the EU PRO Plus programme.

Title: Primary school "Vuk Karadžić" in Belotinac in the municipality of Doljevac to be reconstructed with the EU support
Content: 16 September 2022
With the support of the European Union (EU), around 200 pupils in the Primary School "Vuk Karadžić" in the Belotinac settlement in Doljevac will have better conditions for education after the reconstruction of the facility built in 1955. The EU provided more than 179,000 Euros for the renovation through the EU PRO Plus programme, which is implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of European Integration.
The reconstruction of the school building will include the replacement of the floors, the reconstruction of the ceiling, the replacement of the roof covering and gutters, the replacement of electrical installations, external and internal lighting, the renovation of toilets and the reconstruction of the water and sewage network, as well as the installation of waste water purification devices, due to the lack of local sewage. The energy efficiency will be also significantly improved through the replacement of internal and external joinery and installation of a thermally insulating facade.
"Our municipality has one of the largest primary schools in Serbia, and the facility in Belotinac is an eight-year school that was in extremely bad condition. With the support of the European Union, we will improve the conditions for the pupils attending this school as well as for the work of the teaching staff", said Jovica Pešić, Head of Economy and Finance in the municipality of Doljevac. The municipality will participate in the project implementation with a significant amount of over 125,000 Euros.
The deadline for the completion of works to be carried out by the company Tončev Gradnja d.o.o. from Surdulica, selected in the public procurement procedure conducted by the municipality of Doljevac, is 120 days.
The project in Doljevac is one of 33 local infrastructure projects in the regions of Šumadija and Western Serbia and Southern and Eastern Serbia that the EU supports through the EU PRO Plus programme with more than five million Euros in order to improve the quality of life of people through the  renovation and reconstruction of educational, health and social care institutions, sports and cultural facilities, and improvement of communal infrastructure and public administration buildings.

Title: Gender Trainers of Ministry of Defence of Serbia Initiate Revision of Gender Training Manual
Content: 15 September 2022
The gender military trainers from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Serbian Armed Forces (SAF) met to discuss how to revise the Gender Training Manual on 15 September 2022 in Belgrade, Serbia.
The Manual’s revision comes as a need to update the document by including new course materials and topics, new normative and legislative information, and research results produced between Manual’s first and revised versions. The revision will be based on the lessons learned collected by the gender trainers in the six years, the period in which the Manual has been in use. The trainers identified areas for revision and agreed on the further steps, working methods, and the work plan for revising this knowledge tool.
The meeting, organised by SEESAC at the request of the MoD, gathered seven gender military trainers and enabled experience sharing and knowledge exchange among them.
The Manual was designed at the initiative of the gender trainers of MoD and SAF, whereas the proposal for its development was presented at the First Regional Meeting of Gender Trainers, held in Belgrade on 22 May 2014. At this point, the trainers recognised the need to prepare a manual that would help them develop and implement training programmes for different target groups in the MoD and SAF to improve all military personnel’s knowledge on gender equality in the security sector. The Manual helped the training on gender in the military standardisation and was a useful tool for trainers to prepare and deliver gender awareness activities.

This activity was implemented within the Strengthening of Regional Cooperation on Gender Mainstreaming in Security Sector Reform in the Western Balkans project and is financed by the Governments of Norway and the Slovak Republic. With the support of SEESAC, the project provides the Ministries of Defence and the Armed Forces from the Western Balkans a platform where, over the period of three years, they can exchange ideas and develop policies to ensure long-term and sustainable inclusion of the gender perspective in defence policies and practices.

Title: Transforming Education Summit – the global moment of truth
Content: 15 September 2022
By Amina J. Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary-General and Jutta Urpilainen, EU Commissioner for International Partnerships

As parents, teachers and students got ready for a return to school this autumn, few were thinking of the fact that across the world, education is in deep crisis. This is a slow and often unseen crisis, but its impacts affect us all. At the upcoming UN Summit on Transforming Education, world leaders have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take decisive action. The United Nations and the European Union now call on all member states to deliver much-needed commitments to ensure that all girls and boys can access, enjoy and benefit from a meaningful, modern, high-quality education. Their rights and our collective futures depend on it.

Education is the most powerful and transformative tool we have to empower girls and boys with hope, skills and opportunity for their future. It also paves the way for solving many of today’s global challenges. However, in many parts, poverty and inequality still have a major influence over school attendance and learning achievement. And right across the world, education systems are struggling to equip learners with the values, skills and knowledge needed to thrive in our rapidly changing world.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a pre-existing crisis and the global funding gap for education has increased significantly. Even before the pandemic, governments were spending less than half of the needed sum on education. Since then, two in three governments have cut their education budgets while some international donors have announced their intention to reduce aid to education.
Collective action on future-oriented learning and education financing is urgent, if we want to recover pandemic-related learning losses and ensure that children and young people everywhere are able to access their right to education as enshrined in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Investing in education has a transformative impact across the Sustainable Development Goals. It advances gender equality: educated girls are more likely to participate in the decisions that most affect them, to live longer, healthier lives, and to earn higher incomes. It makes a major contribution to national development: every euro spent on education can generate 10–15 euros in economic growth. And by nurturing informed, empowered citizens, it can help countries to tackle major challenges such as climate change, social breakdown, conflict, gender-based violence and more.
The European Union is significantly increasing its investment in education in partner countries. The EU will dedicate more than 10% of its international partnerships budget, representing over 6 billion euros, towards global education.
Now we need others to do likewise. The UN Secretary-General is calling on all government leaders and all actors, including private sector and civil society, as part of a global mobilisation, to make concrete commitments to increase funding for education, from all sources.
At the Transforming Education Summit, the representatives of all countries and partners face a moment of truth: now is the time to collectively fill the investment gap to tackle the global education crisis. Now is the time to invest in learning recovering and help put the SDGs back on track, thereby sowing the seeds for transformation of our education systems, so that education better prepares learners to contribute to a more inclusive, peaceful, sustainable and just future, leaving no one behind.

Title: First Steering Committee Meeting of the Joint SDG Programme: "Extending Social Protection in Serbia through Enhanced Shock-Responsive Policy"
Content: 08 September 2022
Belgrade, 7 September 2022 – The United Nations in Serbia and the Government of Serbia held the first Steering Committee meeting of the Joint SDG Programme that focuses on catalysing a strengthened shock-responsive social protection system to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the consecutive crisis that hit the country – such as Covid and Ukraine crisis.
The members of the Steering Committee included representatives from the Ministry of Human and Minority Rights and Social Dialogue, Ministry of Public Administration and Local-Self Government, Ministry of Family Welfare and Demography, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs, Standing Conference of Town and Municipalities, Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia and Commissioner for the Protection of Equality, UN Resident Coordinator, representatives from implementing UN Agencies- UNICEF as the led Agency, UNFPA, UNHCR and RCO.
The joint programme builds on the second priority of the UNSDCF 2021-2025 on social cohesion and related outcome on social protection, in line with SDGs and EU integration with the aim to  (i) strengthen the data response on the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable groups to feed into the introduction of legislative changes for adaptive social protection system  (ii) apply the shock-responsive social protection principles to provide support for 170 vulnerable families with children- focusing on single parent and women households and older people households, refugees- mostly hit by the crisis, in rural areas, through the provision of a temporary basis cash transfer programme. The total project value is $289.200, funded mainly by the UN Joint SDG Fund.
“This is a short time initiative, that will help to produce significant data that will be used to advocate for strengthened shock- sensitive social protection measures in the national social protection system in the country that is responsive to current and in cases of other future shocks. We already had multiple research and studies that had shown that targeted social response is more effective, for the budget and the people”, said the UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia, Francoise Jacob, Co-Chair of the Steering Committee.
Jacob also added that the purpose of the meeting is to establish the Steering Committee that will provide oversight and guidance to the joint programme implementation and aim for solutions that are evidence-based and adapted to the population groups at heightened risk.
The Co-Chair from the Government, Advisor to the Prime Minister, Slavica Đukić Dejanović said: “One of the advantages of this program is the provision of new data and projections on the impact of crises on the most vulnerable groups of citizens, but also the provision of cash transfers to the most vulnerable families and elderly people. We must be aware of the fact that investing in sustainability reduces the costs of recovery and reconstruction in the event of natural or man-made disasters, and it supports strengthening of capacity and resources, people, assets and management systems, to be ready to face future challenges."

Title: “If rural women were sure that they would get protection from abusers, as well as legal and psychological support, they would be more encouraged to report violence”
Content: 02 August 2022
Mileva Malešić is the Founder and President of the Managing Board of Women's Forum Prijepolje, non-governmental organization aimed at improving gender equality and the position of women. She has been a journalist and activist for women's rights for more than 20 years. She also established the Television Forum, a civil society media and webpage Forum INFO portal, primarily reporting on women’s rights and gender equality. From May 2021 to May 2022, Women’s Forum Prijepolje implemented the UN Women project, Improved safety of women in Serbia, which is funded by the Norwegian Embassy in Belgrade. This effort is aimed at improving the position of rural women and fighting gender-based violence.
What are the main project activities and results?
“We organized meetings with women in their rural communities to hear about their problems, concerns, and the obstacles they face. We spoke directly with 52 women. We created and produced television reports and shows, as well as written material about how to prevent and protect women from violence. All of these were published on our webpage. Our media content – 23 videos and written materials – reached around 100,000 people through our television and social media channels. As part of the international campaign, the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, we organized a round table with representatives of institutions and non-governmental organizations from Zlatibor and Raška districts. During the session, the representatives shared information about their work and experiences. Besides this, we organized a street action, where we sent a strong message that violence against women is unacceptable. In addition, we organized a seminar for journalists from 10 local media outlets on gender-sensitive reporting when it comes to violence against women.
What are the biggest challenges faced by rural women when it comes to their general position and gender-based violence?
Most women from rural areas are not formally employed, although they work from dawn to dusk, and have no guaranteed income. Patriarchal norms are still deeply rooted in their communities, and household roles are gender-based. Women are cooking, washing, cleaning, raising children, taking care of elderly family members. Economic dependence is one of the main reasons why women are unable to break the circle of violence. There is no organized public transportation to and from the villages of the Prijepolje municipality. Women are the most affected by this situation as very few women own a car or have a driver's license. Some village clinics have been shut down, making it difficult for women to access health care. Patriarchal upbringing teaches women that they have to suffer and remain silent. As a result, violence is generally seen as a private matter, not a serious social problem, so it’s rarely talked about. Older women and women with disabilities are at particular risk of violence.
What do rural women need most to be empowered and encouraged to report violence and discrimination?
The basic prerequisite for women to report violence is that they are informed about how and from whom to seek help and protection. Since our organization was established, and especially since our media outlet began working, we have been constantly informing women about existing ways they can gain protection. Through numerous meetings in local communities, workshops in schools, public actions and campaigns, we educate women and girls about how to recognize different forms of violence and why it is important to report it. If they could be sure that they will get protection from abusers, as well as legal and psychological support, they would definitely be more encouraged to report violence.
What is your opinion about media reporting on cases of violence against women and gender equality in general?
The reporting of most media outlets in Serbia about violence against women and gender equality is unsatisfactory, full of stereotypes and sensationalism. One of the reasons for establishing TV Forum, the first television station run by civil sector in Serbia and the Balkans with a prefix - female, was to introduce new standards in how women are represented in the media. On the other hand, all our organization’s activities were more visible, as well as the problems facing women in our region. We have created a safe women's media house and the possibility to improve media coverage on topics important for women. We use the Code of Gender-Sensitive Reporting, gender-sensitive language and regularly organize seminars and training for journalists from our own and other newsrooms. There are more and more women in the media, but men still hold many of the senior positions. It is important for women to be in decision-making, so that we can improve reporting on topics that concern women.
What role does the support of UN Women Serbia play for you and your organization?
We have been cooperating with UN Women Serbia since 2018. We have jointly implemented projects dealing with the economic empowerment of women, unpaid female work, safety of rural women, and currently we have a project on legal and patriarchal norms of inheritance. The UN Women support means a lot to us, not only in terms of finances, but also in terms of cooperation and learning through the implementation of projects. I am very happy that we have been supported to highlight overlooked topics that are important to women and our community.”

Title: UN Secretary-General: Black Sea grain exports deal ‘a beacon of hope’ amid Ukraine war
Content: 22 July 2022
For months, the Secretary-General has been underlining the importance of facilitating full access to world markets for Ukraine’s food stocks and Russian food and fertilizers.
He travelled to Moscow and Kyiv in April to propose a plan to reach that objective.
Ukraine and the Russian Federation are breadbaskets of the world, producing almost one-third of the world’s wheat and barley and half of its sunflower oil.  Russia is also a top global exporter of fertilizers and the raw materials for its production.
Today in Istanbul, senior representatives from Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Türkiye gathered to sign an initiative which establishes a mechanism for the safe transportation of grain, related foodstuffs and fertilizer from Ukrainian ports to global markets.
The United Nations, represented by the Secretary-General, signed the Initiative as a witness. The purpose of the Initiative is to contribute to the prevention of global hunger, to reduce and address global food insecurity, and to ensure the safety and security of merchant ships entering or departing Ukrainian ports.
In the Initiative, the Parties recognized the role of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in securing the discussions for this Initiative. They went on to request his further assistance in its implementation, in the furtherance of the humanitarian mission of the United Nations, subject to its authorities and mandates.
To facilitate the implementation of their Initiative, the Parties agreed to set up a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul, under the auspices of the United Nations, comprised of representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Türkiye and the United Nations.
The JCC will enable the safe transportation, by merchant ships, of commercial foodstuffs and fertilizer from three key Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea: Odesa, Chornomorsk, Yuzhny.
The new Centre will:
The new Centre will not:
An agreement was also reached with the Russian Federation on the scope of engagement of the United Nations to facilitate the unimpeded exports to world markets of Russian food and fertilizer – including the raw materials required to produce fertilizers.  This agreement is  based on the principle that measures imposed on the Russian Federation do not apply to these products.
Simultaneously, the Russian Federation has committed to facilitate the unimpeded export of food, sunflower oil and fertilizers from Ukrainian controlled Black Sea ports.
Agreements to facilitate unrestricted access to exports of Ukraine food from the Black Sea along with exports of food and fertilizer from the Russian Federation matter on many levels.
To calm commodity markets, lower prices and provide critical relief to the most vulnerable people and countries getting hammered by an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis.
To the numerous countries in the developing world that rely on wheat and other grain imports to feed their people.
And to assist in reversing the turmoil in the global fertilizer market that is now threatening next season’s crops – including rice, the most widely consumed staple in the world.
The comprehensive agreements secured today in Istanbul are a big step forward in tackling the global food crisis now gripping the world.

They will provide much-needed relief to the most vulnerable people and countries.

Title: Social Protection Services Improved for 3,000 Citizens with the Support  of the Swiss Government
Content: 14 July 2022
The quality of life for more than 3,000 citizens from vulnerable social groups has improved through the enhanced social protection services as a result of 41 projects implemented by local self-governments with the support of the Swiss Government through the Swiss PRO Programme, as highlighted during the event held on June 9, 2022 in Belgrade.
The total value of support provided by the Swiss Government through two public calls of the Swiss PRO Programme under the slogan "Join Forces, Provide Support" is over 530,000 euros, while local self-governments co-funded the project in the amount of about 170,000 euros. Also, local self-governments received technical support for the development and implementation of social protection services, such as home care and a senior club for the elderly, a personal assistant and day care center for people with disabilities and counseling for families, youth and children.
"Improving the position of vulnerable groups is the policy of the Government of Serbia and the priority of the social protection system. Local self-governments are one of the most important parts of the system and support for strengthening their capacities is very valuable because in the future they should become even more important bearers of social protection and social policy at the local level", pointed out Biljana Zekavica, Assistant Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs.
Improving social inclusion is one of the key priorities of Swiss development cooperation with Serbia, and close cooperation between Swiss PRO and national and local partners has contributed to observable progress in this area, said Melina Papageorgiou, Head of Governance at the Swiss Cooperation Office in Serbia.
"Greater quality, scope and inclusiveness of public services for citizens, especially social protection services for vulnerable groups, is an important aspect of public administration reform. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a challenge for vulnerable groups, especially the elderly and people with disabilities, and the Swiss government plans to continue to support partners in furthering these important public services”, Papageorgiou said.
Director of the UNOPS Serbia Multi-Country Office Michela Telatin pointed out that local self-governments have successfully used the Swiss PRO Programme as a tool to do some heavy lifting in the domain of social protection for essential advances in this area.
"I am really proud that our joint activities have improved the quality of life for 3,000 people throughout Serbia. I would like to thank the Ministry of Labour for its guidance and cooperation, the Swiss Government for having social inclusion and good governance as their priorities and all the financial contribution being provided, especially for response to COVID-19 consequences, and I would like to congratulate the local self-governments for their leadership and commitment to implement the change at social level that really allows not to leave anyone behind", Telatin concluded.
Certificates for successful implementation of projects were awarded to local self-governments Arilje, Babusnica, Bela Palanka, Blace, Brus, Cuprija, Gadzin Han, Ivanjica, Krupanj, Lebane, Loznica, Medvedja, Mionica, Negotin, Novi Pazar, Paracin, Pirot, Pozarevac, Prijepolje, Prokuplje, Raca, Raska, Razanj, Rekovac, Sabac, Sjenica, Surdulica, Svilajnac, Topola, Tutin, Uzice and Zagubica.
In addition to the results of supported projects, the event presented the experience of the City of Loznica in improving social protection services with the support of Swiss PRO and presented examples of good practice of the Municipality of Sjenica that introduced the sensory room service.

Title: Challenge Call for Innovative Solutions: Forest Ecosystem Restoration and Greening
Content: 13 July 2022
Belgrade, June 13, 2022 - With the support of the European Union, and in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), and the European Investment Bank (EIB), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Serbia announced the Challenge Call for Innovative Solutions: Forests and Green Infrastructure for Improving Natural Capital and Climate Resilience.
This challenge aims to support the implementation of innovative ideas that will contribute to increasing the forested area and improving the functionality of ecosystems, thus enriching the biodiversity and increasing the resilience to natural disasters and extreme weather events caused by climate change. The application of these ideas in practice will contribute to a healthier environment, further accelerate the green transformation of the economy and society, and the implementation of the EU Green Agenda in Serbia.
Best solutions under this call will receive mentoring and technical support, while co-financing will be provided to the most successful among them, so that these ideas may be applied in practice.
All interested local self-government units, public companies, managers of protected areas, and/or cooperatives can apply for projects on publicly owned land and all interested forest owners (e.g. cooperatives, associations, companies) can apply for projects on forest and agricultural land in private and cooperative ownership, until July 13, 2020.
Project applications that result in the formation of forests and green urban areas by using diverse indigenous species of forest vegetation would be particularly welcomed. Also, projects that have multiple benefits for local communities, such as better air quality, improvement of biodiversity, preservation of the quality of agricultural land, and greater absorption of carbon dioxide - will be prioritised.
This Challenge Call for Innovative Solutions is published within the "EU for the Green Agenda in Serbia" project, which, with the financial support of the European Union and in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, is implemented by UNDP, in cooperation with the Embassy of Sweden and EIB.

Title: Cascading global crises threaten human survival and the SDG roadmap is the way forward
Content: 07 July 2022
New York, 7 July – The climate crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and an increased number of conflicts around the world have placed the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in jeopardy, according to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022, released by the United Nations today.
The Report highlights the severity and magnitude of the challenges before us, with these cascading and intersecting crises creating spin-off impacts on food and nutrition, health, education, the environment, and peace and security, and affecting all the SDGs, the blueprint for more resilient, peaceful and equal societies.
COVID-19 AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
According to the latest data presented in the Report, the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc across the Goals and its effects are still far from over. Global “excess deaths” directly and indirectly attributable to COVID-19 reached 15 million by the end of 2021. More than four years of progress in alleviating poverty have been wiped out, pushing 93 million more people worldwide into extreme poverty in 2020. An estimated 147 million children also missed more than half of their in-person instruction over the past two years. The pandemic also severely disrupted essential health services, derailing hard-won progress on SDG 3.
CLIMATE EMERGENCY
Meanwhile, the world is on the verge of a climate catastrophe where billions of people are already feeling the consequences. Energy-related CO2 emissions for 2021 rose by 6 per cent, reaching their highest level ever and completely wiping out pandemic-related declines. To avoid the worst effects of climate change, as set out in the Paris Agreement, global greenhouse gas emissions will need to peak before 2025 and then decline by 43 per cent by 2030, falling to net zero by 2050. Instead, under current voluntary national commitments to climate action, greenhouse gas emissions will rise by nearly 14 per cent over the next decade.
WAR IN UKRAINE
The war in Ukraine is creating one of the largest refugee crises of modern time. As of May 2022, over 100 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes. The crisis has caused food, fuel and fertilizer prices to skyrocket, further disrupted supply chains and global trade, roiled financial markets, and threatened global food security and aid flows. Projected global economic growth for 2022 was cut by 0.9 percentage point, due to the war in Ukraine and potential new waves of the pandemic.
The world’s most vulnerable countries and population groups are disproportionately impacted. Women have suffered a greater share of job losses combined with increased care work at home. Some evidence suggests that violence against women has been exacerbated by the pandemic.
Young people continue to have higher unemployment rates than before the pandemic, and child labour and child marriage are on the rise. Least developed countries struggle with weak economic growth, rising inflation, major supply-chain disruptions, policy uncertainties, and unsustainable debt.
A ROADMAP OUT OF CRISIS
Today, we are on the verge of a critical juncture. Either we fail to deliver on our commitments to assist the world's most vulnerable, or we step up our efforts to rescue the SDGs and deliver meaningful progress for people and planet by 2030.
“The road map laid out in the Sustainable Development Goals is clear,” stated Mr. Liu Zhenmin, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. “Just as the impact of crises is compounded when they are linked, so are solutions. When we take action to strengthen social protection systems, improve public services and invest in clean energy, for example, we address the root causes of increasing inequality, environmental degradation and climate change.”
The report also emphasizes that to emerge stronger from the crisis and prepare for unknown challenges ahead, funding our data and information infrastructure must be a priority for national governments and the international community.
Additional key facts and figures:
The Sustainable Development Report 2022 presents data provided by over 200 countries and areas around the world. While this year’s report demonstrates the dire impacts of the current crises on the 17 Goals, it clearly demonstrates that realizing the SDGs is the remedy needed to address our global challenges. To achieve the SDGs demands urgent transformative action and evidence-based approaches at a global scale.

Title: WUF11 closes with calls for urgent urban action
Content: 30 June 2022
After five days of debate and discussion, with 400 events featuring 700 speakers from government, civil society, communities, academia and the private sector, the Eleventh Session of the World Urban Forum (WUF11) in Katowice, Poland closed. New friendships and partnerships were formed, new agreements reached and bold ideas formulated among the 17,003 people from 155 countries who attended WUF11.
The closing ceremony in the Spodek Arena concluded with the torch for WUF12 being officially passed to the Egyptian government, represented by General Mohammed Sharawy, Minister of Local Development, in a short signing.
“What we have witnessed here was a rich experience with many inspiring topics,” he said. “I am extremely proud that Cairo is the first African city to stage the World Urban Forum since Nairobi staged the first event in 2002.”
The enthusiasm generated by participants throughout WUF11 was however balanced by warnings that there could be no further delays in taking urgent action to deliver sustainable urbanization, given the multiple crises confronting world cities.
Addressing the closing ceremony in the Spodek Arena, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director of UN-Habitat, said: “The climate emergency, pandemics, the housing crisis, violence and conflict, all converge in cities.
“If we want to transform to a better urban future, we will have to increasingly deal with urban crises. We have no excuse not to be prepared.
“We don’t have much time to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal targets of 2030. We have only 7.5 years, 90 months or 2,742 days left to implement the New Urban Agenda in order to achieve the SDGs. So, what shall we do? The time to act is now.”
Ms Sharif announced that the global observance of the World Habitat Day this year will be on 3 October in Belkiser, Turkey.  She also opened a call for the expression of interest to host the World Urban Forum in 2026.
The Executive Director warmly thanked Małgorzata Jarosińska-Jedynak, State Secretary at Poland’s Ministry of Regional Development and Funds, Marcin Krupa, the Mayor of Katowice, and the local organising committee.
“The Government of Poland as well as the city of Katowice have exceeded all expectations helping us make WUF11 a most memorable and accessible event,” she said.
Ms Jarosińska-Jedynak responded that WUF11’S Declared Actions must be a basis for action. “This is the time for bold steps and bold action,” she said. “The World Urban Forum has given us energy and enthusiasm to push for change in our cities for a better future.”
Speakers acknowledged the special Urban Crises Track created at WUF11 on responses to conflict and disaster, prompted by the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine, and Poland’s hospitality to an estimated three million Ukrainian refugees.
The Executive Director thanked the President of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, H.E. Collen Kelapile, for leading the Group of Friends of Sustainable Urbanisation and UN-Habitat in New York, which is putting its full weight behind the New Urban Agenda.
She acknowledged the contributions of H.E Madame Martha Delgado, President of the UN-Habitat Assembly and Co-Chair of the Advisory Group, for her work to bring the key messages from all the constituencies of WUF11 to the UN-Habitat Assembly next year.

Title: UNODC World Drug Report 2022 highlights trends on cannabis post-legalization, environmental impacts of illicit drugs, and drug use among women and youth
Content: 27 June 2022
VIENNA, 27 June 2022 – Cannabis legalization in parts of the world appears to have accelerated daily use and related health impacts, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)’s World Drug Report 2022. Released today, the report also details record rises in the manufacturing of cocaine, the expansion of synthetic drugs to new markets, and continued gaps in the availability of drug treatments, especially for women.
According to the report, around 284 million people aged 15-64 used drugs worldwide in 2020, a 26 per cent increase over the previous decade. Young people are using more drugs, with use levels today in many countries higher than with the previous generation. In Africa and Latin America, people under 35 represent the majority of people being treated for drug use disorders.
Globally, the report estimates that 11.2 million people worldwide were injecting drugs. Around half of this number were living with hepatitis C, 1.4 million were living with HIV, and 1.2 million were living with both.
Reacting to these findings, UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly stated: “Numbers for the manufacturing and seizures of many illicit drugs are hitting record highs, even as global emergencies are deepening vulnerabilities. At the same time, misperceptions regarding the magnitude of the problem and the associated harms are depriving people of care and treatment and driving young people towards harmful behaviours. We need to devote the necessary resources and attention to addressing every aspect of the world drug problem, including the provision of evidence-based care to all who need it, and we need to improve the knowledge base on how illicit drugs relate to other urgent challenges, such as conflicts and environmental degradation.”
The report further emphasizes the importance of galvanizing the international community, governments, civil society and all stakeholders to take urgent action to protect people, including by strengthening drug use prevention and treatment and by tackling illicit drug supply.
Early indications and effects of cannabis legalization
Cannabis legalization in North America appears to have increased daily cannabis use, especially potent cannabis products and particularly among young adults. Associated increases in people with psychiatric disorders, suicides and hospitalizations have also been reported. Legalization has also increased tax revenues and generally reduced arrest rates for cannabis possession.
Continued growth in drug production and trafficking
Cocaine manufacture was at a record high in 2020, growing 11 per cent from 2019 to 1,982 tons. Cocaine seizures also increased, despite the Covid-19 pandemic, to a record 1,424 tons in 2020. Nearly 90 per cent of cocaine seized globally in 2021 was trafficked in containers and/or by sea. Seizure data suggest that cocaine trafficking is expanding to other regions outside the main markets of North America and Europe, with increased levels of trafficking to Africa and Asia.
Trafficking of methamphetamine continues to expand geographically, with 117 countries reporting seizures of methamphetamine in 2016‒2020 versus 84 in 2006‒2010. Meanwhile, the quantities of methamphetamine seized grew five-fold between 2010 and 2020.
Opium production worldwide grew seven per cent between 2020 and 2021 to 7,930 tons – predominantly due to an increase in production in Afghanistan. However, the global area under opium poppy cultivation fell by 16 per cent to 246,800 ha in the same period.
Key drug trends broken down by region
In many countries in Africa and South and Central America, the largest proportion of people in treatment for drug use disorders are there primarily for cannabis use disorders. In Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and in Central Asia, people are most often in treatment for opioid use disorders.
In the United States and Canada, overdose deaths, predominantly driven by an epidemic of the non-medical use of fentanyl, continue to break records. Preliminary estimates in the United States point to more than 107,000 drug overdose deaths in 2021, up from nearly 92,000 in 2020.
In the two largest markets for methamphetamine, seizures have been increasing – they rose by seven per cent in North America from the previous year, while in South-East Asia they increased by 30 per cent from the previous year, record highs in both regions. A record high was also reported for methamphetamine seizures reported from South-West Asia, increasing by 50 per cent in 2020 from 2019.
Great inequality remains in the availability of pharmaceutical opioids for medical consumption. In 2020, there were 7,500 more doses per 1 million inhabitants of controlled pain medication in North America than in West and Central Africa.
Conflict zones as magnets for synthetic drug production
This year’s report also highlights that illicit drug economies can flourish in situations of conflict and where the rule of law is weak, and in turn can prolong or fuel conflict.
Information from the Middle East and South-East Asia suggest that conflict situations can act as a magnet for the manufacture of synthetic drugs, which can be produced anywhere. This effect may be greater when the conflict area is close to large consumer markets.
Historically, parties to conflict have used drugs to finance conflict and generate income. The 2022 World Drug Report also reveals that conflicts may also disrupt and shift drug trafficking routes, as has happened in the Balkans and more recently in Ukraine.
A possible growing capacity to manufacture amphetamine in Ukraine if the conflict persists
There was a significant increase in the number of reported clandestine laboratories in Ukraine, skyrocketing from 17 dismantled laboratories in 2019 to 79 in 2020. 67 out of these laboratories were producing amphetamines, up from five in 2019 – the highest number of dismantled laboratories reported in any given country in 2020.
The environmental impacts of drug markets
Illicit drug markets, according to the 2022 World Drug Report, can have local, community or individual-level impacts on the environment. Key findings include that the carbon footprint of indoor cannabis is between 16 and 100 times more than outdoor cannabis on average and that the footprint of 1 kilogram of cocaine is 30 times greater than that of cocoa beans.
Other environmental impacts include substantial deforestation associated with illicit coca cultivation, waste generated during synthetic drug manufacture that can be 5-30 times the volume of the end product, and the dumping of waste which can affecting soil, water and air directly, as well as organisms, animals and the food chain indirectly.
Ongoing gender treatment gap and disparities in drug use and treatment
Women remain in the minority of drug users globally yet tend to increase their rate of drug consumption and progress to drug use disorders more rapidly than men do. Women now represent an estimated 45-49 per cent of users of amphetamines and non-medical users of pharmaceutical stimulants, pharmaceutical opioids, sedatives, and tranquilizers.
The treatment gap remains large for women globally. Although women represent almost one in two amphetamines users, they constitute only one in five people in treatment for amphetamine use disorders.
The World Drug Report 2022 also spotlights the wide range of roles fulfilled by women in the global cocaine economy, including cultivating coca, transporting small quantities of drugs, selling to consumers, and smuggling into prisons.

Title: Statement: Reproductive rights are women’s rights and human rights
Content: 24 June 2022
Reproductive rights are integral to women’s rights, a fact that is upheld by international agreements and reflected in law in different parts of the world.
To be able to exercise their human rights and make essential decisions, women need to be able to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to information, education, and services.
When safe and legal access to abortion is restricted, women are forced to resort to less-safe methods, too often with damaging or disastrous results—especially for women who are affected by poverty or marginalization, including minority women.
The ability of women to control what happens to their own bodies is also associated with the roles women are able to play in society, whether as a member of the family, the workforce, or government.
UN Women remains steadfast in our determination to ensure that the rights of women and girls are fully observed and enjoyed worldwide, and we look forward to continued evidence-based engagement with our partners everywhere in support of rapid progress towards universal enjoyment of universal rights.

Title: Outcomes of the UN supported Consultations on Transforming Education in Serbia,  presented at the Palace of Serbia
Content: 23 June 2022
A presentation on transforming education consultation processes took place today at the Palace of Serbia, at an occasion that gathered government representatives, UN agencies, academia and civil society organisations. The event is the official closure of the national consultations on transforming education in Serbia, held from April to June, bringing together relevant stakeholders from the education sector (academia, teachers, civil society organisations, parents and youth). The Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development coordinated the consultations, with technical assistance from UNESCO and UNICEF.
The consultations aimed to formulate the main priorities and future commitments in the education system in Serbia, to be presented during the Transforming Education Summit convened in New York by the UN Secretary-General next September.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic is still not over, globally and locally it is already time to take decisive actions to prevent further learning disruptions and the deepening of inequalities regarding access to education.
At her opening speech, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Serbia, Mrs Françoise Jacob, noted: “In the realization of the national consultations, ahead of the Transforming Education Summit, I am very thankful to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development for taking the lead role in the realization of the national consultations on transforming education. Let’s seize the moment and mobilize the action, ambition, solidarity and solutions needed to achieve SDG4 and transform education in Serbia between now and 2030.”
National consultations in Serbia serve as an opportunity to take stock of the efforts being undertaken to ensure equal and quality education. Furthermore, they provide a place to reimagine education to be resilient to future shocks and transformative to fit the needs of all children and youth.
“The aim of these consultations was to assess and formulate main priorities and perspectives of our education system. Report on national consultations in Serbia as well as Statement of commitment for transforming education are submitted to the TES Secretariat and will be presented at this occasion”, said in her address State Secretary Anamarija Viček, noting that the report presented outlines the opinion, vision and commitment of a wide range of key stakeholders in the education sector from government authorities, to formal and informal educational practitioners and parents.
In a view of supporting a country-tailored consultation process, UN Secretary-General António Guterres encouraged UNESCO and UNICEF, separate UN agencies both with mandates in education, to accompany governments and engage stakeholders through the national consultation work stream: “It was a great honor to support the consultations process in Serbia on such an important and generational topic as transformation of education. We are also deeply proud that the process was inclusive, bringing forward the perspectives of the most imminent educational actors: government authorities, academia, teachers, parents and students who were at the forefront of the ‘educational battle’ to curb the effects of COVID-19 to education and worked relentlessly to ensure that education never stops”, said Siniša Šešum, Head of UNESCO Antenna in Sarajevo.
As the voice of youth will be in focus during the Summit, 940 young people from across Serbia participated in June 2022 in online and offline consultations to express their views, expectations from transforming education, as well as to join efforts with young people worldwide to reimagine education by 2030.
“For children, education quality and relevance matter. They want their voices to be heard. And to matter! We should seize the momentum created by the upcoming Transforming Education Summit to drive concrete actions addressing the needs of children and youth”, concluded Mrs Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Representative in Serbia.
From April to June, the consultation process gathered recommendations from 1,143 persons to identify priority areas and formulate recommendations for achieving quality, equal, healthy and sustainable education from all children and youth by 2030.

Title: UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia: We can all take action to say #NoToHate
Content: 18 June 2022
Hate speech is on the rise worldwide with the potential to incite violence, undermine social cohesion and tolerance, and cause psychological, emotional, and physical harm to those affected.
Hate speech not only affects the specific individuals and groups targeted, but societies at large.
In July 2021, the UN General Assembly highlighted global concerns over “the exponential spread and proliferation of hate speech” around the world and adopted a resolution on “promoting inter-religious and intercultural dialogue and tolerance in countering hate speech”. The resolution recognizes the need to counter discrimination, xenophobia and hate speech and calls on all relevant actors, including States, to increase their efforts to address this phenomenon, in line with international human rights law. The resolution proclaimed 18 June as the International Day for Countering Hate Speech, which will be marked for the first time in 2022.
The devastating effect of hatred is sadly nothing new. However, its scale and impact are amplified today by new technologies of communication, including social media, so much so that hate speech has become one of the most frequent methods for spreading divisive rhetoric and ideologies on a global scale. If left unchecked, hate speech can even harm peace and development, as it lays the ground for conflicts and tensions, wide scale human rights violations or increased discrimination against particular groups. More recently, we have also seen how online hate speech targeted to individuals may have led to extreme self harm actions, increased depression and suicide. This is yet a new frontier for our common fight for universal human rights.
The United Nations defines Hate Speech as “any kind of communication in speech, writing or behavior, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender or other forms of identity. This is often rooted in, and generates intolerance and hatred and, in certain contexts, can be demeaning and divisive.” It feeds from a mix of fear, ignorance, anger, unhealthy group behaviours, egoistic desire for personal gain, and the protective anonymity of operating from behind a screen. It can be very casual, such as a comment at the bottom of a media article, a picture, or a statement on social media – or very explicitly calling for offline action. To some extent, it is also a collateral effect of extreme individualism, and in some contexts, the result, and the cause of weakening democratic processes. There are various levels of gravity in incitement to hate, which must be addressed diligently through public condemnation, legal and judicial action, information and education.
The United Nations has a global strategy to address hate speech, which emphasizes the need to counter hate holistically and with full respect for freedom of opinion and expression, while working in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including civil society organizations, religious leaders, media outlets, tech companies and social media platforms. We have to engage at multiple levels: with the sources of hate speech, the conveyors such as social media platforms, the judicial and legislative systems, the education system. Most recently, there is a particular effort towards ensuring that social media platforms become fully accountable for the impact of their strategies, are a lot more diligent to protect their users, and are not used to incite offline violence against specific individuals and groups – as was the case in 2017 with Facebook platform used to foment violence against Rohingyas ethnic minority. This is part of a wider effort of the UN to ensure that technology products, policies, practices and terms of service comply with human rights principles and curtail the fast spreading of misinformation.
In Serbia, language or communication of sensation, hate, discrimination and intolerance is routinely used by political leaders, media outlets, celebrities, sports spectators, social media users. It targets multiple groups and individuals – migrants, the LGBT community, women, activists, or those with particular political affiliation, profession or economic status. 2021 was marked by a climate in which segments of the civil society did not feel safe or acknowledged due to incidents of threats and public attacks. We have also witnessed repeated and consistent rise of divisive narratives related to extreme nationalism, past conflicts and denial of established individual responsibility for harm done against people in the Western Balkans. Serbia’s constitution, anti-discrimination law and criminal laws address much of these situations, but are not yet fully used.
Dialog, solidarity, civic education, mediation and strengthening the concept of a common good and common future, are the remedies to hate speech, beyond the required ethical and judicial mechanisms that must be in place to sanction the worst cases of hate speech. Dialog is about agreeing on common goals while understanding, appreciating and using diversity and difference of opinions and perspectives. We must augment, expand, reshape the dialogs as a key enabler to build trust. Hate speech, divisive narratives, personal attacks, particularly in the public sphere such as traditional media, social media or national parliaments can take the country away from a strong, empowering social contract, much needed to steer the nation towards a transformative future. Hate eats us up, it does not make us feel good, it breaks families and friendships, it creates enemies, it creates sorrow, extreme pain.
We all have the moral, political and legal duty of speaking out firmly against instances of hate speech and promote trust, reconciliation, dialog, compromises, solidarity and ultimately, love. This first International Day to Counter Hate Speech is a call to action, for upholding the values and principles at the core of the United Nations charter. As UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said, “let us recommit to doing everything in our power to prevent and end hate speech by promoting respect for diversity and inclusivity”.

Title: First Joint Steering Committee meeting of the Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2021-2025 of the United Nations and the Government of Serbia
Content: 14 June 2022
The Minister of EU Integration, Jadranka Joksimovic, together with the UN Resident Coordinator in the Republic of Serbia Francoise Jacob, facilitated the first Joint Steering Committee on the implementation of the new Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework of the United Nations and the national institutions for 2021-2025.


The first meeting of the Joint National Steering Committee (JNSC) of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2021-2025 (UNSDCF), was held on 14 June 2022. The meeting was co-chaired by Minister of EU Integration Ms. Jadranka Joksimović, UN Resident Coordinator Ms. Francoise Jacob, and Minister Counselor and Head of UN Department Ms. Marina Ivanovic, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Minister of EU Integration Ms. Joksimović, highlighted the importance of the first JNSC meeting, which represents a new five-year cycle of multi-enhanced partnership to accelerate green and digital transformation. The complexity of the global situation, especially in the European continent, and geopolitical and climate-related crises including - energy, food, and security- show the importance of working in synergy, using common values, for the achievement of SDGs.
Head of UN Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ms. Marina Ivanovic highlighted the great importance of the United Nations and cooperation with the UN Team in the country in a very sensitive global moment of polarization in the international forums. The UN organization is very important for sustaining the Serbia territorial integrity and sovereignty. In that sense Serbia expects full compliance with the UNSCR 1244 on all occasions, thus defending not only Serbia’s own national interests, but also international law and key principles from the UN Charter.
On behalf of the UN Country team, UN Resident Coordinator Ms. Francoise Jacob expressed appreciation to the government co-chairs for their remarks and support to the UN. The UNSDCF was developed in extensive consultations with the line Ministries in the previous period. It includes contributions of 20 UN resident and non-resident agencies, and its strategic framework has three strategic priorities: (i) Green transformation (ii) Human capital (health, education, social protection, demographic resilience), and (iii) Rule of law, governance, human rights and gender equality. The overall budget of UNSDCF for five years is approximately 363 million EUR, with half of the amount already secured and funded. The Joint National Steering Committee is the highest governance body providing direction and oversight as well as mutual accountability towards the achievement of the cooperation framework’s outcomes and objectives.
The UN Resident Coordinator noted that the meeting is the first of its kind after several years of absence and as such it is considered mostly informative, with the purpose to encourage full engagement in the coming meetings to discuss Joint Work Plans and adjustments, if necessary. UN will continue to contribute to the donor coordination mechanisms of MEI through the sector working groups. It will continue to engage with all other stakeholders, civil society, bilateral donors, and development banks. UNSDCF is strongly oriented toward the achievement of the SDGs, for which only seven years remain. The recent Global Sustainable Development report ranked Serbia as 35 out of 164 evaluated countries highlighting Serbia’s good progress in reducing poverty and inequalities, improving the quality of education, gender equality, health, and decent jobs. However, much more remains to be done on the green agenda, and it is to be appreciated Minister’s highlights on Government’s priorities in the area.
The United Nations keeps transparency and accountability at the heart of its actions. A report with main results achieved from UN Serbia in 2021, alongside other documents is shared with JNSC members. On behalf of the UNCT, the UNRC expressed her full commitment to deliver on the results as planned in the Cooperation framework.
Presentations were held by UN Co-Chairs of the three Results Groups, on the main UNSDCF priorities:
1. Green, Sustainable and Inclusive Economy (presented by FAO National Coordinator Mr. Alex Mentov)
2. Wellbeing, Social Equity and Human Capital (presented by UNICEF Representative in Serbia Ms. Deyana Kostadinova)
3. Rule of Law, Human Rights and Gender Equality (presented by UNHCR Deputy Representative, Ms. Stefanie Krause)
Further to the presentations, members of the JNSC continued with discussions that focused on the i) capacities needed to accelerate the green transformation and key social reforms, ii) positioning of the UN and convergence of the EU accession agenda with agenda 2030, iii) the need to shape transformative visions in the areas of health, education, food systems, and demographics.

In her closing remarks, the UNRC noted the following (i) UN reform process urges UN agencies to converge and work closer together. JNSC is one of the platforms to support this convergence, paired with the important inter-ministerial work and approach to development (e.g. on food systems); ii) encouraged the renewed direction to the Inter-Ministerial Working Group on SDGs and Agenda 2030 (iii) encouraged increased visibility and importance of communication for the UN on the vision of the green future and transformations, both at the system level and individual transformation.

Title: Healthy environment - an important priority for the citizens of Serbia
Content: 02 June 2022
Results of the public opinion survey presented.
Belgrade, 2 June 2022 – About two thirds of Serbian citizens believe that preserving a healthy environment is more important than the economic growth. This is one of the main findings of the public opinion survey.
Belgrade, 2 June 2022 – About two thirds of Serbian citizens believe that preserving a healthy environment is more important than economic growth. This is one of the main findings of the public opinion survey, observing personal relations to the environment and climate change in Serbia, which was presented today at the EU Info Center, within the European Green Week 2022.
This quantitative survey on a representative national sample was conducted by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in cooperation with the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CeSID), in order to determine the public opinion on topics covered by the EU Green Agenda for Serbia.
“Public opinion is very important, and the EU often produces ‘European barometer’ on various topics. End of 2021, a survey for the ‘Future of Europe’ showed that 91% of young Europeans (15–24-years old) agree that tackling climate change can help improve their own health and well-being, while 87% of all respondents also share this sentiment”, said Antoine Avignon, Program Manager, EU Delegation to Serbia, and added:
“Today, at the occasion of the event ‘Listening to Serbian public on environment’ organized at the EU Info Centre in Belgrade as part of the EU Green Week, very similar data were presented. In particular, our partner UNDP mentioned that in Serbia 62% citizens believe that climate change is a real threat which requires real action. Further, a survey conducted by our new project “Odvajamo” also found that 94% of persons are motivated to take action for waste separation to help Serbia in reducing pollution. Policy makers need good data analysis to take good decisions. We need to work together for actions to stop global warming and pollution. That is the meaning our slogan: Bolji smo zajedno! (Better Together!) ”
The research was presented by the Team Leader for Resilient Development at UNDP, Žarko Petrović, who pointed out:
“Our main conclusion from this research is that the citizens of Serbia are aware of the importance of preserving a healthy environment and tackling climate change. They also know what should be done to find solutions to these challenges. However, it turned out that the citizens are not ready to contribute to that purpose by allocating additional funds from their household budgets.”
When it comes to the environment, every fourth citizen of Serbia (26%) worries the most about the air pollution, this concern followed by the water quality (13%) and illegal dumpsites (12%).
Most respondents are not entirely satisfied with what the state is undertaking to solve environmental problems. As possible solutions citizens propose increasing fines for polluters - both businesses and individuals, preventing logging and planting forests, greater support for environmental organizations, as well as subsidies for economic entities and individuals that contribute to the fight against pollution and climate change.
Almost two thirds of Serbian citizens (62%) believe that climate change is a real threat and that it is necessary to introduce changes that would prevent its consequences. According to 82% of respondents, the main cause of the climate change are human activities.
Regarding solutions to prevent the consequences of climate change, the public in Serbia proposes the preservation of forests and additional afforestation, as well as water conservation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the volume of recycling.
However, the habits of Serbian citizens are not entirely in line with their views on environmental protection - 75% say that they do not sort waste, while 55% do not pay additional attention to the packaging when buying products.
Also, most citizens (73%) are not ready to spend more money on environmental protection costs, by paying higher bills for electricity, water and other utilities. One part of them thinks that the bills are already too high (43%), and the other does not believe that the money would go to the intended purpose (30%).
The vast majority of respondents are not ready to invest additional funds into purchasing a new heating device or insulating their homes, citing lack of need or lack of money as the main reasons.

Novi Sad, June 1, 2022 - Within the EU Green Week 2022 in Serbia, the Challenge Call for Innovative Solutions for improving Air Quality was launched today in the Science and Technology Park in Novi Sad.
With the support of the European Union, and in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Serbia invited local self-governments, public and private companies, as well as scientific and research institutions to submit their innovative ideas for improving air quality at the local level. The implementation of these ideas will contribute to a healthier environment and further accelerate the green transformation of the economy and society in Serbia.
The Challenge Call is open until June 27, 2022. The application is possible only through the electronic form that can be downloaded from the EU for Green Agenda in Serbia website: https://zelena-agenda.euzatebe.rs/rs/konkursi.
On this occasion, Assistant Minister of Environmental Protection, Aleksandra Imširagić Đurić, presented the key activities of the Ministry in the area of improving air quality:
“The Ministry will work intensely on further harmonization of the legal framework with the EU directives in the area of air quality, as well as on the development of the Air Protection Program of the Republic of Serbia with the Action Plan, its adoption and further implementation. Also, it is necessary to work on the improvement, adoption and implementation of policy documents at the local level, as well as on raising awareness through the active participation of the professional and interested public, local communities and citizens,“ added Imširagić Đurić.
Miroslav Tadić, Team Leader for the Environment and Climate Change at UNDP Serbia, pointed out that exposure to polluted air has serious negative consequences for human health, quality of life and life expectancy. “According to the data of the Serbian Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)”, added Tadić, “people living in densely populated areas are most exposed to the consequences of air pollution. That is why we are inviting everyone with an idea for reducing the pollution and improving the quality of air in Serbia - to apply for this Challenge. Ten best-rated solutions will receive our mentoring and technical support, while at least three solutions will receive financial support for implementation," said the UNDP representative.
Those interested will be able to find out more about the conditions of participation and the process of application for the Challenge at the Info Day, which will be organized by UNDP and the Ministry of Environmental Protection on June 8, 2022, in Belgrade. All questions concerning the Challenge may also be sent directly to: adaptacije.rs@undp.org.
The Challenge Call for Innovative Solutions for improving Air Quality has been launched within the "EU for Green Agenda in Serbia" project, which, with the financial support of the European Union and in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, is implemented by UNDP in cooperation with the Embassy of Sweden and the EIB.

Title: E-Governance Improved in 70 Local Self-governments with Swiss Government Support
Content: 27 May 2022
New eServices and open data are available to citizens in 70 towns and municipalities, as result of Swiss Government Support, through the Swiss PRO Programme, was announced at the event held on 27 May 2022 in Belgrade, which marked the end of the campaign under the slogan “Let’s Click Together!”.
With Swiss Government support, and in cooperation with the Government of Serbia and local self-governments, the Swiss PRO Programme has provided comprehensive technical and financial support to improve the capacities and procedures for the provision of eServices and open data, as well as website development.
“The activities in the area of digitalisation and eGovernance have for a number of years been on the top of the list of priorities of the Republic of Serbia Government. Swiss Government support through the Swiss PRO Programme, is of tremendous significance in strengthening local self-government employees to improve their knowledge and procedures for eGovernance operations, so they can put all their capacities in the service of improving these services used by citizens and businesses. We remain dedicated to further develop eGovernance tailored to us all, so we can additionally improve the quality of life of citizens and future local and economic development,” said Aleksandar Trivić Lovčanski, Special Advisor to the Minister, with Chief of Staff competences, on behalf of the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government.
Towns and municipalities have been provided with the opportunity to publish their electronic services on the improved eGovernance portal, and significant contribution of the programme is also in the domain of awareness raising on the importance of eGovernance, developing the regulatory framework at the local level and acquiring practical skills to provide eServices, was also said during the event.
“Swiss Government has for over 20 years been supporting the reform and modernisation of local self-governments, and through the Swiss PRO Programme, we have been improving the conditions under which eServices are provided, as well as the service provision and better access to open data, which ensures higher transparency and efficiency. All this is not an easy endeavour, and this is why all local self-governments that have introduced various new eServices deserve praise. We will continue to support the introduction of eServices, which will increase transparency and efficiency of governance in Serbia at all levels,” said Melina Papageorgiou, Governance Advisor with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.
As part of the public information campaign implemented throughout Serbia, promotion of eServices was organised on public squares, with over 1,800 citizens presented with the opportunity to access directly and easily certain rights and services under the auspices of the local administration through the eGovernance portal, while around a million people were informed via social media about the advantages of using eServices and open data.
“Many local self-government services are now cheaper and faster, and really more efficient for citizens and businesses. We must not forget that men and women citizens access their rights and complete their tasks at the local level, and we will keep striving to further develop eGovernance and eServices at the local level. Owing to the support of the Swiss Government, together we have been able to bring about positive change,” said Marko Vujačić, Head of Programme in UNOPS Serbia.
Special recognition by the Swiss PRO Programme of advances in opening data was awarded to Novi Pazar Town, which published 65 data sets on their open data portal, while Vrnjačka Banja Municipality was awarded special recognition for their advances in the provision of eServices and the use of data exchange systems for tasks under original and transferred competences.
Experiance in developing eGovernance at the local level with the Swiss PRO Programme support was shared at the event by the representative of Municipality of Krupanj.
“The work on establishing new eServices would be much more complicated without significant support provided by the Swiss PRO Programme. The improved local eGovernment enabled better communication with citizens and enhanced their satisfaction with provision of services by our local self-government,” said Svetlana Milovanović, Associate for Local Economic Development and Information in the Municipality of Krupanj.
The event also saw a video presentation of the success of the project implemented by Municipality of Mali Zvornik.
More information on the results of implemented activities is available in the Fact Sheet on results of the support of Swiss PRO Programme.

Title: Serbia Ready for Stockholm+50 Conference
Content: 20 May 2022
The final event in a series of dialogues on environment in Serbia was held at the “Jevremovac” Botanical Garden, within the country’s preparations for the “Stockholm+50” conference.
Belgrade, 20 May 2022. – The fifth and final event in a series of dialogues on environment in Serbia was held today at the “Jevremovac” Botanical Garden, within the country’s preparations for the “Stockholm+50” conference. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) organized the national consultations with support from the Government of Sweden and in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection.
The closing event within national consultations was opened by the Minister of Environmental Protection Irena Vujović, alongside Swedish ambassador to Serbia H.E. Annika Ben David and the UNDP resident representative in Serbia Francine Pickup. Minister Vujović thanked everybody who answered the Ministry’s invitation to contribute to the consultations.
“The consultations were a good opportunity to use the dialogue between various stakeholders to reach joint conclusions, highlight most important environmental issues and offer recommendations on how to address them. We heard the voices of all participants in open dialogue, and these will be considered when creating national environmental policies and plans. I am especially happy that the youth showed a great deal of interest in the consultations and that they are motivated to take part in finding solutions for challenges in this area,” Irena Vujović, Minister of Environmental protection said, and added: “Serbia made Important headway in addressing environmental issues, as well as in harmonisation its legislation with the EU, resulting in opening Cluster 4 which includes Chapter 27 – Environment and Climate Change.
The most important recommendations on what Serbia should do to reduce environmental pollution, preserve biodiversity and adequately tackle climate change challenges were presented by various stakeholders during today’s event. These recommendations, collected during a series of dialogues, will be incorporated in a National Report that the Serbian delegation will present at the Stockholm conference in less than two weeks.
“By organising the Stockholm+50 global conference that will take place in Stockholm on 2 and 3 June, the Swedish Government intends to mobilise global and local environmental action for our planet and our future! Serbia was chosen to be a country hosting consultative dialogues during the preparations for the Stockholm+50 conference.  Thank you all for your active participation and I do hope we will continue with constructive dialogue and engagement,” H.E. Annika Ben David, Swedish ambassador to Serbia, said.
“Thanks to support of Sweden and to partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, we were able to gather more than 500 representatives of national and local institutions, civil society, private sector, academia and youth. This confirmed to us that there is a strong interest in Serbia to help preserve the environment and grapple with climate change. I believe that recommendations from national consultations participants will help Serbia find a path towards sustainable and green future, for the benefit of its economy and citizens,” Francine Pickup, UNDP Serbia Resident Representative, said.
Two panel discussions on the importance of bees and the necessity of protecting them, attended by representatives of academia and the civil sector, were held today in cooperation with ‘Ekonaut’ association on the occasion of World Bee Day (20 May) and International Day for Biological Diversity (22 May). A workshop on the world of bees was also held for the children and the youth.
Five national dialogues were held from 13 April until the present. The topics that were discussed follow: protecting biodiversity, climate change, green transformation in agriculture, the link between the environment and public health, the role of the youth in protecting the environment.
Thanks to the SparkBlue online platform, all interested parties could actively join the process to follow the course of the dialogue and achieved results and give their own recommendations for improving the environment in Serbia.
The ‘Stockholm+50 conference: healthy planet for the prosperity of all – our responsibility, our opportunity’, will be held on 2 and 3 June 2022 in the capital of Sweden. In addition to marking the 50th anniversary of the first United Nations conference on the environment, the goal of this international meeting is to accelerate the implementation of activities contributing to achieving global Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as the ‘green’ recovery from the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Supported by the Swedish Government, UNDP organised a series of national consultations in 59 countries around the world, including Serbia.

Title: EU support for the improvement of local infrastructure - 5.5 million euros for 33 local self-governments
Content: 13 May 2022
The European Union (EU) will support implementation of 34 local infrastructure projects in the regions of Šumadija and Western Serbia and Southern and Eastern Serbia through the EU PRO Plus programme including the renovation and reconstruction of educational, health and social care institutions, sports and cultural facilities, and improvement of communal infrastructure and public administration buildings.
In this way, the EU, in cooperation with the Ministry of European Integration, supports the improvement of living standard with more than 5.5 million Euros, while special focus will be on the vulnerable groups, and the Covid 19 recovery.
"Sustainable territorial development is an important strategic theme throughout Europe. Serbia shares this goal, and European integration, i.e. our harmonization with the EU policies, are an instrument that can best contribute to reducing development disparities in our country, as well as creating opportunities for a better life and work for all those who want to stay in to their local communities", said Jadranka Joksimović, Minister of European integration.
"These projects, which will be implemented with the support of the European Union within the EU PRO Plus Programme, are a tangible contribution to this goal, and above all to creating equal conditions for education and growing up of children, improving the quality and accessibility of communal, health and social services," concluded Minister Joksimović while pointing out that local self-governments competed with priority projects that will improve life in those areas.
“By supporting the implementation of the local infrastructure projects, the European Union directly contributes to a better life for the population in Serbia through the reconstruction of public facilities that will not only improve their functionality and services to the population but will also improve energy efficiency, accessibility, environment and urban mobility”, said the Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Serbia, Ambassador Emanuele Giaufret.
A total of 75 project proposals were submitted to the public call that was open from 3 December 2021 to 31 January 2022, which prescribed construction permit and financial share of minimum 15 percent of the project value as the necessary conditions for successful application. In addition, the local self-governments had the right to apply for two projects, provided that one or both are related to health and / or social protection. Thus, 33 local self-governments to which projects have been approved will participate in the realisation with 2,742,579 million Euros, so the total budget of all projects is estimated at 8,272,532million Euros.
The list of the project approved for funding is available here on the EU PRO Plus website.

The challenge call aims at removing some of the biggest identified obstacles to green transformation and decarbonisation of the public and corporate sector, such as: the lack of investments, incentive measures and sustainable business models, followed by the lack of a policy framework that promotes synergies for efforts to reduce GHG emissions and other harmful emissions into environment.
The Call consists of two LOTs and is open until 20 June 2022.
LOT 1  for decarbonisation of the economy by applying new business models, new technologies or digital solutions with the primary objective to reduce GHG emissions in both EU ETS sectors: electricity and heat generation, energy-intensive industry sectors including oil refineries, steelworks, and production of iron, aluminium, metals, cement, lime, glass, ceramics, pulp, paper, cardboard, acids and bulk organic chemicals (i.e. EU-ETS operators) and non-ETS sector (e.g. transport, buildings, agriculture, waste, etc.), as well as entities obliged under the Energy Management System.
LOT 2 – Pollution reduction of IPPC operators (falling under the Industrial Emissions Directive), through investments in the application of the best available technologies to pursue a clean technology transition and better resource efficiency.
At least thirty (30) most promising proposals will receive mentoring and technical support through acceleration process. With the technical support of experts, they will have the opportunity to work on their project concepts, test them and further develop submitted technical solutions. At the end of this phase, projects which are evaluated to contribute most to decarbonisation, contribute reducing the other harmful emissions and transformation to green business models will be chosen for the implementation phase and will receive co-financing.
For all interested applicants, info days will be organized on May 17, May 25, and June 1 2022.
More details on the conditions of participation in the challenge and how to apply are available on the website: www.zelena-agenda.euzatebe.rs.

Title: New equipment for safe disposal of medical waste - USA donation to Batut
Content: 27 April 2022
Belgrade, April 27, 2022 – Today, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) delivered new equipment for the proper disposal of medical waste to the "Dr Milan Jovanovic Batut" Public Health Institute. The $150,000 donation includes an autoclave and a shredder - for sterilization and grinding of medical equipment and infectious medical waste that will ensure that the increased amount of toxic medical waste generated by the pandemic will be disposed of in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.
“On behalf of USAID, I would like to commend Director Jovanović, the staff of Batut Institute and everyone working in Serbia’s healthcare system. Whether you were a doctor saving lives or a janitor cleaning COVID wards -- you worked tirelessly to help your fellow citizens get through the worst of this crisis. The equipment USAID is donating to help Batut to safely dispose of medical waste that was generated from COVID-19 itself, as well as from the successful delivery of several million vaccines, is just part of the approximately $10 million in COVID-19 assistance that the United States has provided to Serbia since the start of the pandemic,” said Denny Robertson, USAID Mission Director.
Previously USAID, in partnership with UNDP, helped establish a National Communication Center at “Batut” and provided Information and Communications Technology (ICT) equipment to “Batut” and 23 regional and local health institutes. The Center helped “Batut” better coordinate the ongoing vaccination process and direct public health resources to protect the health of Serbian citizens according to priority needs.
Verica Jovanović, the director of the "Batut" Public Health Institute said, “We received an autoclave that destroys bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms by using steam and high temperature, and a shredder that grinds medical waste previously sterilized in autoclave - into fine particles. After such treatment, the amount of medical waste is significantly reduced, and it can be disposed of in the same way as non-medical waste or can be recycled.”
The USAID donation also includes two transport trolleys for loading carts, a loading cart designed specifically for waste treatment including liquids, two water treatment systems, a ground scale and 10 transport containers.
“Our report found that in Serbia, during the first 12 months of the pandemic alone, the amount of generated medical waste was about 40 percent higher compared to the same period before COVID-19,” said Francine Pickup UNDP Serbia Resident Representative, adding that “we must keep the environment protected, because our long-term health depends on it.”
Jelena Janković, a.i. Assistant Minister of Health in the sector of public health and program healthcare, thanked the Institute, UNDP and USAID for their support in activities related to public health protection and the donation, adding that it is crucial that this modern autoclave is used to enable recycling of medical and infectuous waste.
The delivery of this equipment is part of the twenty-month $2.75 million “Together against COVID” project, funded by the USAID and implemented by UNDP. The project is realized in partnership with the Ministry of Health and the "Dr Milan Jovanović Batut" Public Health Institute and supports Serbia’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the areas of health, and social and environmental protection.

Title: Citing dire needs, UN Chief calls for 4-day Holy Week humanitarian pause in Ukraine
Content: 19 April 2022
UN Secretary-General's remarks to the press.
In five days, Ukrainians and Russians will mark Easter.  This holiday unites the Orthodox Christians in both Russia and Ukraine -- as well as Catholic Ukrainians -- in celebration.   

Easter is a season for renewal, resurrection and hope.  
 
It is a time for reflection on the meaning of suffering, sacrifice, death — and rebirth.   
 
It is meant to be a moment of unity.  
 
But this year, Holy Week is being observed under the cloud of a war that represents the total negation of the Easter message.  
 
Instead of celebration of a new life, this Easter coincides with a Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. 
 
The intense concentration of forces and firepower makes this battle inevitably more violent, bloody and destructive.  
The onslaught and terrible toll on civilians we have seen so far could pale in comparison to the horror that lies ahead.
This cannot be allowed to happen. 
 
Hundreds of thousands of lives hang in the balance.   
 
Many good-faith efforts by many parties to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine have failed.  
 
Today I am calling for a 4-day Holy Week humanitarian pause beginning on Holy Thursday and running through Easter Sunday, April 24th, to allow for the opening of a series of humanitarian corridors.  
 
The humanitarian pause would provide the necessary conditions to meet two crucial imperatives.   
 
First, safe passage of all civilians willing to leave the areas of current and expected confrontation, in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
 
Second, beyond humanitarian operations already taking place, a pause will allow for the safe delivery of lifesaving humanitarian aid to people in the hardest-hit areas such as Mariupol, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk.   
 
The United Nations is ready to send humanitarian aid convoys during this period to these locations.  We are submitting detailed plans to the parties.   
 
Humanitarian needs are dire.  People do not have food, water, supplies to treat the sick or wounded or simply to live day-to-day.  
 
More than 12 million people need humanitarian assistance in Ukraine today.  Of those, more than one-third are in Mariupol, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk.
We anticipate that this figure will increase to 15.7 million – that’s about 40 percent of all Ukrainians still left in the country.   
 
There is a measure of progress to build upon.  Some 2.5 million people have been provided with assistance in the past seven weeks, including many in the east.  
  
For all these life-or-death reasons, I call on Russians and Ukrainians to silence the guns and forge a path to safety for so many at immediate risk. 
 
The 4-day Easter period should be a moment to unite around saving lives and furthering dialogue to end the suffering in Ukraine.   
  
This morning, the Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths briefed the Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations – including Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, Muslim and Jewish leaders.  I welcome their support.   
 
Inspired by Holy Week and all that it represents, I urge all parties – and all champions of peace around the world -- to join my Easter appeal.  
 
Save lives. 
 
Stop the bloodshed and destruction.    
 
Open a window for dialogue and peace and keep faith with the meaning and the message of Easter.  
 
Thank you.

Title: SG Op-Ed on Global Crisis Response Group “The War in Ukraine: A Silent Assault on the Developing World”
Content: 13 April 2022
For the people of Ukraine, the Russian invasion is a waking nightmare, and a humanitarian disaster on a terrifying scale.

But the war is also fast becoming a matter of life and death for vulnerable people around the world.
We have all seen the tragedy unfolding inside Ukraine: cities flattened; people suffering and dying in their homes and in the streets; the fastest displacement crisis in Europe since the Second World War.
But beyond Ukraine’s borders, far beyond the media spotlight, the war has launched a silent assault on the developing world. This crisis could throw up to 1.7 billion people — over one-fifth of humanity — into poverty, destitution and hunger on a scale not seen in decades.
Ukraine and the Russian Federation provide 30 per cent of the world’s wheat and barley, one-fifth of its maize, and over half of its sunflower oil. Together, their grain feeds the poorest and most vulnerable people, providing more than one-third of the wheat imported by 45 African and least-developed countries.
At the same time, Russia is the world’s top natural gas exporter, and second-largest oil exporter.
But the war is preventing farmers from tending their crops, while closing ports, ending grain exports, disrupting supply chains and sending prices skyrocketing.

Many developing countries are still struggling to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with historic debt burdens and soaring inflation.

Since the start of 2022, wheat and maize prices have increased by 30 per cent.

Brent oil prices have risen more than 60 per cent over the last year, while natural gas and fertilizer prices have more than doubled.
The United Nations’ own lifesaving operations are under severe strain. The World Food Programme has warned that it faces the impossible choice of taking from the hungry to feed the starving. It urgently needs $8 billion to support its operations in Yemen, Chad and Niger.
Some countries are already sliding from vulnerability to crisis and serious social unrest. And we know the roots of many conflicts lie in poverty, inequality, under-development and hopelessness.
But while much of the world has stepped up in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, there is no sign of the same support for the 1.7 billion other potential victims of this war.
We have a clear moral duty to support them, everywhere.
The Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance that I launched last month aims to develop coordinated solutions to these interlinked crises, with governments, international financial institutions and other key partners. I thank the global leaders in all sectors who are supporting this initiative.
On food, we are urging all countries to keep markets open, resist hoarding and unjustified and unnecessary export restrictions, and make reserves available to countries at the highest risk of hunger and famine.
This is not the time for protectionism. There is enough food for every country to get through this crisis if we act together.
Humanitarian appeals must be fully funded, including for the World Food Programme. We simply cannot allow people to starve in the twenty-first century.
On energy, the use of strategic stockpiles and additional reserves could help to ease this energy crisis in the short term.
But the only medium- and long-term solution is to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy, which is not impacted by market fluctuations. This will allow the progressive phase-out of coal and all other fossil fuels.
And on finance, the G20 and international financial institutions must go into emergency mode. They must find ways to increase liquidity and fiscal space, so that governments in developing countries can invest in the poorest and most vulnerable, and in the Sustainable Development Goals.
This should be a first step towards deep reforms to our unfair global financial system, which makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.
Social protection, including cash transfers, will be essential to support desperate families through this crisis.
But many developing countries with large external debts do not have the liquidity to provide these safety nets. We cannot stand by and watch, as they are forced to choose between investing in their people, and servicing their debt.
The only lasting solution to the war in Ukraine and its assault on the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world is peace.
As the United Nations works to support the innocent victims of this war — both inside and outside Ukraine — we call on the global community to speak with one voice and support our plea for peace.
This war must end, now.

Title: “New video communication service is a step towards removing invisible barriers in access to justice for women victims of violence who are deaf or hard of hearing”
Content: 22 March 2022
UN Women Serbia teamed up with the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Serbia, to enable access to justice for deaf and hard of hearing women victims of violence. This was part of the  "Improved safety of women in Serbia" project, funded by the Norwegian Embassy in Belgrade. Support included procurement of tablets for all 66 basic courts in Serbia, which will improve the use of a specialized video communication service. Mihailo Gordić, vice president of The City Organization of the Deaf Persons of Belgrade, speaks about why this project was critical, and why more recognition of deaf and hard of hearing persons’ needs, including women victims of violence, was important.
What are the biggest obstacles that deaf and hard of hearing people face in everyday life and how do they overcome these?
By far the biggest obstacle is access to information and communication. To overcome this, it is necessary for deaf people to have a bilingual education in their mother tongue, Serbian sign language, and in the official language of the country. Awareness about the linguistic status of Serbian sign language in our country is very low.
Deaf people in Serbia still need to explain that Serbian is not their mother tongue and that textual translation from spoken to written Serbian does not mean much to them. If we want communication to go smoothly and to enable access to information and various content for deaf people, it is necessary to provide translation into Serbian sign language.
Serbian sign language is the mother tongue of the deaf in Serbia, and Serbian is the second language they learn, but do not speak so well. As Serbian and English differ, so do Serbian and Serbian sign language. Sign language is not universal, there is a national sign language in every country.
To make life easier for deaf and hard of hearing people, which services are available, and which ones are missing?
Without Serbian sign language interpreters, access to information and communication would be almost non-existent for deaf or hard of hearing people. Since 2010, the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy has financially supported the translation services of Serbian sign language interpreters, which helps significantly to facilitate communication for deaf people. Associations and the deaf community in Serbia are very grateful for this support, but the number of interpreters is very limited. Numerous services are missing, but all of them stem from inaccessibility to education as well as insufficiently qualified interpreters for Serbian sign language, for which there is no comprehensive or formal training in Serbia.
Starting this year, tablets have been introduced across Serbia’s courts to help deaf and hard of hearing people, including women who are also victims of violence. How important is this effort?
The project is extremely important because in this way deaf people, including deaf women who are victims of domestic violence, are able to access the justice system and all relevant information. Communication takes place in a timely and uninterrupted manner.
How this service works?
The service operates online through the National Translation Center for Serbian Sign Language. For example, a deaf person comes to court and wants to get information or report something. A court clerk in charge of the tablet contacts a Serbian sign language interpreter at the National Serbian Sign Language Interpreting Centre who translates communication between the deaf person and a court representative.
How important is the support of UN Women and the Ministry of Justice in providing access to justice for deaf and hard of hearing women victims of violence as well as for all deaf and hard of hearing people?
The support of UN Women and the Ministry of Justice is immeasurable. Without this support, the justice system would continue to be almost inaccessible to deaf people and especially deaf women who are victims of domestic violence. We have to bear in mind that the number of women in this situation is on the rise. This service will certainly empower and improve the independent functioning of deaf people in Serbia. It is a step towards removing invisible barriers and it is a matter of protecting the lives and dignity of people with disabilities, including deaf and hard of hearing people.

The commercial sector in Belgrade generates more than 40 thousand tons of edible and inedible parts of food annually, according to the Analysis of research on direct measurement and morphological composition of food waste from commercial outlets, published by the Environment Improvement Centre.

Within the direct measurements that were carried out, a total of 29 representative commercial outlets were observed,: hotels and other accommodation, restaurants and fast food outlets, retails, schools and kindergartens, and other commercial outlets.

Quantities of food waste from commercial outlets
Based on the obtained projected data, most of the waste is generated within the group of restaurants and fast-food outlets, with over 21 thousand tons annually. This is followed by retail outlets with 4,767 tons/year, schools and kindergartens with 3,551 tons/year, and finally groups of hotels and accommodation with an annual generation rate of 1,302 tons. The remaining commercial food waste generators (public institutions and companies with their restaurants, markets, hospitals, etc.) generate more than 9,000 tons of food waste annually.

Morphological composition of food waste
The projection of the morphological composition of food waste shows that on average the most dominant category is vegetables, with a share of over 45 percent, with the highest percentage recorded within the group of schools and kindergartens (62 percent).
The second most represented category is fruit, with almost 19 percent, with this category being the most represented in the retail sector (over 38 percent).
The categories of meat, fish and eggs, and bread and pastries, in the total average composition, have similar values ​​(about 14 percent), while the category of milk and dairy products has the lowest value for virtually all observed groups of commercial establishments, with a final average share of about 5 percent.
If the amount of food waste from the commercial sector is shown in relation to the total population of Belgrade, 26.5 kilograms of edible and inedible food waste is generated per person annually. Also, previous direct measurements of food waste in households showed that every inhabitant of Belgrade throws away an average of 108.1 kilograms of edible and inedible parts of food annually. The summarized values ​​of these two researches indicate that the total food waste generated in Belgrade, on an annual level, is about 205,000 tons, or 134.6 kilograms per capita. This places Belgrade at the top of the list of European cities in terms of the amount of food waste generated when compared to other cities according to the UNEP Food Waste Index Report.
###
About the project: These two researches were conducted following the methodology of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for measuring the global food waste index, during September and October 2021, and will be the starting point for all future research in this area. The research was conducted with the support of the United Nations Environment Programme, within the project "Build Back Better: Using Green and Digital Technologies to Reduce Food Waste at Consumer Level".

Belgrade, 23 February 2022 – To mark the International Day Against Peer Violence, UNICEF Serbia is launching a new free package of U-Report Viber stickers - Stop Violence!

Download the stickers from here -> https://stickers.viber.com/pages/unicef_2022 and join U-Report on Viber where you voice your opinion on important issues in an accessible way.

The International Day Against Peer Violence is marked every year, on the last Wednesday in February, and is known as Pink T-shirt Day.

Pink T-shirt day came about when a boy from Canada was verbally and physically bullied by his friends because he came to school wearing a pink T-shirt to support his mother who had breast cancer. Local activists bought 50 pink T-shirts and handed them out to his school peers who wore them to support the boy. Children then started coming to school in pink T-shirts, which thus became a symbol of the fight against peer violence in schools around the world.

Marking this day aims to promote empathy, respect for diversity and tolerance. Peer violence is a general social problem that many children face, and prevention is crucial.

If you are a witness or a victim of violence, you can contact the following contact the National Children's Line of Serbia - 116111 or via https://cuvamte.gov.rs/#

If you are a parent, call the toll-free number of the NADEL Parent Line 0800 007 000, which is available every day from 4 pm to 10 pm.

Title: UNODC holds the 2nd Steering Committee meeting on the EU-UNODC joint action on enhanced border control
Content: 22 February 2022
22-23 February 2022, Belgrade, Serbia / online: UNODC held the 2nd Steering Committee on the EU-UNODC joint action promoting rule of law and good governance through targeted border control measures at ports and airports in South-Eastern Europe in a hybrid mode to discuss the main developments within the action to date and agree on the way forward.
The initiative is aimed at enhancing the capacities of authorities in the Western Balkans to fight organized crime, by supporting more effective and coordinated responses to illicit trafficking by border law enforcement at land and port border crossing points and international airports in the region. The action is funded by the European Union (EU) and is implemented by the UNODC-WCO Container Control Programme (CCP) and the UNODC-WCO-INTERPOL Airport Communication Project (AIRCOP) in cooperation with the UNODC Regional Programme for South Eastern Europe.
Specifically, UNODC is working on the establishment of joint airport inter-agency groups composed of an AIRCOP Joint Airport Interdiction Task Force (JAITF) and a CCP Air Cargo Control Unit (ACCU) to cover both cargo and passenger threats as well as providing continuous technical assistance to the existing Port Control Units (PCUs) established by CCP.
The action’s main stakeholders were convened to the event, including senior representatives from the Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR), EU delegations and the Government authorities in the region as well as UNODC along with WCO and INTERPOL.
The UNODC Chief of the Regional Section for Europe, West and Central Asia and Regional Representative for South Eastern Europe opened the event and highlighted that “international commitment and cooperation is an investment in our shared vision of the future and if we have learnt anything from the pandemic it is from the numerous examples globally of how acting together we are stronger and can tackle the greatest of threats.” He pursued with pointing out the challenges still faced by South Eastern Europe while underlining the importance of national ownership in UNODC work in the region.
The Head of Sector Rule of Law, Security, Migration and Reconciliation at DG NEAR stressed in her statement that “regional cooperation is at the heart of what EU membership entails” and expressed appreciation on the strategic partnership with UNODC and the hope that “the positive trend will continue and will be strengthened”.
The event followed with interventions from UNODC representatives stating the importance of continuing efforts in addressing both cargo and passenger related threats while reminding on the objectives of the action. Subsequently, the Governments’ authorities from the region provided a status update on activities within the action, progress and the next steps, particularly on the establishment of the joint inter-agency groups.
A special session was dedicated to gender mainstreaming, and the necessary efforts in this direction. CCP presented its Women’s Network, its objectives, what is being done to support the women working in CCP units, including raising awareness on the issue and creating tools for women to be able to exchange on the challenges they face and the need to have more gender mainstreaming activities. CCP also mentioned a study on representation of women in the Customs Administrations of the region currently conducted within the action, which is intended to collect qualitative and quantitative data on women’s representation in the relevant agencies and provide tailored recommendations. Similarly, AIRCOP presented its initiatives to promote gender related policies and activities, including the “Series of Portraits” initiative which gives more visibility to women in law enforcement. The AIRCOP representative also mentioned the benefits of women being part of the inter-agency groups from an operational perspective, and announced the introduction of a mandatory training focusing on gender within the inter-agency groups to mitigate potential weaknesses caused by the lack of women in key posts.
The first day sessions concluded with the review of the workplan for 2022 and its endorsement and adoption by all the participants. This was followed by an overview of the communication and visibility activities within the action.
The second day focused on the practical elements of cooperation such as the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) as well as inter-agency cooperation illustrated with case studies presented by CCP and AIRCOP. The value of the Steering Committee meeting was also underlined through discussions among the authorities present in the room.
The action’s Steering Committee is aimed at providing specific guidance and support to the action as it allows for all the stakeholders to meet and discuss key issues aimed at reviewing the progress of the action and deciding on future undertakings. In doing so, the national ownership of the governments in the region is ensured leading to greater coordination and coherence in the action implementation.

Title: From birth to the first day of school – the Bebbo mobile app answers parenting questions
Content: 10 February 2022
A mobile app created in Serbia will be available in 11 countries and territories.
As of today, the Bebbo mobile application is available on Google and Apple stores. Bebbo provides the support parents need in the first years of a child's life to help monitor their child’s growth and development, keep track of their child's health, nutrition, timely paediatric visits and vaccinations, but will also support parents to take care of themselves. Bebbo is an improved version of the HaloBeba - Your companion in parenting mobile app, which was developed by UNICEF Serbia and the Belgrade Institute of Public Health, together with the HaloBeba telephone counselling service, and in cooperation with the Nordeus Foundation. This new Bebbo app will be available in 11 countries and territories, in 19 language.
The Bebbo app provides information on breastfeeding, nutrition, vaccinations, play, learning and health, as well as evidence-based advice about children's health.
“The new and improved HaloBeba mobile app, now called Bebbo, is our gift to parents – the most important people in the first years of a child’s life! This innovative tool makes practical guidance and advice easily available and is a step towards a more relaxed and stimulating parenting experience. We hope that this enhanced Bebbo app will become an ally in the upbringing of every child and will support parents if they have any doubts. We are especially proud that UNICEF’s Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia has recognized the innovative nature of the original HaloBeba app, upon which Bebbo is built, and has now made this upgraded app available beyond the borders of Serbia,” said Deyana Kostadinova, UNICEF Serbia Representative.
This comprehensive guide to parenting and growing up is available to both Android and iOS users, and can be used both online and offline when content is pre-downloaded so it can be available when there is no internet access.
“We are very pleased that the Belgrade Institute for Public Health’s counselling service - HaloBeba - will expand and augment the support it provides to parents and everyone who takes care of children. The counselling service provides almost 150,000 tips by phone every year, primarily on how to take care of children when they are ill or with colic, but also on hygiene and daily routines, advice on breastfeeding and nutrition, the importance of vaccination, on stimulating development, the importance of parent-child relationships and other topics. Professional and timely advice over the phone, provided by exceptionally kind nurses, is the right medicine for many parents, as it calms and encourages them. By developing the Bebbo app, the Institute and UNICEF are continuing their long-term successful cooperation for the benefit of children,” said Prof. Dr Dusanka Matijevic, Director of the Belgrade Institute for Public Health.
The Nordeus Foundation, a partner in this endeavour, as well as experts from the Nordeus company, were instrumental in developing the application.
“Knowledge and technology know no boundaries, but their power grows through sharing. This is supported by the fact that this kind of support system is crossing the borders of Serbia and is expanding its positive impact. We are proud that from day one we had the opportunity to contribute our knowledge and experience. This kind of widely available and free support means a lot to both parents and children and is especially invaluable now that both health and education systems are facing the challenges of this pandemic,” said Branko Milutinovic, CEO of Nordeus and one of the founders of the Nordeus Foundation.
The content of the application can be personalized according to the age of the child, and all data is stored on the user's personal device. It can be used by both parents simultaneously for one or more children.
With the Bebbo app, parents can regularly monitor their child's growth and get recommendations on how to encourage progress in accordance with their child's age. This interactive guide through parenting allows parents to record preventive paediatric and other medical examinations, monitor the vaccination calendar, keep a record of received vaccines, and receive a reminder about upcoming vaccinations. Moreover, when parents run out of ideas for daily activities with their children, they can consult the Bebbo app and get recommendations that will encourage learning and development, all thanks to a library of tips with over 700 articles and videos.
The Bebbo app is part of the Playful Parenting Program implemented by UNICEF and the Government of the Republic of Serbia, with the support of the LEGO Foundation.

Title: New shipment of COVID-19 vaccines procured through the COVAX Facility arrives in Serbia
Content: 21 January 2022
Belgrade, 21 January 2022 - Serbia has received a new shipment of COVID-19 vaccines procured through the COVAX Facility. This delivery of 100,800 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccines has arrived at Belgrade’s Nikola Tesla Airport this morning.

Title: Joint statement by Alice Wairimu Nderitu, the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and Francoise Jacob, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia
Content: 09 December 2021
Joint statement by Alice Wairimu Nderitu, the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and Francoise Jacob, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia, on the occasion of the International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the Prevention of this Crime

Seventy-three years ago, world leaders were unanimous in saying “never again” to the horrible crimes committed during the Holocaust and adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. This was a time for hope. The world had witnessed the horrors of large-scale violence with an explicit intent to destroy a targeted group and decided to act not only to codify the contours of this crime but also to make an explicit commitment to prevent its occurrence. Yet, today, genocide remains a real threat for too many people worldwide, directly or through narratives of the past. We have been facing a steady increase in number of violent conflicts, that are lasting longer, causing disastrous human and economic consequences. And we all know that outbreaks of violence, conflict and atrocity crimes have roots in long-standing structural discrimination, deep economic inequalities, and social exclusion, and in a shrinking democratic and civic space.
We must renew our commitment and work together to prevent discrimination against protected groups and inter-group tensions from escalating. We need to counter and address hate and divisive speech and incitement to violence, to stop glorification of convicted war criminals and ensure robust accountability when these crimes are committed. We need to keep on building trust, awareness and understanding across all levels, from the top political leadership to the community level, and across all relevant fields, from national political representative bodies, to monitoring bodies, local authorities, religious institutions, the education system and the media.
We call on all those in position of authority to do their utmost to focus on what brings the country together rather than on what takes people apart. This means learning the lessons of the past to build a future where the commission of such crimes is no longer possible. Experience has also shown us that accountability for past crimes constitutes a critical element of prevention of future acts and therefore must be prioritized. It has also shown that acknowledging the suffering experienced by all communities is necessary to build a future grounded on trust and mutual understanding. We must honor them with our words and actions.
We need to continuously invest in our youth. Youth are the backbone of our countries and the future, a powerful force for preventing tensions and build a common, forward looking narrative. We have seen many young people across the region taking initiatives to counter derogatory language or hate speech, to bring people together, to pave the way for a future in which violence and war crimes are no longer possible. The United Nations remains committed to supporting the people of Serbia and national efforts aimed at trust-building, the promotion of inclusiveness and mutual understanding, and in forging a hopeful vision for a shared future.

Title: First-ever Global Report on Corruption in Sport flags urgent need for unified, international response to corrupt practices in sport
Content: 09 December 2021
VIENNA, 9 December (UN Information Service) — Up to 1.7 trillion US$ is estimated to be wagered on illicit betting markets each year, according to a new report released today by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

Offering a playbook to effectively tackle crime and corruption in sports by setting out a range of concrete policy considerations, the Global Report on Corruption in Sport also reveals the staggering scale, manifestation, and complexity of corruption and organized crime in sport at the global, regional, and national levels. Developed in partnership with nearly 200 experts from across governments, sport organizations, the private sector, academia, and related stakeholders, it is the most in-depth review of its type to date.
While corruption in sport is not a new phenomenon – fraudulent activities in the running of sports institutions and competitions have been documented from the times of the ancient Olympic Games – the past two decades have witnessed a substantial increase in criminal activities within this area. Indeed, globalization, a huge influx of money, the rapid growth of legal and illegal sports betting, and technological advances transforming the way sport is played and consumed are making it increasingly attractive to criminal networks seeking to exploit sport for illicit profit.
Against this backdrop, the Global Report breaks down an extensive range of issues, analysing the role of illegal betting, competition manipulation, abuse in sport, the susceptibility of major sporting events to corruption, and the involvement of organized crime, among others. It also highlights the changing landscape of sport and its relation to corrupt practices, the existing initiatives to tackle the problem, issues related to detecting and reporting wrongdoing, as well as how existing legal frameworks can be applied to address corruption within this area.
The Global Report comes out at a pivotal time, with increasing emphasis being placed on anti-corruption efforts within all sectors, including the sporting community. The report is launched ahead of next week’s biennial UN anti-corruption gathering, the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations
Convention against Corruption, being held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt from 13 to 17 December, where the issue of corruption in sport will be discussed.
Designed for both governments and sports organizations, the Global Report highlights the urgent need to:
• Strengthen legal, policy and institutional frameworks to prevent and respond to different manifestations of corruption and crime in sport at the global, regional, and national levels.
• Develop and implement comprehensive anti-corruption policies in sport, with a focus on addressing corruption linked to the organization of major sports events, competition manipulation, illegal betting, and the involvement of organized crime in sport.
• Promote and increase cooperation and the exchange of information and good practices among sport organizations, crime prevention and criminal justice authorities, law- and policymakers.
• Enhance the understanding of the interlinkages between corruption and organized crime in sport and develop capacities of relevant government entities and sport organizations to tackle them.

Title: Pretty Loud in Collaboration with UN Serbia and Coordination Body for Gender Equality Releases Music Video for the Song "Ravnopravno" to Mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and 16 Days of Activism Campaign
Content: 24 November 2021
To mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the launch of the 16 Days of Activism campaign, the band Pretty Loud, in collaboration with UN Serbia and the Coordination Body for Gender Equality, releases the music video for the song “Ravnopravno” (Equal).
Belgrade, 24 November 2021 – Ravnopravno is the latest song / music video by Pretty Loud, the first all-female Roma hip hop band in Serbia, created to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the launch of the global 16-day campaign.
Violence against women is a ubiquitous social problem that cannot be exclusively attributed to any single social class, and one that affects all women irrespective of their education level, socio-economic status and other socio-demographic characteristics. However, women with disabilities, women living in rural areas, women in traditional, minority or Roma communities, who face various challenges on a daily basis, find it even more difficult to speak out about violence and to seek help.
Therefore, the aim of the Ravnopravno music video, released as part of this year’s 16-day campaign is to send a message to the general public about the various forms of violence against women, as well as to help young people to recognize it and adopt a constructive attitude towards eliminating all forms of violence as they grow up.
Ravnopravno tells a story about a young woman growing up in an atmosphere of violence. Told from her perspective, the story exposes various traditional and cultural dimensions of violence against women, which often remain taboo subjects.

“All women should bravely stand up and speak openly about the violence taking place every day in various communities. This issue is not given sufficient attention. How do we go about changing this? We have decided to stop the violence using music. Hence we made this song and this music video. We would like to see more articles on positive topics, on women being successful, independent and very brave”, said the Pretty Loud girls.
“All women and girls, especially those from vulnerable groups, should live their lives free from violence, should be encouraged to report violence, and should receive timely and efficient protection against it. As the United Nations in Serbia, in cooperation with all our partners, we will continue our joint efforts towards building a society in which violence is not tolerated and perpetrators are punished”, said Françoise Jacob, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia.
Combating gender-based violence is one of the objectives of the Republic of Serbia’s gender equality policy, and domestic violence is prohibited by law. Despite considerable progress in this regard, many women and girls in Serbia still live in fear of violence and the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 epidemic pose an additional challenge for ensuring their full safety.
“Violence against women and girls is widespread and constitutes a major social problem. It is, therefore, imperative that we all increase our efforts towards preventing violence, as well as working with the perpetrators and educating the youth and entire communities. Roma girls and women are multiply vulnerable and discriminated against, and are exposed to the most serious violation of human rights – child marriage. We must fight against this, since underage marriages affect the social well-being of a country and undermine the development and future of every girl. The very moment that girls enter such unions, they face alarming risks of violence, impaired health, inability to continue their education, and are precluded from gaining economic independence and dreaming of a better life. Child marriage does constitute a form of violence against women and girls”, said Prof. Zorana Mihajlović, Deputy Prime Minister and Chair of the Coordination Body for Gender Equality.
Although gender-based violence is widespread and mostly affects women and girls of various ages and takes various forms, in recent years we have witnessed an increasing number of women who are encouraged to report violence and seek institutional assistance, as well as a developing positive climate in society and communities that are ready to support the victims and condemn violence. The activism and voices of young women, including the members of Pretty Loud, are symbols of the new generations that are capable of changing the reality and creating a society based on equality, in which violence will be totally unacceptable.
The music video for Ravnopravno is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85uoOsHFpaM
PRETTY LOUD is the first all-female Roma band.
It was founded as part of the activities of the GRUBB foundation, at the initiative of a group of girls and young women aged between 15 and 27.
Roma women are predominantly housewives, dropping out of school early and marrying young. Pretty Loud breaks this stereotype. They are proudly fusing rap and hip hop with Roma music to create a unique blend, while combining contemporary and urban movement with the traditional dance. Their lyrics send straightforward messages on the importance of education, the right to
personal choice and independence, and maintain that underage marriage is not a Roma tradition. They sing about their daily challenges, hopes and discrimination, as well as about love and equality.
GRUBB works with Roma children and youth to ensure that everyone can achieve their full potential and social integration. In 2017, GRUBB's innovative method was the winner of the 2017 EU Award for Roma Integration.

Title: United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, in her first official visit to Serbia
Content: 19 November 2021
The United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, is conducting her first official visit to Serbia, from 17 to 20 November 2021. This responds to her prioritization of the prevention and trust-building agenda in the country and the broader region of the Western Balkans, as well as her acknowledgement of the leading role of Serbia in the region. Her visit also builds upon her June 2021 visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Special Adviser has reiterated the importance of encouraging national efforts to build trust across all levels, from the top political leadership to the community level. The Special Adviser has also emphasized the importance of working in this direction in all relevant fields, from education to addressing hate speech, with a particular focus on youth and on promoting inclusiveness and mutual understanding.
During her visit, the Special Adviser has conducted meetings with government officials, representatives of civil society and religious leaders. The Special Adviser’s mandate is not connected to the determination of past crimes, which correspond solely to courts of justice, but is focused on prevention. “This includes acknowledging the suffering experienced by all communities in the past in order to build a future grounded on trust and mutual understanding. Addressing the ongoing trust deficit requires active leadership at all levels,” said the Special Adviser.
In her meetings, the Special Adviser has observed the impact that the legacy of the past has in efforts to move the country forward. “I call on all those in position of authority to do their utmost to focus on what brings the country together rather than on what takes people apart. This does not mean forgetting the crimes that occurred in the past but learning the lessons of the past to build a future where the commission of such crimes is no longer possible.”
In this direction, Special Adviser Wairimu Nderitu remains committed to supporting national efforts aimed at trust-building and will offer her assistance to this effect, in coordination with the United Nations Country Team and in support of the people of Serbia.

Title: Press briefing notes on Western Balkans - OHCHR
Content: 17 November 2021
Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Liz Throssell
Location: Geneva
Date: 12 November 2021
We are concerned at events this week in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, where police stepped in to protect a mural of the convicted war criminal Ratko Mladic painted on a building in the city centre.
The mural in Belgrade is not an isolated incident. Posters, graffiti, other materials and statements praising war criminals are found in other parts of  Serbia, as well as in various towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and elsewhere in the region.
Symbols glorifying convicted war criminals should have no place in the public space. Such symbols are all the more concerning given the recent rise in hate speech and denial of genocide and other atrocity crimes in the Western Balkans – developments that highlight the failure to address the past.
The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is particularly worrying, where such trends are deepening divisions.
We call on the authorities in the region to abide by their international human rights obligations to ensure the rights to truth, justice and reparation, as well as to adopt measures to prevent recurrence and to promote further reconciliation efforts. We call on them to condemn and refrain from all forms of hate speech and incitement to violence and to ensure the perpetrators of such acts are held accountable.
The UN Human Rights Office stands ready to continue offering its guidance on human rights issues to help people in the Western Balkans move forward with the transitional justice processes that are so crucial for the region’s future.

Title: The European Commission and the ILO join forces to support young people
Content: 20 July 2021
The European Commission and the International Labour Organization join forces to support the institutions responsible for youth employment policy in the Western Balkans in introducing a youth guarantee.
Belgrade/Sarajevo/Tirana/Skopje/Podgorica - 20 July 2021 The European Commission (EC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have joined forces to support the institutions responsible for youth employment policy in the Western Balkans in introducing a youth guarantee (YG). The European Training Foundation (ETF) is also a partner in the realization of interventions. Inspired by similar schemes in the EU Member States, a youth guarantee is a commitment to support every young person under the age of 30 who is not employed, in education or training (so-called NEETs). This commitment entitles young people to receive a good quality offer of employment, traineeship, apprenticeship, or continued education within four months of leaving school or becoming unemployed.
The EC/ILO support includes the adaptation of the youth guarantee to the Western Balkans through policy, programming and monitoring support, advanced training, and peer-learning across Western Balkans and EU.
This EC/ILO Technical Assistance Facility (TAF) comes after the second EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Meeting on Employment and Social Affairs on 8 July, at which ministers and representatives responsible for employment endorsed a Declaration on ensuring sustainable labour market integration of young people. The Declaration recognises the disproportionate negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the labour market situation of young people and spells out a commitment to gradually implement youth guarantees in the region. The Declaration takes inspiration from the EU Council Recommendation of 30 October 2020 on A Bridge to Jobs – Reinforcing the Youth Guarantee.
Young people are bearing the brunt of the massive economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, youth employment fell by 8.7 per cent in 2020 compared with 3.7 per cent for adults. An examination of the share of young people who are not in employment, education, or training (NEET) provides a snapshot of young people’s overall vulnerability to the economic situation. Simply stated, if the employment rate goes down, either the NEET rate or the educational participation rate (or both) must increase. Clearly, a reduction of employment compensated by an increase in education is, in principle, more desirable than an increase in NEET rates. However, in the Western Balkans, the loss of employment and the rise in inactivity has not – in general – been offset by a return to education. In Montenegro, for instance, four out of five young people who lost their job became inactive rather than unemployed, but did not go back to education. NEET rates in the Western Balkan economies remained above the pre-crisis level throughout 2020, although in some cases they declined from their peak in 2020Q2, thanks to the measures implemented. In Serbia, one out of five young people fall within the NEET category, but it can be as high as one out of three in other parts of the region.
The ILO has called on governments for action to prevent short-term exit of youth from the labour market turning into long-term exclusion for a generation of young people. The implementation of a youth guarantee could help in avoiding long-term scarring effects, i.e. the increased likelihood of more spells of unemployment or inactivity, lower earning prospects, and lower chances of obtaining a good quality job.
The ILO is a specialised technical agency that leads the action of the United Nations system on employment and the world of work. This partnership with the European Commission to facilitate the establishment of youth guarantees in the Western Balkans builds on the previous EC/ILO Joint Action on the Youth Guarantee targeted at EU member states. It contributes to achieving the objectives set out in the EC’s Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans (EIP) in October 2020. The EIP promotes long-term economic recovery, a green and digital transition, regional integration, and convergence with the European Union; it includes a flagship initiative on the Youth Guarantee with a view to offering better perspectives to young people and mitigating the brain drain.

Title: Children with disabilities in residential institutions in Serbia
Content: 02 July 2021
Belgrade, 2 July 2021 - UNICEF takes note of  the recently published Report on the situation of children with disabilities in residential care in Serbia by civil society  organizations. Many of the concerns articulated in the Report have been tackled through the ongoing reform of the childcare system and deinstitutionalization process.
Serbia has made considerable progress in reducing the number of children in institutions. Globally, Serbia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of children in institutions (under 100 children per 100,000 children). However, children with disabilities are still overrepresented in institutions, their stay is long-term and they are often placed together with adults. Estimates suggest 4 out of 5 children in institutions have a disability. Children with disabilities make up 73,9 % of all children in residential care institutions.
In its Concluding observations on the combined second and third periodic reports of Serbia from 2017, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (among others) recommended the Government of Serbia to immediately reduce the placement of children under the age of 3 years, including with disabilities in residential care institutions, and to implement measures to reduce the number of children in large-scale institutions for children with disabilities and ensure that institutionalization is used only as a last resort. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also urgeed the Government of Serbia in the Concluding observations on the initial report of Serbia in 2016 to strengthen its efforts to deinstitutionalize children, in particular those with intellectual and/or psychosocial disabilities, and to ensure more efficient transition for boys and girls moving from institutions into families.
Children with disability are in any society challenging priority group for services reform, as the alternatives to institutional care require agreed-upon vision and resource intense engagement of different sectors - and Serbia is no exception.
Serbia, as a democratic country, now needs to use its democratic institutions to address this issue. The ongoing child-care reforms and the process of deinstitutionalization must be accelerated to ensure that no child is left behind. This particularly relates to children with disabilities who continue to be overrepresented in residential care and are mostly placed in large-scale facilities. Therefore, decisive action, committed resources, adoption closely monitored implementation of the Strategy for deinstitutionalization are required.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides that every child should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding. Furthermore, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) protects the right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community . However, family strengthening services and measures at the gatekeeping level are underdeveloped so as the most vulnerable families, particularly those with children with disabilities, continue to be at risk of separation and placement into care. Sustainable effects of the process of deinstitutionalization will be achieved only if accompanied with parallel investments into prevention services.
UNICEF is committed to continue and strengthen its support to the Serbian Government’s efforts in this area, and calls on all the Government and development partners to accelerate progress on fulfilling the rights of children with disability and secure the much needed financial resources to ensure that the rights of  children with disabilities become a priority.

Title: UNODC supports practitioners in South Eastern Europe and Italy in addressing drug use disorders among youths
Content: 31 May 2021
UNODC organized a regional capacity development online workshop on “Treatnet Family: Elements of Family Based Treatment for Youths with Drug Use Disorders including in Contact with the Criminal Justice System: Creating Societies Resilient to Drugs and Crime” for practitioners in South Eastern Europe and Italy with the kind support of the Government of Italy.
Adolescence is a time when an individual pattern of biopsychosocial risk and protective factors might increase or reduce vulnerability for the initiation of substance use or involvement in delinquency. Family can be both a risk and a protective factor and Treatnet Family is designed to enhance and strengthen the protective potential of family interactions in families with adolescents using substances including drugs. Treatnet Family is a science-informed training package on elements of family therapy, intended to support practitioners in the health, social and criminal justice sectors who work with youths and their families in resource limited settings, including those in contact with the criminal justice system. Treatnet Family is part of UNODC’s overall Treatnet training package for the treatment of drug use disorders and the initial development was supported by the government of Japan. Implementation has previously shown positive effects in reducing substance use, improving family functioning and mental health.
“Human connection is the opposite of addiction” could have been the motto of the UNODC Treatnet Family workshop with countries from South Eastern Europe and Italy: 35 practitioners from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, working with adolescents with substance use problems in their daily practice, joined the online meeting and in a participatory way enhanced their knowledge and skills on addressing issues related to drug use disorders among youths and related problems associated with family settings. The Treatnet Family trainers Molly Bobek and Hendrik Roozen in this workshop are experienced family therapies and trainers.

Treatnet Family focused on theoretical foundations and core assumptions of family therapy, the spectrum of substance use and substance use disorders and mostly on family therapy core strategies such as reframing and the phases of family therapy work. The five-day online workshop provided ample opportunity for exchange between professionals and to discuss ways to address drug use disorders, particularly among youth, as well as associated challenges.
Participating substance use disorder treatment professionals from the region enhanced their understanding of substance use problems in a systemic perspective and in various role plays learnt to help families break negative cycles in their interactions and instead explore new ways of more supportive interactions and taking care of each other.  A practical example of a perspective change and challenging gridlocked family interactions is captured in the phrase “Catch your child doing something nice” instead of looking out for a problem behavior. The event provided the opportunity for exchange and mutual support also at the regional level despite language barriers: the training was supported by simultaneous interpretation into seven languages.
When presenting their follow-up plans, many practitioners indicated their interest to support further expansion of substance use treatment services for adolescents, including through elements of family therapy, in their countries.

Title: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, on UN 75 anniversary, UN worldwide consultations conducted in Serbia reveal peoples’ strong call for action on climate change, universal access to health care, more solidarity and inclusion
Content: 23 October 2020
Belgrade, 23 – October -  2020 - The UN is marking its 75th anniversary at a moment of great disruption amidst a global health crisis, with serious economic and social consequences for all people, and even more so for the most vulnerable.
In January 2020, the United Nations launched the global consultations to mark its 75th anniversary. This is the UN’s most ambitious effort to date to understand expectations of international cooperation.  People of Serbia were also asked about their hopes and fears for the future. The results for Serbia reflect global results to a large extent. People in Serbia, including youth, identified three priorities – better care for the environment, universal access to health services, solidarity between countries and between people. People in Serbia see climate change, armed conflict, health risks and inequalities, including gender inequalities, as some of the most worrying threats for the future
“In Serbia, we are at a unique moment in time: a new government is coming to power, with the ability to shape an inclusive recovery from COVID-19, spearhead faster progress in ensuring the well-being of all people, reverse rising inequalities and harness the collective efforts from all communities. We are at a crossroads where our collective and individual futures are in all our hands, with a once in a lifetime opportunity to not just recover but build forward better, and create a world fit for every child and young person as they are the future of the world,” says Francoise Jacob, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia.
The response to the pandemic,  shows that global cooperation in the 21st century is about mutual responsibility and shared accountability, among countries, between people and their state, between generations.
Strong multilateral cooperation is the  key to tackle these challenges. Global survey finds that 87% respondents believe that international cooperation is vital to deal with today’s challenges, and COVID made this more evident. Six in ten respondents believe that the UN has made the world a better place. Looking to the future, 74% see the UN as “essential” actor in tackling global challenges.
“On this 75th anniversary of the UN, as recognised by our Secretary-General, multilateralism is key, and it must be both globally connected and locally close to the minds of people. It must be inclusive, with the participation of the youngest and the oldest, women and men, businesses and charities, academia and philanthropy, religion and secularism.  Serbia and her partners are frequent supporters of multilateralism, not only through active participation in the work of the UN multilateral bodies and active contribution to UN peace operations, but also through countless new regional initiatives to promote cooperation. We are grateful and we also remind all of you that Peace starts with each of us,” says Simona-Mirela Miculescu, Representative of the UN SG and Head of UNOB.
Newly appointed President of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia  Ivica Dacic stresses that Serbia remains strongly committed to the goals and principles of the UN Charter, convinced that they are more relevant today than ever. "There is no doubt that the situation in which the world finds itself today requires joint action, solidarity and cooperation. The current COVID-19 pandemic has shown that no country is an isolated "island" and that, regardless of the level of development and existing capacities, it cannot cope with the complex consequences of this crisis on its own. The role of the UN and its specialized agencies is precisely in connecting and directing joint efforts towards overcoming the challenges we face. Therefore, continuous work is needed to adjust and strengthen the efficiency of the UN system, in order to be ready for current and some future challenges. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the UN for its support and assistance in the fight against the pandemic, primarily through cooperation on joint projects and advocacy for the improvement of our health system, "said Ivica Dacic. suffering, but also brought some unexpected positive effects, from cleaner air in densely populated urban areas to solidarity on a global and local level and rapid progress of innovation. Children, young people and adults master various technologies and new skills, because education through digital technologies and distance work have imposed themselves as a new normality," says Mr. Dacic.
While the coronavirus has brought intense suffering to many families and communities in Serbia and around the world, it has also brought some unforeseen positive side effects, from cleaner air in dense urban environments to global and local solidarity and fast progress in innovation. Children, young people and adults are mastering different technologies and gaining new skills as digital education and remote work options have emerged as the new normal.
The crisis, however, has also exposed and further deepened trends of inequalities within the society, including in Serbia, where it continues to impact vulnerable groups more severely.
The United Nations is now shaping its 2021-2025 strategy for its partnership with Serbia, as well as the response plan to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. We plan to address both the needs to adapt to the crisis and the new world it has created, and to mitigate the impact of situations in the future by building forward better, accelerating the reform processes, nurturing trust and transparency, and anchoring sustainability and resilience in the country’s development vision.
To finalize and implement  these forward looking agendas, Serbia can count on the expertise and support of all of its international partners, and most prominently the United Nations and the European Union, bilateral partners and International Financial Institutions. The effective use of resources that are available through a strong multilateral cooperation can boost Serbia’s ambitious forward-looking path.

Title: Fostering regional solidarity - Project “Dialogue for the future“
Content: 11 June 2020
Belgrade, 11 June 2020 - As part of the joint regional programme “Dialogue for the future“ (DFF), today six organizations signed the contract on financial support for the implementation of cross-country projects which will contribute to fostering social cohesion and dialogue in, and between the Republic of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.
“Promotion and respect of cultural diversity of the region is pathway for the sustainable future and open dialogue. No dialogue is possible without respect towards each other.  Strengthening interpersonal solidarity and the well-being of the community as a whole is a key value and support that every society relies on, especially in crisis situations such as the pandemic that has hit the whole world. Greater social cohesion is key to ensure that Leave No One Behind concept is fully implemented. Equally important is the role of education and culture in connecting youth and promoting importance of their role in boosting social cohesion,” says Francoise Jacob, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia.
Out of 106 projects that responded to the public call for proposals, six selected projects from Serbia will receive financial support for implementation:
All projects will be implemented in partnership with organizations from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. The organizations will receive funds in the amount of 190,000 USD for the realization of their projects, and each organization will co-finance their project in the amount of 40,000 USD. Project activities will be realized in Zrenjanin, Kragujevac, Subotica, Smederevo, Sombor, Vrsac, Novi Pazar, Vrnjacka Banja, Loznica, Vranje and Sremski Karlovci.
On behalf of the grantees, Saša Stefanović, Director of the Network of Organizations for Children of Serbia said that “if we strive for strong social cohesion in a society in which diversity is accepted, there is trust in people and in institutions, and solidarity is expressed, we need dialogue and action for the common good”.
"It is necessary for children and young people from marginalized groups to participate in that dialogue. It is important to support them so that their opinions are heard and respected and to ensure that future policies are based on what they say. "I am convinced that the projects that received support for "Dialogue for the Future" will provide an opportunity for boys and girls to participate in something that is important for the entire community," Stefanović pointed out.
Selected projects will contribute to better social cohesion, building capacities of the young people, improved media and digital literacy, promoting dialogue and action for the common good, educational programmes for social cohesion, gender equality, cultural diversity and intercultural understanding, and environmental protection.
The Joint UN Regional Programme "Dialogue for the Future: Promoting Dialogue and Social Cohesion in and Between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia" is implemented by UNDP, UNICEF and UNESCO, with the support of the UN Peacebuilding Fund.

Title: United Nations launches global initiative to combat misinformation
Content: 21 May 2020
NEW YORK, 21 MAY 2020—Today the United Nations is launching ‘Verified’, an initiative to combat the growing scourge of COVID-19 misinformation by increasing the volume and reach of trusted, accurate information.
“We cannot cede our virtual spaces to those who traffic in lies, fear and hate,” said UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, who announced the initiative. “Misinformation spreads online, in messaging apps and person to person. Its creators use savvy production and distribution methods. To counter it, scientists and institutions like the United Nations need to reach people with accurate information they can trust.”
Verified, led by the UN Department for Global Communications (DGC), will provide information around three themes: science – to save lives; solidarity – to promote local and global cooperation; and solutions – to advocate for support to impacted populations. It will also promote recovery packages that tackle the climate crisis and address the root causes of poverty, inequality and hunger.
The initiative is calling on people around the world to sign up to become “information volunteers” to share trusted content to keep their families and communities safe and connected. Described as digital first responders, the volunteers will receive a daily feed of verified content optimized for social sharing with simple, compelling messaging that either directly counters misinformation or fills an information void.
DGC will partner with UN agencies and UN country teams, influencers, civil society, business and media organizations to distribute trusted, accurate content and work with social media platforms to root out hate and harmfulassertions about COVID-19.
“In many countries the misinformation surging across digital channels is impeding the public health response and stirring unrest. There are disturbing efforts to exploit the crisis to advance nativism or to target minority groups, which could worsen as the strain on societies grows and the economic and social fallout kicks in,” Melissa Fleming, UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, said. “The Verified initiative will also work to address this trend with hopeful content that celebrates local acts of humanity, the contributions of refugees and migrants, and makes the case for global cooperation.”
The initiative is a collaboration with Purpose, one of the world’s leading social mobilization organizations. It issupported by the IKEA Foundation and Luminate.
Patricia Atkinson, the IKEA Foundation’s Chief Programmes Officer, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis. The IKEA Foundation is proud to be supporting Verified -- an initiative aiming to make sure everyone has access to the trusted science and advice they need to keep their family and loved onessafe.”
Nishant Lalwani, Managing Director of Luminate, added: “COVID-19 has provided a stark reminder that access to accurate, trusted information can be the difference between fear and resilience, division and unity, and even life and death. We are proud to be supporting Verified and its work to tackle the coronavirus ‘infodemic’ by rapidly spreading reliable, science-based information to protect people and communities around the world.”

Title: UNHCR warns stateless people risk being left behind in Corona Virus response
Content: 13 May 2020
The UN Refugee Agency is urging Governments worldwide to pay urgent attention to the plight of millions of stateless people and to follow a set of recommendations the organization has issued today to ensure their coverage in the COVID-19 response.
Geneva-Belgrade, 12-May-2020 - UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is urging Governments worldwide to pay urgent attention to the plight of millions of stateless people and to follow a set of recommendations the organization has issued today to ensure their coverage in the COVID-19 response.
“Millions of people around the world are denied a nationality and the legal rights endowed with it. They do not exist on paper and most often live on the fringes of society. Our worry is that at such a critical time, in the middle of a global pandemic, they now are at great risk of being left behind in the response,” said Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Without citizenship, stateless people often do not have access to essential services, including health care, and now may also be precluded from or face obstacles in accessing coronavirus testing and treatment. Others may refrain from accessing services for fear that their legal status can put them at risk of detention or deportation.
“We must repeat that exclusion does not benefit anyone, least of all the global effort to contain the virus. The pandemic can only be beaten if everyone, regardless of their legal status, is included in the response. Nobody can be protected unless everybody is included, and that means including often invisible, stateless populations,” said Grandi.
Some 3.9 million stateless people appear in the reporting of 78 countries but the true number is likely to be far greater. Without legal rights and access to services, statelessness leaves many politically and economically marginalized, discriminated against and vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.
In many countries across the world, stateless people live in sub-standard and inadequate sanitary conditions which can compound the risk of outbreaks. Limited by their legal status, many work in informal sectors, which can also hamper adherence to public health protocols such as self-isolation and physical distancing.
Most persons at risk of statelessness in the Republic of Serbia, belong to the Roma ethnic minority, many of whom fled KiM. Those living in informal settlements or unofficial collective centres faced extra challenges in observing the recommendations of the health experts. Many also lost their, however limited, means of income due to movement restrictions.
Persons at risk of statelessness in Serbia, who lack documentation or cannot register permanent residence in the places where they actually live, remain invisible to the system and can too often not access public assistance, services or welfare. UNHCR partners swiftly provided humanitarian assistance, intervened in cases where authorities discriminated against them,  and called on independent State bodies to ensure that citizens lacking documents or registration are not left behind in local and national COVID-19 prevention or recovery efforts.
Authorities should also adopt and implement special measures not to exclude needy citizens from equal access to state financial assistance, just because they lack ID cards. The UN Refugee Agency continues supporting Serbia in its efforts to reduce statelessness and to pro-actively protect the health and rights of persons at risk of statelessness especially in its current COVID-19 response.
In some countries, considerable numbers of stateless people are also being held in prolonged pre-removal detention on the basis that they are not considered as legal residents and there is no country to deport them to. In addition to the violation of their right to liberty, they now face the prospect of increased risk of infection, as doctors and medical associations around the world have raised concerns about the potential of COVID-19 to spread within these centers.
UNHCR is also concerned about the potential for mitigation and response measures to fuel xenophobia and discrimination for those perceived to be at risk of contagion, given a majority of the world’s known stateless population belong to minority groups and are particularly vulnerable to discrimination.
“This virus is exposing both the devastating consequences of statelessness and the urgency of the need to resolve it. The right to a nationality is a fundamental human right and in this time of crisis it can mean the difference between life or death,” said Grandi.
To ensure the protection and inclusion of stateless people in the public health response, UNHCR has issued guidance on policy and good practices. Some of these recommendations include:

Title: “Danas Daily” Labour Day interview with Jovan Protic, ILO NC for Serbia
Content: 01 May 2020
1.  The call for solidarity in the area of labour, made by international organizations and trade unions to the national governments could remain without response, similarly to the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. At the same time, the international workers’ movement has been weakened, so does it appear that the implications upon labour will depend upon the “economic mercy” of the states?
We have to acknowledge that this crisis is very different from previous ones. It is not only a health crisis but also a social and economic crisis. Talking about the economic fallout, there is no playbook on how to handle such a huge challenge based on both supply and demand shocks. Business disruptions have lowered production, creating shocks to supply. And consumers’ and businesses’ reluctance to spend has lowered demand.
The expected drop in manufacturing might be comparable to the global financial crisis in 2008/09, but the decline in services appears larger this time — reflecting the large impact of social distancing.
What we see in many countries is more than a mercy approach. Despite the missing playbook, many governments try to go for substantial targeted policies to support the economy through the pandemic. The goal is very often to prevent a temporary crisis from permanently harming people and firms through job losses and bankruptcies. But, the consistency and quality of the responses vary from country to country. The success of keeping the impact on labour low will also greatly depend on the strength of national institutions and the commitment to evidence based policy making, the trust vested in them by the citizens and the rule of law. Another important factor is just and interest-based social dialogue which could transpose the calls for solidarity into action. This largely depends upon the trustworthiness of those who participate in it.
2.  The economists have been warning that the profit maximization logic in the global competition and mainly neoliberal economies was on the brink of collapse even before the pandemic. Will all this which is now happening, contrary to globalization and neo-liberalism, lead to the opposite extreme, or will the world be compelled to learn new methods of doing business, production and interest-based connections (?) Is that going to speed up the changes in the area of labour and are the trade unions fit to confront with those challenges?
The globalization in the past few decades was undoubtedly lead by the profit maximization logic, but on the other hand it has helped raise incomes across the globe, rapidly develop economies and lift millions out of poverty. Factors that have contributed to it were international trade deals, rapidly developing economies and easier travel, which have all created a system that is much more dependent now on what is happening on the other side of the world than it ever was. That has come with a price - the increased risks of contagion, be it financial or medical, to the extent that those risks have become the underbelly of globalization. The pandemic has exposed those risks and made the people much more risk-averse - it has disrupted supply chains overnight and forced the companies and customers to look for alternatives locally. It will definitely make the businesses look more into their neighborhood rather than across the globe, and as much as it will probably slow down the global economic growth it might create new opportunities for emerging enterprises that might fill up the niches left by the disruption of global supply chains. To what extent the workers and new entrants to the labour market will benefit from those new opportunities will depend upon the ability of the national governments to recognize the opportunities, and upon the capacity of trade unions to reach out to smaller and new businesses. Thus, the crisis might turn into an important motivating factor for the trade unions to make an additional effort to approach and grasp for new membership in smaller and local businesses rather than focus on their “traditional clients”.
3.  In Serbia there are not yet any data on how many workers have lost their jobs, permanently or temporarily, due to the pandemic. The unions claim that already at the end of March there were dozens of thousands of such workers and that the figures will double by the end of April. The Chamber of Commerce stated that in March 67,000 workers stayed at home and did not work and approximately 170 companies have practically halted their production. Do you have any data about the increase of unemployment or any estimates for the near future (?), can the employment after the crisis return quickly to the pre-crisis level?
In order to make quick progress on collecting these new data, the ILO and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) joined forces two weeks ago. We established a joint task force to assess the impact of the crisis on the economies of the Western Balkans by examining the likely short- and medium-term effects on employment
So far we do not yet have precise figures for Serbia, but we expect to come up with the results of the task force by the beginning of June. We are aware that workers are being laid off temporarily, especially in tourism and services, but they do not yet show up in unemployment statistics. The development of unemployment will very much depend on how quickly companies resume work and how quickly the national economic picks up.
How quickly the employment in Serbia will return to pre-crisis level will primarily depend on the economic growth, but also on the ability of the policy-makers to come up with improved activation policies, as Serbia had substantive inactive labour force reserves prior to the pandemic. If the 3% economic decline in 2020 is indeed followed by a strong growth in 2021, as forecasted by the IMF, Serbia will have relatively good chances for employment recovery, but it will also depend a lot on the economic trends in Europe overall which are not nearly as optimistic. A lot of economic output and employment in Serbia is linked to European (and global) supply chains, so if some major industries in Europe – such as car industry – do not recover quickly, that will certainly affect the pace of recovery in Serbia, too.
4.  As a lot of people in Serbia have fixed-term contracts, or are employed through private employment agencies, or are engaged as seasonal workers, or work in the informal economy, we assume that they are the hardest hit because they have practically lost their income, and will get nothing from the state because the state measures do not recognize them. How can this part of the labour force be assisted to survive the period of the crisis?
For informal economy workers, reduced hours due to the pandemic means indeed a loss of income with no possibility of receiving unemployment benefits. This is not a specificity of Serbia - informal micro and small enterprises constitute 80 per cent of enterprises worldwide and are generally out of reach of public policies. Part-time workers, many of who are women, temporary workers, or workers under short-term contracts and in the digital gig economy are not eligible for unemployment benefit or income support in most of the countries.
Many of them face the same “work or lose your income” dilemma as informal economy workers. To pay their food and other basic expenses they often continue to work until forced to stop by measures to limit contagion by the virus. This compounds the economic insecurity they already face.
The only immediate measure of the Government in this case is income support which could be extended through non-contributory social security schemes or existing cash transfer programs. Support could also be offered temporarily to informal enterprises, but it would require conditionality that they register and formalize after the end of the pandemic. In adopting short-term responses to the crisis, urgent attention should be devoted to protecting low-income households, rather than giving away 100 EUR to each adult citizen of Serbia regardless of the level of income.
5.  Legislative changes last year in Serbia, especially in the area of labour force leasing (Private employment agencies law), have apparently come at the right moment for future employers through those agencies. Experiences from other countries show that the liberalization of engagement of such agencies drastically reduce and limit the workers’ rights, their incomes are lower and they are turned into precarious workers. Our trade unions did not manage to convince the Government to give up on this Law or to improve it in the making. Is this law going to be their major problem during and after the pandemic?
Serbia has ratified the ILO Convention 181 on Private employment agencies in 2013, which invites the ILO member countries to regulate the work of those agencies by their national legislation. Trade unions in Serbia have long opposed the adoption of any legislation that would regulate the work of those agencies, believing that their work would cease if it doesn’t get regulated, which was a profound mistake. Banning the work of those agencies is not an option, so regulating their work – even if not to the level required by the trade unions, is better than leaving them the room to interpret themselves the broader conditions for their work.
What is really important is a substantial economic recovery and the build-up of the rule of law that would create more and better employment overall, thus creating better job opportunities to the workers as an alternative to low-paid work through the agencies. To what extent this Law be a problem to the trade unions depends upon their ability to recognize these developments that can truly benefit the workers overall and whether or not they will be willing to support the elimination of socio-economic inefficiencies that hinder the economic growth.
6.  The ILO estimated that the measures and limitations imposed due the pandemic could leave between 13 and 35 million people around the world without employment. The ILO estimates that “work in poverty” until the end of the year will affect between 8 and 35 million workers, who will retain their jobs but with minimal salaries. At the same time some 200 million people will lose their income due to reduction of salaries. How can one make progress in such world which will certainly not be able to recover for years? Are the public works part of the solution to this problem, and/or some modern Marshall Plans?
The initial global projection of the ILO from March was that up to 25 Mio people could lose employment because of the economic crisis caused by the pandemic, which is around 13% increase of global pre-pandemic unemployment of around 190 million workers. In the meantime we see a high risk that the end of the year figure of additional unemployed will be even higher than the initial projection.
For comparison, the 2008-9 financial crisis increased unemployment by 22 Mio globally, so the virus could have a more damaging impact on employment than the financial crisis. We need to understand that the COVID-19 pandemic is a unique economic challenge different from other crisis. Shocks reverberate through both supply (disrupted supply chains, containment measures, and lockdown of non-essential economic activities) and demand (lower consumption of goods and services due to declining household incomes, restriction of movements, and uncertainty) which makes the economic and social crisis very severe.
We need an entire package of measures starting with protecting workers in the workplace reducing the risk of exposure to the virus, to policies to protect jobs and income like short time work schemes, insurance-based unemployment benefits or other income support schemes for those who are not covered like informal workers. Enterprises, especially small and medium sized companies, will need temporary liquidity assistance in form of preferential loans or grants.
The ILO has come out with a compendium of the policy responses designed by its 187 member states in order to facilitate exchange and learning, which can be reached through our website.
We are in constant contact with the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy of Serbia and with the social partners and one of our first post-pandemic activities in this country will be the assistance to the drafting of the new National Employment Strategy 2021-2025, which will certainly take into account the new realities and help Serbia adapt and accelerate the growth of its employment rate.

Title: A new normal: UN lays out roadmap to lift economies and save jobs after COVID-19
Content: 28 April 2020
New York, 27 April 2020 – The urgent health crisis that is COVID-19 has created a historic recession with record levels of deprivation and unemployment, creating an unprecedented human crisis that is hitting the poorest hardest, especially women and children. In a new framework released today as a roadmap to support countries’ path to social and economic recovery, the United Nations calls for an extraordinary scale-up of international support and political commitment to ensure that people everywhere have access to essential services and social protection.
The “United Nations Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19: Shared responsibility, global solidarity and urgent action for people in need”  calls for protecting jobs, businesses and livelihoods to set in motion a safe recovery of societies and economies as soon as possible for a more sustainable, gender-equal, and carbon-neutral path—better than the “old normal”.
“This is not only a health crisis but a human crisis; a jobs crisis; a humanitarian crisis and a development crisis. And it is not just about the most vulnerable. This pandemic shows that we are all at risk because we are only as strong as the weakest health system. Its unprecedented scale demands an unprecedented response,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who presented his report on the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 “Shared Responsibility, Global Solidarity” in March.
“Everything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change and the many other global challenges we face,” he said. This new framework released today sets the way United Nations entities will deliver this vision on the ground.
Decisions made in the next few months will be crucial for the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UN’s framework for social and economic recovery stresses.
Noting that during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, more people died from the interruption of social services and the economic breakdown than from the virus itself, the framework focuses on protecting the needs and rights of those most affected by the pandemic, starting with the most vulnerable countries, groups, and those who risk being left behind.
Drawing lessons from the 2008-2009 global economic and financial crisis, the framework notes that countries with strong social protection systems and basic services suffered the least and recovered the fastest. To prevent billions of people from sliding into poverty, governments around the world will need to rapidly adapt, extend and scale-up safety ‘cushions’, such as cash transfers, food assistance, social insurance schemes and child benefits to support families.
For the impacts of COVID-19 to be reduced, the UN calls for an extraordinary scale-up of support to cope with the challenges ahead, including immediate social protection responses that consider differentiated impacts on vulnerable groups, children, women, men, and those in the informal sector. This is particularly urgent considering that 4 billion people, more than half of the world population—including two out of three children—have no or inadequate social protection.
NOTES FOR THE EDITORS
The UN will focus on five key streams in its response, which places communities at the centre of recovery efforts: 1.protecting existing health services and strengthening health systems’ capacity to respond to COVID-19; 2. helping people cope with adversity, through social protection and basic services; 3. protecting jobs, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and informal sector workers through economic recovery programmes; 4. guiding the necessary surge in fiscal and financial stimulus to make macroeconomic policies work for the most vulnerable and strengthening multilateral and regional responses; and 5. promoting social cohesion and investing in community-led resilience and response systems. These five streams are connected by action to meet the need for environmental sustainability, if countries are to recover and “build back better”, and be better prepared to address future shocks, including pandemics.
UN teams covering 162 countries and territories will rollout this recovery plan in the next 12 to 18 months, under the leadership of UN Resident Coordinators (RC), supported by a network of global and regional expertise. As the technical lead in the socio-economic recovery efforts, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) will support RCs, with UN teams working as one across all aspects of the response.
While a significant proportion of the existing US$17.8 billion portfolio of sustainable development programmes across UN entities will be adjusted towards COVID-19 needs, given the scale and scope of the socio-economic impact of the pandemic, additional funds will be required. To support these efforts, the Secretary-General launched the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, a UN inter-agency fund mechanism to help support low- and middle-income programme countries overcome the health and development crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and support people most vulnerable to economic hardship and social disruption. The financial requirements of the Fund are projected at $1billion in the first nine months and will be subsequently reviewed. The Secretary-General also called for a multilateral response that amounts to at least 10 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) to mount the most effective response to crisis the world has ever seen.
There will be no return to the “old normal”, the framework document states. The pandemic is a blow to developing and emerging economies that already face binding constraints of debt and limited fiscal space, with several developing countries needing urgent debt relief. Its impacts will be especially devastating for the most vulnerable countries – those in humanitarian or conflict settings. The UN also calls for a massive fiscal and financial repurposing in the next weeks and months, including the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies to aid the response. The UN stresses that the status quo and business-as-usual are policy choices, and they are not inevitable. For a sustainable development that benefits more people, the choice must be for a recovery from COVID-19 that is fast, fair, green and inclusive.
About the framework document : The “United Nations Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19: Shared responsibility, global solidarity and urgent action for people in need”, released today puts in practice the UN Secretary-General’s Shared Responsibility, Global Solidarity report on the same subject. It is one of three critical components of the UN’s efforts to save lives, protect people, and rebuild better, alongside the health response, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the humanitarian response, as detailed in the UN-led COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan. Three funding mechanisms support the comprehensive response pillars: The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, managed by the UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation for the immediate health needs; the  “Global Humanitarian Response Plan” for the humanitarian appeal; and the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund for the socio-economic recovery.
About the UN Development System: The United Nations development system is the world’s largest international actor on social protection and basic services. The UN System is present in 162 countries and territories and reaches tens of millions of people through basic services, social transfers and other forms of social protection. The UN Development System has extensive experience in supporting governments in developing social protection systems including social protection floors and delivery of quality social services and to support such services across humanitarian and development contexts. unsdg.un.org

Title: UNFPA Serbia Statement on COVID-19 with regard to pregnant women and lactating mothers
Content: 16 March 2020
Belgrade, 16 March 2020 - Sexual and reproductive health is a significant public health issue during epidemics, and safe pregnancy and childbirth depends on functioning health systems and strict adherence to infection precautions.
As the COVID-19 outbreak may raise specific concerns among pregnant women, UNFPA would like to share a synthesis of the limited evidence on the risks for this group as well as the preventive measures and supportive therapies recommended.
To date, there is no scientific evidence about the increased susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19. However, pregnancy brings physical changes that might make some pregnant women more susceptible to viral respiratory infections. Pregnant women with respiratory illnesses must be treated with the utmost priority due to increased risk of adverse outcomes.
Pregnant women should take the same preventive actions to avoid infection recommended for all adults, such as avoiding close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing, washing hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub, covering mouth and nose with a tissue or elbow when coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. All recommended actions are available on the WHO website.
At this time, there is not yet a vaccine to prevent or treatment to cure the virus but there is recommended treatment for the symptoms. Treatment for pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection should be provided with the supportive therapies recommended by WHO for adult patients in close consultation with their OB/GYN.
Breastfeeding women should not be separated from their newborns, as there is no evidence to show that respiratory viruses can be transmitted through breast milk, according to UNICEF. The mother can continue breastfeeding, as long as the necessary precautions below are applied:
●     Symptomatic mothers well enough to breastfeed should wear a mask when near a child (including during feeding), wash hands before and after contact with the child (including feeding), and clean/disinfect contaminated surfaces;
●     If a mother is too ill to breastfeed, she should be encouraged to express milk that can be given to the child via a clean cup and/or spoon – while wearing a mask, washing hands before and after contact with the child, and cleaning/disinfecting contaminated surfaces.
Provision of mental health and psychosocial support for affected individuals, families, communities and health workers is a critical part of the response.
UNFPA stands with the affected communities, particularly the most vulnerable women and girls, whose protection and health needs must be at the center of response efforts. We are working with our staff around the world to review our internal preparedness as well as our engagement with partners, governments and the communities we serve to prevent and respond to the epidemic.

Title: UN in Serbia – Repeated and clear communication, and citizen action, are required to prevent further spread of COVID 19 virus in Serbia
Content: 13 March 2020
Belgrade, 13 March 2020 – WHO Director-General declared a COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. So far almost 125,000 cases from 118 countries and territories have been reported to WHO. The number of cases reported outside China has increased almost 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has almost tripled.
“This is a new virus. We can learn a lot from what has happened and is happening in other countries in the past 2 months; and we must adapt the best practices. The number of infected people is likely to increase in Serbia, but the results of the measures introduced in countries like China, Taiwan, Singapore show that the virus can be contained effectively with courageous measures, and the participation of all citizens. Systems are in place in Serbia to address such situation, as long as the virus spread is contained,” says Dr Marijan Ivanusa, the WHO representative and Head of the Office in Serbia.
The UN Country Team in Serbia acknowledges timely measures announced by the Government of the Republic of Serbia to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impacts.
“Taking strong steps now to slow the spread of coronavirus and flatten the curve of contamination will help communities and individuals. While on average 80% of infected individuals will feel only mild symptoms, the experience in other countries show that 20% will require dedicated medical support or hospitalization. We all need to work together to protect the vulnerable segments of the population, the elderly, the people with existing medical conditions, and the communities with little access to hygiene and medical facilities,” says Francoise Jacob, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia.
Every citizen has the capacity to contribute by  protecting themselves and  protecting  others -  be it at home, in schools and universities, at the workplace or in the transport system.
It is of critical importance to follow the basic principles outlined in public statements, such as:

The UN in Serbia will support the government and the people of Serbia to address the challenges of the COVID 19, expand the medical services, reach out to all and save lives.
Additional information and educational materials (published by WHO, Ministries of Health, Institute of Public Health Dr Milan Jovanovic Batut) on the topic of COVID 19 virus prevention can be downloaded from the following link. We strongly encourage media colleagues  to further promote it through your channels! Folder will be updated on regular basis.

Title: The United Nations launches 75th anniversary dialogues: The biggest global conversation on the world's future starts now
Content: 02 January 2020
January 1, 2020 saw the launch of the UN75 initiative - the largest, most inclusive conversation on the role of global cooperation in building a better future for all. The initiative will see the UN spark dialogues throughout 2020 in diverse settings across the world.
In a ‘global reality check’, four innovative data streams will build the first ever repository of crowd-sourced solutions to major global challenges.
The UN75 dialogues together with a ‘One-minute Survey’ that anyone can take, opinion polling in 50 countries and artificial intelligence sentiment analysis of traditional and social media in 70 countries, will generate compelling data to inform national and international policies and debate.
In calling for participation, the Secretary-General said:
“No country, no community, is able to solve the complex problems of our world alone. We need to come together, not only to talk, but to listen. It is absolutely essential that you all join the conversation. We need your opinion, your strategies and your ideas for us to be able to deliver better for the people of the world that we must serve.”
Intended to engage constituencies across borders, sectors and generations, the UN75 team is collaborating with a wide multi-sector network, including the UN Resident Coordinators, for a diverse and global reach, and for dialogues to be convened in every country of the world. In a global listening exercise, with an emphasis on youth and groups not already engaged with the UN, the UN75 initiative aims to better understand expectations of international cooperation in light of pressing global challenges.
The views and ideas that are generated will be presented, by the Secretary-General, to world leaders and senior UN officials on September 21, 2020, at a high-level event to mark the 75th anniversary.
To inspire and inform the dialogues the UN is also partnering with Vox Media’s brand studio, Vox Creative to create a video informed by interviews with 38 people from around the world, sharing their experiences and opinions related to important global issues, to be launched January 6, 2020.
Those who want to be a part of the conversation - physically or online – can see how to join through the website: www.un.org/UN75. For further information and/or to request an interview, please contact Lisa Laskaridis (lisa.laskaridis@un.org)

Title: On Human Rights Day 2019 international organizations urge for more support for Serbian youth
Content: 10 December 2019
Even though the overall unemployment rate has been decreasing recently, high youth unemployment remains the same, despite the National Youth Strategy and other efforts. According to the most recent labour force data available, the youth unemployment rate is twice as high as the general unemployment rate. Especially concerning is the fact that youth aged 18 to 30 are also at the highest risk of poverty.
Belgrade, 10 December 2019 – On Human Rights Day this year, we focus on youth faced with challenges in many parts of the world, including in Serbia. Youth unemployment, poverty risk, and mental health concerns are just some of the problems that Serbian youth face.
Even though the overall unemployment rate has been decreasing recently, high youth unemployment remains the same, despite the National Youth Strategy and other efforts. According to the most recent labour force data available, the youth unemployment rate is twice as high as the general unemployment rate. Especially concerning is the fact that youth aged 18 to 30 are also at the highest risk of poverty.
The situation of marginalised youth groups, such as young Roma is especially difficult, since they are not expressly identified as a vulnerable group in the Law on Public Health. Health care, especially in rural areas, is not equally available to all citizens, including rural youth.
As regards youth mental health, as many as 45% reported being constantly worried about something, and 28% – crying frequently. More than a half of the respondents reported having experienced at least one stressful event in the past two years, with 23% of them experiencing more than one. As many as 12% of the respondents reported feeling completely worthless, while 7% reported having considered ending their lives.
Although an accurate figure cannot be reliably ascertained, the European Statistical Office data show that over 4,000 people leave Serbia each month, and 51,000 – predominantly youth – each year. At an annual level, this corresponds to approximately an entire Serbian municipality.
For youth in Serbia to ensure their rights and greater autonomy, on this Human Rights Day, the UN Country Team in Serbia, the Council of Europe Office in Belgrade, the OSCE Mission to Serbia and the EU Delegation to Serbia affirm that young people should be offered meaningful support, conducive to their self-sustainability and empowerment. We reiterate that it is essential to ensure options for their full participation in society and opportunities to freely express themselves, so that no one speaks on their behalf.
It is crucial that youth, regardless of their background, and especially the most vulnerable groups, be recognised as decision-makers on their own lives, with an equal voice, as their participation in law-, policy- and decision-making at all levels is indispensable.
While overcoming the challenges of transition from childhood to adulthood, from education to economic independence, many young men and women lack support. Youth with disabilities encounter additional barriers to continuing their education or contracting employment in the open labour market.
All young people, regardless of their identity traits, including their ethnic, religious, political, economic and social status, as well as sexual identity should enjoy equal rights, freedoms, and protection.
We want to be  clear: young people are not alone and young people matter. Thousands of young people in Serbia and the region are supported, policies and legal frameworks are improved, and youth voice is strengthened and mainstreamed under the programmes of the UN Country Team, Council of Europe Office in Belgrade, OSCE Mission to Serbia and EU Delegation to Serbia. Last year we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Next year marks 70 years of the European Convention on Human Rights, so it is essential that youth continue to be recognised as one of the key groups of human rights holders, since they are among the most vulnerable, as well as among the strongest proponents of the values of diversity and solidarity.

Title: Countries in Pan-European region making progress on equitable access to water and sanitation but important ‎gaps remain

Ensuring equitable access must be central to efforts to realize the basic human rights to water and sanitation. However, despite significant progress in the provision of water and sanitation in the pan-European region, the latest data of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) shows that 31 million people do not have access to basic sanitation and 314,000 people still practise open defecation, majority of whom live in small rural settings. Furthermore, between 2000 and 2017, over 16 million people have yet to enjoy access to basic drinking water and over 48 million people do not have piped water at home. Countries of the region therefore still have a long way to go to meet equitable access targets of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (on clean water and sanitation for all) of the 2030 Agenda.
On the occasion of its 5th session of the Meeting of the Parties currently on-going in Belgrade (Serbia), the Protocol on Water and Health launched today its new publication “The Human Rights to Water and Sanitation in Practice: Findings and lessons learned from the work on equitable access to water and sanitation under the Protocol on Water and Health in the pan-European region” which capitalizes on  countries’ experiences in improving equitable access to water and sanitation.
Indeed, for almost 10 years, the Protocol on Water and Health , which is jointly serviced by UNECE and WHO-Europe, has been supporting countries (in particular Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, France, Hungary, North Macedonia, Republic of Moldova, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, Ukraine) in appraising - through self-assessments, and improving- via concrete actions, equitable access to water and sanitation at local and national levels.
As shown in the publication, the work on equitable access to water and sanitation carried out across the region shed light on remaining inequity challenges and access gaps often not discussed or not well understood because of a lack of data available. Geographical disparities, both in physical access and in price of water and sanitation services, are still important between rural and urban areas. Specific barriers faced by vulnerable and marginalized groups are also a common issue, and they often do not receive the attention they deserve. Affordability is also a growing concern. Finally, governance frameworks often lack specific equitable access targets and indicators which could help to track and address inequities.
In the region, countries have taken initiatives and implemented concrete actions to address these challenges, building on the findings of detailed assessments of the situation they undertook. In North Macedonia for example, several improvements took place, such as the renovation of toilets in village schools, the building of public toilets close to the main taxi station in Skopje and the renovation of toilets in many public institutions, now opened to the public and free of charge. In the Spanish municipality of Castello, seven public fountains have been installed to guarantee access to drinking water.
To address inequities challenges, some countries also opted for action at policy level to have a more informed decision making. This is the case of Armenia, where a specific action plan to improve equity (2018–2020) was endorsed: on-going work on identifying the legislative barriers to ensure equitable proposed the inclusion of a definition of vulnerable and marginalized groups in the Water Code. In France, a new law was adopted in 2013 to improve the affordability of water and sanitation services. In Bulgaria, the government is currently developing a regulatory framework to ensure sanitation in schools. In North Macedonia, local NGOs were mobilized to lobby future mayoral candidates to include actions in their programme activities that had been identified as part of the local equitable access plans developed at municipal level.
The work on equitable access have also allowed countries to raise awareness among diverse WASH stakeholders and beyond and enhance cross-sectoral cooperation– bringing together human right community, Ministries of education, justice, social protection, labour and enabling a common undertaking to make sure access is provided for all.
The Protocol on Water and Health will continue to support countries to improve equitable access to water and sanitation in its future Programme of Work (2020-2022) to be adopted tomorrow, during the last day of its 5th session of the Meeting of the Parties.

Title: Exports, investment and networking take centre stage at first Serbian grain conference
Content: 01 November 2019
Serbia ranks as one of the world’s top largest grain exporters and offers many advantages in terms of trade – from high-quality grains to favourable transport links along the Pan-European Corrridor VII, which connects the Black Sea to the North Sea.
Serbian grain yields are still 15 to 20 percent lower than in the European Union. But Serbia is quickly catching up with maize yields increasing by a quarter and wheat yields by a third over the last ten years.
Around 200 grain and oil seed industry leaders from Serbia and abroad gathered in Belgrade today for the first ever Serbia Grain Conference.
In addition to export possibilities for Serbian grain, the conference looked at logistics, bottlenecks limiting sector growth, the impact of climate change on grain yields and quality and global grain projections and market trends. It also explored investment needs to increase trade efficiency.
Emmanuel Hidier, FAO Senior Economist, noted that “further mid- to long-term investment, like modernizing irrigation systems to cope with a changing climate and reduced rainfall, would boost production and yields,” he said.
Miljan Zdrale, EBRD Head Agribusiness for Central and South-Eastern Europe, added that investing in expanding port capacities, building new silos and upgrading the existing ones would “put Serbia in a good position, especially in years of high productivity, to respond to grain shortages elsewhere.”
The event was organized by the Serbian Grain Association with support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Serbian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management.
For the last two years, FAO and the EBRD have supported the Government and the Serbian Grain Association in their efforts to strengthen Serbia’s standing as a major producer and exporter of grain and oilseeds.
They have facilitated public-private policy dialogue to discuss domestic grain infrastructure, grain quality, trade and export issues, including phytosanitary requirements for wheat exports to Egypt, one of the world’s biggest grain importers.
The Serbian Grain Association, with FAO and EBRD support, has also become stronger over the last two years.
It has increased its membership and its visibility through a new website, a monthly e-newsletter and its participation in major international grain events. The Association, for example, hosted a round table at Global Grain Geneva, Europe’s largest annual meeting of grain players, to promote Serbian grain.
Today’s conference was a unique opportunity for networking and creating business contacts with key stakeholders. Serbian government officials, representatives from the International Grain Council, the Serbian Grain Association and national and multinational companies, national and international experts, grain traders and exporters were among the participants.
Serbia is looking to make its grain conference an annual event, bringing public and private sector players together to advance the industry.

Title: UNECE presents recommendations for the sustainable future of the Drina River Basin
Content: 29 October 2019
How can we create new opportunities for integrated investment projects and to support sustainable development of water and energy resources in the Drina river basin, shared by Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia? How can potential trade-offs be limited in favour of harnessing possibilities for cross-sectoral and cross-boundary cooperation?
These questions were at the heart of discussions between basin countries in Belgrade this week as authorities representing different natural resource management sectors, environmental protection and representatives of power utilities, civil society organizations and financial institutions discussed the recommendations of the Drina River Basin Nexus follow-up project, implemented by UNECE.
The high-level workshop, organized by UNECE and supported by the Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea, provided a platform for dialogue on how to foster transboundary cooperation across sectors, improving monitoring and knowledge about factors affecting water quality and erosion, achieving a more balanced flow regulation, including environmental flows, and promoting investment into sustainable renewable energy.
The dialogue was conducted around two key questions that are decisive for the future of the water-energy-environment nexus in the Drina river basin:
Among the project’s key recommendations are to improve information exchange for the Drina’s sustainable management.  In particular, the project – conducted in 2018-2019 under the Water Convention –  underlines the need for improved monitoring of water quality, incorporating hydrobiological quality elements and hydromorphology, requiring better harmonization for shared water bodies. Such information will allow to more effectively design measures, including to address pollution, and limit environmental impacts from future development.
Related to energy, the project called for efforts towards defining and agreeing a more optimal flow regulation, implying accounting for environmental needs and other water uses, in addition to hydropower generation. Without a basin-wide approach to managing the Drina River which is continuously transforming by erosion and sedimentation, efficiency of investment into flood protection and hydropower generation is affected. The project makes country-specific recommendations based on multi-stakeholder dialogue to promote investment into sustainable renewable energy, including wind and solar, and to capitalize on so far underdeveloped intersectoral opportunities like harnessing wastewater as a resource.
State Secretary at the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the Republic of Serbia Ivan Karić stressed: “the Drina is one of our most beatiful rivers, and citizens of Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia are privileged to live by it. However, we also share the responsibility for managing the Drina, and we need to jointly ensure its sustainable future.“
Salvatore d’Angelo of the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea Protection, which has been supporting the Drina Nexus River Basin project since its launch four years ago, said: “Integrated water management approach for the Drina river would assure regional security, stability and sustainable development, and [Italy supports] available tools that help address the issues, such as the Water Convention.”
The UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia, Ms. Françoise Jacob and the Director at the Office of UNECE’s Executive Secretary, Mr. Kire Ilioski, welcomed the participants by outlining the role of this project as an “accelerator” to tackle transboundary issues in the Drina river basin, promote investments and facilitate an integrated approach in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Mr. Ilioski stated that “with regional and transboundary cooperation, and intersectoral coordination, more can be done together and some trade-offs between development and the environment become clearly a mutual opportunity”.
The project’s recommendations aim to help to build on cooperation for sustainable development in the Drina river basin, for example by facilitating agreement on priority actions and projects among sectoral authorities and between Governments, which could mitigate against perceived risks and reassure potential investors.

Title: The United Nations in Serbia and the Government of the Republic of Serbia mark the 74th anniversary of the UN and reaffirm commitments to multilateralism and cooperation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 28 October 2019
Belgrade, 28 October 2019 – The United Nations in Serbia and the Government of the Republic of Serbia, represented at this event by the First Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, observed the 74th anniversary of the United Nations, reaffirming their commitments to multilateralism and cooperation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
Speaking at the opening of the event, the newly appointed UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia Françoise Jacob emphasized commitment to values of the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the urgency to reach 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 “to make this planet a better world, with greater solidarity, trust, dignity and fairness, while Leaving No One Behind”. She also congratulated the Government of Serbia for submitting the Voluntary National Report on the implementation of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development.
By quoting the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who highlighted the UN’s role to maintain peace – while bringing life-saving aid to millions caught in armed conflict, Ms Simona Miculescu, Representative of the UN Secretary General and Head of UN Office in Belgrade pointed that the UN is extremely grateful for the troop contributions made by the countries in this region to advance organization’s peacekeeping efforts. “Serbia has made a significant contribution in this respect, by deploying over 250 uniformed and civilian personnel in five peace operations. We commend the professionalism and good reputation of Serbian peacekeepers and pay tribute to the eight Serbian peacekeepers who have made the ultimate sacrifice under the UN flag”, said Ms. Miculescu.
First Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivica Dačić highlighted the great importance that the Republic of Serbia attaches to the United Nations, as the global and the most important international organization which plays a key role in maintaining peace and security, protecting human rights and creating conditions for sustainable economic development everywhere in the world. "Serbia strongly supports multilateralism and we consider  multilateral efficiency strengthening of utmost importance. We are deeply convinced that only through joint action, mutual harmonization and appreciation we can find answers to the increasing global challenges. I believe that today, as the world is undergoing major and accelerating change, the United Nations is needed more than ever before. The Republic of Serbia remains strongly committed to the objectives and principles of the United Nations Charter. We are determined to defend international law, including the Security Council Resolution 1244, which safeguards the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country," said Mr. Dacic.
This year the UN Country Team in Serbia, together with the UN development system globally, is undergoing a reform driven by Member States to make it more efficient and put more focus on results and People. To strengthen the coherence of the UN work in the Republic of Serbia, an independent function of the UN Resident Coordinator, previously combined with the role of the UN Development Programme Resident Representative, was introduced in 2019. The UN reform facilitates Delivering as One across UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes and ensures better alignment with the Republic of Serbia development needs and priorities. All these principles will be outlined in the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework - the new programming cycle for the period 2021-2025, aimed at advancing Serbia’s development agenda in line with the Agenda 2030 and EU accession priorities.
The event was also a timely opportunity to launch an ambitious campaign starting January 2020 when the United Nations will hold dialogues around the world and across borders, sectors and generations to reach the global public, listen to their hopes and fears, and to learn from their experiences about the Future We Want and the United Nations We Need. The campaign will be devoted to 75th anniversary of the UN that will be marked next year.

Title: Conference on responses to South-East Europe’s demographic changes to take place in Sarajevo
Content: 14 October 2019
Sarajevo, 14 October 2019 — A conference on how to respond to South-East Europe’s demographic changes by strengthening human capital, gender equality and human rights will take place in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 21-22 October 2019.
The high-level regional conference on “Population Dynamics, Human Capital and Sustainable Development in South-East Europe” is organized by UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC), and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The event is supported by the Offices of the UN Resident Coordinators in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and the Office of UN Development Coordinator in Kosovo,[1] as well as the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The conference will gather government representatives, academics, civil society, the United Nations and other international multilateral institutions in South-East Europe to discuss demographic trends such as low fertility, population ageing and migration, and how they can be turned from challenge into opportunity by investing in human capital, expanding gender equality and ensuring respect for the rights of all people, including those left behind.
Discussions will result in recommendations for action to be taken by the countries in the region for the development of population and social policies that are based on evidence and human rights, and for strengthening regional cooperation on population dynamics and human capital development.
“The demographic changes happening in South-East Europe are too often seen as a crisis. It’s time to change this narrative: when managed properly, demographic change can actually open up many new opportunities for the countries in the region,” said Alanna Armitage, UNFPA Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
This is also key for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, she added.
The conference is a part of series of events leading up to the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 to be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 13-15 November 2019.
This year UNFPA marks its 50th anniversary and the 25th anniversary of the landmark International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), which recognized that people with their rights and needs, not numbers, must be at the centre of population policies.

Title: UN Environment lays the groundwork for cleaner soil in Serbia
Content: 08 October 2019
Over 700 contaminated and potentially contaminated throughout the country, while 14 sites have been prioritized for remediation
Belgrade - 7 October 2019 – Fourteen former industrial sites have been shortlisted for remediation under the first ever such nationwide effort to improve land management in the Republic of Serbia.
Decades of industrial activity, combined with improper waste disposal infrastructure, have left a hazardous legacy of contaminated soils in the country. Hundreds of sites have been polluted by heavy metals and potential carcinogens such as zinc, copper, lead, mercury, as well as confirmed carcinogens such as chromium or cadmium – posing a variety of environmental and health risks.
The polluted sites are often located close to urban areas and rivers. Organic pollutants and metals can leach into the soil, affecting food and water and risking biodiversity loss.
In order to address these threats and to reduce the risks of humans being exposed to them, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has provided analysed soil, water and sediment for 32 sites and delivered trainings so that local authorities could monitor soil quality and submit data to the country’s environmental authorities. Officials have also been trained to set criteria for deciding which sites should be prioritized for clean-up, putting the Serbian government in good stead for further clean-up actions. An interactive hotspot map has been created to help manage data for polluted sites, and a national platform set up to share information on land degradation and sustainable land management.
“Healthy soil is central to many aspects of our daily lives, from safe food to a healthy place to live and play,” says Hans Schodder, UN Resident Coordinator a.i in Serbia. “We are proud to have helped Serbia map contaminated soil sites for rehabilitation, supporting the country onto a cleaner path for its citizens and nature”.
“Thanks to this project, we have a better idea of the scale and type of contamination faced. Serbia can now conduct more detailed investigations into individual polluted sites, carry out the transparent disposal of hazardous waste and ease its burden on our natural environment,“ says Dr Milan Milutinović of Belgrade’s Institute of Public Health.
“Not only have we been able to carry out soil sampling and learned to apply new methodologies for risk assessment - the project has also helped us to ensure better cooperation between all levels of government,” says Filip Radović, Director of the Serbian Environmental Protection Agency. “The Republic of Serbia has made the first step in setting priorities for soil remediation, with a lot more work ahead in this area that will require additional support,” he underlined, adding that “the purchases of soil analysis instruments, protective field equipment and software by the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea has also made a major difference”.
The project – which is being officially closed at a meeting in Belgrade today - was funded by the Global Environment Facility and the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea.
The list of 14 priority sites includes areas in and surrounding chemical factories and heavy industry. Subject to further funding, the project’s next steps will be to remediate degraded hotspots, improve soil quality and reduce the impact of pollution on the ecosystem and human health.
In the long term, the aim is for contaminated sites to be safely managed and soil quality monitored - especially in industrial, mining, power production and agricultural areas, which are major economic drivers in Serbia.
Note to editors:
The ‘Enhanced cross-sectoral land management through land use pressure reduction and planning’ project was launched in September 2015. The project was carried out by the UN Environment Programme together with the Serbian Ministry of Environmental Protection and the country’s Environmental Protection Agency.
UNEP supports national efforts to improve soil quality under its ecosystem management work area. Healthy soils support plant and animal diversity, regulate water flow, filter pollutants and help to store and cycle nutrients.

Title: UNHCR, UNICEF and IOM urge European states to boost education for refugee and migrant children
Content: 11 September 2019
Brussels/Geneva, 11 September 2019 - Three UN agencies are calling on European States to increase resources and practical support for their school systems to ensure all refugee, asylum-seeking and migrant children can access and stay in quality education.
In a briefing paper published today, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund, and IOM, the International Organization for Migration, detail the obstacles children and adolescents born outside Europe face when trying to access education in Europe.
Currently, the number of children and adolescents born outside Europe (including recently arrived refugee and migrant children) who leave school early is nearly twice as high compared to native-born children.
Migrant children also have lower learning outcomes when they are not given adequate support. For example, around 3 in 4 native-born students attain proficiency in science, reading and math but only 3 in 5 students with a migrant background do.
Among the key challenges highlighted in the report are:
Children of pre-primary age (3 to 5 years old) and upper secondary age (15 years and older) are particularly vulnerable to being out of school, as they are often beyond the scope of national legislation on compulsory education.
To help States tackle these challenges and address key data gaps, the paper gives examples of good and promising practices in education across Europe and makes a series of recommendations.
In Serbia, in line with the applicable national legislation, refugee, asylum-seeker and migrant children have last week enrolled into schools for the third consecutive year.
This is the result of the concerted efforts of the relevant national authorities strongly supported by the three United Nations agencies and their partners.
Efforts to build capacities of teachers and school staff as well as to strengthen Serbian language learning and catch-up classes and to ensure multi-sectoral approach to inclusion of all refugee, asylum-seeker and migrant children - unaccompanied children in particular - into the local communities and schools continue.
“For refugee children, education is not only vital for their own futures but for the communities in which they live. Quality education boosts life chances, facilitates integration, and is a win-win for the student and society. Investing in education for all is one of the best investments a government can make,” said Pascale Moreau, UNHCR Director of the Bureau for Europe.
The brief urges States to strengthen the links between schools and other critical public services, such as health and child protection to ensure that barriers to enrolment and factors contributing to early leaving are addressed. The paper also recommends increasing access to early childhood education services and promoting the integration of young people into upper secondary education and training programmes.
“With political will and additional investments, Governments across Europe can build inclusive public-school systems, ensuring all children, regardless of their migration status have their right to an education protected, while building inclusive and successful communities”, said Ms. Afshan Khan, UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia and Special Coordinator for the Refugee and Migrant Response in Europe.
The three agencies also call on States to increase efforts and make further investments at both national and regional level to collect quality standardized and harmonized data on refugee, asylum-seeking and migrant children in education, to inform policy development and allocation of resources.
“Eliminating gaps in refugee and migrant children’s education is critical to their development and well-being and this can have a positive knock-on effect for society in general. Education also has the cohesive power to help refugee and migrant children and their families build links to the local communities and to contribute. Investing in inclusive and quality education will help us to meet our responsibility to ensure that no generation is left behind,” said Manfred Profazi, IOM Senior Regional Adviser for Europe and Central Asia.

Title: World Environment Day 2019 - Regional study on the impact of air pollution on human health shows reduced life expectancy of Western Balkan population caused by poor air quality
Content: 05 June 2019
Belgrade, 5 June 2019 – Approximately 7 million people worldwide die prematurely each year from air pollution. Nine out of ten people breathe outdoor air that is polluted beyond levels deemed acceptable under the World Health Organization’s Air Quality Guidelines. Air pollution is thus considered a global public health emergency. This is why the World Environment Day 2019 will urge governments, industry, communities, and individuals to come together to explore renewable energy and green technologies, and improve air quality in cities and regions across the world.
The population of the Western Balkans region is exposed to some of the highest concentrations of air pollutants in Europe, up to five times higher than the national and EU guideline levels, as well as WHOS’s AQG.
The latest assessment report ‘Air Pollution and Human Health: The Case of the Western Balkans’ developed with financial support from the Government of Norway, was launched by the United Nations Environment Programme last Friday in Sarajevo. It provides an overview of air quality in the Western Balkans as well as an estimate of the health impacts of air pollution in the region and the expected health benefits of reductions in air pollution in the selected cities. The assessment report covers the following countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, with a focus on the  cities: Korca, Banja Luka, Brod, Prijedor, Tuzla, Zenica, Bar, Niksic, Pljevlja, Podgorica, Tivat, Bitola, Skopje, Tetovo, Belgrade, Pancevo, Uzice and Valjevo.
Air pollution is a serious problem in all Western Balkan countries where air pollutant concentrations usually exceed the permitted values. According to the report, air pollution contributes to high mortality rates and reduced life expectancy in the selected cities. The report specifically indicates the dangers of exposure to fine particulate matter emissions (PM2.5 and PM10). The region’s topography, but primarily the low-quality solid fuels used in coal-fired power plants, the burning of coal for domestic heating and cooking, outdated industry and old vehicles contribute to the high concentrations of pollutants in the air.
Air quality in the Western Balkans countries analyzed in this study is monitored in accordance with EU legislation and the collected data reported to the European Environment Information and Observation Network (EIONET). However, despite the efforts by the governments to invest in air quality monitoring, the main challenges the existing air quality monitoring systems in the Western Balkans currently face are inconsistent data due to lack of financing for the stations’ maintenance, the absence of certified calibration laboratories and of air quality modelling.
Air quality improvement by alleviating energy poverty is crucial to reduce the number of deaths and diseases associated with air pollution in the Western Balkans. Some of the policy recommendations from the report include creating national, regional and international frameworks to address environmental challenges, awareness raising about air pollution, promoting the use of renewable energy, environmentally sound management of chemicals and waste.
As for Serbia, major sources of air pollution are industrial processes, electricity and heat generation, and road transport. Only few cities in Serbia have prepared Air Quality ImprovementPplans as well as local environmental action plans (e.g. Kragujevac, Užice, Belgrade). Having recognized the need to intensify efforts to reduce air pollution, the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the Republic of Serbia established a working group for air pollution reduction in October 2018 and initiated dialogues with representatives of local authorities of the cities with highest concentration of air pollutants.
Furthermore, the City of Belgrade receives technical support under UN Environment’s District Energy in Cities Initiative, one of six accelerators of the UN’s Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) Energy Efficiency Accelerator Platform, supporting market transformation efforts to shift the heating and cooling sector to energy efficient and renewable energy solutions by building local know-how and implementing enabling policies that will accelerate investment in modern – low-carbon and climate resilient – district energy systems.

Title: Representatives of the Green Climate Fund present possibilities for financing projects in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation
Content: 23 May 2019
Belgrade, 23 May 2019 – The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management and the UN Environment held the second in a series of stakeholders’ consultation meetings within the project “Developing the capacities of the Republic of Serbia for an effective engagement with the Green Climate Fund “.
“Climate change is the biggest challenge of our time which can be only slowed down through adaptation and mitigation activities. Aknowledging that this is a country-driven process, I am pleased to see that UN Environment, as well as several other UN agencies in Serbia, support the Government of Serbia in these endeavors”, says Hans Schodder, UN Resident Coordinator a.i in Serbia.
After the first stakeholders’ consultation meeting held in March this year, which effectively marked the beginning of a process of stakeholder engagement and disclosure, the second consultation meeting presents another milestone in the process of supporting Serbia’s readiness and preparatory activities in cooperation with the Green Climate Fund.
“The Green Climate Fund presents one of the most favorable opportunities for financing activities aimed at reducing GHG emissions, but also minimizing damages and losses due to natural disasters. We see cooperation with the Fund as an excellent opportunity to transform our country’s economy into an efficient and innovative one, in accordance with the goals and priorities of the Serbian Government. Having recognized these possibilities, it is our goal to strengthen this cooperation, which we endeavor to achieve through these consultation meetings", says Bogdan Igić, State Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management.
The meeting was very significant due to the participation of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) representatives who presented the GCF related possibilities and requirements for financing climate change adaptation and mitigation projects. In addition to allowing the possibility of follow up, continuous update and regular assessment of progress and exchange of good practices and challenges, the meeting is aimed at providing relevant information to all potential participants in projects funded by the GCF to ensure efficient cooperation with the Fund.
The aim of the project is to develop, in coordination with stakeholders (Government institutions, local authorities, civil society organizations, public and private companies, banks and other financial institutions, women and vulnerable groups and others), the Country Programme which identifies key national priorities for further GCF funding.

About the Green Climate Fund:
The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is an international fund established in 2010 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). By adopting the Paris Agreement under the Convention, the GCF became a key financial mechanism for implementation of the Agreement, i.e. one of the main tools for keeping global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius.
The Fund promotes the implementation of activities that simultaneously contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions and increase resilience to altered climate conditions in developing countries.
The GCF funding is provided by developed countries, both from public sources and private capital.
The Fund finances projects and programs both focused on climate change mitigation (reduction of GHG emissions) and adaptation (adjustment to the altered climate conditions) that are prepared by the government, public and/or private sector. These projects and programs need to be in line with national development goals and priorities. At the same time, projects must contribute to the strategic objectives of the Fund.

Title: Preventive work with perpetrators of domestic violence needed to end repeated violence
Content: 08 May 2019
Belgrade, 8-May-2019 – “Serbia needs more responsible programmes for the work with perpetrators of domestic violence to timely warn against threats of violence, reduce the risk of repetition of violence and increase safety of women and children at risk of violence” – this is the conclusion of today’s discussion on “How to implement responsible programmes for the work with perpetrators of domestic violence”.
Violence against women, according to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, is any any act of gender-based violence or acts of violence that disproportionately affect women. The data shows that almost every third woman experienced violence in her life, and most of the perpetrators are men.
"Male violence against women can be only stopped by changing personal and social patriarchal and discriminatory attitudes that degrade women and girls, and tolerate and justify violence against them," says Jelena Tadzic, head of the social inclusion and gender equality portfolio of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and adds that the UN sees boys and men as important allies in the long-term struggle against this type of violence.
From 2011 to 2016, a total of 658 perpetrators were referred to the programmes for the  work with perpetrators of violence in Serbia. Unfortunately, ever since their establishment, these programmes have been sporadically implemented, they are not part of the multi-sectoral protection system and are not systemically linked to victims’ support programmes. In addition, although the institutions nominally accept the idea of such programmes, there is no systemic response to violence against women and children. At the same time data on their distribution, quality, characteristics and effects are scarce.
Responsible programmes for the work with perpetrators of violence primarily aim to reduce the risk of repetition of domestic violence and to increase safety of women and children at risk. “Men can choose not to be violent and most of them are not feeling comfortable with what they do,” claims Rory Macrae, National Coordinator of the Caledonian System in Scotland. “These programmes offer an opportunity to perpetrators to openly discuss their prejudices and beliefs and develop strategies to solve their own problems in a less destructive manner, while improving their own and the lives of their loved ones. This also helps prevent future generations from repeating the violence they have experienced as children.”
Effective implementation of these programmes involves information exchange and cooperation between women’s support services, the police and judiciary. The implementation of the programme for the work with perpetrators of violence is an international obligation that Serbia took over by ratifying the Istanbul Convention in 2013. The implementation of these programmes abroad started in 1980s. "Programmes for the work with perpetrators of violence are not an alternative to or a substitute for sanctions. Violence is a criminal offense and must be punished. That’s why these programmes, especially in the so-called gray areas, when the perpetrator does not end up in court, although violence ocurred, play big role,“ claims  Alessandra Pauncz, director of the European network for work with perpetrators of violence, stressing that the the safety of women and children must be in always in focus.
Today’s discussion featured participation of international experts with decades of experience in dealing with perpetrators of violence at the European network for work with perpetrators of violence, representatives of the Serbian government institutions, independent bodies, UN agencies, implementers of the programmes for the work with perpetrators of violence, as well as representatives of women's NGOs that represent the interests and rights of women who survived violence.
The conference was organized as part of the joint project "Integrated Response to Violence against Women and Girls in Serbia", implemented by the UN agencies (UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women, UNFPA) in partnership with the government institutions at all levels - national, provincial and local, with the support of the Swedish Government.

Title: In its concluding observations on Serbia, the UN Committee on discrimination against women notes certain progress, but remains concerned about gender stereotypes and gender-based violence
Content: 20 March 2019
Belgrade, 20 March 2019 – The UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women in Serbia (UN Women) and the UN Human Rights Team in Serbia, together with civil society organizations, presented the concluding observations and recommendations of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.
The observations and recommendations to Serbia were released on 8 March and concern the fourth periodic report on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, to which Serbia has voluntarily committed itself as a UN member state.
“As a party to the Convention, Serbia has undertaken to ensure that women enjoy all human rights and freedoms fully and equally. The Committee’s recommendations highlight certain progress and also offer guidance for all of us on joint action to prevent violations of these rights and freedoms in specific areas”, observed Milana Rikanović, Head of UN Women in Serbia.
In its concluding observations, the Committee welcomes the progress made, especially the legal reforms undertaken and the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, and also makes important recommendations to Serbia on advancing gender equality and reducing gender-based violence.
“We hope that the Committee’s findings and recommendations to Serbia will provide guidelines both to the Government and to the civil society on what the priorities are and how all stakeholders in society can contribute to overall improvement. The Committee has been very specific in its commendations and recommendations and we hope they will have an impact on further national and local efforts”, stated Milan Marković, Head of the UN Human Rights Team in Serbia.
Among other things, the Committee urges the state to take all necessary measures to combat the anti-gender discourse and to intensify efforts to raise women’s awareness about their rights under the Convention. According to the Committee, the state is required to enable access to free legal aid for victims of all forms of gender-based discrimination and to strengthen cross-sectoral cooperation in order to prevent and combat gender-based violence.
In addition, it underlines that all cases of trafficking in persons must be effectively investigated, equal representation of women accelerated in all areas of public and political life, immediate birth registration and access to identity documents ensured for all children, and gender-sensitive content introduced into curricula and textbooks.
The event was jointly organized by the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), United Nations Human Rights Team in Serbia, Platform of Organizations for Cooperation with UN Human Rights Mechanisms and Women's Platform for the Development of Serbia.
"Current reforms in our society are present but only formal, without essential implementation of laws, policies and effects on women's position and gender relations. Implementation mechanisms are not effective, because the accompanying regulations defining these mechanisms are missing or brought long after the adoption of laws," says Biljana Stepanov, director of the Center for Women Support and members of the Women's Platform for Development of Serbia.

Title: International Women’s Day 2019 – putting the spotlight on public services, safe spaces and technology to advance progress for women and girls
Content: 08 March 2019
Ahead of the International Women’s Day, UNCT Serbia is commemorating its 2019 theme “Think Equal, Build Smart, Innovate for Change”. Globally, around 740 million women currently make their living in the informal economy with limited access to social protection, public services and infrastructure that could increase their productivity and income security. In Serbia, women do 2.2 times more unpaid care and domestic work than men, while every second woman faced psychological, and every third physical violence.
Belgrade, 7 March 2019 - Ahead of the International Women’s Day, the UN County Team in Serbia (UNCT) is commemorating its 2019 theme “Think Equal, Build Smart, Innovate for Change”. Globally, around 740 million women currently make their living in the informal economy with limited access to social protection, public services and infrastructure that could increase their productivity and income security. In Serbia, women do 2.2 times more unpaid care and domestic work than men[1], while every second woman faced psychological, and every third physical violence.
This is why this years’ theme explores the ways in which innovation can work for gender equality, boost investment in gender-responsive social systems, and build public services and infrastructure that meet the needs of women and girls.
To address some of these issues at the country level, UNCT has been investing efforts to improve position of the most vulnerable groups of women in Serbia through several joint projects. “Gender equality is one of the key topics of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and at the heart of our current five year Development Partnership Framework with the Government of Serbia, but also one of the core values of the EU.  The UN Country Team in Serbia remains committed to work hand in hand with the Government and people of Serbia and all relevant stakeholders so that ‘no woman is left behind,” says Steliana Nedera, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. in Serbia.
Combating violence against women all along the frontline
Achieving gender equality requires urgent action to eliminate many of its root causes such as gender-based violence. Together with its partners in Serbia, within the project “Integrated Response to Violence against Women and Girls II”, UNCT is working on prevention of violence, while ensuring that when it occurs, the victims get timely and effective protection and support from relevant institutions, and the perpetrators get punished. Thanks to support from Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the programme of our alliance trained 360 police officers on first responses to reported violence, while 140 health-care workers across Serbia were trained to provide adequate support to victims. In terms of prevention, more than 2500 boys and girls were mobilized through a variety of activities designed to address gender equality and gender-based violence. The network of women reporters of violence against women has been a key new reinforcement to the overall effort. The informal group is made up of 31 editors and journalists committed to improving media reporting on violence against women.
Reshaping future – engaging women in IT sector
It is estimated that there are 9-15% of women currently employed in IT sector in Serbia. In order to contribute to the digital transformation in Serbia and increase the number of IT specialists, on the labor market in Serbia, UNCT assisted the Government to train 733 individuals for junior programmers through the re-qualification programme in 8 cities across the country. In 2018, out of the total number of program participants, 28% were women.
Women with Disabilities Leading Change
In order to better understand and tackle multiple discrimination that women and girls with disabilities face, UNCT has partnered with the relevant ministries and civil sector through the project "Autonomy, Voice, Participation of Persons with Disabilities". According to the empirical research conducted during the project the presence of stereotypes and prejudices in the society still pose obstacles for persons with disabilities to exercise freedom to be sexually active, to get married and form a family. As a response, the first national mentoring program for women with disabilities has been established. A total of 10 activists – women with disabilities will be providing peer-to-peer support to a group of mentees.
From engagement to employment: improving the social inclusion of young Roma women in Serbia
UNCT also engaged young Roma women as UN Community Volunteers through the “Local initiatives for improved social inclusion of young Roma” joint project. A total of 12 Roma women developed their advocacy skills and were engaged on initial six-month assignments across 24 municipalities, in public institutions in their home communities, including positions at the Ministry of Culture and Information, health and social welfare centers. The initiative also enabled young Roma women to increase their knowledge of human rights, discrimination, legally-invisible, stateless and internally displaced persons and returnees, and the rights of vulnerable groups.
Creating infrastructure that meets the needs of refugee and migrant women
Within the European Union Support to Municipalities Hosting Migrants and Refugees, UNCT assists local public service providers to deliver quality services with the full respect of culturally and gender sensitive-considerations. Within the infrastructure upgrades of communal infrastructure, UNCT creates  gender, culture and disability sensitive multi-purpose spaces and conducive environment for social inclusion and better provision of support services to victims of gender-based violence, exploitation and human trafficking.
On International Women’s Day, UNCT reaffirms its commitment to redouble its efforts in promoting women’s rights, dignity and leadership. Only by including women decision-makers in areas like public services, technology, urban design we can increase women’s access, prevent violence and improve the overall quality of life.

Title: Experts join forces to prevent African swine fever from entering the Balkans
Content: 21 February 2019
Belgrade, 21-February-2019 - Reducing the risk of incursions and improving preparation for the rapid detection and control of African swine fever in the Balkan countries is the main topic of the four-day FAO workshop finishing today in Belgrade.
African swine fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease that kills up to 100 percent of infected animals, both pigs and wild boars. It poses no risks to human health but has the potential to devastate rural livelihoods and jeopardize food security and trade in affected regions.
In recent years, the disease has gradually spread, and its occurrence in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania in 2019 poses a serious and imminent threat to the Balkans.
“The virus may spread rapidly due to the relatively dense wild boar population and highly prevalent backyard sector,” said Daniel Beltran-Alcrudo, FAO animal health officer. “Awareness, improved biosecurity and preparedness are key to preventing the disease from entering the region and to minimizing its negative impacts on rural livelihoods, the pig value chain and trade."
To this end, FAO is implementing an emergency project called “African Swine Fever Emergency Preparedness in the Balkans,” with today’s workshop as a first step in defining prevention and control strategies for the region and to discussing the challenging issues of border control, awareness, biosecurity and others.
The workshop brings together international experts, as well as more than 25 participants from the five recipient countries – Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia – plus Croatia, Hungary and Romania. Participants include representatives from veterinary and forestry agencies and also from hunting associations and non-governmental organizations working with the pig sector. For a disease like African swine fever, coordination among all these institutions is critical. International agencies like the European Food Safety Agency and the World Organisation for Animal Health will also be present.
“The workshop is an extremely important forum for the sharing of knowledge among experts of various fields,” said Daniela Mangione, FAO policy officer. “The Balkans were never exposed to African swine fever, which means that governments, farmers and hunters have little awareness and little technical knowledge of the disease.”
As a result of the workshop, representatives will agree on, plan and define activities for the 18-month project and collect detailed information on the key difficulties and challenges for each country concerned.

Title: World Soil Day – new State of Soil Report 2016-2017 presented at the event Fostering national soil partnership
Content: 17 December 2018
Belgrade, 17 December 2018 – Serbian Environmental Protection Agency and its partners UN Environment and regional NGO FEA – Forestry and Environmental Action celebrated the World Soil Day (WSD) at the event „Fostering National Soil Partnership“.
The celebration of WSD was an opportunity to present the results accomplished in the area of research, protection and prevention of land degradation, above all the new State of the Soil Report 2016-2017 which identified potential sources of pollution found in 709 locations as one of the main factors of land degradation, reduction of organic matter, whereas erosion affects 80% of agricultural land; covering a 25-30% of country’s territory, landslides are also a huge threat.
The publications that are also introduced are the Guide for Sustainable Land Management and the accompanying brochure for local self-governments and decision-makers at the local level, the Publication on the state of contaminated sites in the Republic of Serbia, as well as the comprehensive website dedicated to land degradation and sustainable land management (www.degradacijazemljista.rs).
In the spirit of partnership and strengthening cooperation between different actors, the event was an opportunity for other partners and stakeholders to present similar undertaken activities and initiatives.
„Given the significant role that soil has for the preservation of human health and the environment, bringing its protection on the political scene is of critical importance for ensuring the availability of this resource in the future“, was one of the conclusions. The scientific community, civil society and decision makers have also made a considerable effort in including soil protection into one of the most important legal frameworks for development in the coming decades, namely the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015. Goal 15 refers to Life on Land: Sustainable management of forests, combatting desertification, halting and reversing land degradation and halting biodiversity loss.
The importance of protection of soil as a separate area is proven by the fact that one of the resolutions adopted at the last UN Environment Assembly (UNEA 3) in 2017 refers precisely to this topic (Managing soil pollution to achieve Sustainable Development).

Key messages from the State of Soil Report:
A total of 709 sites that present potential sources of pollution were registered on the territory of the Republic of Serbia, the majority of which are in the category of potentially contaminated sites and require additional investigations. Uncontrolled and inadequate waste disposal, as well as pollution within industrial complexes also affect the quality of soil.
Soil erosion is one of the main processes of land degradation in the Republic of Serbia and the cause of deterioration of soil quality. It is estimated that soil erosion affects about 80% of agricultural land to various extent.
There are 2.228 registered landslides in 26 different municipalities in the Republic of Serbia. Terrain instability processes with the occurrence of landslides, mudslides, etc. of different dimensions and activities, cover approximately 25-30% of the territory of the Republic of Serbia.
Water erosion is predominant in central and mountainous areas, whereas wind erosion is prevalent in the Province of Vojvodina in northern Serbia which affects about 85% of agricultural land. Some parts of the territory are exposed to recurring landslides.
The organic matter content in agricultural soil is low with the tendency of further reduction, which requires urgent measures.

All publications, including:
The State of Soil Report in the Republic of Serbia 2016-2017, Guide for Sustainable Land Management at the Local Level in the Republic of Serbia, Towards Soil Decontamination in the Republic of Serbia, can be downloaded from the following link.

About World Soil Day:
World Soil Day is celebrated annually on 5 December with the aim of raising awareness on the importance of healthy soil and advocating for sustainable management of soil resources. This year’s World Soil Day is celebrated under the slogan "Be the Solution to Soil Pollution - STOP SOIL POLLUTION".

Title: Countries from South East and Southern Europe agree common vision to beat pollution
Content: 05 December 2018
Belgrade, 5 December 2018 - Countries from South East and Southern Europe will pursue new measures that reduce pollution and benefit people’s health, the environment and economy.
A joint vision agreed on at a ministerial conference ending today will see states incentivize and redirect investment towards non-polluting activities, promote waste prevention and recycling and step-up the monitoring of transboundary pollution, among other measures. UN Environment is called on to encourage information exchange and partnerships to support the transition.
A report commissioned by UN Environment titled ‘The state of pollution in the Western Balkans and current challenges’ finds that countries in the area have made strides in environmental policy. Yet they continue to face serious challenges related to air and water pollution, unregulated waste dumping and soil contamination in particular.
“A regional approach to fighting pollution is crystallizing ahead of the fourth UN Environment Assembly (UNEA4)”, said the Head of UN Environment’s New York Office and UN Assistant Secretary-General, Satya Tripathi. “This can open a new common chapter in history for the Western Balkans. Countries have the chance to leapfrog some of the development stages experienced by other industrialised states”.
“Environmental protection is more than just an economic, technical or cooperation issue - it is a moral obligation," said Serbian Environment Minister Goran Trivan. “High environmental standards mean healthy lives for citizens and will benefit our economies”.
Countries in the area currently rank among the worst in Europe for air pollution, the report notes. In Bosnia and Herzegovina for example, heavy dependency on coal, poor energy efficiency in buildings and the use of old cars mean that 225 out of every 100,000 deaths are due to household or ambient air pollution – more than triple the European average[i]. The economic cost of air pollution in the country is equivalent to 21,5 % of Gross Domestic Product.
Meanwhile, over 90% of inhabitants in the area have access to safe drinking water. Yet only a small share of urban wastewater is treated there before entering rivers and sea, the report underlines. Furthermore, municipal waste collection is not available for 20-40% of inhabitants there. This contributes to widespread illegal waste dumping, and means the area is a major source of plastic pollution in the Mediterranean and Black Sea.
Other than Albania, all countries in the area plan to build new coal power plants, the study notes. Yet the economic and environmental reasoning behind this is questionable, the report argues, with solar and wind energy now becoming cheaper than coal or hydropower in the region.
Economic instruments such as an excise tax on dirty fuels and the polluter-pays principle are proposed to address pollution and fund green incentives. The report recommends that environmental objectives also be introduced into energy and transport policies.
Countries should continue to expand their networks of terrestrial and marine protected areas, the report proposes. It finds that Albania is currently the only country in the area on track to have 17% of its territory designated as a protected area – an Aichi target under the Convention on Biological Diversity.
The ministerial conference is organized by the Government of Serbia and the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea - which provided significant funding for the event and related work  - with support from UN Environment. UNEA4 will gather representatives from all UN member states in March 2019 to address innovative solutions for environmental challenges and sustainable consumption and production.

Title: Consumption of antibiotics in Serbia reduced by 38.2%
Content: 15 November 2018
Belgrade, 15-November-2018 - Total antibiotic consumption in Serbia for systemic use has been reduced by 32.8 percent, from 36.5 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants in 2015 to 24.53 in 2017. Very good results have also been achieved in the field of pediatrics with the rate of prescribed antibiotics per 1,000 children reduced by 12 percent.
The outcomes of a three-year effort in combating antimicrobial resistance were presented at a conference on the occasion of the World Antibiotic Awareness Week 2018 with participation of Dr Zlatibor Loncar, Minister of Health, Dr Zsofia Pusztai, WHO representative in Serbia, Dr Verica Jovanovic, Director of the Institute of Public Health of Serbia, Dr Sanja Radojevic Skodric, Director of the Health Insurance Fund and representatives of other ministries, international partners, associations, civil sector and the media.
Pointing to the dangers of inappropriate antibiotic use and appealing to the public, Dr Pusztai encouraged citizens to think twice and seek advice and only use antimicrobials if and when prescribed by a health professional. She also pointed to this year’s focus on taking a One Health approach, recognizing that human health, animal health and environment health are inextricably linked.
Through statements to the media, the public was warned that excessive use of antibiotics by certain bacteria became resistant to them, and that infections caused by such bacteria could lead to complicated treatment or even fatal outcomes.
Strengthened surveillance of antimicrobial use in Serbia was enforced in the past few years along with effective campaigning for the rational use of antibiotics which was launched by the Serbian Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and implemented through the Second Serbia Health Project funded by the World Bank.
Addressing antimicrobial resistance in itself, and particularly by adopting the One Health approach, would contribute to Serbia’s progression towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals contained in the Agenda 2030, in particular SDG goals 3, 11, 12, 17 (good health and well-being, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, partnership for the goals) as well as the EU accession process through chapters: 11, 12, 27, 28 (agriculture, food safety, environment, consumer and health protection).

Title: Joining forces for a better position of children and youth in Serbia
Content: 14 November 2018
Belgrade, 14 November 2018 -  UNICEF and the Coordination Body for Gender Equality of the Republic of Serbia have signed today a Memorandum of Understanding on preventing child marriage and improving the position of children and youth in Serbia.
Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia and President of the Coordinating Body for Gender Equality Zorana Mihajlovic said that signing the Memorandum was a result of the already good cooperation between the Coordination Body for Gender Equality and UNICEF.
“Through our joint work and exact results, we will show that there are no issues that we cannot solve. There is no more important job than to protect our children, and we will fight for their carefree childhood, their education and the prevention of child marriage that is particularly present in Roma community", Mihajlovic said.
Regina De Dominicis, UNICEF Representative in Serbia, expressed her satisfaction with the good cooperation with the Coordination Body for Gender Equality and said that the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding was yet another proof of the commitment to improve the position of Serbia’s children and young people.
"We will work together in three areas. The focus will be on ending the harmful practice of child marriage in Serbia through the launch of a multi-sectoral coalition against child marriage, as almost 60 per cent of young Roma women enters early marriage.
Furthermore, we will be advancing the social inclusion of Roma children by addressing their lack of opportunities. As a start, we have agreed to cooperate to ensure that the most vulnerable children have access to books to address literacy at the earliest age. And we will try to expand opportunities for young people, girls in particular, in the area of digital technologies to prosper in the 21st century”, said Regina De Dominicis.

Title: Serbia may eradicate statelessness within a few years
Content: 02 November 2018
Belgrade, 02 November 2018 – Serbia has made excellent progress in the prevention and reduction of statelessness. Should it decide to enact a few outstanding strategic measures stipulated in the Global Action Plan for Eradication of Statelessness, the Republic of Serbia could eliminate statelessness completely within a couple of years, concluded a UNHCR-organised conference today.
The conference “Combating Statelessness in Serbia – Achievements and the Way Forward” was organized to mark the fourth anniversary of the global #IBelong Campaign under which states try to eradicate all statelessness around the world by 2024.
Opening the conference, Branko Ružić, Minister of State Administration and Local Self-Government stated “I am very grateful to UNHCR and the civil sector for their long-standing support in resolving this important issue. Though we have been commended as best practice example in resolving the personal status of Roma, we must now focus on increasing employment of this minority community. We have a good legislative framework for that aspect as well”.
”This campaign and the results have shown the significance and value of cooperation, since it was key to efficient resolution of the problem. The general benefit is that we have helped identify the the citizens living on the territory of Serbia, their rights and obligations“ added Robert Sepi, Deputy Ombudsman.
Thanks to the excellent cooperation and the efforts of the Ministry of  State Administration and Local Self-Government, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs, numerous national and local authorities, the Ombudsman, the UN Refugee Agency and specialised civil society organisations, Serbia introduced and implemented many legislative changes facilitating the process of registration into birth registries and issuance of personal documents, and confirming the citizenship of many persons whose ancestors had been living in Serbia for generations. Many persons who previously could not solve it despite for generations having lived in Serbia obtained citizenship through the cooperation and coordinated activities of the civil sector and the Ministry of Interior. As a consequence, the number of persons at-risk-of-statelessness in Serbia decreased by 43% in the period 2010 - 2015.
Commenting on the progress made and on how good models to reduce and prevent statelessness developed in Serbia have already been used by governments and authorities elsewhere in the region and beyond, the participants of the conference noted that the prevention of statelessness remains important in Serbia and that the momentum achieved must be used to resolve outstanding challenges in the near future.
Thanking all authorities and other partners, the UNHCR Representative Hans Friedrich Schodder concluded “Depriving fellow humans from exercising basic rights without any fault or control of their own, statelessness is a scourge that can and must be eradicated. Today we should be proud of having worked together very well to get very close to this aim. The UN Refugee Agency remains committed to do its utmost to support you to completely eradicate the occurrence and re-occurrence of statelessness in Serbia.”

Title: UN Global standards for business to tackle LGBTI discrimination launched in Belgrade today
Content: 11 October 2018
Belgrade, 11  October 2018 – The global LGBTI equality standards for the business community have been launched today by the UN Country Team in Serbia and the LGBTI Equal Rights Association for Western Balkans and Turkey (ERA) in partnership with the UN Global Compact in Serbia and the Commissioner for Protection of Equality at the special event with government officials, business representatives, and civil sector.
Drawing on good practices from around the world, these standards set out actions companies can take to protect the rights of LGBTI individuals. These include eliminating workplace discrimination, making sure business operations do not contribute to discrimination against customers, suppliers or members of the public, and working with business partners to address discriminatory practices up and down the supply chain. They also encourage companies to stand up for the rights of LGBTI people in the countries where they operate – including through advocacy and support for local organizations.
In Serbia, Hemofarm AD, Ernst & Young DOO and Erste Bank AD (all members of the UN Global Compact network in Serbia) join the growing list of early adopters.
Welcoming the standards, the UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia Ms. Karla Robin Hershey said: “By adopting the UN Global Standards of Conduct for Businesses in regard to LGBTI equality, United Nations recognized the importance of cooperation between state, civil society, corporate sector and international organizations. Equality and the protection of discrimination are binding principles everywhere and for everyone, and as such are recognized by the United Nations. For this very reason, the UN Country Team in Serbia stands ready to support to all actors in order to achieve equality in all spheres of life, including equality in business sector.“
Speaking at the launch, the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality Brankica Jankovic noted that “It is important that we are united with the idea that business and human rights are on the same sides and that the economy cannot be separated from people.”
The Standards of Conduct build on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011. They are the product of a year-long process of consultations facilitated by the UN Human Rights Office and the Institute for Human Rights and Business, including regional meetings with leading business representatives and activists in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.
The Standards have already been launched in New York, Mumbai, Paris, London, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Geneva, Davos, Melbourne, Nairobi and Sao Paolo. Launching of the UN Standards in the Republic of Serbia is the first in South-East Europe, after the Standards had been launched in other parts of the World. Serbian is the seventh language in which the Standards are available globally.
The five standards:
RESPECT the human rights of their LGBTI workers, customers and members of the public
ELIMINATE workplace discrimination against LGBTI employees
SUPPORT LGBTI employees at work
PREVENT discrimination and related abuses against LGBTI customers, suppliers and distributors – and insist that suppliers do the same
STAND UP for the human rights of LGBTI people in the communities where companies do business
About the event
The launch of the Global standards for business to tackle LGBTI discrimination is an integral part of a series of events and activities held on the occasion of the commemoration of this year’s 73rd anniversary of the United Nations and the 70th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The central theme of the UN73 anniversary is the UN Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, which were adopted by more than 150 member states, including Serbia, at the UN headquarters in New York in September 2015.
Progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals contained in the Agenda 2030, European integration and achievement of the national development and human rights priorities are inseparable processes. Thus, this event, that is being implemented through the Development Partnership Framework 2016-2020 between the Government of the Republic of Serbia and the UN Country Team in Serbia, contributes to the efforts of the Republic of Serbia in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (5, 10, 16), as well as the EU accession process (Chapters 23 and 24), and human rights standards in the country.

Content: 10 October 2018
Belgrade, 8 October 2018 - The Republic of Serbia has successfully conducted the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) on the capacities for the implementation of the International Health Regulations.
The Joint External Evaluation (JEE) is a voluntary, collaborative process to assess a country’s capacity under the International Health Regulations in order to prevent, detect and rapidly respond to public health threats whether occurring naturally or due to deliberate or accidental events.
In the framework of strengthening the capacities to effectively respond to possible public health emergencies and crisis situations, Serbia recognized the significance of the WHO JEE tool and initiated this process in the country.
Evaluation has been conducted jointly by an international independent expert team and representatives of all relevant national sectors, agencies and institutions including Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Institute of Public Health, Serbian Environmental Protection Agency, Serbian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, Institute for Virology, Vaccines and Sera “Torlak” and Belgrade airport “Nikola Tesla”.
The evaluation sessions were opened by Assistant Health Minister, Dr Vesna Knjeginjic, followed by introductory addresses of State Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Mr. Velimir Stanojevic, WHO Representative, Dr Zsofia Pusztai as well as  Director of the National Institute of Public Health and national IHR focal point, Dr Verica Jovanovic.
The external technical experts had the opportunity to meet national stakeholders in the field through scheduled visits to the Clinic for Infectious and Tropical Diseases – National Clinical Center, Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, National Institute of Public Health, Institute for Virology, Vaccines and Sera “Torlak”, but also Belgrade Airport and the Belgrade Emergency Operations Center.
Outcomes of the JEE have identified priority actions that will lead to the development of the National Action Plan for Health Security, in order to strengthen national capacities and country preparedness for all hazard emergencies.

Title: Serbia becomes one of the first countries to align national sexual and reproductive health priorities with international standards
Content: 26 September 2018
To mark the World Contraception the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Serbia and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Office in Serbia presented the National Program for Safeguarding and Improving Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Citizens of the Republic of Serbia. With the adoption of this National Programme, Serbia becomes one of the few countries that fully aligned national priorities in the area of sexual and reproductive health with international standards.
Belgrade, 26 September 2018 – To mark the World Contraception Day the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Serbia and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Office in Serbia presented the National Program for Safeguarding and Improving Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Citizens of the Republic of Serbia.
With the adoption of this National Programme, Serbia becomes one of the few countries that fully aligned national priorities in the area of sexual and reproductive health with the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health (2016-2030) and the WHO Action Plan for Sexual and Reproductive Health: Towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Europe – leaving no one behind.
Less than one-fifth of women in Serbia are using reliable methods of contraception, while young people are burdened with prejudices and know little on how to protect their health. „ With this set of measures, we wish to raise awarness of general public about importance of protecting reproductive health, as well as to reduce number of unitended pregannices that end with unsafe abortions and spread of sexually transmitted infections. With the Programme we also aim to prevent violence in our society and provide for better protection of women exposed to violence,” states Dr Vesna Knjeginjic, Assistant Minister at the Ministry of Health.
Participants at the event agreed that universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, is a strategic investment in the generations to follow. It creates environment in which women and couples can make informed choices about their reproductive health, and freely decide if, when and how many children to have.
“Adoption of the National Program for Safeguarding and Improving Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Citizens of the Republic of Serbia comes at a pivotal moment. I am assured that policies that reinforce sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as a fundamental human right, will support Serbia in realizing Sustainable Development Goals and will help Serbia on its EU accession road”, adds Dr Tamar Khomasuridze, Sexual and Reproductive Health Adviser at UNFPA Eastern Europe and Central Asia Regional Office.

Title: Measles cases hit record high in the European Region
Content: 20 August 2018
Copenhagen, Denmark, 20 August 2018
Over 41 000 children and adults in the WHO European Region have been infected with measles in the first 6 months of 2018. The total number for this period far exceeds the 12-month totals reported for every other year this decade. So far, the highest annual total for measles cases between 2010 and 2017 was 23 927 for 2017, and the lowest was 5273 for 2016. Monthly country reports also indicate that at least 37 people have died due to measles so far this year.
“Following the decade’s lowest number of cases in 2016, we are seeing a dramatic increase in infections and extended outbreaks,” says Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “We call on all countries to immediately implement broad, context-appropriate measures to stop further spread of this disease. Good health for all starts with immunization, and as long as this disease is not eliminated we are failing to live up to our Sustainable Development Goal commitments.”
Seven countries in the Region have seen over 1000 infections in children and adults this year (France, Georgia, Greece, Italy, the Russian Federation, Serbia and Ukraine). Ukraine has been the hardest hit, with over 23 000 people affected; this accounts for over half of the regional total. Measles-related deaths have been reported in all of these countries, with Serbia reporting the highest number of 14.
According to the latest assessment by the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC), released today, 43 of the Region’s 53 Member States have interrupted the endemic spread of measles and 42 have interrupted rubella (based on 2017 reporting).
At the same time, the RVC expressed concerns about inadequate disease surveillance and low immunization coverage in some countries. It also concluded that chains of measles transmission continued for more than 12 months in some countries that had interrupted the endemic spread of the disease, reverting their status back to endemic.
“This partial setback demonstrates that every person who is not immune remains vulnerable no matter where they live, and every country must keep pushing to increase coverage and close immunity gaps, even after achieving interrupted or eliminated status,” says Dr Nedret Emiroglu, Director of the Division of Health Emergencies and Communicable Diseases at the WHO Regional Office for Europe.
The measles virus is exceptionally contagious and spreads easily among susceptible individuals. To prevent outbreaks, at least 95% immunization coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine is needed every year in every community, as well as efforts to reach children, adolescents and adults who missed routine vaccination in the past.
While immunization coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine increased from 88% of eligible children in the Region in 2016 to 90% in 2017, large disparities at the local level persist: some communities report over 95% coverage, and others below 70%.
WHO is working closely with Member States currently facing outbreaks to implement response measures, including enhanced routine and supplemental immunization as well as heightened surveillance to quickly detect cases. WHO is also working with other countries to attain the 95% threshold.
“At this midterm juncture for the European Vaccine Action Plan, we must celebrate our achievements while not losing sight of those who are still vulnerable and whose protection requires our urgent and ongoing attention,” concludes Dr Jakab. “We can stop this deadly disease. But we will not succeed unless everyone plays their part: to immunize their children, themselves, their patients, their populations – and also to remind others that vaccination saves lives.”
All 53 countries in the Region will review midterm progress towards the goals of the European Vaccine Action Plan at the 68th session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe, taking place in Rome, Italy, on 17–20 September 2018.

Title: Marking the World Population Day - Family Planning is a Human Right
Content: 10 July 2018
Belgrade, 10 July 2018 - The importance of modern family planning has been at the heart of this year's commemoration of the World Population Day globally themed "Family Planning is a Human Right”.  This year marks the 50th anniversary of the 1968 International Conference on Human Rights, where family planning was, for the first time, globally affirmed to be a human right.
“Access to voluntary family planning enables women to space their births, benefiting both mothers’ and children’s health. The right to family planning also permits the enjoyment of other rights, including the rights to health, education, and the achievement of a life with dignity." said Dr Doina Bologa, UNFPA Country Director for Serbia at the press conference organized on 10 July in Belgrade, one day ahead of the global marking of the World Population Day.
When it comes to family planning situation regionally, data shows that the countries in our region have some of the world’s lowest modern contraceptive usage rates. According to Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey  (MICS 5), modern  contraception in Serbia is used by less than one-fifth of women in the general population who are married or in union (18.4%), while a traditional methods, primarily withdrawal, is used nearly twice more (40 %). The situation is even worse in marginalized categories of women, as only 7.2% of Roma women living in Roma settlements in Serbia are using modern contraception, while a traditional methods are used by 54 % of respondents.
Several reasons can explain this: too many women in our region still believe the myth that modern methods are harmful, and social pressure can get in the way of people asking for advice and supplies. Additionally, not all medical personnel are trained to provide quality advice and services, and not always is a wide range of contraceptives available reliably and at costs that people can afford.
“From the demographic perspective, family planning is important in many ways. It empowers women to avoid unplanned pregnancies and prevent negative consequences to their reproductive health. This makes it more likely that women will have the number of children they actually want, thus preserving fertility and promoting general health” stated Prof. Dr Mirjana Rasevic, Head of the Centre for Demographic Research, Institute for Social Sciences.
UNFPA will thus continue to support government efforts to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health care. “By adopting the National Program for Safeguarding and Improving Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Citizens of the Republic of Serbia, Government of the Republic of Serbia and Ministry of Health will continue to support health care providers and couples to make informed choices about their reproductive health, including for family planning”,  added Dr Vesna Knjeginjic, Assistant Minister at the Ministry of Health.
Sustainable Development Goal targets (such as target 3.7, to achieve universal access to sexual and reproductive health services), and achieving many of the Goals depends in part on the ability of women to exercise their reproductive rights. Development Partnership Framework (DPF) for Serbia 2016-2020 developed in close cooperation and through a partnership between the Government of the Republic of Serbia and the United Nations Country Team in Serbia, also envisages efforts to improve counselling services about family planning and the availability of reproductive health services and commodities in the country.

Title: First International Men and Gender Equality Survey launched in Serbia as a part of the UNCT joint project
Content: 17 May 2018
Belgrade, 17 May 2018 - First International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) in Serbia, the most comprehensive survey carried out to date on men’s attitudes and practices on a wide variety of topics related to gender equality, was presented on the national MAN 2018 Conference.
The conference was jointly opened by State Secretary, Mr. Darko Stanic,  Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ms. Ljiljana Loncar, Gender Equality Advisor to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Andrea Orizio, Head of the OSCE Mission to Serbia,  Mr. Ola Andersson, Counselor at Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Ms. Marija Rakovic, Programme Coordinator at UNFPA, Ms. Sumka Bucan, Regional Coordinator at CARE International Balkans and Mr. Vojkan Arsic, Director at Center E8.
Prof. Dr Marina Hughson presented the key finding of the IMAGES Serbia Research highlighting that this is a “men-friendly research”. Some of the key results indicated that almost 90% of men in Serbia wish they could spend more time with their children, while 68,1 percent of men believe that child related decisions are a joint responsibility of both parents.
After the panel discussion, international experts Ms. Nurgul Kinderbaeva, UNFPA Regional Office for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Mr. Natko Gereš, Promundo, Ms. Elli Scambor (Austria) and Ms. Majda Hrzenjak (Slovenia) gave presentations on caring masculinities, fathers and caregiving and men related research in EU and worldwide.
IMAGES Serbia was coordinated by UNFPA, Ministry of Youth and Sports and Center E8 within the joint project Integrated Response to Violence against Women and Girls in Serbia II, through the partnership of UNICEF, UN Women, UNFPA and UNDP and the Government of the Republic of Serbia and led by the Coordination Body for Gender Equality. The overall objective of the Integrated Response to Violence against Women and Girls in Serbia II is development of social and institutional environment that will contribute to zero tolerance and elimination of violence against women in Serbia. Joint actions of UN agencies and Governmental bodies contribute to solving the problem of domestic violence and violence in partner relations, enhance support to women, girls and their families and create society which does not tolerate violence.
The project is implemented with the support of the Government of Sweden.
IMAGES Serbia was additionally supported by CARE and OAK Foundation, while OSCE Mission in Serbia provided support for the organization of the MAN 2018 Conference.

Title: Representatives of the EU, UN agencies and Serbian state institutions visit Kikinda
Content: 12 April 2018
Kikinda, April 12th, 2018 – Nicolas Bizel, Head of Operations in the Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Serbia, Pavle Markov, Mayor of the City of Kikinda, representatives of Serbian state institutions and UN agencies, visited today the Reception Centre for Migrants and Health Centre in Kikinda. The delegation also participated in a volunteer action in Banatska Topola village. The visit has been organized within the European Union Support to Migration Management in the Republic of Serbia.
Head of Operations in the Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Serbia and the officials visited the Reception Centre in Kikinda where 130 migrants and refugees are accommodated. The delegation was ensured that the Reception Centre functions smoothly thanks to the European Union donations. The Reception Centre was renovated to a large extension and the accommodation and living conditions were improved – children playground and fence around the Centre were constructed, lights and video surveillance were installed during the last few months. In addition, the dining room and the kitchen were completely renovated in the value of approximately 184.000 Euros.
Nicolas Bizel handed over a specialized medical vehicle in the value of 21.000 Euros, donated to the Health Centre “Kikinda. The vehicle will facilitate the transport of patients from the Health Centre to the higher-level institutions for health protection. The analyser worth 20.000 Euros, donated by the EU to The Institute of Public Health, will contribute significantly to efficiency of the laboratory.
The visit to Kikinda ended in Banatska Topola village where volunteer action of afforestation took place. In joint action, the local volunteers and migrants from the Reception Centre planted 400 seedlings that will serve as protection from soil erosion by ground water.
“I am very pleased with what I have seen today in Kikinda and I was convinced myself that the assistance of the European Union was adequately used and that it reached those who needed it most. We have improved functioning of the health protection in Kikinda so that the medical treatment will be facilitated for locals, as well as for migrants and refugees accommodated in the Reception Centre. The European Union supports functioning of this and other reception and asylum centres. By support I refer to providing assets for adequate accommodation, food, access to health protection and education for children, school transport, protection of migrants, especially children and other vulnerable categories. In addition, our support implies also operational expenditures in the reception centres and cost for employees”, stated Nicolas Bizel commending the activity of afforestation as yet another sort of a social cohesion between migrants and locals.
Pavle Markov, Mayor of the City of Kikinda expressed gratitude to the European Union on behalf of the City of Kikinda for recognising the needs of the City and for taking part in improvement of the quality of life of its citizens as well as refugees and migrants who live on its territory.
“Hereby, it was proved once again that the City of Kikinda jointly with representatives of the European Union can and is willing to implement projects of great importance for its fellow citizens. This cooperation resulted in improvement of accommodation conditions in the Reception Centre for migrants, along with the necessary support to the Social Welfare Centre, Health Sector and the Public Utility Company.
We will certainly continue this fruitful cooperation and, as a City, we are already considering the future EU projects to improve living conditions of all citizens of Kikinda”, Markov emphasized.
The aforementioned activities of support to Kikinda as a host city of migrants were implemented by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Health Organization (WHO), and International Organization for Migration (IOM) and United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS).

Title: WHO at 70 - working for better health for everyone, everywhere
Content: 07 April 2018
On 7 April, World Health Day, the World Health Organization marks its 70th anniversary. On this occasion, we reflect not only on the impressive progress in health that has been achieved in the past 7 decades – from routine vaccination against childhood diseases to vastly improved maternal health, a focus on healthy environments, protection from health threats, and a strong legal framework to stop tobacco use, for example – but also recommit to the most fundamental goal of health for all.
Under the slogan, Health for all, World Health Day and WHO’s 70th anniversary was also marked in Serbia, with a breakfast reception organized for key national and international partners, UN agencies, the diplomatic community and the media.
This year, World Health Day is dedicated to one of WHO’s founding principles: “The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.”
Universal health coverage is a simple idea: it means that all people can use quality health services, where and when they need them, without experiencing financial hardship. It is a fundamental human right, a vision that WHO has pursued in partnership with countries since its foundation 70 years ago.
Yet despite impressive progress in the WHO European Region, even the most advanced countries have not been able to protect everyone from financial hardship caused by out-of-pocket payments for health care, and the heaviest burden falls on poor and vulnerable people. Out-of-pocket payments for health make up more than 15% of total spending on health in most countries of the European Region which raises concerns about the strengths of the system in providing protection for patients against the cost of ill health.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has made “universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all” a global goal. This year, WHO and its Member States have committed to an ambitious 5-year plan to accelerate progress towards achieving universal health coverage.
WHO calls on leaders in all Member states, including Serbia to take 3 concerted actions towards universal health coverage. Universal access to a strong and resilient people-centred health system with primary care as its foundation – bringing together community-based services, health promotion and disease prevention – produces social and economic benefits for individuals and societies.
Specifically, reducing the out-of-pocket payments that lead to financial hardship requires more public financing and carefully designed coverage policies with a focus on poorer people and other vulnerable groups, and a recent regional analysis suggest that all countries can do more and better to move towards universal health coverage.
Health is our most precious asset. It must not be a luxury enjoyed by the privileged. We all benefit socially, economically and environmentally from a world that seeks health for all. It is time that we come together and make this a common goal.
Data and context of UHC in Serbia
In the past 15 years, the life expectancy of the Serbian population has improved for both men and women from 71.76 years (69.05 years for men and 74.52 years for women) to 75.42 years (72.85 years for men and 78.00 for women) in the period 1998–2014. According to the WHO global health estimates, NCDs accounted for 94% of all deaths in Serbia in 2014. In 2015, the main causes of mortality for all ages included diseases of the circulatory system, malignant neoplasms and diseases of the respiratory system .  The standardized death rates (SDRs) for the four major NCDs in Serbia are higher compared to those for countries in the EU and the Region but the SDRs for the main causes of NCD mortality have decreased in recent years, most significantly for diseases of the circulatory system.
The highest incidence and mortality from malignant diseases in men came from lung (30.5%), colon (12%) and prostate cancer (8.1%), while most women were affected by breast (17.9%), lung (15.2%) and colorectal cancer (10.5%).
Data from the RHIF for 2015 record the number of registered adult patients with arterial hypertension is 28.6% of the adult population registered with a chosen doctor and the number of registered adult patients with diabetes mellitus is 8.1%of the adult population registered with a chosen doctor.
Up to 80% of heart diseases, strokes and type 2 diabetes as well as over a third of cancers could be prevented by eliminating common risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and the harmful use of alcohol. With its long history of a strong public health infrastructure and established framework and expertise, Serbia has the potential to make remarkable progress in scaling up coverage by core population-based interventions for NCD prevention. NCDs are acknowledged as a major threat to the socioeconomic wellbeing of the population in the 2016 Law on Public Health and concrete actions are formulated in a new draft Public Health Strategy.
Total health expenditure increased constantly in past decade but in the same period, the total expenditure on prevention and public health services was increased at a slower rate than total health expenditure, which led to a decrease in the percentage of prevention and public health services as a share of total health expenditure.
Out of pocket payment (OOPS) increased according to National Health Account and reached 41% in 2016.
Examples of good practice in the health care system in Serbia
The development of the Acute Coronary Syndrome network demonstrates that a strategically organized process can be implemented. The full process consists of the planning of human and financial resources, infrastructures, an information technology and communication network, and evaluation and quality processes. Clinical outcomes are comparable with the best international results.
A pilot project covering diabetes facilities at primary health care centres has started with needs assessments at different levels of care, with the involvement of the multidisciplinary team at all levels of conception and implementation of the programme.
Accreditation of health care institutions is improving quality, safety and the patient experience through the established Agency for Accreditation of Health Care Institutions.

Title: Serbia steps up partnership with FAO and EBRD for stronger agriculture
Content: 21 January 2018
Belgrade, 26-January-2018 – Promoting Serbian agricultural exports, modernizing the country’s water management systems and developing food quality labelling and geographical indication schemes were at the heart of a three-way meeting today in Serbia.
At the meeting, Serbia’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) agreed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) pointing to the continued commitment of the three partners to strengthening Serbia’s agrifood sector.
Serbia’s Minister of Agriculture, Branislav Nedimovic, commended the fruitful partnership with FAO and the EBRD in recent years, noting that the new agreement recognizes what he called “mutual goodwill and interest in continuing to leverage our respective strengths – to build a more efficient, sustainable, inclusive and competitive agrifood system in Serbia.”
Promoting Serbian exports
Serbia’s grain and oilseed sector is vital to the country’s economy, employing over 180,000 people and accounting for a considerable share of export income. In fact, the country has become one of the largest exporters of maize in Europe.
But despite favourable grain and oilseed market trends, Serbia has yet to fully tap into global grain markets.
Under the new agreement, FAO and the EBRD will continue to support efforts to accelerate Serbia’s export growth. In part, this will involve strengthening the capacity of the Serbian Grain Association to analyse markets and resolve production and trade bottlenecks – from infrastructure to logistics.
“There is great potential for Serbian producers and traders to access new markets, including those in the Near East, Middle East and Asia,” said Miljan Zdrale, the EBRD’s Regional Head of Agribusiness for central and south-eastern Europe. “FAO and the EBRD will continue to provide technical assistance for compliance with trade requirements and promote public-private dialogue among the country’s grain industry players, as well as regular information sharing and participation in international trade events.”

Linking quality to origin
FAO and the EBRD are also looking to expand their export development activities to other agricultural products, such as the country’s famous Arilje raspberries. Thanks to an FAO-EBRD project, the first 1 000 tonnes of Arilje raspberries achieved geographical indication (GI) certification this year.
The Oblačinka from Oblačina – a sour cherry from southern Serbia – has already received GI status. This entitles the cherries to be marketed under a public label that recognizes the link between a high-quality product and its place of origin.
Serbian products featuring the GI label were showcased during today’s meeting.
FAO, the EBRD and Serbian authorities have supported the creation of associations tasked with protecting and marketing the certified GIs, ensuring internal controls and traceability, and strengthening producers’ links to suppliers and retailers.
“A successful GI can open up new market opportunities, both domestically and abroad, raise rural incomes and ignite the local economy,” said FAO senior economist Emmanuel Hidier.

Title: New FAO report reveals food insecurity, nutrition problems in Europe and Central Asia
Content: 04 December 2017
Budapest, 4 – December – 2017 The countries of Europe and Central Asia have made good progress reducing the prevalence of undernourishment, but some 14.3 million women and men in the region are still not getting the food they need and malnutrition problems are on the rise, according to an FAO report published today.
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in Europe and Central Asia 2017, analyzes a range of food security and nutrition indicators to assess the countries’ progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture) by 2030. It appraises dietary energy supply, nutrition indicators such as stunting and wasting, anaemia, overweight and obesity, as well changing diets and their impact on different population groups.
After tremendous progress in recent years, the situation in the region now appears to be stagnant. The prevalence of undernourishment remained almost unchanged in the Caucasus and Central Asia according to the report which was presented at a Regional Symposium on Sustainable Food Systems for Healthy Diets.
“Poverty remains the single, most important obstacle to food security,” said Vladimir Rakhmanin, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Europe and Central Asia. “But there is a clear path forward. The Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, provide a powerful framework for tackling the challenges faced by the countries of Europe and Central Asia.”
To better appraise the drivers and features of food insecurity in the region, FAO’s report includes the new Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), which serves to complement the analysis of progress against Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) indicators on food security and nutrition. Providing more timely and comprehensive analysis, the new methodology shows that 14.3 million adults in the region suffered from severe food insecurity during the period 2014-16.

Asking about hunger
The FAO study uses country data, and factors in results from the new Food Insecurity Experience Scale, 
or FIES, introduced to complement the analysis of progress against the SDG 2 indicators measuring
food security and nutrition. The survey tool asks individuals to respond to these eight questions.
During the last 12 months, was there a time when, because of lack of money or other resources:
·         you were worried you would not have enough food to eat?
·         you were unable to eat healthy and nutritious food?
·         you ate only a few kinds of foods?
·         you had to skip a meal?
·         you ate less than you thought you should?
·         your household ran out of food?
·         you were hungry but did not eat?
·         you went without eating for a whole day?
Answers are then weighted to assess the level of food insecurity. FAO’s 2017 report includes FIES findings on severe food insecurity in the ECA region.
Yet, to fully assess the situation the nutrition data collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) is key, the report noted. Malnutrition in one or more of its three main forms – undernutrition, overnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies – is present to varying degrees in all countries of the region, the report states.
“Often all three coexist, in what is called the ’triple burden’ of malnutrition,” said FAO senior policy officer Ariella Glinni, principal author of the report. “It is not unusual for countries to experience high rates of both child undernutrition and obesity. Micronutrient deficiencies and overnutrition in children, women and men have become two major food security and nutrition concerns across the region.”
Overnutrition a problem, too
Overnutrition among the adult population is another important problem, the report found. A person is obese when his or her body mass index - the ratio of weight-for-height measured as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres - exceeds 30. Citing WHO data, the report points to a 30 percent increase in the number of obese adults during the period from 2000 to 2014. The highest prevalence of obesity was observed in the countries of South Eastern Europe where 26.9 percent of all adults were classified as obese.
Growing rates of obesity in the region closely correlate with per capita incomes that allow for consumption of food products with higher caloric value, coupled with increasingly sedentary lifestyles.
To a lesser extent, said Glinni, “as a form of malnutrition obesity can also be a result of changing dietary habits, and of low incomes associated with the consumption of cheaper foods with high levels of total fat, sugar and other refined carbohydrates.” A lack of awareness about healthy diets also contributes to the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity across the various income groups in the region.
Women and men in the region suffer from different forms of malnutrition. Women of child-bearing age are at greater risk of anaemia, constituting an important public health problem, as FAO found.
While women are mainly responsible for growing, purchasing, processing and preparing most of the food consumed, to make a real difference, initiatives to improve nutrition should target both women and men.
Changing climate and other challenges
This year's report features the theme: Ensuring food security through better management of scarce and fragile natural resources in the context of climate change.
Food demand in the region is growing, consumption patterns are changing, and urbanization is accelerating. At the same time, many production systems in the region are already unsustainable and vulnerable to shocks – including those stemming from extreme weather events – making future productivity gains uncertain, the report warns. Achieving food security under these conditions will require sustainable increases in agricultural production, greater resilience and more efficient use of natural resources.
Some of the countries in the Europe and Central Asia region are among the most vulnerable to changes and variability in climate, and many are already experiencing negative impacts on their agro-ecosystems, according to FAO. Increased damage and losses to the crop, livestock, forestry and fisheries subsectors are already being reported.
The need to reduce food losses and waste, which account globally for over 30 percent of the food produced, is becoming even more urgent. By wasting less food, and reducing food losses along the value chain, pressure on fragile ecosystems is lessened, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, agrifood systems become more efficient, and food security and nutrition are enhanced.
FAO also studied how individual countries are gearing up to address their food security and nutrition problems. It found that while many have taken the first steps to implement the 2030 Agenda – building on measures adopted to meet the earlier
Millennium Development Goals – only a few have policy frameworks that address all four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability.
Some countries still lack comprehensive food security policies. In others, FAO found, food security is defined more narrowly as focusing primarily on national food self-sufficiency, without considering the other dimensions of food security.
Many countries in the region are recognizing the importance of addressing nutrition issues in order to achieve food security and improve the wellbeing of their citizens, FAO found. Yet, nutrition policies and programmes have had varying degrees of success and need to be combined with coordinated measures – such as social protection, rural development, and nutrition awareness programs – and focus on the underlying causes of each type of malnutrition.

Title: The role of rural women is crucial for the development of Serbia
Content: 16 October 2017
Belgrade, 16 October 2017 - On the occasion of the International Day of Rural Women, the Coordination Body for Gender Equality, UN Women in Serbia and the Women's Platform for the Development of Serbia opened a debate on the quality of life of rural women, rural development and agriculture that recognizes, uses and develops women's resources, knowledge and networks.
Zorana Mihajlovic, Deputy Prime Minister and President of the Coordination Body for Gender Equality in the Government of the Republic of Serbia, opened the conference entitled “Rural women: Towards better quality of life in rural areas”, saying that there is a lot of women when it comes to work, but when it comes to property ownership, they almost do not exist.
“We are here today to map out all the problems rural women are facing and to find concrete answers and ways how to make things better. This conference thus has to be the first in a series of events on this topic,” said Mihajlovic.
Zeljko Radosevic, State Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, pointed out that the Ministry had initiated the implementation of gender equality policy in the field of agriculture. "This is just one way to improve the situation of women in rural areas and their engagement," Radosevic said.
Milena Rikanovic, UN Women in Serbia representative, said that rural women are key to rural development in the country but on the other side are faced with numerous problems. “It is necessary that rural women are positioned and perceived as a basis for sustainable development in rural areas," said Rikanovic.
According to Karla Hershey, UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia, empowering rural women fits into a comprehensive approach that inspired the new Global Agenda 2030 and calls that we leave no one behind. "Recognizing and applying this approach will bring great benefits to rural women in Serbia, as well as Serbia as a whole," Hershey said.
Pauline Menthonnex, Deputy Head of Mission at the Embassy of Switzerland, said that Switzerland supports Serbia in its endeavors to achieve gender equality with special focus on rural women in Southern and Western Serbia in the fields of agriculture and tourism.
After the introductory speeches, the conference continued with the presentation of the Alternative Report on the Situation of Rural Women in Serbia to the CEDAW Committee by Kosana Beker. Participants were then divided into groups on different topics varying from policies, measures and institutional framework to funds and budgets in a bid to jointly come up with solutions within each area.
The idea of honoring rural women with a special day was put forward at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, in 1995 when the Serbian government also committed to provide rural women with equal access and full participation in public life as well as to raise awareness on their needs and possibilities in creating rural development policies.

Title: UNICEF: 70 Years in Serbia Photo Exhibition
Content: 01 October 2017
Belgrade, 1 October 2017 – The First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia, Ivica Dacic, and UNICEF Representative in Serbia, Michel Saint-Lot, officially opened a photo exhibition – UNICEF: 70 Years in Serbia in the Foreign Ministry’s Museum of Diplomacy.
"The exhibition we have opened today tells a story of the continuity and importance of this cooperation from 1947 up to the present day. Our long-standing collaboration and partnership, which have developed through numerous successful initiatives over the past 70 years, confirm the importance of the support provided by UNICEF to the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Serbia to provide a healthy and stimulating environment for the development, education and safe life of children, and the full realisation of their rights in our country, in accordance with international instruments and the highest standards in the field of children's rights," said Ivica Dacic the First Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia.
The photo exhibition depicts seven decades of UNICEF’s dedicated work in Serbia. It spans from 1947, when the first humanitarian aid shipments were sent to children and families in the former Yugoslavia, up to the present day.
“UNICEF has always been a part of the history of this country. Since 1947, we have been helping in various ways - from humanitarian aid to systemic support to the Government in its reform processes. We have always worked together, in partnership, towards the same goal - to reach every child who needs support. Celebrating the 70th anniversary of UNICEF's work in Serbia is an opportunity to remind ourselves of the obligations we have towards children and to recommit to fulfilling our promises - to work to ensure that every child reaches his or her full potential,” said Michel Saint-Lot, UNICEF Representative in Serbia.
The exhibition UNICEF: 70 Years in Serbia is a retrospective showing UNICEF actively providing humanitarian and development assistance, and supporting the health, education and social protection systems.
After the opening at the Museum of Diplomacy, the exhibition will move to the streets of Belgrade, and other cities across Serbia, where it will be available to the general public during October and November.

Title: Top Investment in the Future of the Nation: Early Childhood Development
Content: 28 September 2017
Belgrade, 28 September 2017 – Programmes that support early childhood development are an opportunity to provide adequate nutrition, stimulation and care needed for a child’s brain development and for the realisation of his or her potential. Investing in the development of children in the earliest age, and support for their families, is a chance to improve outcomes for children, especially those who are most disadvantaged. Such investment generates multiple benefits - for children now, and for society in the future, it was concluded at the “Top Investment in the Future of the Nation: Early Childhood Development” conference, which was held today in Belgrade, Serbia.
“Supporting the youngest children requires a comprehensive approach to policies and programmes for children and their parents, caregivers and the society in which they live. The child must be healthy and protected, grow up in a family, have a solid foundation for education, and later for employment, and avoid the risk of poverty. It is, therefore, important that the entire system is geared towards supporting the child and parenting, just as it is equally important for everyone to remember that early childhood development is crucial for the cognitive, emotional, psychological and physical potentials of the child,” stressed Prof Dr Slavica Djukic Dejanovic, Minister without portfolio responsible for demography and population policy.
Multi-sectoral interventions are important to reach children early with services that support families to deliver nurturing care and promote, protect, and support early childhood development.
"The Government of the Republic of Serbia recognises the importance of caring for children and developing support services for them and their families. These services are realised through a variety of measures and policies, primarily in the health, education and social protection sectors, while particular emphasis is placed on supporting the development of the youngest children. In addition to protecting the child, both directly and through family support services, one of the basic responsibilities of the system is to ensure the minimum financial security of the family. This kind of security is one of the necessary conditions for improving the support provided to children - support for their well-being and overall development. Still, the most important role of the social protection system is the protection of the rights of the child and the best interests of the child. The development of support services for children and families, especially families with numerous and complex needs and problems, is one of the priorities of social protection. In order to ensure an adequate and comprehensive response to the creation of conditions for supporting children at an early age, it is necessary to involve different sectors, institutions and organisations, and to coordinate and act jointly. The Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs will focus on developing these services in the future, as children are our biggest priority,” said Zoran Djordjevic, Minister of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs.
The period from conception to the start of school can influence the future of the child, but also the economic growth and development of every society.
UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia Afshan Khan said that early childhood is an opportunity to build the brains of the children who will build the future. “The early moments of a child's life represent a critical window of opportunity which we must seize to make sure every child can reach their full potential in life. UNICEF is pleased to work alongside the Government of the Republic of Serbia across all sectors – health, nutrition, education, and social protection – to make sure the most vulnerable children are reached with vital early childhood interventions.“
The conclusions reached at the conference will contribute to the formulation of a Call for Action to Support the Development of Children in Early Childhood, which will be signed by the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development and the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs, in order to direct their coordinated efforts for the benefit of every child and family in Serbia.
UNICEF will continue to support the Government of the Republic of Serbia to advance the development of the youngest children, especially those children that are most vulnerable.

Title: EU and UN team up to eliminate violence against women and girls
Content: 20 September 2017
New York, 20 September 2017

Today at the United Nations General Assembly in New York the European Union and the United Nations launched a EUR 500 million Spotlight Initiative to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls.
The EU-UN Spotlight Initiative was launched by the EU High Representative / Vice-President of the Commission Federica Mogherini and Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica, together with the UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed.
Speaking at the launch, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated: “It is a harsh but true reality – 1 in 3 women will face violence throughout their lifetime. Violence against women and girls devastates lives, and causes pain across generations. “The Spotlight Initiative is truly historic,” he added. “This Fund is a pioneering investment in gender equality and women's empowerment. When we shine a spotlight on the empowerment of the world's women and girls, everyone's future is brighter.”
EU High Representative Federica Mogherini noted: “The European Union is committed to combatting all forms of violence against women and girls, as they undermine our core fundamental rights and values, such as dignity, access to justice and gender equality. We need first to ensure that we keep women and girls safe, in order to empower them to deploy their full potential.”
Commissioner Mimica added: "Violence against women and girls is one of the greatest injustices of our time, which crosses all borders, generations, nationalities and communities. It deeply touches our hearts and our minds. And it is a serious barrier to any society's full development potential. To make a real change, I invite all partners to join our Spotlight Initiative for a world in which all women and girls can truly shine!”
The EU-UN Spotlight Initiative is supported by a multi-stakeholder trust fund, with the EU as its main contributor in the order of half a billion Euro, which is open to other donors.
Over the next few years, comprehensive programmes will be implemented to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, such as sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices; trafficking and economic (labour) exploitation; femicide; and domestic and family violence. Core areas of intervention will include strengthening legislative frameworks, policies and institutions, preventive measures, access to services and improving data gathering in Africa, Latin America, Asia, the Pacific and the Caribbean.

Consistent with the principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Spotlight Initiative will apply a rights-based approach, and give particular attention to the most marginalised women and girls in order to ‘leave no-one behind'. It will aim at galvanizing political commitments at the highest level and at providing large-scale targeted support, as well as at building new partnerships. It will also raise awareness of the widespread, persistent and detrimental impact of violence against women and girls.
Background
Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is one of the most widespread and devastating human rights violations across the globe. It affects all societies, cutting across generational, socio-economic, educational and geographic boundaries. Overall more than a billion lives today are touched by violence. It is estimated that 35% of women have experienced violence at some point in their lives. This figure is as high as 70% in some countries.
Moreover, more than 700 million women worldwide were married as children before 18. Of those women, more than 1 in 3–or some 250 million–before the age of 15. At least 200 million women and girls have undergone female genital mutilation in 30 countries.
This scourge is a barrier to gender equality, women's and girls' empowerment and overall sustainable development, and an impediment to the achievement of the SDGs.
The Spotlight Initiative is an expression of the same political will that was demonstrated by the international community in adopting the SDGs, with standalone Goal 5 on Gender Equality and specific targets on ending violence against women and girls, as well as mainstreaming of gender equality across the entire SDG framework.
The New European Consensus on Development, the EU's new global approach to sustainable development for the years ahead, also underlines the commitment of the EU and all its Member States to gender equality.

Title: Backpacks and school supplies distributed to Jovan Ristic primary school pupils, including refugee and migrant children
Content: 04 September 2017
Belgrade, 4 September 2017 - The Minister of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs Zoran Djordjevic, the Assistant Minister for Pre-School and Primary Education of the Minister of Education, Science and Technological Development Vesna Nedeljkovic, UNICEF Representative in Serbia Michel Saint-Lot and UNHCR Representative in Serbia Hans Friedrich Schodder this morning visited the Jovan Ristic primary school in Borca, which is enrolling refugee and migrant children this year. The backpacks with school supplies were distributed to all the pupils attending the Jovan Ristic primary school, including to refugee and migrant children and children from socially vulnerable families.
The Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs had earlier announced a set of new projects and strategies aiming to support the vulnerable categories of refugees and migrants, children in particular.
Minister Djordjevic noted that all the children in Serbia must enjoy equal treatment irrespective of religious and ethnic affiliation and social status, and added that unhindered education of each child represents one of the fundamental human rights.
Djordjevic added that the Ministry is continuously working to strengthen support to children from vulnerable categories such as the children without parental care, children accommodated in centres for minors and refugee and migrant children.
The Assistant Minister for Pre-School and Primary Education of the Minister of Education, Science and Technological Development, Vesna Nedeljkovic, said that after the last years’ participation of this Ministry in the project “Support to Pupils – Refugees/Migrants on the Territory of the Republic of Serbia“, implemented together with UNICEF and other partners whereby 200 refugee pupils attended the Serbian schools, the Minister issued a Professional Instruction for inclusion of pupils – refugees/asylum-seekers into the education system. It provides for systemic preparations for entry of all 645 refugee children into the primary education system which the law stipulates to be mandatory and free of charge. The pupils will be attending schools in 17 municipalities Serbia-wide where the reception centres are located. The teachers in these schools were trained to apply the Professional Instruction.
“This is a moment of real opportunity - to protect the right to education of refugee and migrant children. For them, education is vital, as it provides some stability and a sense of normalcy. It is one of the few things they can take with them into their future lives. UNICEF is working closely with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Labour, Veteran and Social Affairs, and the Commissariat for Refugees to ensure that at least 700 children will be able to access schools this year in locations where there are Government shelters. We are providing capacity building to schools – to around 500 members of school teams from around 90 schools from 17 local self-governments and backpacks and school supplies for school-aged refugee and migrant children,” stated Michel Saint-Lot, UNICEF Representative in Serbia.
“UNHCR is very happy to see the children from refugee and migrant families starting the school year along with their peers from Serbia. It is indeed a very exciting day for all, and in particular for the children who have come a long way from their home countries. I hope they will all study hard and make many new friends. We thank the Government of Serbia for all the efforts invested over the past months to make this possible,” stated Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative in Serbia.
The primary school Jovan Ristic already took part in many projects, the current one being “Support to Pupils – Refugees/Migrants on the Territory of the Republic of Serbia“. The first group of pupils in the last school year consisted of seven boys from Afghanistan aged 13-15, and 13 pupils aged 7-17 started attending classes in March 2017. Having gained excellent experience, this year it will enrol 12 boys and girls from Afghanistan who will be attending grades four to eight.

Title: World Population Day - Family Planning: Empowering People, Developing Nations
Content: 11 July 2017
Belgrade, 11 July 2017 - Ever since 1989, the UN has celebrated World Population Day on July 11 in the hope of raising awareness on the urgency and importance of population issues, including their relations to the environment and development. This year the topic is Family Planning: Empowering People, Developing Nations.
Access to safe, voluntary family planning is a human right. It is also central to gender equality and women’s empowerment, and is a key factor in reducing poverty. Investments in making family planning available also yields economic and other gains that can propel development forward.
Around the world, some 214 million women who want to avoid pregnancy are not using safe and effective family planning methods, for reasons ranging from lack of access to information or services to lack of support from their partners or communities. Most of these women with an unmet demand for contraceptives live in 69 of the poorest countries on earth.
However, when it comes to family planning situation in our region, data shows that the countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia have some of the world’s lowest modern contraceptive usage rates. According to Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey  (MICS 5), modern  contraception in Serbia is used by less than one-fifth of women in the general population who are married or in union (18.4%), while a traditional methods, primarily withdrawal, is used nearly twice more (40 %). The situation is even worse in marginalized categories of women, as only 7.2% of Roma women living in Roma settlements in Serbia are using modern contraception, while a traditional methods are used by 54 % of respondents.
Investing in family planning is investing in the health and rights of women and couples worldwide. These investments also yield economic and other gains that can propel development forward and are thus critical to the success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its accompanying 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
In 2017 World Population Day, 11 July, coincides with the Family Planning Summit, the second meeting of the FP2020–Family Planning 2020–initiative, which aims to expand access to voluntary family planning to 120 million additional women by 2020
“For women to reach their full potential and be more economically productive, they must be able to exercise their right to decide for themselves whether, when or how often to have children. Upholding this right will lead to improvements in health and produce an array of benefits: greater investments in schooling, greater productivity, greater labour-force participation and eventually increased income, savings, investment and asset accumulation,” late Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, UNFPA Executive Director (1949-2017).
Family planning is included in Sustainable Development Goal targets (such as target 3.7, to achieve universal access to sexual and reproductive health services), and achieving many of the Goals depends in part on the ability of women to exercise their reproductive rights. And universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, is key to success. Development Partnership Framework (DPF) for Serbia 2016-2020 developed in close cooperation and through a partnership between the Government of the Republic of Serbia and the United Nations Country Team in Serbia, also envisages efforts to improve counselling services about family planning and the availability of reproductive health services and commodities in the country.
“If we focus on youth, research shows us that many young people in Serbia have no basic knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of reproduction, and that their knowledge of contraception and sexually transmitted infections is scarce and burdened with prejudices. Thus, they prefer to use coitus interruptus method instead of modern family planning methods,” says Dr Doina Bologa, UNFPA Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Country Director for Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Director for Kosovo[1] .
“Improving the situation in the sphere of family planning is possible and it requires commitment from all. National Programme for Sexual and Reproductive Health which aims to coordinate actions of all stakeholders for advancing reproductive health and rights of the population of Serbia is an important step towards achieving this goal, and UNFPA is happy to support these efforts made by the Ministry of Health and Government of the Republic of Serbia,“ adds Bologa.

About World Population Day
In 1989, the then-Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) recommended that 11 July be observed as World Population Day. An outgrowth of the Day of Five Billion, marked on 11 July 1987, the Day since then seeks to focus attention on the urgency and importance of population issues, particularly in the context of overall development.

Title: Keeping the Line Open: Eight SOS Helpline Services Supported
Content: 07 July 2017
Belgrade, 7-July-2017 - SOS telephone service support for women who are in situations of violence, provided by women’s non-governmental organizations will be avaliable to more users, and especially to Roma women and women with disabilities. Grants were awarded to eight associations that provide the specialized service. They were awarded by UNDP, within the United Nations joint project "Integrated Response to Violence Against Women and Girls II“.
UNDP supported „Femina Association“ from Smederevska Palanka working on expanding the support provided for realization of rights, psychosocial and psychological services for women who are in situation of violence from the Danube and Braničevo districts, while the "Peščanik" service from Kruševac will be expanded in the Rasinski district through establishment of the two new SOS services in Brus and Ćićevac. „Women’s Centre Užice“ will expand the service onto three municipalities Čajetina, Bajina Bašta and Požega, covering the district of Zlatibor, and Fenomena from Kraljevo will extend the already existing service by making it available 24 hours to women in situations of violence.
The special emphasis was to make the service available to women from the vulnerable groups - "Osvit" from Niš will continue providing SOS helpline service in Roma language, the Roma Center for Women and Children Daje works on informing and improving the protection of Roma women in situation of violence from Roma neighbourhoods in Belgrade, while Roma Association Novi Bečej works on providing support to women who suffered sexual violence. Organization for supporting women with and without disabilities in situation of violence ...IZ KRUGA VOJVODINA is supported to continue working on the emotional, psychological, informative and legal empowerment as well as to continue providing support to women who suffer violence.
SOS phones provide support and information on how women who experienced domestic violence and violence in partner relations can protect themselves as well as on how they can report violence, and which institutions they can get in touch with in order to seek assistance. Apart from the support provided, women who suffered violence are being empowered to leave the situation they are involved in. SOS phones are crucial for the first contact with the user and for meeting her needs, as well as for further guidance to community services such as social welfare centers, the police, health centers, and prosecution.
SOS helpline has been present in Serbia for 25 years. This service is provided by trained activists with many years of experience and expertise working with women who suffered violence. According to the data provided by the Women Against Violence Network, this service is provided by 27 women’s non-governmental organizations in 18 cities in Serbia. Furthermore, these telephones receive more than 10 000 calls on annual basis. On average, about 2/3 of the work of specialist non-governmental organizations is voluntary and under constant pressure that the service will be extinguished.
Activities within the joint project Integrated Response to Violence Against Women and Girls in Serbia II, are implemented by UNICEF, UN Women, UNFPA and UNDP, in partnership with the Government of the Republic of Serbia, headed by the Coordinating Body for Gender Equality. Integrated Response to Violence Against Women and Girls in Serbia Is aimed at development of a social and institutional environment that will contribute to zero tolerance and eradication of violence against women in Serbia. Through joint action, United Nations agencies and Government bodies contribute to tackling the problem of domestic violence and violence in intimate partner relationships, improving support for women, girls and their families, and creating the environment that does not tolerate violence.
The project is being implemented with the support of the Swedish Government.

Title: UNHCR and IOM present Global Compact on Migration and Refugees
Content: 19 June 2017
Belgrade, 19 June 2017 – International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Serbia (UNHCR) presented today the Global Compact on Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees.
This event is organized with regard to the adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants on 19 September 2016 which further led to the adoption of Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM). GCM will be used to enhance coordination in the multidimensional field of international migration and will serve as a framework for comprehensive international cooperation to address migrants, human mobility and all aspects of international cooperation.
In the New York Declaration, 193 UN Member States have also requested the UN Refugee Agency – UNHCR to steer head consultative process leading to the adoption of a Global Compact for Refugees.
With regards to the above, Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in Serbia, Ms. Karla Hershey stated at the opening of the Conference: “Both Global Compact processes seek to advance international solidarity and standards in managing migrants and refugees globally.  This also mirrors one of the aims of Serbia’s progress towards EU Accession, bearing in mind the strong positive influence that Chapters 23 and 24 will have on the Global Compact.  At the same time, migration is part of Agenda 2030 as a key global development policy, particularly focused on lowering inequalities. “Nobody left behind” refers to all humans. In addition to citizens, refugees, stateless persons, asylum-seekers and migrants all need to be recognized under this Global Compact.“
Ambassador Katarina Lalic Smajevic of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic Serbia addressed the participants in the introductory session by emphasising that:  „Republic of Serbia has supported the adoption of New York Declaration and is actively involved in achieving Global Compact on migration and Global Compact on Refugees because we believe that only through a coordinated activity and joint efforts, both international organizations as well as UN member states, we can lead to a significant breakthrough in addressing migration and refugees crisis, due to the fact that this is not geographically limited but global phenomenon. UNHCR, IOM and other international partners can count on Serbia's cooperation in reaching their goal, as it was thus far.
Having in mind the commitment of all government institutions in addressing the migration crisis, government representatives took a special reflect on priorities and challenges. State Secretary of the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Social and Veteran Affairs, Mr. Nenad Ivanisevic stated: „Serbia remains committed to finding a solution to migration crisis, we will neither build walls nor fences, everyone who find themselves in our territory will be assisted, but we will certainly take care of the safety of our citizens“.
Assistant to the Police Director, Mr. Bogoljub Zivkovic has emphasised: „Since 2015, which was the beginning of migration crisis in Europe, Serbia has been facing great challenges which are being handled in responsible and humane manner. With regards to that, Ministry of Interior shall, in line with its jurisdiction, contribute to fulfilling the commitments laid out in the New York Declaration and shall continue with comprehensive and exceptional cooperation that it has with IOM Mission and UNHCR in Serbia through projects and donations which aim to assist Ministry of Interior in responding to the challenges of the migration crisis“.
On behalf of the Commissariat for Refugees and Migration of the Republic of Serbia, Deputy Commissioner, Ms. Svetlana Velimirovic stated: „Serbia is a country with dynamic migration flows and, at the same time, a country of origin and reception of migrants. Unified standards, good coordination and joint understanding of a solution to migrants' problems, especially by taking care of the rights of both local and migrant population, are the key element to an efficient migration management. I am certain that Serbia can make a significant contribution through its knowledge and experience“.
Through a detailed presentation of a Global Compact on Migration, IOM Coordinator for Western Balkan, Mr. Peter Van der Auweraert stated: „As IOM, we hope that governments will agree on increasing legal pathways for migration and take concrete steps to further improve the protection of vulnerable migrants. As the leading UN agency on Migration, IOM stands ready to support governments with both the formulation and eventual implementation of the Global Compact on Migration. Given its broad experience in managing crisis and ordinary migration, Serbia has a lot to contribute to the inter-state process that will determine the content and the scope of GCM“.
Having outlined the process leading to a Global Compact on Refugees, Mr. Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative in Serbia concluded: „The UN Refugee Agency warmly welcomes the strong interest of Serbia in forging a Global Compact on Refugees. Having protected and assisted more than half a million refugees from the former Yugoslavia, more than 200 thousand internally displaced from Kosovo and Metohija as well as close to a million, mainly Syrian, refugees during the recent European refugee crisis, the government and people of Serbia have shown exemplary compassion and developed many good models that can assist in enhancing international solidarity and standards in easing the plight of refugees and IDPs.“

Dr Krstev has set a distinctive example for health professionals and others involved in tobacco control through her exceptional leadership and ability to cooperate with both national and international partners.
While Serbia has made progress in the area of tobacco control, work remains in order to fully implement the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The WHO FCTC entered into force in 2005, and its Parties are obliged to take a number of steps to reduce demand and supply for tobacco products. There are 180 Parties to the Convention, including Serbia.
The current smoking prevalence among adults in Serbia was 34.7% in 2013 (37.9% among male population and 31.6% among female), compared to 26% in the EU Member States. Based on the current level of adult smoking in Serbia, premature deaths attributable to smoking are projected to be as high as 1.2 million of the 2.5 million smokers alive today, and may increase in the absence of stronger tobacco control policies. The SimSmoke tobacco control model that was used to develop the projections for Serbia indicate that by adopting a set of tobacco control policies consistent with the WHO FCTC, smoking prevalence in Serbia can be reduced by 29% within five years, 37% within 15 years and 44% within 40 years. Nearly 535,000 premature deaths could be averted over 40 years.
The tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced, killing more than 7 million people every year and costs households and governments over US$ 1.4 trillion through healthcare expenditure and lost productivity. Among WHO regions, Europe has the highest prevalence of tobacco smoking. More than 6 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while around 890 000 are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. But tobacco use is one of the largest preventable causes of noncommunicable diseases.
All countries have committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Key elements of this agenda include implementing the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and by 2030 reducing by one third premature death from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including heart and lung diseases, cancer, and diabetes, for which tobacco use is a key risk factor.
On World No Tobacco Day 2017, WHO is highlighting how tobacco threatens the development of nations worldwide, and is calling on governments to implement strong tobacco control measures as part of their responses to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These include making indoor public places and workplaces smoke-free , raising excise taxes , banning marketing and advertising of tobacco and promoting plain packaging of tobacco products.
At today’s official Award ceremony held at the UN House building in Belgrade, in the presence of representatives of the Serbian government, relevant ministries, diplomatic community, UN agencies and the media, the Award was presented to Dr Krstev jointly by the WHO Representative in Serbia, Dr Zsofia Pusztai, the UN Resident Coordinator, Ms. Karla Robin Hershey, and Dr Meho Mahmutovic, State Secretary of the Serbian Ministry of Health.
WHO and UN will continue to support countries in their efforts to take strong national action on tobacco control to protect their citizens and pledge to leave no one behind in our work for a healthier and sustainable future for all.

Title: UN Women and the European Union launch initiative to focus on ending violence against women in Serbia
Content: 29 May 2017
Inception Workshop on the Serbian component of the UN Women Regional Programme  Ending Violence against Women in the Western Balkan countries and Turkey: Implementing Norms, Changing Minds was officially opened by Nicolas Bizel of the EU Delegation in Serbia at EU Info Center in Belgrade on 29 May.
Bizel said that the EU started this regional programme with UN Women for three reasons: “One – it brings attention on meeting the obligations set by both the UN legal framework and as well as that of the EU; It allows for regional exchange and cooperation to build on lessons learned and good practice methodologies by involving six Western Balkan countries as well as Turkey; It will support concrete and practical measures, working with CSOs, to be implemented at grass roots level to address and combat gender discrimination and gender based violence.”
According to Ljiljana Loncar, Advisor to the President of the Coordination Body for Gender Equality in Serbia, her institution had initiated the adoption of a new National Strategy for Preventing and Combating Violence, and Serbia had already adopted the Law on prevention of domestic violence, which will take into force on 1 June. "We all have to fight against violence against women and girls to stop it as such violence obviously knows no boundaries," said Loncar.
Biljana Brankovic, member of GREVIO Committee, which monitors the implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention), has presented the main conclusions of the national study on the availability and accessibility of support services in response to violence against women and girls in Serbia. She noted that legislation changes are not enough for effectively tackling violence against women and that it’s necessary to improve the existing support services for victims.
“The most urgent is to introduce a free national SOS line that would be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and to open support centers for victims of sexual violence and provide stable funding for existing specialized women's organizations,” she explained.
Milana Rikanovic, Head of UN Women Office in Serbia, presented the roadmap for the implementation of the regional Programme in Serbia.
She stressed that a precondition of combatting gender-based violence is developing institutional and policy frameworks and stressed that all actors of society have to raise awareness on violence against women and girls. “It is a long way from implementing norms to changing minds, but we can make it with joint efforts and exchange of experience in the region," Rikanovic concluded.
Violence against women and girls is one of the most persistent social issues in Serbia. Statistics show that every second woman in the country has suffered some form of violence. In the past ten years, 330 women in Serbia were killed in gender-based violence.
The aim of this initiative is to promote favorable social norms and attitudes to prevent gender discrimination and violence against women; pursue empowerment of women and girls (including those from disadvantaged groups) who have experienced discrimination or violence to advocate for and use available, accessible, and quality services along with full implementation of legislative framework in line with international standards.

Title: New quality label to raise profile of Serbian food
Content: 24 May 2017
Belgrade, 24-May-2017 - Serbian meat producers can now apply for the “Serbian quality – Srpski Kvalitet” label - the country’s first national quality label - to set their products apart in the market. At a press conference held on 22 May in Belgrade, the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection unveiled the public quality label, announcing that eight products had already been granted the right to use it.
The Serbian Government has been working with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to encourage the adoption of high-quality standards in the meat sector.
With funding from Luxembourg, the project brought together a working group of meat processing companies and government representatives to create a public quality label that would recognize the higher quality of certain meat products, as well as other food categories in the future.
To obtain the new quality stamp for a product, fresh, Serbian raw material – Serbian meat in this case – must be used. In addition, for each type of product category, the label will require up to three specific properties differentiating the Srpski Kvalitet products from standard products in the market.
Gaining consumer confidence and market edge
Over half of Serbia’s farms raise livestock, and many produce meat – mainly pork, poultry and beef. However, imports and competition in the domestic market have become more intense, with increasing quantities of locally processed meat products made from imported frozen meat. That is why this new label focuses on meat from Serbian livestock. The feed of these animals is free from genetically modified organisms – an increasingly important point for most Serbian consumers.
The new quality label, created by a ministerial decree, can help premium meat products gain recognition in the domestic market and potentially abroad, and provide consumers with guarantees on product quality and traceability.
“This is an important development for our country’s food industry as a whole as the national label will assure consumers that what they are buying is made with products from the Republic of Serbia and is of superior quality,” said Branislav Nedimovic, Serbia’s Minister of Agriculture and Environmental Protection, at the press conference. “It will create a premium for quality meat products and help producers possibly tap into new markets.”
Drawing on the French experience
The initiative began in 2014 when FAO and the EBRD organized a study trip to France for a group of Serbian meat producers and government representatives. In meeting with French key players involved in meat production and quality certification, they learned more about the use of public and private quality labels.
Study tour participants were particularly impressed by France’s Label Rouge, a mark that assures consumers of the superior quality of certain food products compared with similar products in the market. Created in the early 1980s, the label – which now applies to a wide range of products – has gained huge consumer recognition.
“We left France very motivated and well prepared to develop a Serbian quality label that would help our premium meat products gain greater recognition, both domestically and internationally,” said Tamara Penjić, Executive Director of Meat Industry Carnex, who participated in the visit.In 2016 we founded our Serbian Meat Quality Association and this year we have our first products certified with the Serbian Quality label”.
According to the decree, applications for the new label need to come from an association. In this context, the Serbian Meat Quality Label Association was created in late 2016. The Association carries out pre-screening, agrees on the quality features of the selected products and submits requests to the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection for approval.
“This association is very useful not only in identifying and promoting products that can obtain the quality mark, but also to facilitate a productive dialogue between the industry and government authorities on quality issues. It also encourages industry players to coordinate and better enforce safety and quality standards along the entire value chain,” said Miljan Zdrale, Head of Agribusiness for South-Eastern Europe at the EBRD.
Keeping up the momentum in Serbia …
Like the Label rouge, the Srpski Kvalitet label has a strong visual image designed to earn consumer trust and loyalty, even beyond Serbia.
While Serbian meat products will be the first category of products benefitting from the label, it is open to all sectors. The example set by the country’s meat industry could inspire other sectors to work with the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection to grant the label to other high-quality, locally produced goods – from dairy products to honey and vegetables.
…and in the region
In addition to the efforts in Serbia, FAO and the EBRD have been supporting the development of quality and origin-based labels in Montenegro, Georgia, and Turkey.
“Consumers are increasingly eager to know where and how their food is produced,” said Emmanuel Hidier, an FAO Senior Economist. “So it is only fair enough that producers’ efforts to achieve higher quality and guarantee the origin of their products are duly recognized through trustworthy labels. The process of creating origin-based and quality labels in Serbia has been very stimulating and encouraging. It has involved lots of goodwill and cooperation from a wide range of stakeholders, from public authorities to farmers and agribusinesses.”

Title: Investment in early childhood education – the safest investment in future
Content: 22 May 2017
Belgrade, 22 May 2017 – Preschool education must be of high quality and accessible to children of all socio-economic backgrounds and in all geographic areas regardless of the level of their development, concluded today international conference on “ Key dimensions of the quality development in early childhood education - the Preschool Curriculum Framework”.
A number of research have shown that investing in early childhood education has multiple benefits for a child’s development and for a whole society.
“There is still much to be done for the improvement of preschool education in the Republic of Serbia. The good thing is that today, more than ever, preschool education is in the focus of the Ministry’s and the Government’s work, sais H.E. Mladen Sarcevic, Minister of Education, Science and Technological Development. He explained that intensive activities were in progress for the development of the new Preschool Curriculum Framework and that the process would be finalised by April 2018.
Addressing the conference, UNICEF Representative in Serbia Michel Saint-Lot said: “Early childhood education is a win for everybody”, “Serbia has a long tradition of pre-school education. And yet, it has one of the lowest rates of participation in pre-school education in Europe. Half of the children aged 3 – 5.5 have no access to preschool programmes. And these are the children who need it most, and who would have the highest benefits - poor, rural and Roma children”.
An increase of coverage of children aged 3 to 5.5 with pre-school education and improvement of quality requires systemic interventions on the national and local levels, modernisation of curricula, improvement of the competencies of pre-school teachers and more support for the improvement of quality.
Swiss Agency for Development (SDC) has supported education reform in Serbia for over a decade, investing approximately 12 million Euros.
“Switzerland considers that is of key importance to support a society that integrates all its members from early stages of life. For this, good quality pre-school system and inclusive enrolment are crucial”, said Ursula Läubli, Director of SDC in Serbia.
UNICEF’s early childhood development programmes in Serbia have also been supported by IKEA, regular monthly donors and UNICEF Ambassador Novak Djokovic.
The conference was organised by UNICEF in Serbia, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Institute for the Improvement of Education, Institute for Education Quality, and CIP-Centre for Interactive Pedagogy.

Title: Living with Autism - From the Perspective of Patients, Parents and Professionals
Content: 13 March 2017
Niš, 13 March 2017 - Early diagnosis, early interventions and inclusion in the education system, from preschool onwards, can greatly contribute to children with autistic spectrum disorders, and other developmental delays, to improve their development and quality of life, it was concluded during the symposium "Living with Autism - From the Perspective of the Patients, Parents and Professionals", held in Niš.
The importance of early detection of symptoms of autism, causes of and new approaches in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders, the inclusion of children with autism in the preschool and school systems, and systemic support to parents were discussed at the symposium. The conference was organised by UNICEF in Serbia and the Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions of Serbia (DEAPS), in cooperation with the Serbian Society of Autism, the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, and with the active participation of Autism Speaks, the world's leading autism organisation. In addition to eminent national experts in this field, the meeting was attended by international experts, including Andy Shih from Autism Speaks, Sarah Parsons, a professor at the University Southampton in Great Britain, and Maria Luisa Scattoni from the Italian Network for Early Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders.
The delays in the timely recognition of early signs and problems of children with autistic spectrum disorders, the lack of centres for the provision of early interventions and the lack of experts in this field, are just some of the problems Serbia is facing.
In order to respond to the current challenges, the Ministry of Health has created the National Programme for the Development of Children in Early Childhood and has started its implementation.
“The adoption of the Law on Health Records foresees the establishment of a register of children with disability. With the coordination of the Public Health Institute and with the collaboration of eminent experts, the work on developing a registry has started. We expect to have the first precise and concrete information about the situation in our country by the end of 2017,” said Zlatibor Lončar, Minister of Health, at the opening of the symposium.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities obliges Serbia to ensure respect for the rights of every child, including the rights of children with disabilities.
“The better position of children with autism and other disorders, and their families, greater availability of services, ensuring the change of attitudes towards inclusiveness in society are only possible with strong political will, and with the cooperation of relevant actors in the system and financial allocations by the government,” said Michel Saint-Lot, UNICEF in Serbia Representative.
Improving conditions so that children with disabilities are able to realise their full potentials is possible only through the joint efforts of relevant ministries, professional associations and associations of persons with autism. The UNICEF in Serbia Representative stressed the importance of donations made by citizens and the private sector, such as Nordeus, which support UNICEF’s programmes in Serbia.
Living with autism can present a significant burden to families with children with autistic spectrum disorders, and they need to be provided help and assistance in a manner that will ease the daily routine of families.
“Children with autism spectrum disorders, on the one hand, in small communities have no access to services or have very limited access, and on the other, in big cities they are flooded with a range of services, many of which are not grounded in science and are not evidence based. Therefore, we need guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and education strategies that provide additional support and help,” said Milica Pejović Milovančeviž from DEAPS.
"Our mission is to promote solutions for people with autistic spectrum disorders and their families, throughout the entire life cycle. Our main goal is the inclusion of children and persons with autism in regular life activities,” said Andy Shih from Autism Speaks.
Participants of the symposium called for the respect of the rights of every child, for the building of an inclusive society and the development and implementation of national guidelines for the early identification, diagnosis and early intervention in the area of autism.
The following day, in cooperation with international experts, discussions on professional guidance to support children with autism and their parents will commence.

Title: Serbia taps FAO expertise in forestry
Content: 22 February 2017
Belgrade, 22-February-2017 - A high-level conference in Belgrade today marks the first stage in a recently-begun four-year commitment on the part of FAO. A project worth US$3.75 million, financed by the Global Environment Facility, or GEF, is directed towards the long-term sustainability of forest ecosystems in Serbia.
Main components and expected results of the project were presented by experts in forest inventory, biodiversity, and forest management planning who helped develop the concept.
FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Europe and Central Asia Vladimir Rakhmanin underlined the ambitious nature of the project. It “goes beyond purely technical issues,” he said, “and has the potential to change long-established methods of planning and production, to meet current and future challenges of climate change and biodiversity conservation.”
Rakhmanin elaborated on FAO’s recent approach of “increasing its work on integrated and cross-sectoral approaches to address horizontal topics,” such as climate change and biodiversity, land tenure and gender.
Branislav Nedimović, Serbia’s Minister of Agriculture and Environmental Protection, was also a keynote speaker at today’s event.
Forests cover approximately 35 percent of Serbia’s national territory.
FAO’s acknowledged expertise and long experience in forestry make the GEF-funded project a natural next step in the right direction. Serbian authorities collaborated with FAO experts in the project’s preparatory phase.
The National Forest Inventory should be transformed by 2020 into an integrated national forest assessment and monitoring tool, fit to handle evolving needs. It should provide consolidated and standardized data, available to the public as well as to government entities. The project also includes a training element targeting forestry administration, institutions, and even forest users.
The Global Environment Facility is an important resource partner of FAO. The two organizations have worked together all over the world, including in Turkey, Central Asia and the Balkans – on areas such as climate change mitigation, and sustainable use of natural resources, especially land.

Title: Human Rights Day 2016: Stand Up for Someone’s Rights Today!
Content: 10 December 2016
BELGRADE, 10 December 2016 - On the occasion of Human Rights Day 2016, the United Nations Country Team in Serbia, the Council of Europe Office in Belgrade, and the OSCE Mission to Serbia take the opportunity to recall our commitment to equal dignity and rights for all.
As elsewhere, the health, vibrancy and resilience of Serbian society depend on human solidarity and mutual understanding. Respect for pluralism and the celebration of diversity enrich democracy and strengthen society.
Legitimate and mutually-recognising democratic institutions; an efficient and independent judiciary; independent, pluralist and responsible media; freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of association; and inclusive societies constitute the fundamental building blocks of democratic security. Participation in democracy makes society dynamic and better able to counter new challenges.
Pluralism, broad-mindedness and a genuine commitment to advancing equality are fundamental to development. The protection and promotion of human rights defenders, as well as the inclusion of vulnerable groups, are intrinsic to human rights-based democracies.
A range of forces including those resulting from xenophobia, racism, populism, and other forms of intolerance pose real threats now to human rights.
We stand side-by-side with Serbia’s institutions and its people in building and maintaining a strong and vibrant democracy. International human rights law and standards provide the basis for these efforts.
We call on all people to stand up for someone’s rights today.   Without concerted action to uphold human rights close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the wider world. It is only through common efforts and solidarity that human rights will prevail.

Title: Universal Children’s Day: A wake-up call on child rights violations
Content: 20 November 2016
Despite enormous progress realized for children since the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, the rights of millions of children are being violated every day
Belgrade, Serbia, 20 November 2016 – Despite enormous progress realized for children since the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, the rights of millions of children are being violated every day, UNICEF said today as it marked Universal Children’s Day.
“With conflicts, crises, and crushing poverty putting millions of children’s lives and futures at risk, protecting child rights is more urgent than ever – and a critical key to building stronger, more stable societies,” said Michel Saint-Lot, UNICEF Representative in Serbia. “We need to stop these violations by investing more in reaching the most vulnerable children, or pay the price in slower growth, greater inequality, and less stability.”
The former Yugoslavia was among the first countries to sign and ratify the Convention in 1990, and the Republic of Serbia, through succession, has taken upon itself the obligations arising from the Convention. The world’s most rapidly and widely ratified human rights treaty, the CRC sets out a basic, universal standard for a healthy, protected, decent childhood for every human being.
Since ratification, despite the difficulties faced in the last two and a half decades, Serbia has managed to translate many of the legal provisions of the Convention into practice, relying on existing infrastructure, services and professionals in the fields of social welfare, education, and health care available to most children in Serbia.
However, there are still significant obstacles to be overcome in order to ensure that every child can enjoy his or her rights to grow and develop to their full potential. There is insufficient implementation of legal provisions into practice, protection services are not available to all children, there is widespread discriminatory attitudes towards children who do not belong to the majority population, and there is still insufficiently developed and strengthened civil society and an absence of coordination mechanisms between ministries at the national, and institutions at the local level.
In Serbia[1]:
• Children and families with more than two children are the most affected by poverty, 30% of them are at risk of poverty.
• There is a deterioration of the nutritional status among the poorest children, 14% of whom are stunted, while 10% of children under five years old from Roma settlements are underweight.
• Only half of the poorest children aged 6-23 months receive at least 2 milk feeds per day.
• The infant mortality rate among children in Roma settlements is almost twice as high when compared to the national average.
• Only half of Serbia’s children attend any kind of early learning programmes - only 9% of the poorest children and 6% of children from Roma settlements aged 3-5 are attending kindergartens, compared to 82% of children from the richest households.
• 1 in 4 children younger than two years old are physically punished and almost 40% of children aged 10-14 years old are exposed to violent methods of discipline.
• There is still a widespread belief (52% of the population) that it is better for children with physical or sensory disabilities to attend special schools, while 68% of respondents think the same for children with intellectual disabilities.
Despite marked progress for children globally in recent decades, nearly six million children still die every year from preventable causes – and children from poor households are twice as likely as children from wealthier homes to die before reaching their fifth birthdays.
Nearly 50 million children have been uprooted - 28 million of them displaced by conflict. Children trapped in besieged areas – including Syria, Iraq, and northern Nigeria are at greater risk of having their rights violated, with their schools, hospitals and homes under attack. Globally, around 250 million live in countries affected by conflict.
Almost 385 million children live in extreme poverty and over a quarter of a billion school-aged children are not learning. Nearly 300 million children live in areas with the most toxic levels of outdoor air pollution – six or more times higher than international guidelines.
Next month UNICEF will mark 70 years of working to bring life-saving aid, long-term support and hope to children whose lives and futures are endangered by conflict, crises, poverty, inequality and discrimination. To mark the occasion, UNICEF in Serbia is organizing a Telethon, with Prva Television, to showcase UNICEF’s work in the country and to raise funds for programmes that UNICEF is implementing for the children of Serbia.
“Every child has the right to grow up healthy and strong, to be educated and protected, and to have a fair chance in life,” said Michel Saint-Lot. “Our commitment to child rights must be matched with action for every child."

Title: UN strengthens its support to Serbia hosting refugees and migrants in winter
Content: 28 October 2016
Belgrade, 28 October 2016 – Marking the UN Week, the UN Country Team and the Government of Serbia invited for a special brief on the refugee and migration situation in Serbia.  The Team of UN agencies reaffirmed its commitments to strongly promote and support additional humanitarian, developmental, budgetary, coordination and political support to allow the Government of Serbia to implement its Response Plan as well as the commitments of the recently adopted New York Declaration.
In 2015, the UN Country Team supported the Government of Serbia with activities in coordination, registration, protection, counter-trafficking, anti-smuggling, shelter, sanitary and other infrastructure, non-food and food aid, health for refugees/migrants as well as support to the public services that assist refugees and migrants and the local communities that host them at the amount of around 1 billion dinars (9.1m USD). Similar assistance extended to date in 2016 amounts to 855 million dinars (8.6m USD).
“The UN Country Team in Serbia stands ready to further increase this support to enhance a sustained lawful and protection sensitive management of the refugee and migration situation, and challenges of irregular migration, to help in addressing forthcoming winter needs, including contingency planning in Serbia. The team will also continue advocating for strong support to Serbia by other donors, including those who are able to provide direct budgetary support to the Government, which UN Agencies are not allowed to furnish” said Irena Vojackova Sollorano, UN Resident Coordinator to Serbia.
During the last months the number of new refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers in Serbia has stabilized at around 6,300, 80% of whom are accommodated in Governmental centres. With the onset of colder weather, UN Agencies and partners have also stepped up their distribution of winter clothes as well as support to the creation of adequate shelter places and conditions for longer–term stay in winter.
“UN Agencies in Serbia welcomed Serbia’s overall humane, lawful and positive management of the refugee and migration situation during 2015 and remain committed to strongly support a continuation thereof during 2016. The transit situation of 2015 has changed to longer-term stay, which obliges us to redouble our efforts in supporting the adaptation of governmental policy and authorities’ approaches. The legal status and services accessible to refugees and migrants as well as our support to public services and local communities that host refugees and migrants must be adjusted to their long-term stay in winter. UN Agencies continue to call on authorities to allow due access to territory and protection for those refugees and migrants who need it and to abstain from unlawful expulsions. We are determined to support the Government to resume comprehensive registration and documentation of all refugees and migrants in Serbia to better understand and address their individual motivations, needs, rights and obligations. We also praise citizens’ overall welcoming and understanding attitude to refugees and migrants“ – said Mr Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative.
As called for in the New York Declaration*, and in line with the global UN Secretary-General’s campaign called 'Together – Respect, Safety and Dignity for All', UN representatives announced the localization of the campaign to help the Government in maintaining public sympathy for the plight  of refugees and migrants.
Consolidated efforts in assisting Serbia’s responds to the current refugee and migration situation by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN WOMEN), the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the World Food Programme (WFP) continue to be coordinated by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

Belgrade, 27-October-2016 Serbia today celebrates the 10th anniversary of the entry-into-force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT). The OPCAT is the premiere international legal instrument on the prevention of torture and related negative treatment.
The OPCAT was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2002.   It entered into force in 2006.   Serbia ratified the OPCAT treaty in 2006. In 2011, Serbia established a National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) against torture, as specified by the OPCAT. The NPM carries out site visits to places of detention and undertakes other work aimed at ending all forms of torture and related degrading treatment.
The anniversary was celebrated at a public event in Belgrade, convened by the Serbian Protector of Citizens (Ombuds institution) and the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Serbia, with the support from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Speaking at the event, Deputy Ombudsperson and NPM Coordinator Milos Jankovic said, “The OPCAT and the National Preventive Mechanism against torture have repeatedly proven their importance and effectiveness in the work of ending torture and degrading treatment once and for all.”
On the occasion of the OPCAT anniversary, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Serbia Irena Vojackova-Sollorano said, “The OPCAT is an excellent example of how international human rights law can bring about positive change for people in real, tangible ways.”

Title: Strengthening health sector response to gender based violence
Content: 06 October 2016
Belgrade, 6 October 2016 - More than half of adult women in Serbia were exposed to some form of domestic violence during their lifetime. This is one of the devastating statistics mentioned today in Belgrade at opening of the training health sector response to gender based violence.
“Not only that gender based violence is a human rights violations, it is also one of the biggest public health concerns world wide”, stated Ms Marija Rakovic, Programme Coordinator at UNFPA in Serbia. “Gender based violence undermines women’s health, and as such it can have severe consequences to sexual and reproductive health of women”.
9% of women in Serbia who suffered physical or sexual violence rated their health as poor or very poor compared to 4% of never-abused women. Women who had ever been pregnant and who suffered partner violence had more abortions (65% versus 46%) and were more likely to have had a child who died (5% versus 2%)[1] .
Dr Vesna Knjeginjic, Assistant Minister at the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Serbia greeted the participants and emphasized the importance of these type of educations. “Health care providers have encountered cases of gender based violence so far, and, unfortunately, they will continue to see these cases in their daily practice. Therefore, it is important that we continue strengthening their capacities to provide adequate response within their professional responsibilities “.
“We should also be aware that the health sector is a critical entry point for identifying violence, providing medical care to women and girls survivors and referring them to other essential services, such as shelters, counselling centers or specialized medical care. For many survivors of violence, a visit to a health professional is the first, and sometimes only, step enabling them to access support and care”, adds Ms. Rakovic.
Dr Stanislava Otašević from the Center for Women's Health Promotion announced that the goal of such events among other things, is to send a message to the citizens that health care institutions are a place where they can openly talk about the violence and that health workers document the existence of violence and its consequences. Health care workers are obliged to respect the confidentiality of statements and feelings of the patient, and provide unbiased assistance and conduct an assessment together with the woman to find out what are their rights while addressing the police, social welfare centers and other institutions that are required to protect them. "Most importantly, women have the right to require that the health worker reports violence to be protected," added Dr. Otašević.
The training program is the result of cooperation and partnership of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Centre for the Promotion of Women's Health, to improve the knowledge and skills of health workers in Serbia that directly provide health services or health managersof whose good and harmonious cooperation depends promotion and improvement of the health system response to gender-based violence.

Title: “The Road to 2030: Eradicating Poverty and Achieving Sustainable Production and Consumption”- topic of this year’s International Youth Day
Content: 12 August 2016
The  International Youth Day will be marked by UNFPA in the spirit of reaffirmation and recognition of the central role of young people in promoting the well-being of their families, communities and nations.
Belgrade, 12 August 2016 - The  International Youth Day will be marked by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in the spirit of reaffirmation and recognition of the central role of young people in promoting the well-being of their families, communities and nations.
This year’s theme, “The Road to 2030: Eradicating Poverty and Achieving Sustainable Production and Consumption”, couldn’t be more relevant and timely, states UNFPA Executive Director, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin. “Globally, large youth populations represent a historic opportunity to introduce progress and adopt innovative solutions to ignite this change. Central to the efforts of realizing youth potential must be the promotion of access to education, health services, including sexual and reproductive health and family planning. These combined interventions are critical in order to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty, strengthen the resilience of populations in the face of all challenges and seize the opportunities of the new economy”, adds Dr. Osotimehin.
When it comes to youth reproductive health in our country, based on the experience from direct assistance, many young people have no basic knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of reproduction, and that their knowledge of contraception and sexually transmitted infections is scarce and burdened with prejudices.
Ms. Marija Rakovic, Programme Coordinator at UNFPA Serbia, explains that the most common sources of information for youth are peers, the media and internet.  “Having in mind the growing use of internet and mobile devices by youth today, we must rely on these resources in order to reach youth and help them achieve their full potential,” adds Rakovic.
Therefore, as in previous years, Centar E8 is organizing an event to celebrate International Youth Day, in order to draw attention of the general public on the importance of young people, their problems and the need and to encourage their active participation in the society. This year with the support of UNFPA, as part of the PaziSe(x) project, Centar E8 will organize activities related to sexual reproductive health and try to increase awareness about the importance of protection. The promotion and education on sexual reproductive health is extremelly important especially because young people, between 13 and 19 years, become sexually mature. Therefore, it is extremely important to have forhand and adequate information in order to protect themselves from threatening behaviors and in the safest way to set foot in a sexually mature age without consequences. The event will take place at Ada Ciganlija between 16-19 pm at the beginning of the promenade in object of JP "Ada Ciganlija". Team of trainers will animate visitors which will include taking pictures in  PaziSe(x) photo booth, raising awareness on sexually transmitted diseases, protection from unwanted pregnancy, etc.

Title: EU and UNICEF widen partnership to better protect child rights in South-East Europe
Content: 04 August 2016
GENEVA/ BRUSSELS, 4 August 2016 – The European Union (EU) and UNICEF have broadened an important regional partnership that aims to protect children from violence and better include children with disabilities into society.
Since 2011, UNICEF and the EU have been working together with countries currently in the process of joining the EU, such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Turkey. This partnership is now expanding to include Kosovo, Montenegro, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
As of this year, the European Disability Forum (EDF) has joined the partnership.
Violence is a daily reality for thousands of children across southeastern Europe. Data shows that more than 50 per cent of boys and girls aged 2-14 (and in some countries, more than 70 per cent) were exposed to at least one form of physical or psychological severe punishment by family members. Many children still find it extremely difficult to speak to outsiders when violence occurs within the family, let alone to seek protection and redress.
The situation of children with disabilities is even more complicated: they are often separated from their families, overrepresented in residential institutions, kept out of schools and are excluded from every day public life. They face prejudice, stigma and severe discrimination.
Many are "invisible" – they are not represented in official data. They are also nearly four times more likely to experience violence.
The EU and UNICEF are contributing 5.89 million Euros – of which 5 million Euros come from the EU – for this regional partnership over the next three years, and have pledged to continue strongly advocating for each and every child to be protected from all forms of violence and to be an equal member of society. ”We believe that this partnership can make a real difference to the life of children in the region. We rely on UNICEF's and EDF's expertise and knowledge to influence policies that have an impact on children who are victims of violence and children with disabilities. At the same time, it is crucial to reach out to civil society and grass-root organizations working on child protection and to promote children inclusion in societies. Therefore, a large part of the funding will be devoted to support small civil society organizations to achieve real change and sustainable improvements of children's daily life and future perspective,” said Johannes Hahn, EU Commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations.
The partnership will contribute to improving coordination for multi-sectoral responses to violence against children. Key professionals will get better data, innovative tools, knowledge and the mechanisms to prevent or respond to violence, abuse and neglect and to narrow the social distance between children with and without disabilities. ”Each case of violence against children is one too many. It places their lives, health, safety, education and future at risk, and can mark them for life. We must speak out against violence and discrimination. It is unacceptable to use violence against children, especially against children who are the most vulnerable. We must find effective national and community-based solutions to protect the rights of all children and help seek redress for each and every child,” said Marie-Pierre Poirier, Regional Director and Special Coordinator for Refugee and Migrant Crisis in Europe.
Disability Persons Organizations including children with disabilities themselves will play a more vocal and active role in monitoring and influencing policies equal rights and social inclusion of children with disabilities. ”It is critical that children with disabilities are included all actions to tackle violence against children. This initiative is also very important in that it seeks to build the capacity and the involvement of organizations of persons with disabilities and other members of the civil society. EDF is happy to partner with UNICEF and the EU, to help make the rights of children with disabilities a reality in the region, as we aim to do in our work in Europe and globally,” said Yannis Vardakastanis, President of the European Disability Forum.

Title: General Assembly decision makes International Organization for Migration part of UN system
Content: 25 July 2016
25 July 2016 – The United Nations General Assembly today unanimously adopted a resolution approving an agreement to make the International Organization for Migration (IOM) part of the UN system as a related organization.
“Migration is at the heart of the new global political landscape and its social and economic dynamics. At a time of growing levels of migration within and across borders, a closer legal and working relationship between the United Nations and IOM is needed more than ever,”said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement welcoming the Assembly's decision.
IOM, which assisted an estimated 20 million migrants in 2015, is an intergovernmental organization with more than 9,500 staff and 450 offices worldwide. Founded in the wake of the World War II to resettle refugees from Europe, the organization celebrates its 65th anniversary in December of this year.
Highlighting that the approval of the agreement by the governing bodies of both organizations marks a “major milestone in the long-standing and close relationship” between the UN and IOM, the Secretary-General added that the relationship agreement not only formalizes this partnership, but also sets out an even closer cooperation between the two organizations while preserving the mandates and responsibilities of other UN organizations and subsidiary organs and agencies in the field of migration.
“The Secretary-General trusts that the relationship agreement will contribute to a more effective global response to the challenges posed by large and sudden population movements. It will help to strengthen the support provided by the United Nations system to Member States in implementing the migration-related elements of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” the statement said.
The agreement outlines a closer relationship between the 65-year-old IOM and the UN to strengthen cooperation and enhance their ability to fulfil their respective mandates in the interest of migrants and Member States.
“The United Nations and the International Organization for Migration, recognizing the need to work jointly to achieve mutual objectives, and with a view to facilitating the effective exercise of their responsibilities, agree to cooperate closely within their respective mandates and to consult on matters of mutual interest and concern,” said the adopted resolution.
For his part, IOM Director General William Lacy said that the Assembly's decision to approve the agreement shows the growing strength of the relationship between IOM and the UN.
“We are living in a time of much tragedy and uncertainty. This agreement shows Member States' commitment to more humane and orderly migration that benefits all, where we celebrate the human beings behind the numbers,” he said in a press release.
“This is an historic day, not only for IOM and the UN, but for migrants and their families across the globe,” he added.
Through the agreement, the UN recognizes IOM as an “indispensable actor in the field of human mobility,” IOM said, adding that this includes protection of migrants and displaced people in migration-affected communities, as well as in areas of refugee resettlement and voluntary returns, and incorporates migration in country development plans.
“IOM has worked closely with the UN since our foundation at both operational and policy levels. IOM Member States recognize IOM as the global lead agency on migration. And now, becoming a part of the UN family will give IOM a vital voice at the UN table to advocate for migrants and their rights worldwide,” said Mr. Swing.
Today's action paves the way for the agreement to be signed by Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon and Mr. Swing at the UN Summit for refugees and migrants on 19 September, which will bring together UN Member States to address large movements of refugees and migrants for more humane and coordinated approach.
IOM was granted Permanent Observer status to the UN General Assembly in 1992, and a cooperation agreement between IOM and the UN was signed in 1996.
Recognizing the ned to establish a closer relationship between the two organizations, the General Assembly earlier this year requested Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to take steps to conclude an agreement in that regard. The UN chiefs' draft agreement, which formed the basis of today's Assembly text, was approved by the Council of the IOM on 30 June.

Title: Investing in teenage girls - topic of this year’s World Population Day
Content: 11 July 2016
Belgrade, 11 July 2016 - Since the World Population Day was established in 1989, the United Nations marked it with the aim of raising awareness on the important issues of population, family planning, gender equality, poverty, reproductive health and human rights, all in the context of sustainable development.
As the theme of this year's World Population Day is investing in teenage girls, United Nations Population Fund reminds that teenage girls around the world face more and greater challenges than their male counterparts. In many countries, a girl who reaches puberty is deemed by her family and community as ready for marriage, pregnancy and childbirth.
“Without education, in poor health, and with little or no control over her own body, her future can be derailed, and her potential may never be realized. The challenges and obstacles faced by a teenage girl multiply if she is a member of an ethnic minority, lives in a village or is from a poor household, which is partly the case in Serbia "said Dr Doina Bologa, UNFPA Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Country Director for Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Director for Kosovo[1].
Adolescent girls in Serbia are less likely to use contraception than older women, and they have limited knowledge in the area of sexual and reproductive health. The rate of child marriage among the general population in Serbia is low; however, prevalence rates of child marriage are much higher among the Roma population of Serbia. According to the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey- MICS (2014), every two in five young women age 15-19 years in Roma settlements (43 percent) are currently married or in union;  while staggering 17 percent of women age 15-49 were married before age 15. Young married Roma women also face domestic violence, not only from their husbands, but also from their in-laws. This is exemplified by the fact that 37 percent of women in Roma settlements feel that a husband/partner is justified in hitting or beating his wife if a wife neglects the children, if she argues with her husband, if the wife refuses to have sex with the husband and similar situations.
“The new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is, thus, an unprecedented opportunity for teenage girls to claim their rights, realize their aspirations and transform our world. When a teenage girl has the power, the means and the information to make her own decisions in life, she is more likely to realize her full potential and become a positive force for change in her home, community and nation. This is why UNFPA in Serbia supports development and implementation of policies and programmes that incorporate the rights and needs of adolescents and youth “, adds Ms. Marija Rakovic, Programme Coordinator at UNFPA Office in Serbia.

Title: Lessons Learned in Securing the Human Rights of Migrants and Refugees
Content: 20 June 2016
Subotica, 20 June 2016 - Government, civil society, the Serbian Ombuds institution, and members of the UN family gathered today for three days of Chatham House discussions of lessons learned in securing the human rights of migrants and refugees on the Balkan Land Route.
The months since the beginning of 2015 – and in particular the very significantly heightened arrival of migrants and refugees along the Balkan land route -- have tested Serbia’s ability to provide effective protection and inclusion to persons fully outside the polity, as well as to mobilize international support for these efforts.   Systems including refugee protection, health response, psycho-social support and trauma response, child protection, security, and the ability to provide basic shelter and sanitation have all been tested.   New balances in service-provision between state and civil society have also taken shape.    These system-wide responses are relevant in the given circumstances for the protection, inclusion and human rights of migrants and refugees, but they also offer wider lessons for Serbia’s human rights protection and social inclusion systems.
The thematic roundtable convened in Subotica provided a platform for Chatham House discussion of lessons learned, around several key thematic bands, including refugee protection and inclusion, the rights of migrants in an irregular situations, protection from gender-based violence, the rights of the child, and trauma response and psycho-social counselling.
The event has been convened by the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Social and Veterans Policy, together with the Office of the United Nations High Commisioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the civil society organization International Aid Network (IAN).  Participants included a broad segments of Government civil society and UNCT Serbia, as well as the Serbian Ombuds institution. Partial funding was also provided by the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.

Title: World Refugee Day 2016 - With 1 human in every 113 affected, forced displacement hits record high
Content: 20 June 2016
20-June-2016 Conflict and persecution caused global forced displacement to escalate sharply in 2015 reaching the highest level ever recorded and representing immense human suffering, according to a report released today by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.
UNHCR`s annual Global Trends report, which tracks forced displacement worldwide based on data from governments, partners including the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, and the organization`s own reporting, said 65.3 million people were displaced as of the end of 2015, compared to 59.5 million just twelve months earlier. This is the first time that the threshold of 60 million has been crossed.
The total of 65.3 million comprises 3.2 million people in industrialized countries who as of end 2015 were awaiting decisions on asylum (the largest total UNHCR has recorded), 21.3 million refugees worldwide (1.8 million more than in 2014 and the highest refugee total since the early 1990s), and 40.8 million people who had been forced to flee their homes but were within the confines of their own countries (an increase of 2.6 million from 2014 and the highest number on record).
Measured against Earth`s 7.349 billion population these numbers mean that 1 in every 113 people globally is now either an asylum-seeker, internally displaced or a refugee – a level of risk for which UNHCR knows no precedent. In all, there are more forcibly displaced people today than the populations of the United Kingdom, France or Italy.
Forced displacement has been on the rise since at least the mid-1990s in most regions, but over the past five years the rate of climb has increased. The reasons are threefold: Situations that cause large refugee outflows are lasting longer (for example, conflicts in Somalia or Afghanistan are now into their third and fourth decades, respectively), dramatic new or reignited situations are occurring frequently (today`s largest being Syria, but also in the space of the past five years South Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Ukraine, Central African Republic etc.), and the rate at which solutions are being found for refugees and internally displaced people has been on a falling trend since the end of the Cold War. As recently as 10 years ago, at the end of 2005, UNHCR recorded an average of 6 people displaced every minute. Today that number is 24 a minute – almost double the typical frequency at which adults breathe.
“More people are being displaced by war and persecution and that`s worrying in itself, but the factors that endanger refugees are multiplying too,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. “At sea, a frightening number of refugees and migrants are dying each year; on land, people fleeing war are finding their way blocked by closed borders. Politics is gravitating against asylum in some countries. The willingness of nations to work together not just for refugees but for the collective human interest is what`s being tested today, and it`s this spirit of unity that badly needs to prevail.”
3 countries produce half the world`s refugees…
Among countries covered by the Global Trends report several stand out: Syria at 4.9 million, Afghanistan at 2.7 million and Somalia at 1.1 million together accounted for more than half the refugees under UNHCR`s mandate worldwide. Colombia at 6.9 million, Syria at 6.6 million, and Iraq at 4.4 million meanwhile had the largest numbers of internally displaced people. Yemen was the biggest producer of new internal displacement in 2015 – 2.5 million people, or 9 per cent of its population.
…And they`re mostly in the Global South
Europe`s struggles to manage the more than one million refugees and migrants who arrived via the Mediterranean dominated the attentions of many in 2015, nonetheless the report shows that the vast majority of the world`s refugees were elsewhere. In all, 86 per cent of refugees under UNHCR`s mandate in 2015 were in low and middle income countries close to situations of conflict. This figure rises to over 90 per cent of the world`s refugee total if the Palestinian refugees under the responsibility of UNHCR`s sister-organization UNRWA are included. Worldwide, Turkey was the biggest host country with 2.5 million refugees. Lebanon, meanwhile hosted more refugees compared to its population than any other country (183 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants). Relative to the size of its economy the Democratic Republic of the Congo hosted most (471 refugees for every dollar of per capita GDP, measured at price purchasing parity).
Asylum claims rise
Among industrialized countries, 2015 was also a record year for new asylum claims, with two million requests (contributing to the 3.2 million cases still pending as of the end of the year). Germany received more asylum requests than any other country (441,900), largely reflecting its readiness to receive people who were fleeing to Europe via the Mediterranean. The United States had the second highest number of asylum claims (172,700), many of these individuals fleeing gang-related violence in Central America. Substantial asylum applications were also seen in Sweden (156,000) and Russia (152,500).
About half the world`s refugees are children
Children constituted 51 per cent of the world`s refugees in 2015 according to the data UNHCR was able to gather (complete demographic data was not available to the report authors). Worryingly, many were separated from their parents or travelling alone. In all there were 98,400 asylum requests from children who were unaccompanied or separated from their families. This is the highest total UNHCR has seen - and a tragic reflection of how global forced displacement is disproportionately affecting young lives.
Unable to go home
While global displacement totals were higher than ever, the number of people able to return to their home or find another solution (local integration in a country of first refuge or resettlement elsewhere) was low. 201,400 refugees were able to return to their countries of origin in 2015 (mainly Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia). This was higher than the total in 2014 (126,800), but still substantially down compared with the peaks of the early 1990s. Some 107,100 refugees were admitted for resettlement in 30 countries in 2015 – representing just 0.66 per cent of the refugees under UNHCR`s mandate (by comparison, 26 countries admitted 105,200 refugees for resettlement in 2014, representing 0.73 per cent of the refugee population under UNHCR care). At least 32,000 refugees became naturalized over the course of the year, the majority in Canada and with smaller numbers in France, Belgium, Austria and elsewhere.
Displacement in 2015, by region (from highest to lowest)
1. Middle East and North Africa
Syria`s war remained the world`s leading cause of displacement and associated suffering. By the end of 2015 it had driven at least 4.9 million people into exile as refugees and displaced 6.6 million internally – amounting to around half Syria`s pre-war population. Iraq`s conflict had by year`s end displaced 4.4 million people internally and created more than a quarter of a million refugees. Yemen`s civil war, which began in 2015, had by the end of December displaced 2.5 million people - more new displacement than any other conflict globally. Including the 5.2 million Palestinian refugees under the mandate of UNRWA, the almost half a million Libyans forced to flee their homes and remaining in the country, plus a number of smaller situations, the Middle East and North Africa region accounted for more displacement than any other.
2. Sub-Saharan Africa
Sub-Saharan Africa had the largest displacement totals in 2015 after the Middle East and North Africa. Continuing bitter conflict in South Sudan in 2015, as well as in Central African Republic and Somalia, plus new or continuing mass displacement in or from countries including Nigeria, Burundi, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique and elsewhere together produced 18.4 million refugees and internally displaced people as of year`s end. Sub-Saharan Africa meanwhile hosted some 4.4 million refugees in all – more than any other region. Five of the world`s top-10 hosting nations were African countries, led by Ethiopia, and followed by Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Chad.
3. Asia and Pacific
The Asia and Pacific region accounted for almost a sixth of the world`s refugees and internally displaced people in 2015, making it the third largest region for displacement overall. One in six of the refugees under UNHCR`s mandate were from Afghanistan (2.7 million people) where almost 1.2 million people were internally displaced. Myanmar was the region`s second largest producer of both refugees and internally displaced people (451,800 and 451,000 respectively). Pakistan (1.5 million) and Islamic Republic of Iran (979,000) remain among the world`s leading refugee hosting countries.
4. Americas
Rising numbers of people fleeing gang and other violence in Central America contributed to a 17 per cent rise in displacement across the wider region. Refugees and asylum seekers from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras together reached 109,800, most coming to Mexico and the United States and representing a more than five-fold increase over three years. Colombia, a longstanding situation, remained the world`s biggest country for internal displacement (6.9 million).
5. Europe
The situation in Ukraine, Europe`s proximity to Syria and Iraq, plus the arrival of more than a million refugees and migrants via the Mediterranean mostly from the world`s top ten refugee-producing countries, together dominated the region`s displacement picture in 2015. European countries together produced some 593,000 refugees - most from Ukraine; and hosted 4.4 million – 2.5 million of these in Turkey. Figures provided by the Government of Ukraine list 1.6 million Ukrainians as being displaced there. The Global Trends report lists 441,900 asylum claims in Germany, where the refugee population increased by 46 per cent from its 2014 level to 316,000.

Title: UNHCR and partners revise funding needs for Greece & Balkans
Content: 10 June 2016
This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson William Spindler – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at the press briefing, on 10 June 2016, at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
Geneva, 10-June-2016 Today we are launching an update of the regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) involving 60 partner organizations and covering the eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route. The RMRP has been revised to take into account the new circumstances on the ground following border closures along the Western Balkans route, and the entry into force of the EU-Turkey agreement.
These developments have had a significant impact on the numbers of refugees and migrants arriving, with a decrease in the number of people along the Western Balkans route and an increase in the number of people remaining in Greece. While the measures adopted have significantly reduced the number of arrivals in Greece, over 57,000  refugees and migrants are currently dispersed across the country in several sites on the mainland and the islands.
In this context, UNHCR and humanitarian partners have redefined their engagement from a response primarily targeting people on the move, to focusing on a static population in Greece and on protection activities in countries in the Western Balkans .
The financial requirements to implement the plan have been adjusted to reflect the change in circumstances. They currently stand at almost 670 million US dollars for 2016, of which contributions of 328.8 million US dollars have been received.
Unmet needs remain significant, as living conditions in the sites in Greece, both on the islands and the mainland, have deteriorated as a result of congestion and the rapid nature in which sites were established on the mainland. The affected population includes many people with specific needs, such as unaccompanied or separated children, single women, pregnant or lactating women, the elderly, people with disabilities, as well as the sick and injured. The number of children in these movements has been on the rise, reaching 38 per cent of the total arrivals from Turkey to Greece in 2016. There is a risk that these people will increasingly rely on smuggling and trafficking networks, exposing themselves to greater protection risks, which will be even more challenging to address considering the clandestine nature of the movement.
The regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP), was launched in January 2016 following the large-scale population movements registered throughout Europe in 2015, when 1 million refugees and migrants undertook the perilous journey across the Mediterranean Sea. The vast majority crossed the Aegean Sea by boat from Turkey to Greece. Many lost their lives: in total, 3,771 people died or were reported missing in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015. Despite worsening weather conditions brought on by the onset of winter, the movements did not subside during the first five months of 2016, with some 200,000 arrivals by sea from January to May 2016, including over 150,000 to Greece.

Title: UNHCR: Number of persons at risk of statelessness in Serbia reduced by half
Content: 07 June 2016
Belgrade, 7 June 2016 – Over the last four years the number of “legally invisible” Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians (RAE) has more than halved according to a survey “Persons at risk of statelessness in Serbia – Progress Report 2010-2015” released by the UN Refugee Agency, today.
“We are pleased to see the progress made since April 2012 when the Ministry for Public Administration and Local Self Government, the Ombudsman of the Republic of Serbia and the UN Refugee Agency signed a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding, aiming to tackle the statelessness issue in Serbia,” said Hans Friedrich Schodder, Representative of UNHCR in Serbia.
REA communities, MOU signatories, other relevant ministries and authorities, as well as civil society together have made significant progress in enacting positive legislative changes as well as harmonized, simplified procedures in the area of birth registration and registration of residence.
The survey, conducted by SeCons in September-October 2015 involved close to 2,000 housesholds (almost 9,000 persons) in 154 RAE settlements of in 77 municipalities of Serbia. Presenting its findings, Professor Slobodan Cvejić also made recommendations towards adoption and implementation of systemic solutions and full participation of the Roma community.
“We can celebrate successful conclusion of the MOU at the end of this year, and remain committed to continue cooperation to ensure implementation of all the important recommendations of this survey so that each and every newborn baby in Serbia, including those with parents of undetermined nationality, receives a birth-certificate,” added Schodder. For this purpose, the UN Refugee Agency today announced the donation of 16 computers to birth registry offices within the project “Welcome Baby to the World”.
“The Government of the Republic of Serbia has paid particular attention to statelessness over the recent years. The Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the line ministry, UNHCR Representation in Serbia and Ombudsman just over four years ago and it served as a framework for identification and implementation of the most efficient solutions to resolve this problem. Our objective is to allow for registration of newborn babies into the birth registries though their parents may be “legally invisible”, i.e. not in possession of a personal document or a birth certificate, and thus prevent new cases of statelessness. I wish to thank UNHCR for their donation of computers which will significantly simplify the work of the registry offices. Even though the MOU expires next year, I am sure that our successful cooperation will continue beyond that time,“ said Kori Udovički, Minister of Public Administration and Local Self Government.
Said Robert Sepi, Deputy Ombudsman of the Republic of Serbia “The number of “legally invisible” persons has decreased substantially thanks to the Memorandum of Understanding. Most importantly, the initiative of the Ombudsman for changes and amendments of the Law on Non-Contentious Procedure was adopted whereby the persons with no civil status recognized were allowed to register in the birth registries. It is very important that the facts and data related to birth, citizenship, personal name and registration of habitual residence at the address of social welfare centres be registered in good time”.
By submitting legal initiatives, organizing visits and campaigns in Roma settlements and capacity building of civil servants, the Ombudsman consistently advocated for adoption of fundamental values that are at core of civilization - recognition of civil status of “legally invisible” persons, so that they may avail themselves of the basic rights provided for in the Constitution and the laws just as all the other citizens.
The Ombudsman welcomes all the joint activities of international organisations, state authorities and independent institutions that recognize the significance of protection and advancement of human rights as well as preservation of human dignity”

Worldwide, more than 10 million people suffer from the consequences of lack of nationality: denial of fundamental human rights to health, education, employment, identity documents. The key universal conventions addressing statelessness are the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. The Republic of Serbia is party to both.

Title: UNHCR alarmed at refugee death on Hungary-Serbia border
Content: 04 June 2016
Budapest, June 4, 2016 (UNHCR) – The UN Refugee Agency is alarmed at reports of the death of a Syrian refugee at the Hungary–Serbia border this week. UNHCR is seeking further details after being alerted about the death by the Hungarian Border Police. The man apparently drowned in the Tisza River after attempting to cross into Hungary from Serbia. He was allegedly with a larger group of refugees and migrants, who have said that they were pushed back, into the river.
Allegations of a push back from Hungary to Serbia in the early morning of 1 June emerged earlier this week after the Hungarian police rescued an Iraqi mother and her children from the Tisza River. Reports emerged that they had been part of a larger group, among them a 22 year old Syrian man had gone missing during the alleged push back. Yesterday, the Hungarian police (at the border town of Szeged) have reported the recovery of the body of the 22 year old Syrian man.
“The circumstances that led to this tragic death need to be swiftly and thoroughly investigated by the authorities on both sides of the border,” said Montserrat Feixas Vihe, UNHCR’s Regional Representative for Central Europe. “Instead of finding safety and sanctuary in Europe, a young man has tragically lost his life.’’
UNHCR remains concerned about the increasing number of allegations of abuse in Hungary against asylum-seekers and migrants by border authorities, and the broader restrictive border and legislative measures, including access to asylum procedures. These include the erection of a fence along Hungary’s borders with Serbia and Croatia, the criminalisation of irregular entry into Hungary through the border fence, and the closing down of asylum reception facilities, limiting access to proper accommodation. UNHCR detailed such measures and practices, implemented in Hungary between July 2015 and March 2016, in our 12 May report, Hungary as a Country of Asylum, and the effect of restricting and deterring access to asylum in the country and, shrinking the protection space, and raising serious concerns regarding compatibility with international and European Union (EU) law.
Since May, UNHCR staff and partners have collected information on over 100 cases with disturbing allegations of excessive use of force as people try to cross the border. More evidence is emerging that Hungary’s restrictive policy of admitting only 15-17 asylum-seekers daily at the two transit zones (at Roszke and Tompa –established in September 2015) is forcing desperate people into the hands of smugglers and towards alternative, irregular and often dangerous routes. Currently, there are several hundred asylum-seekers waiting to access asylum procedures in Hungary at the transit zones – the majority of them are women and children.
“Sadly it seems that push-backs and barriers to protection leave people with little choice but to put their lives in the hands of ruthless smugglers, often with tragic consequences” UNHCR’s Feixas Vihe added.
UNHCR’s concerns of restrictive border practices and allegations of push backs have been raised with the Hungarian authorities, and UNHCR has offered its good services to the Government of Hungary to reduce the serious protection and humanitarian risks at the border. UNHCR continues to call on EU Member States to move away from restrictive and individualized measures, towards collective and comprehensive measures to ensure access to asylum, and protect people in need.

Title: $3.2 million GEF grant targets Serbian forests
Content: 13 April 2016
Serbia’s forests will benefit from a US$ 3.2 million grant just approved by the Council of the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The grant will finance a four-year FAO project aimed at long-term forest health through sustainable management.
Forestry is important for Serbia. Almost a third of the country’s territory is covered by forests, and the sector accounts for 2.3 percent of total gross domestic product. Yet, a national forest inventory in 2009 found forests overall to be in poor condition, with unfavourable structures, poor health, and lack of natural regeneration.
The FAO project will help Serbia revise its current development strategy and legislation concerning forests, incorporating sustainability objectives and modern principles of multifunctional forest management. Conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change will also become important considerations in forestry decision making.
For a smooth implementation of these principles, some 120 experts – forest users and representatives of forestry administration and institutes – will receive training from FAO on forest management including carbon, forest restoration, methods for controlling forest degradation, and related topics.
The first area to come under multifunctional forest management could be 80 000 hectares of land in the buffer zone of Tara Mountain National Park. An integrated sustainable forest management plan, to be developed and tested there, should increase forest cover by 5 percent, resulting in sequestration of 954,200 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. In carrying out these activities, FAO will be working in partnership with the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ).
Endorsement by the GEF Council clears the way for initial project activities to commence in the coming weeks. Initial activities will include a capacity needs assessment and development of the full-size project.

Title: Roma remain one of the most vulnerable groups, continue to face difficult living conditions and discrimination in access to social protection, health, employment and adequate housing
Content: 08 April 2016
Belgrade, 8-April-2016 - On the occasion of International Roma Day, the Delegation of the European Union to Serbia, the United Nations Country Team in Serbia, the OSCE Mission to Serbia and the Council of Europe Office in Belgrade reaffirm our strong commitment to equality and non-discrimination.
Today, the Romani community, Europe's largest ethnic minority, still experiences multiple discrimination and marginalisation in countries throughout Europe, including Serbia.  Roma remain one of the most vulnerable groups; they continue to face difficult living conditions and discrimination in access to social protection, health, employment and adequate housing, as stated in reports by both relevant international mechanisms and independent bodies of the Republic of Serbia.
Thousands of Roma represent the most vulnerable and marginalised among the population of internally displaced, still facing obstacles in accessing rights and durable solutions.
International and European human rights standards clearly provide for equality before the law and prohibit discrimination on all grounds, including ethnicity. The realisation of Roma inclusion will reinforce everyday democracy and the rule of law. It is the only way to reach a society based on the principle of equality of opportunity where everyone has the right to participate and to be heard.
On this day, we therefore call on all relevant stakeholders to pursue with determination Roma inclusion policies in Serbia, pursuant to the recent adoption of a new Strategy of Social Inclusion of Roma for the Period from 2016-2025 and the Action Plan for Realization of Rights of National Minorities by the Government of Serbia.
The Delegation of the European Union, the Council of Europe Office in Belgrade, the OSCE Mission to Serbia and the United Nations Country Team in Serbia remain committed to improving the lives of Roma in Serbia and ensuring that their fundamental rights are respected, and to supporting our Serbian partners in this endeavour.
International Roma Day is celebrated annually on April 8, in commemoration of the 1971 founding of the International Romani Union, the first major international Romani civic initiative.

Title: The Government of Japan and UNIQLO provide assistance to refugee children and families in Serbia
Content: 07 April 2016
Belgrade, 7 April 2016 – The Japanese company UNIQLO, as UNICEF’s global partner, has provided a total of 6,500 pieces of clothing to help refugee and migrant children in Serbia, some of which were distributed during the winter months. Today, in the Transit and Reception Centre for Refugees and Migrants in Adaševci, UNICEF started the distribution of the spring and summer clothes UNIQLO has provided for children and babies who are stranded in Serbia.
UNICEF’s response to the refugee and migrant crisis is made possible by its donors and partners, and thanks to the Government of Serbia, which has authorised UNICEF’s presence in the refugee centres.
The hand-over ceremony was attended by Mr. Vladimir Cucić, the Commissioner for Refugees and Migration of the Republic of Serbia, the Ambassador of Japan to Serbia, H.E. Mr. Juichi Takahara, and UNICEF and UNHCR Representatives in Serbia, Mr. Michel Saint-Lot and Mr. Hans Friedrich Schodder.
In addition to last year’s financial support to UNICEF and UNHCR for their work connected to the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe, the Government of Japan in 2016 provided an additional grant of US $4.57 million in response to the refugee and migrant crisis in Serbia.
The funds allocated to UNICEF in Serbia have been used to support children and women refugees and migrants and for the provision of adequate and safe child-friendly and mother-and-baby spaces, nutrition and winterization items; while UNHCR has been using its part of the allocation for the "Emergency support for refugee crisis in Serbia, Europe" project.
“Children are among the most vulnerable categories of migrants and any help is highly appreciated. The Government of the Republic of Serbia has been investing great efforts to provide the best answers to the serious migratory challenges. One of these responses was the refurbishment of the Adaševci motel into the Transit and Reception Centre. Cooperation with UNICEF has always been at a high level and this partnership will be nurtured in the future as well.  I use this opportunity to extend our gratitude for the donation to the Government of Japan and UNICEF,” said Mr. Vladimir Cucić, the Commissioner for Refugees and Migration of the Republic of Serbia.
"Serbia is not the cause of the refugee crisis, nor is it the preferred destination of refugees. Regardless, the Government of Serbia, local authorities and the citizens of Serbia have acted in a responsible manner and provided assistance to the refugees in transit. The Government of Japan has recognised this humane behaviour and has provided support to Serbia, through international organisations such as UNICEF, UNHCR, UNDP, IOM and IFRC. Japan also provides direct assistance to the municipalities affected by the migrant crisis,” said Ambassador Takahara, adding that Japan would continue to support Serbia in the hope that the Serbian Government will continue to have a humane approach to refugees who are stranded in Serbia.
UNICEF in Serbia’s Representative, Mr. Michel Saint-Lot stressed that UNICEF’s emergency assistance to refugees and migrants was focused on children. “I want to thank the Government of Japan for its continuous support to UNICEF’s work, in Serbia and globally. The Japanese generous financial contribution has helped UNICEF secure safe places for refugee and migrant children to rest, play and receive psychosocial support by qualified professionals, and also for women to breastfeed in privacy and prepare and provide age-appropriate food to their children. UNIQLO’s donation of clothes complement the supplies of both winterization and summer items we have been securing for children and babies.”
Addressing the media, Mr. Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative in Serbia said:  “The Government of Japan is one of the biggest donors to UNHCR operations worldwide. In Serbia, we have enjoyed continuous, unfailing cooperation since the early 1990s. Thanks to the generous contribution of the Government of Japan, last year we have provided direct assistance, improved the accommodation and sanitation conditions in the reception centre in Presevo where the refugees have been assisted from the very onset of the crisis. Over the next 12 months, UNHCR will continue providing basic legal and medical assistance, enhancing the work of our partners’ mobile teams and further improving the living conditions of persons of our concern. We look forward to continuous good cooperation and joint actions.”
