Content: 03 June 2024
“By utilizing culture as a resilience-building tool and applying Employment Intensive initiatives to the rehabilitation of Cultural Heritage sites, this innovative project provided short-terms economic opportunities to a total of 1,305 beneficiaries, Jordanians and Syrians"
Under the patronage of H.E. Mr. Makram Queisi, Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, and with the support of the European Union, Friends of Jordan Festivals, and UNESCO Jordan Office, organized an event in Pella and Beit Eidis, Irbid Governorate, to mark the successful conclusion of an initiative aimed at providing dignified and sustainable livelihoods to Syrian refugees and Jordanian host communities.
The event held on May 31, 2024, and attended by representatives from UNESCO, the European Union, public authorities, diplomatic community, UN agencies, civil society organizations, and local communities, served as a platform to mark the completion of the “Support to Livelihoods Through Cultural Heritage Development” project, which was funded by the European Union under the umbrella of the Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis (Madad).
Under this initiative, UNESCO, with support of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and in close collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and the Department of Antiquities (DOA), implemented rehabilitation and maintenance works on six archaeological sites located in the Irbid and Mafraq governorates. The initiative aims to preserve Jordan’s rich cultural heritage while creating short-term employment opportunities for 1,305 people, who are amongst the most vulnerable members of the local communities and Syrian refugees. The interventions carried out addressed various aspects of conservation and maintenance works, such as general cleaning, consolidation, stabilization and limited reconstruction of walls, preservation of mosaics, implementation of safety and accessibility measures, and maintenance of tourist trails.
The Jordanian Department of Antiquities played a pivotal role in the successful implementation of the project, offering accessibility to the sites, and ensuring overall supervision of the works as well as technical support throughout their whole duration. His Excellency Professor Fadi Bala’awi, Director General of the DOA, recognized the invaluable contribution of this initiative in preserving and promoting Jordan’s rich cultural heritage, through efforts that have not only conserved the country’s historical sites, but also created sustainable livelihood opportunities for vulnerable members of the community.
During the visit, Deputy Head of the EU Delegation and Head of Political, Press and Information Section, Angela Martini, said: “Today, we have seen the lasting impact of one of our joint projects that contributed for 4 years to unearthing and developing some of Jordan’s rich cultural heritage. The EU has been a proud donor of this project, which aimed to provide access to dignifying employment opportunities for Syrians and Jordanians and, more broadly, create an enabling environment for entrepreneurship in the cultural heritage sector.”
UNESCO Jordan Officer in Charge, Mrs. Marina Patrier, stated: “By utilizing culture as a resilience-building tool and applying Employment Intensive initiatives to the rehabilitation of Cultural Heritage sites, this innovative project provided short-terms economic opportunities to a total of 1,305 beneficiaries, Jordanians and Syrians, distributed between six sites in Northern Jordan, including Pella and Beit Eidis. It also promoted greater community engagement in the preservation of the heritage sites in Jordan, empowering individuals from local communities to participate in safeguarding and transmitting their own cultural heritage”.
Those who participated in the event enjoyed a guided visit of the two archaeological sites of Pella and Beit Eidis, where they managed to discover local crafts and cuisine. They also attended a concert of Arabic classical music performed at the Pella site by the Jordanian artists Humam Eid, Issam Elayyan, Awwad Awwad, and Natali Al-Samaan.
As the curtains close on this project, UNESCO, the European Union and its partners reaffirm their commitment to continuing efforts to harness the potential of culture for sustainable development and peacebuilding in the region. By investing in the preservation of cultural heritage and engaging communities as active stakeholders, these initiatives aim to create a future where cultural diversity is celebrated, while fostering increased community involvement.

Title: An innovative system for Monitoring and Early Warning of RPW Date infestation
Content: 28 May 2024
Date production is a major contributor to the Jordanian agricultural sector's income, accounting for around a hundred million Jordanian Dinars of the entire agricultural income. Annually, the production of dates amounts to around 33,000 tonnes.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is holding a Training of Trainers (ToT) Workshop on the Susa-Hamra App: a digital system for monitoring and early warning for Red Palm Weevil (RPW), from May 28 to 30 in Amman, with the presence of representatives of the ministries of agriculture in the countries participating. Under the framework of the FAO RPW eradication “GCP /RNE/012/MUL programme, a three-day workshop is organized by the FAO Regional Office for the Near East and North Africa (RNE), FAO's Plant Production and Protection Division (NSP), and in collaboration with the Jordanian Ministry of Agriculture. The workshop will be attended by 50 participants from 6 NENA countries, including Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria. The workshop aims to strengthen the technical capacities of the participating officials on RPW visual inspection protocols, trapping techniques, and data collection using the SusaHamra app. In addition, participants will acquire knowledge on data validation using the PlantVillage Platform and employ the RPW platform for mapping and analysis.
Date production is a major contributor to the Jordanian agricultural sector's income, accounting for around a hundred million Jordanian Dinars of the entire agricultural income. Annually, the production of dates amounts to around 33,000 tonnes. Red Palm Weevil is a key quarantine pest that represents a threat to the date palm sustainable production and is negatively impacting farmer livelihoods, and the environment not only in Jordan but in most NENA countries. Weak quarantine measures and challenges in the early detection of RPW-infested plant materials have contributed to its rapid spread in the NENA region” " stated Eng. Nabil Assaf, the FAO Representative in Jordan.
Eng. Ayman Al-Oran, Assistant Secretary-General for Plant Wealth at the Ministry of Agriculture, added that the Red Palm weevil was recorded for the first time in Jordan in 1999, and during the last ten years, its infections have increased steadily. The Ministry recognized the necessity of formulating a comprehensive national strategy to halt the spread of the red palm weevil and limit its economic damage. The plan was developed for three years and aimed at using the available innovative technologies for early detection and control of RPW, with the participation of stakeholders and in cooperation with experts from the FAO and the private sector. The national plan will target the Jordan Valley, Azraq, Aqaba, and Al-Safi regions.
Mr. Thaer Yaseen, the regional officer of plant protection, at FAORNE, stressed that RPW has not been effectively managed despite efforts and resources provided by the authorities in NENA countries. There was broad recognition that the risk of RPW cannot be addressed only at the national level and that its challenges must be addressed urgently at national regional, and global levels. Also, enhanced solidarity and cooperation between countries and regions are required to harmonize the monitoring and control strategies.
FAO developed the regional Trust Fund program for RPW eradication in the NENA region as one of the most affected regions. The RPW eradication project “GCP/RNE/012/MUL” is a five-year project that aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts for the eradication of the RPW in the Near East and North Africa (NENA) region. The project is designed to develop the necessary strategies, plans, tools, and technologies to assist NENA countries in sustainably managing the RPW through three major thematic areas: i) research; ii) capacity development; and iii) transfer of knowledge and technology.
“FAO designed a new monitoring system that includes a mobile app for field collecting data through visual inspection and checking pheromone traps, in addition to a cloud platform for processing, analyzing, and mapping the collected data,” said Mr. Maged Elkahky, Agricultural Officer, FAO NSP. He added that the beta version of the mobile application "Susa-Hamra App” was released at the end of 2018, and the field use of the system was officially launched in December 2023. The system was presented and validated in the Maghreb countries in a previous workshop. Tunisia has currently adopted the new digital tool as a national system to monitor and survey the RPW in the affected areas.
Susa-Hamra App and the platform mark a significant step forward in the fight against RPW and support the officials and stakeholders in making informed management decisions.

Title: JAPANESE AMBASSADOR VISITS ZAATARI CAMP, OBSERVES WFP REFUGEE ASSISTANCE FIRSTHAND
Content: 27 May 2024
Ambassador Okuyama emphasized Japan's commitment to supporting vulnerable refugees, saying, "Amid the growing need to address the alarming levels of food insecurity and the increasing vulnerability of refugees in Jordan."
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) today accompanied His Excellency Ambassador Okuyama Jiro, the Ambassador of Japan to Jordan, during a visit to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.
Ambassador Okuyama engaged with a family benefiting from WFP assistance, listening firsthand to their experiences and challenges. He also toured a WFP-contracted supermarket, witnessing the use of blockchain and iris-scanning technologies for redeeming WFP assistance in camps.
Reflecting on the visit, Ambassador Okuyama emphasized Japan's commitment to supporting vulnerable refugees, saying, "Amid the growing need to address the alarming levels of food insecurity and the increasing vulnerability of refugees in Jordan, this project aims to help them meet their nutritional needs through cash assistance and various community activities. It is my sincere hope that Japan’s new contribution will assist WFP in providing crucial and urgent support to increasingly vulnerable families in camps and host communities".
WFP Country Director in Jordan, Alberto Correia Mendes, expressed gratitude for Japan's continuous support, stating, “The support from Japan and other partners is more crucial than ever as we navigate these challenging times, especially given the growing needs by vulnerable refugee families posed by reduced assistance due to funding constraints”.
With the support of donor partners, WFP provides monthly cash-based assistance to 410,000 refugees in Jordan’s camps and host communities who rely on humanitarian support to meet their basic food needs. However, since July 2023, funding shortfalls forced WFP to reduce the value of its monthly cash assistance for refugees by one-third.
Japan has supported WFP's refugee response in Jordan for over a decade, a commitment reaffirmed by Ambassador Okuyama’s recent visit. This year, Japan's contribution enabled WFP to assist 24,896 refugees for one month and conduct activities aimed at promoting good nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as children under two years old.

Title: FAO, in collaboration with partners, facilitates learning initiative between Amman & Milano Municipalities to address food loss and waste
Content: 21 May 2024
The collaboration seeks to harness the collective expertise and experiences of Amman and Milan in addressing food loss and waste, as key entry point for promoting sustainable transformation of urban agrifood systems.
Amman Municipality and Milan Municipality, have joined forces in a pioneering collaboration aimed at tackling food loss and waste management, marking a significant stride towards sustainable urban development.
With urbanization rates on the rise globally, the challenge of sustainable urban food systems has never been more pressing. Recognizing the urgency of this issue, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in collaboration with Let's Food and the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, is facilitating a peer-to-peer learning initiative between these two municipalities.
The collaboration seeks to harness the collective expertise and experiences of Amman and Milan in addressing food loss and waste, as key entry point for promoting sustainable transformation of urban agrifood systems.
The kickstart is a hybrid meeting – scheduled on 20 May 2024 - aimed at engaging stakeholders, pinpointing needs and priorities, and outlining a one-year roadmap for effective peer-to-peer learning between the two municipalities.
As stated by Corinna Hawkes - Director of the Agrifood Systems and Food Safety Division in FAO - Local governments are crucial contributors because they are the level of government closest to the people and they can address many food systems challenges at the city level and beyond.
After this initial exchange, further virtual interactions will take place, culminating in a workshop scheduled for November 2024 in Amman. This workshop will see the participation of cities across Europe and the Near East and North Africa Region, enhancing collaborative efforts and knowledge exchange.
The exchange between Amman and Milan represents more than just a one-time collaboration between the two cities; it embodies a commitment to driving systemic change in urban agrifood systems. It is fundamental – Hawkes added - that these peer exchanges are integrated with other learning modalities, such as the learning-by-doing approach and by concrete actions to achieve effective structural changes in food systems at all levels.
FAO Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf emphasized the transformative potential of such partnerships, stating, "The exchange between Amman Municipality and Milan Municipality holds the promise of catalyzing connections among existing initiatives at all levels, inspiring policymakers, other cities in Jordan, resource partners, the private sector, and eventually unlocking resources to achieve real changes in Amman and beyond.”
“FAO’s work on South-South and Triangular Cooperation and its support to countries in taking action to reduce food loss and waste, is therefore critical in this endeavor. Thanks to South-South and Triangular cooperation, cities have been able to share their experiences and learn from each other and strengthen food systems at sub-national and municipality levels.” said Mr. Anping Ye, Director of the South-South and Triangular Cooperation Division of FAO.
The Deputy Chief of the Italian Embassy, Emilio Fralleone, highlighted that "Paramount importance lies in food waste management, reducing food loss and strengthening food chains, for all these phenomena are intertwined and the way we decide to tackle them will contribute to shape the world of tomorrow. We recognize in this scenario the pivotal role played by Municipalities, especially given the growth of urban populations, in achieving these objectives. Amman and Milan stand at the forefront of research and development in this field within their respective Countries. Through peer-to-peer collaboration and experience sharing there will surely be a further enhancing of knowledges, nurturing growth, and progress.”
The Mayor of Milan, Mr. Giuseppe Sala, stated, “There is a great scope to reinforce food systems at national and international levels by building on the experience of cities”. He added, “Tackling Food waste is one of the main drivers of food systems transformation.”
The Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture in Jordan, Eng. Mohammad AlHayari, indicated that this initiative in peer learning comes to produce a new pioneering model for cities around the world, based on the specific challenges facing Jordan and relying on the responsible human element that can be creative and turn challenges into opportunities.
On behalf of the Mayor of Amman, the city director, Eng. Ahmed Al-Malkawi, said that this workshop between Amman and the municipality of Milan in the field of organic waste management of vegetables and fruits would enhance cooperation, exchange experiences, and explore solutions that achieve common goals for developing organic waste management, trusting that the workshop would be a platform for exchanging ideas and experiences that support sustainable growth in the field of organic waste management from vegetables and fruits, which is considered one of the challenges that requires sustainable solutions to reduce negative impacts on the environment and public health.
This collaborative initiative builds upon FAO's Priority Programme "Achieving Sustainable Urban Food Systems," and recognizes food loss and waste management as powerful entry point to catalyze systemic transformation in urban and peri-urban areas.

Title: Empowering Jordanian Youth: UNESCO and Canada Joint Efforts to Support the Ministry of Education in Transforming Vocational Education in Jordan
Content: 01 May 2024
Through the programme, it is expected that 1800 TVET teachers and over 35,000 learners will benefit from capacity development interventions and newly introduced systems and practices in Vocational Education.
UNESCO and Canada are strengthening their partnership in the education sector in Jordan to support the Ministry of Education in transforming technical and vocational education and training (TVET). Canada announced in February 2024 an envelope of $6.5 million for UNESCO to implement a Technical Assistance Programme aiming at increasing access to safe and inclusive education for Jordanian and refugee girls and boys in the public education system. It will provide young people with the skills they need for future employment opportunities by adapting vocational training courses to the needs of the labor market.
Through the programme, it is expected that 1800 TVET teachers and over 35,000 learners will benefit from capacity development interventions and newly introduced systems and practices in Vocational Education. Furthermore, 12 MoE Vocational Education schools will implement newly developed models related to private sector engagement and career guidance.
This programme has been designed to support Canada’s Sovereign Loan to Jordan to modernize Jordan’s vocational education sector by renovating vocational studios, modernizing educational technology and improving overall infrastructure.
Through close collaboration with the Ministry of Education, private sector industries, and other national stakeholders, UNESCO will support the implementation of various strategies to enhance the quality of TVET programmes in public schools. Key areas of focus include career guidance, private sector partnerships, awareness campaigns, teacher training, and the enhancement of graduates' qualifications.
The ultimate goal of the programme is to contribute to Jordan’s socio-economic development by equipping young people, regardless of gender or background, with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the changing labor market.
Marina Patrier, UNESCO Jordan Officer in Charge, recalled UNESCO TVET Strategy (2022-2029) and mandate, and the critical role played by TVET: “UNESCO connects education to the fast-evolving world of work through its promotion of skills for work and life. TVET helps youth and adults develop the abilities, knowledge, values and attitudes they need to find decent work and contribute to building a peaceful, healthy and sustainable world.”
The programme directly derived from the findings and recommendations of the TVET System Review undertaken in 2023 by the MoE with technical support from UNESCO. It is fully aligned with the 2030 Education Agenda-SDG4 at global level; and to the Economic Modernisation Vision, the Education Strategic Plan and Joint National TVET Strategy at national level.

Title: Jordan is the first country in the Arab region to publish a comprehensive Statistical Bulletin for the Social Protection Sector
Content: 01 May 2024
The statistical bulletin will assist decision-makers in developing the necessary policies in the social protection sector, as we witness the revision and update of the National Social Protection Strategy.
The Department of Statistics in Jordan, with support from the ILO and the EU, has launched the first statistical bulletin for the social protection sector in Joran and in the Arab region.
The initiative spearheaded by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation and the Department of Statistics, saw the active participation of all key players in the social protection sector in Jordan,.
H.E Dr. Haidar Fraihat, the Director General of the Department of Statistics in Jordan, congratulated the national team on this achievement, highlighting the importance of statistics and data as an essential resource to inform national plans and policies.
“We are launching today the results of the statistical bulletin that includes the government interventions that are provided to individuals to protect them from social and economic risks and challenges caused by the different contingencies as defined by the ILO convention 102 (1952) which was ratified by Government of Jordan. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 also recognizes social protection as a human right, and this was confirmed through the SDG 1.3, which aims to implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable” he said.
“This bulletin will provide easy access to relevant data, enhance the use of data to guide national strategies and policies, and make social protection data available to a wide range of key stakeholders, at the national and international levels.” he said “The statistical bulletin will facilitate decision-making on social protection, based on concrete, comprehensive and up-to-date data, with the aim of improving the coverage and efficiency of the system and assessing the impact of social protection programs on citizens” he continued.
Representatives from eight line ministries and government institutions, as well as ILO and UNICEF were present at the launch.
“The statistical bulletin will assist decision makers in developing the necessary policies in the social protection sector, as we witness the revision and update of the National Social Protection Strategy.” Noted H.E Dr. Barq Dmour, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Social Development.
This bulletin is the first issue of a series that the Department of Statistics intends to publish annually. It collects and unifies all data issued by relevant national institutions operating and concerned with the Jordanian social protection system. This issue of the statistical bulletin covers national social assistance and social insurance programs, which form the core of the national social protection system in Jordan.
According to the results presented in the bulletin, Jordan has made great achievements in the SP sector, with over one in three residents in the Kingdom (34.1%) covered by national social protection mechanisms during 2021, reaching as high as 45.2% of Jordanians, including direct and indirect recipients of national cash and in-kind support programmes, as well as individuals insured through contributory Social Protection mechanisms.
Of all Jordanians, 25% were covered by contributory schemes, 16% of Jordanians received tax- financed cash-based benefits and 4% received in-kind benefits during 2021. Accounting for cash-based benefits only, national coverage is estimated at 30.2%, reaching as high as 41.3% of Jordanians.
Total expenditure on social protection during 2021 reached JOD 3.69 billion (11.5% of GDP), equivalent to JOD 334 per capita, and contributory benefits account for 90% of total expenditures, reaching JOD 3.31 billion (10.3% of GDP), split equally between the Social Security Corporation (51%) and the Ministry of Finance (49%). Expenditures on tax-financed schemes reached 1.2% of GDP in 2021, up from 0.9% in 2020. Cash assistance schemes administered by the NAF, accounting for 93% of tax-financed expenditures, increased by 41% relative to expenditures in 2020.
“It is impressive indeed to see the advancements of the government efforts to extend social protection in the country and enhance Jordan’s status in the region and worldwide, and looking into the social protection coverage and expenditure indicators for Jordan exceeding regional averages, and coverage of key vulnerable groups in Jordan such as older persons, persons with disabilities, and children which is double their regional averages, is truly inspiring to continue investing in extending social protection further”. noted Ms. Ilona de Zamaróczy, the EU Program Manager for Social Protection at the Delegation of the European Union to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
The Statistical Bulletin pursues the twofold aim of supporting the implementation of the Jordanian National Social Protection Strategy (2019-2025) and of building national capacities to improve sustainability of social protection via better mechanisms for evidence-based policy design.
“We congratulate Jordan for leading the enhancement of social protection statistics in the region, providing a tool and resource to make social protection data available and accessible to all. With this publication, policy makers can have a holistic view of different aspects of the social protection system and monitor the progress of Jordan in achieving SDG 1.3. Building on the good practices of Jordan, the ILO will strive to engage other countries in the region to improve the methodology for collecting and analysing social protection data in view of the new edition of the  World Social Protection Repor[PL1] t.” Said Luca Pellerano, Senior Social Protection Specialist for the ILO in Beirut noted.
“We envisage the development of this work in coordination with the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation and with the support of the International Labor Organization to prepare a statistical bulletin that is updated annually to monitor the progress of social protection in Jordan, and with the participation of a team of representatives from the different institutions implementing social protection measures in Jordan who have worked intensively together to develop this first publication of social protection statistics in Jordan”. concluded H.E Dr. Haidar Fraihat

The ILO will continue to support the Department of Statistics in the process of issuing a second publication for the statistical bulletin for the years 2022-2023 through the EU-funded program “Towards a comprehensive national system for social protection and accelerating job opportunities for vulnerable Syrians and Jordanians/MADAD” implemented jointly by the International Labour Organization and UNICEF.

Title: Sustainable jobs and vocational training for Jordanians and Syrian refugees
Content: 01 May 2024
ILO and Flower of Life Association agreement in Jordan aims to provide Syrian refugees with on-the-job training and sustainable employment, through the EU Madad project which is funded by the EU Madad Trust Fund.

ILO officials concluded a field visit to the Jordanian governorates of Ramtha and Irbid to review activities carried out by the Flower of Life Association within an implementation agreement signed between the two parties.
The agreement falls under the ILO project “Towards an Inclusive National Social Protection System and Accelerating Decent Job Opportunities for Syrians and Vulnerable Jordanians,” funded by the European Union’s Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis (Madad Fund). The project is part of the ILO Programme of Support to the Jordan Compact.
The agreement aims to transition Syrian refugees residing in Jordan from cash assistance to sustainable opportunities through vocational training and job placements. The agreement targets 142 Syrian refugees who will be placed in full-time employment and provided with on-the-job training, while the project is targeting a total of 2,500 temporary job placements and on-the-job training for both Jordanians and Syrian refugees by the end of the year.
The field visit to Ramtha Governorate included a visit to the Yasser Al-Salman Farm, which employed 19 Syrian refugees (8 women and 11 men) and provided on-the-job training in agriculture and product packaging under the supervision of specialized engineers from the National Agricultural Research Center.
Additionally, there was a visit to Elite Chemical Industries Company in Irbid Governorate, specializing in the chemical, veterinary, and skincare industries, which employs two Syrian refugees as packing and packaging workers, with plans to employ seven others.
The two companies provided a detailed review of their activities and an opportunity for ILO officials to meet several Syrian workers, to better understand their working conditions and receive their feedback on their experiences of the initiative.
ILO Chief Technical Adviser in Jordan Qais Al-Qatamin said: "The International Labor Organization and its partners in this agreement form one working team. We aim to employ the largest possible number of Syrians and Jordanians in available workplaces, providing a decent work environment, developing their expertise, and ensuring long-term job sustainability."
Director General of Flower of Life Association Ali Alfadaan said: "As a local community organization, we have played a role in networking with companies, sorting applicants based on competence and abilities, and considering people with disabilities. We are pleased to provide one-year-long job opportunities for more than 25 beneficiaries in the two governorates. We thank the International Labor Organization for this cooperation and hope for additional job opportunities soon."
The project is based on three main pillars: The first is eenhanced coordination, integrated planning, and monitoring of government-wide efforts in the social protection and employment sector. The second is concerned with enhancing access to the labor market, decent work, and employment-based social protection plans. The third focuses on the transition of Jordanians and Syrian refugees from cash assistance to sustainable jobs.

Title: EU and WHO sign funding agreement to supports strengthening Jordan’s Primary Health Care services.
Content: 29 April 2024
This four-year programme support priority actions of the Ministry of Health’s Strategic Plan, guided by Jordan Economic Modernization vision.
The Minister of Health, Dr. Firas Al-Hawari, patronized the signing ceremony of the funding agreement provided by the European Union (EU) to the World Health Organization (WHO) to strengthen primary health care services in Jordan, at the Ministry of Health in the presence of Mr. Patrick Lambrechts, Head of Cooperation at the European Union Delegation to Jordan and the Representative of the World Health Organization in Jordan Dr. Jamila Al-Raiby.
This fund comes within the “Strengthening access to quality primary health care services for Syrian refugees and host communities in Jordan” project, where the EU committed €15 million to support the WHO’s efforts to strengthen Jordan’s primary health care services.
The project will contribute to improving the efficiency, equity, and responsiveness of the Primary Health Care (PHC) system and addressing the population’s needs in Jordan, including the refugees.
This four-year programme, funded by the EU through its Neighborhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI Global Europe) in response to the Syrian crisis, supports priority actions of the Ministry of Health’s Strategic Plan, guided by Jordan Economic Modernization vision.
Minister of Health, Dr. Firas Al-Hawari, said that the efforts made by the European Union and the World Health Organization would contribute to helping the government prepare primary healthcare centers, which would directly support its plan towards achieving universal health coverage. Hawari continued, “By upgrading selected PHC facilities to meet service standards (in terms of improving healthcare workers skills, support Health Information System infrastructures, equipment, and supplies), it will increase the utilization of Primary Health Care facilities in Jordan. It's important to recognize the invaluable support of WHO and the EU in advancing Jordan's healthcare priorities.”
H.E. Dr Feras Hawari valued the support provided by the World Health Organization and European Union in supporting health priorities in Jordan.
Mr. Patrick Lambrechts, Head of Cooperation at the European Union Delegation to Jordan, said: “Now more than ever, it is crucial that we support Jordan’s commitment to strengthen primary health care and health systems, guaranteeing access to high-quality health services to all individuals across the Kingdom. Universal health coverage and the health-related sustainable development goals (SDGs) can only be sustainably attained through an unwavering dedication to enhancing primary health care.”
On her part Dr Jamela Al-Raiby, WHO Representative to Jordan emphasized on the importance of implementing this project saying: “Primary Health Care creates the foundation for the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Through this project, WHO will support the implementation of PHC-oriented models of care to promote the integration of health services for quality of care, and increase access to primary health care for refugees, in particular Syrian refugees, and their host communities”.
By embracing a ‘whole-of-government’ and ‘whole-of-society’ approach, this project will harness the collective strength of Jordan's institutions and communities to achieve a healthier future for all. Together, these efforts mark a significant step forward in advancing the health and well-being of the people of Jordan.

Title: UN Secretary General Press Remarks with the Foreign Minister of Jordan
Content: 25 March 2024
I commend Jordan for your support for de-escalation, including in East Jerusalem.
And I salute Jordan for your relentless efforts to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza, including through the personal efforts and wisdom of King Abdullah.
Assalam alaikum.
Foreign Minister Safady, thank you for your warm welcome.  It’s good to be back in Jordan, especially at such a critical time for the region and our world.
When I see Jordan, I see solidarity in action.
I see it in the words and deeds of His Majesty King Abdullah – a global champion for peace.
And I see it in the spirit of the people of Jordan and your enormous compassion towards those fleeing upheaval.
Jordan is home to the largest number of Palestine refugees.  I visited a camp earlier today and commend Jordan for your pivotal advocacy for the vital work of UNRWA.
You have also opened your hearts and doors to many others, including refugees from Syria.  And I urge the international community to support Jordan as it supports millions of people in need.
Jordan’s spirit of solidarity is precisely what brings me here once again.
I am on my annual solidarity mission during the holy month of Ramadan where I visit and fast with Muslim communities in distress.
Ramadan is meant to be a period of celebration – but not this year.
Hearts are heavy in the region – and indeed around the world – from the unprecedented and ongoing devastation in Gaza, as well as rising violence in the occupied West Bank.
I commend Jordan for your support for de-escalation, including in East Jerusalem.
And I salute Jordan for your relentless efforts to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza, including through the personal efforts and wisdom of King Abdullah.
For my part, I will keep pushing for the removal of all obstacles to life-saving aid, for more access and more entry points.
But we must face facts.
There will be no sustainable humanitarian solution with an ongoing war as bloody as this.
Let me repeat: nothing justifies the abhorrent October 7 attacks and hostage-taking by Hamas – and nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
The effective delivery of humanitarian aid requires the immediate delivery of a humanitarian ceasefire.
The need is urgent.
I was at the Rafah border crossing this weekend.
I met with injured Palestinian civilians and heard directly from our frontline humanitarian colleagues.
They are veterans of some of the worst humanitarian crises in recent decades.
They have seen it all.
And yet, without exception, they told me they have never seen anything as horrible as what is happening in Gaza today.
The scale and speed of the death and destruction are on an entirely different level.
And now starvation is bearing down on Palestinians in Gaza.
There is a growing consciousness around the world that all of this must stop.
The fighting must end now, the hostages must be released now, and we must not lose sight of the big picture.
A lasting end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only come through a two-State solution.
Israelis must see their legitimate needs for security materialized, and Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for a fully independent, viable and sovereign State realized, in line with United Nations resolutions, international law and previous agreements.
We know where the alternative would lead.
To indefinitely prolonging a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security.
To exacerbating polarization.
To emboldening extremists everywhere.
Those standing in the way of a two-state solution have an obligation to state clearly the alternative.
How would the future look with such a large number of Palestinians inside without any real sense of freedom, rights and dignity?
This would be inconceivable.
The two-State solution is the only way to address the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians.
I know it is easy to be cynical in today’s world.  But that’s a luxury we cannot afford.
Cynicism is a form of surrender to the prevailing assumptions of the moment.
It is a refuge for those too weak, too narrow, too timid to imagine a better future.
When things are difficult, we must try even harder.
I will keep pushing for peace inspired by your example.
Once again, thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister, and the government and people of Jordan for leading the way to solidarity and peace.

Title: UN Secretary General Remarks at Wihdat Camp for Palestine Refugees
Content: 25 March 2024
UNRWA is a hot topic these days – but one fundamental thing is often being lost in the debate:  people.
Assalam alaikum.

I am extremely pleased to be here at the Wihdat Camp for Palestine refugees.
We are at a centre dedicated to the wellbeing of Palestine refugees.  So allow me to begin with an invitation to join me in a moment of silence in tribute to our United Nations colleagues and all others who have been killed in this conflict.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am on a Ramadan solidarity visit to Jordan to meet Palestine refugees being served by UNRWA.
UNRWA is a hot topic these days – but one fundamental thing is often being lost in the debate:  people.
The real people UNRWA serves -- and the real difference that UNRWA is making in their lives.
Jordan is home to 2.4 million Palestine refugees, the largest number in the region.
Today I heard some of their stories and saw a glimpse of UNRWA’s exceptional work.
I had the privilege of visiting a health centre – where young mothers and their children are receiving high-quality primary health care, where labs perform state of the art medical tests, where a pharmacy is dispensing life-saving medication to patients at no charge.
I sat in on science and English language classes at a girls school.
I saw young women in a science lab learning and experimenting principles from Archimedes.
I visited a class teaching English along with the values of human rights and conflict resolution.
I also met with 6 truly inspiring young student parliamentarian leaders, including 3 students from Gaza.
It was a heart-warming visit in heart-breaking times.
Here in Jordan, but also in Syria, in Lebanon – and, of course, in the occupied West Bank and Gaza -- UNRWA is a lifeline of hope and dignity.
Providing education for over half a million girls and boys;
Health care for around 2 million people;
Extending job opportunities and community and family support.
And ensuring a social safety net for nearly half a million of the poorest Palestinians.
Beyond and behind those facts, UNRWA is profoundly contributing in ways that can’t be measured on a graph -- advancing social cohesion, promoting stability, building peace.
Imagine if all of this was taken away.
It’s cruel and incomprehensible – especially as we honour the 171 women and men of UNRWA who have been killed in Gaza – the largest number of deaths of UN staff in our history.
As our work continues in the face of big obstacles, I am determined to ensure that UNRWA abides by the values of the United Nations in all its actions.
And so taking into account recent unacceptable events, an independent review is well underway to strengthen and improve UNRWA.
I look forward to its recommendations.
We must strive to keep the one-of-a-kind services that UNRWA provides flowing because that keeps hope flowing.
In a darkening world, UNRWA is the one ray of light for millions of people.
I see that hope here.
Now more than ever, we must not take away that hope.
You can count on me -- and I count on all of you to keep spreading that hope and potential of Palestine refugees here at the Widhat Camp and far beyond.
Thank you. Shukran.

Title: Jordan endorses Its first "Urban Policy", developed by UN-Habitat and Local Administration Ministry
Content: 14 March 2024
The Jordan National Urban Policy (JNUP) represents a proactive approach towards establishing comprehensive national policies aimed at fostering environmentally sustainable, economically prosperous, socially inclusive, resilient, and well-connected cities and neighbourhoods.
On March 6th 2024, in a historic move considered the first of its kind, the Council of Ministers officially endorsed the first Jordan National Urban Policy (JNUP), developed by UN-Habitat in partnership with the Ministry of Local Administration. This endorsement follows the recommendations of the Services, Infrastructure, and Social Affairs Committee issued on February 26th, and the endorsement of the Steering Committee established within the framework of the regional project, "Sustainable, Inclusive and Evidence-based National Urban Policies in selected Arab States," implemented in four Arab countries by UN-Habitat.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Local Administration, Tawfiq Kreishan, explained, "We in Jordan are in the process of establishing a national institutional framework, serving as a reference that guides all ministries, institutions, and agencies involved in urban development, municipal services, and public transportation. This aims to enhance our efforts towards integration, inclusivity, and enrichment of our functional tasks."
Echoing this, the Mayor of the Greater Amman Municipality, Dr. Yousef Al-Shawarbeh, emphasized the significance of this policy, stating: "The Jordan National Urban Policy is considered a historical document, but it requires a national-level planning and regulatory law. For our nation and the future generations, it is our responsibility to adopt this policy and protect it through legislation that safeguards the rights of both the nation and its citizens."
The National Programme Coordinator for the UN-Habitat Jordan Office, Deema Abu Thiab, explained that, at its core, the Jordan National Urban Policy seeks to facilitate transformative, productive, inclusive, and resilient urbanization for the long term. She added, “This endorsement marks a significant milestone in Jordan's journey towards sustainable urban development."
The Jordan National Urban Policy (JNUP) represents a proactive approach towards establishing comprehensive national policies aimed at fostering environmentally sustainable, economically prosperous, socially inclusive, resilient, and well-connected cities and neighbourhoods. In addition to serving as a guiding framework for national urban development, the JNUP acts as an incubator for sectoral plans across various ministries, authorities, institutions, and special administrative regions, including the Greater Amman Municipality, Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority, and the Jordan Valley Authority. The policy also engages relevant stakeholders such as universities, civil society organizations, private sector, donor organizations, and other actors.
The JNUP is aligned with the recommendations set forth in the Economic Modernization Vision, the Public Administration Modernization Roadmap, and the Royal Committee Document for Political System Modernization.

Title: Skills fair highlights the importance of modernizing and transforming apprenticeship-based vocational training
Content: 14 March 2024
A Jordanian delegation led by the ILO in Jordan participated in the Skills Fair on Quality Apprenticeships in Turin, Italy, to strengthen capacities to meet the evolving challenges of the contemporary world of work
The International Labour Organization (ILO) in Jordan participated in the Skills Fair on Quality Apprenticeships held in Turin, Italy, with a Jordanian delegation consisting of representatives from the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Labour, the Vocational Training Corporation, the National Aid Fund, the Technical and Vocational Skills Development Commission, the Accreditation and Quality Assurance Commission for Higher Education Institutions, the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions, and the Jordan Chamber of Industry.
The International Training Center of the International Labour Organization (ITCILO) organized the Skills Fair on Quality Apprenticeships to highlight the importance of modernizing and transforming vocational training based on industrial apprenticeships to meet the evolving challenges in the contemporary world of work. The fair targeted key stakeholders at the international level, including policymakers, ministries of labour, TVET institutions, vocational training providers in the public and private sectors, entrepreneurs, workers' organizations, regional organizations, trainees, and representatives of youth organizations. The aim was to enhance international, regional, and national cooperation in line with ILO Quality Apprenticeships Recommendation, 2023 (No. 208) on enhancing the quality of vocational training based on industrial apprenticeships at the global level.
The Jordanian delegation, led by the International Labour Organization in Jordan, participated in several workshops, lectures, and specialized events in vocational training, its quality, and industrial apprenticeships. The Skills Fair focused on several topics, including promoting the adoption of quality apprenticeships, engaging policymakers in shaping policy approaches for vocational training at the global level, facilitating the exchange of good practices, and encouraging cooperation between social partners and governments. It also emphasized involving youth in international discussions and plans, ensuring a rights-based approach to apprenticeship programs, highlighting inclusivity and non-discrimination, and creating opportunities for international cooperation and building networks. The event also focused on disseminating knowledge and future methods related to apprenticeships.
Dr. Khaled Alqudah, ILO National Coordinator for the Program of Support (POS) Amman office, stated, “This exhibition represents a unique experience for the Jordanian team, which included representatives of the vocational education and training bodies, who are dealing with various types of vocational education and training programs. This exhibition also holds special importance in developing programs for industrial apprenticeship and how to invest and improve it to serve some poor and needy groups, as vocational apprenticeship is one of the important elements for these individuals’ transition to permanent and continuous work and economic participation in the labor market.”
The Skills Fair on Quality Apprenticeships provided a platform for the Jordanian delegation to exchange experiences, knowledge, and discuss future approaches to enhancing and transforming vocational training. The event stressed the importance of modernizing vocational training to meet the challenges of the contemporary and future world of work.

Title: UN-Habitat, ESCWA convene stakeholders for Water Climate Adaptation talks in Jordan"
Content: 11 March 2024
First National Steering Committee meeting of 2024 on the “Resilient Water Solutions Against Climate Change” project convened in Amman
In the context of the “Resilient Water Solutions Against Climate Change in Jordan and Lebanon” project, led by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in partnership with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA)), the first National Steering Committee meeting in Jordan for 2024 has concluded on 29 February, chaired by the Ministry of Environment of and gathering representatives from the Ministry of Water and Irrigation in Jordan, along with United Nations coordinators, local authorities, implementing partners and other relevant stakeholders.
During the meeting, participants discussed the project’s workplan, current progress, achievements, and upcoming milestones. Major progress has been made since the last national steering committee for the project was convened in Jordan in June 2023. Since then, UNICEF Jordan has installed 37 greywater reuse systems in schools and other public entities. The Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development (JOHUD), an executing entity for the project, has also identified beneficiary sites targeting vulnerable communities for the installation of 64 rooftop rainwater harvesting systems. Additionally, the consultant groups LDK and Royal Scientific Society in Jordan have finalized their assessment reports for developing climate-resilient urban master plans and setting up two urban observatories for both the municipalities of Irbid and Mafraq.
“This is a strategic project that aims to better respond to the impacts of climate change and vulnerabilities in the context of the Syrian crisis in Jordan and Lebanon”, said Abdelmajid Khabour, representative of the Ministry of Environment in Jordan. “It raises the resilience of both displaced and host communities and enhances their ability to adapt to the negative effects of climate change in the most important and sensitive sectors affected by these changes, which are the agriculture and water sectors, and influences the economies of the local community,”, he added.
In his remarks, Bassem Hassan, representative of the Ministry of Water and Irrigation in Jordan, highlighted the ministry's team great efforts to follow up on the project. “One of the greatest components and lessons we learned through this project is how to be resilient, flexible and credible”, he said.
For her part, Deema Abu Thiab, National Programme Coordinator of UN-Habitat Jordan, said this meeting not only reflects the importance of all partners’ joint efforts, but also highlighted the commitment of the Jordanian Government in addressing water challenges related to climate change. “Today's meeting is an important opportunity to discuss the project's progress, challenges and opportunities, and to exchange experiences and learn from best practices and lessons learned. It is also an opportunity to enhance coordination and cooperation between all partners and parties concerned to ensure the project is implemented effectively, efficiently and sustainably”, she said.
Financed by the Adaptation Fund, the project aims to provide innovative measures to promote climate change resilience with a focus on ensuring climate change and gender mainstreamed urban planning. It also encourages the sustainable management and use of water resources through promoting water-efficient irrigation methods and permaculture, in addition to using non-conventional water sources, such as treated wastewater and harvested rainwater. In Jordan, the cities of Mafraq and Irbid are the project’s targeted areas due to recurrent droughts, extreme heat and a shift in rainfall patterns which have recently become major concerns for these areas.

Title: FAO Regional Ministerial Conference for the NENA region concludes with a Ministerial Declaration
Content: 06 March 2024
Delegates reiterated their support for the FAO Strategic Framework 2022–31, which calls for the transformation to more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient, and more sustainable global agrifood systems to assure the “Four Betters”.
The 37th session of the Regional Ministerial Conference for the Near East and North Africa (NENA) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) ended today with a Ministerial Declaration supporting the FAO Strategic Framework 2022-31, supported by the Organization’s flagship initiatives, and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
The Ministerial Declaration was agreed by Members of the NENA region at the end of a two-day high-level gathering in Amman.
Delegates reiterated their support for the FAO Strategic Framework 2022–31, which calls for the transformation to more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient, and more sustainable global agrifood systems to assure the “Four Betters”: better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life, leaving no one behind. The FAO Strategic Framework supports Members in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The high-level participants also endorsed the four Regional Priorities for FAO’s programme of work as set out in its Strategic Framework for the next decade, and which reflect strategic areas to support countries in the region in transforming their agrifood systems.
The Ministers also reiterated their support for FAO’s flagship initiatives, including the One Country One Priority Product, Hand-in-Hand, and 1000 Digital Villages, and committed to support their implementation in their countries in line with national priorities.
Gaza
Ministers and Heads of Delegation of the region also called for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to “all forms of violence.”
The Declaration expresses “deep concern about the deteriorating security situation in the region and the resulting food security and nutrition crisis, particularly in Gaza, Sudan, Yemen and the Syrian Arab Republic.”
On Gaza specifically, it expresses extreme concern with the “deteriorating humanitarian situation, the forced displacement of the population in the Gaza Strip, the destruction of the agriculture sector and related livelihoods and infrastructure resulting in severe food insecurity leading towards famine.”
Ministers also expressed solidarity with those facing the “devastating situation due to the war in Gaza and conflicts in other member countries” and emphasized “the importance of promoting peace in the region.”
In his closing remarks to the conference, FAO Director-General QU Dongyu said: “I wish to convey my deepest sympathies for the ongoing suffering in Gaza, Sudan and Yemen, and other hotspots in the region, due to the impacts of war and conflicts, and other global crises.”
“Let me assure you of FAO’s continued support to these communities, in line with our mandate and resources framework. I continue to stress that peace is a prerequisite for food security,” the Director-General added.
Already in November, Qu had called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza to ease civilian suffering and to facilitate the delivery of urgent assistance.
The Ministerial Declaration was adopted against the backdrop of the increasingly worrying situation in Gaza, where the population is experiencing catastrophic levels of conflict-induced food insecurity and a high risk of famine.
According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, the entire population of about 2.2 million people in the Gaza Strip is estimated to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 and above), the highest percentage of people experiencing such acute food insecurity that the IPC has ever classified for any given area or country.
About 50 percent of the population is projected to be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and at least one in four households (more than half a million people) conservatively assessed to now be in Catastrophic or famine-like conditions (IPC Phase 5).
FAO is already playing a crucial role in Gaza, particularly in terms of providing emergency relief and participating in rebuilding efforts. FAO is part of the joint UN flash appeal and is closely coordinating with the wider UN family and partners in responding most appropriately and effectively, in line with its mandate.
FAO has also issued a call for $20 million in the Nov 2023 UN Interagency Flash Appeal and plans to reactivate the production of perishable, highly nutritious food that cannot be imported as food aid, including fresh milk, meat, and vegetables.

The Socio-Economic Empowerment of Vulnerable Women in Ghor Al Safi through Improving Access to Safe inclusive and Green Public Spaces
The RC visited the developed park and community center (now named Zaha Cultural Centre- Ghor Al Safi), witnessing the transformative impact this joint UN project has had on the local community. With children playing in the rehabilitated and inclusive playground, local community members expressed their relief at their children’s improved safety, noting that before the project, children often played in the streets, leading to accidents. Mothers expressed gratitude for the safe space that fosters learning and play. The RC also saw the multi-use area being utilized for a market, where women trained through the project showcased their products. Discussions with beneficiaries revealed the center's positive impact, particularly for women and youth, offering tailored training programs on entrepreneurial skills and livelihood creation. Youth shared their learning experiences in the computer room, from coding for robotics to safe digital marketing for women-led businesses. The childcare area and multi-use room provided safe spaces for children and youth. Recognized as a success by local officials and community members, this project exemplifies the impact of collaborative UN efforts.
This project, titled “The Socio-Economic Empowerment of Vulnerable Women in Ghor Al Safi through Improving Access to Safe, inclusive and Green Public Spaces,” was completed in 2022 and jointly implemented by UN-Habitat, UNOPS, and ILO, in collaboration with Zaha Cultural Centre and the Municipality of the Southern Jordan Valley, who are now managing the rehabilitated public space and community centre. This programme had been funded by the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Multi Partner Trust Fund, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and growing vulnerabilities among marginalized women.

UN Women has partnered with the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization in its efforts to support women in Gaza.
15,000 women and girls in Gaza will receive life-saving assistance, as a result of a partnership between UN Women and the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization (JHCO). Supported by the Jordan Armed Forces, a first shipment left Jordan by cargo plane today for Al-Arish, to deliver much needed humanitarian assistance for women and girls in the Gaza strip. “Under the United Nations Flash Appeal for the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), UN Women has partnered with the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization in its efforts to support women in Gaza, in coordination with our offices in OPT,” said Nicolas Burniat, Country Representative, Jordan, UN Women. “UN Women commends the Jordanian government for its strong advocacy with the international community for a ceasefire and for its unwavering efforts to strengthen the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Gaza, especially their support for women and girls.” he added.

Title: United Nations in Jordan Urges Donors to Continue Essential Support for UNRWA
Content: 13 February 2024
Crisis in UNRWA Funding Endangers Critical Services in Jordan, Immediate Action Required
The United Nations in Jordan has warned of dire consequences for Palestine refugees in Jordan if funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is not immediately reinstated.
This comes in the wake of the suspension of funding by 16 donor countries following allegations against UNRWA staff in Gaza.  The decision by some of the Agency’s top donors to freeze their contributions may deprive UNRWA from over 51 percent of its forecast income for 2024, thus severely jeopardizing the critical humanitarian response in Gaza, and  the healthcare, education, relief,  social services and economic support to the broader Palestine refugee population in the region, including in Jordan.
“Palestine refugees in Jordan are deeply worried about the suspension of funding to UNRWA. If the current situation remains unchanged, we face uncertainty about our ability to continue providing all our services past the end of February,” said Olaf Becker, Director of UNRWA Affairs in Jordan.
UNRWA's extensive operations in Jordan, with an annual budget of around US $ 145 million and approximately 7,000 staff members, play a vital role in delivering essential services to Palestine refugee communities. These drastic measures can jeopardise the running of 161 schools serving more than 107,000 students, 25 health centers providing over 1.6 million medical consultations annually, and cash assistance support for 59,000 of the most vulnerable, as well as 20,000 Palestine refugees who have fled Syria. Furthermore, UNRWA is responsible for waste management in 10 official camps, where over 400,000 individuals live.
The United Nations Secretary-General has appealed to donor governments to reverse their decisions and “at least, guarantee the continuity of UNRWA’s operations”.
When UNRWA’s future hangs in the balance, so do the lives and hope of millions of Palestine refugees. Investing in UNRWA means investing in stability for the region. It means investing in the economic and social well-being of Palestine refugees and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. It means investing in the resilience of unwaveringly generous host countries like Jordan by helping to mitigate the pressures associated with hosting millions of refugees. And it means honouring the commitment of the international community to Palestine refugees and their rights until a just and durable political solution is found.
Mr. Becker reiterated that “UNRWA fully relies on donor contributions to ensure the continuous delivery of its services, as per its mandate towards Palestine Refugees. Disruption to funding would have very serious consequences for the Palestine Refugees we serve, and we therefore call on our donors to reconsider their decision and resume support to UNRWA, which is urgently needed now more than ever.”

Title: ILO and Jordan’s Vocational Training Corporation agree to recognize the prior experience of 1,000 beneficiaries
Content: 31 January 2024
The program aims to issue accredited certificates for Jordanian and Syrian informal workers in various economic sectors in Jordan.
ILO, with support from the US Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, under the project "Formalizing Access to the Legal Labour Market for Refugees and Host Communities in Jordan," signed an implementation agreement with Jordan’s Vocational Training Corporation to implement the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) program.
The RPL program aims to reach 1000 beneficiaries, half of whom are Jordanians and half Syrian refugees, with women constituting at least 30 percent of the beneficiaries. The goal is to facilitate recognizing their previous experiences, assessing their skills and competencies, and providing a training program to address gaps in education and their special needs. The program supports them in obtaining an occupational practice license and issuing licenses to Jordanian and Syrian workers who currently practice their professions informally in various economic sectors. The program will be implemented in several Jordanian governorates: Amman, Irbid, Zarqa, Mafraq, Jerash, Ajloun, Tafila, Madaba, and Karak.
The Vocational Training Corporation (VTC) will work to establish a steering committee to supervise the program's implementation and ensure high-quality results. They will conduct assessments to recognize the prior experiences of 1000 beneficiaries who are individuals with the skills, knowledge, and practical experience but lacking official recognition of their skills. The VTC will provide training to prepare beneficiaries for the skills test and issue occupational practice licenses in cooperation with the Technical and Vocational Skills Development Commission (TVSDC). Additionally, VTC will recruit and train staff for the RBL program, write reports, and develop a set of performance indicators to match the program’s objectives.
The project "Formalizing Access to the Legal Labour Market for Refugees and Host Communities in Jordan" stands on three robust pillars: First, increase access for Jordanians and Syrian refugees to benefit from meticulously crafted on-the-job training and skills validation. Second, supporting Jordanian and refugee women to enter and stay in the formal workforce. Skills training on entrepreneurship and business development will play a pivotal role in this journey. Third, access to work permits for Syrian refugees to increase their involvement in the workforce.
ILO Chief Technical Adviser in Jordan, Mr. Qais Al-Qatamin, emphasized the Program’s significance for skilled Jordanian and Syrian workers, stating, “Through this program, ILO aspires to formalize, develop, and certify skills and support Jordanians and Syrian refugees in obtaining work permits following their approved expertise to create a lasting positive impact on the beneficiary's lives and contributing to a more inclusive and resilient labor market.” His Excellency Engineer Ahmed Gharaibeh, Director-General of the Vocational Training Corporation, said: “The VTC is honored by this partnership with ILO. We aim to raise the quality of services provided to the local community as the percentage of students enrolled in vocational education during the next ten years is expected to reach 50%.” His Excellency also indicated that the RBL program will play an important role in spreading the culture of vocational education and issuing occupational practice licenses that recognize the skills and previous experiences of workers in this field, improving their social image and legally approving their experiences.
The ILO plays an important role in improving and developing the situation of workers in the Jordanian labor market and aims to support Jordanians and Syrian refugees to practice their work in a way that guarantees their rights and increases their efficiency.

Title: Statement by the Secretary-General - on UNRWA
Content: 28 January 2024
"I strongly appeal to the governments that have suspended their contributions to, at least, guarantee the continuity of UNRWA’s operations", UN Secretary General

The United Nations is taking swift action following the extremely serious allegations against several UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) staff members. An investigation by the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was immediately activated.
Of the 12 people implicated, nine were immediately identified and terminated by the Commissioner-General of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini; one is confirmed dead, and the identity of the two others is being clarified.
Any UN employee involved in acts of terror will be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution. The Secretariat is ready to cooperate with a competent authority able to prosecute the individuals in line with the Secretariat’s normal procedures for such cooperation.
UNRWA had also previously announced a full, independent review of the organization on 17 January.
Meanwhile, 2 million civilians in Gaza depend on critical aid from UNRWA for daily survival but UNRWA’s current funding will not allow it to meet all requirements to support them in February. While I understand their concerns – I was myself horrified by these accusations - I strongly appeal to the governments that have suspended their contributions to, at least, guarantee the continuity of UNRWA’s operations.
The abhorrent alleged acts of these staff members must have consequences. But the tens of thousands of men and women who work for UNRWA, many in some of the most dangerous situations for humanitarian workers, should not be penalized. The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met.

Title: FAO strengthens countries’ capacities in desert locust risk reduction in the East Africa and the Middle East
Content: 05 December 2023
Amman – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is conducting a 5-day training workshop for technical officers in charge of Desert Locust control from East Africa and the Middle East, aimed to enhance preparedness of their countries to effectively respond to desert locust outbreaks and invasions.
Participants to the desert locust contingency planning workshop have been drawn from both breeding and invasion countries, and these include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Somalia, Syria, and Uganda.
“The training comes at the right time, especially with predictions of an increase of desert locust threats during this time. The workshop will allow the discussion of the national plans of the participating countries, as well as the benefit of the practical exercise to be implemented by the participants for the proper application of the management tactics based on the agreed plans,” said H.E Eng. Khalid Hneifat, Minister of Agriculture of Jordan told participants underscoring the importance of the collaboration between the Ministry of Agriculture, and CRC and FAO.
Increasing vigilance – learning from the past
The 2019-2022 desert locust upsurge that hit the Central Region and the Horn of Africa, considered the worst crisis for decades, was successfully contained. However, it exposed gaps in preparedness towards Desert Locust management. The upsurge threatened food security and livelihoods of an estimated 35 million people, including small-scale farmers.
“Preparing to respond to Desert Locust emergencies is fundamental in preventing and controlling desert locust outbreaks. The training will equip officers with skills in developing and implementing Desert Locust contingency plans which serve as the benchmark for assessing the preparedness of national locust control units to effectively address locust crises,” Shoki AlDobai, Team Leader for FAO’s Locusts and other Transboundary Plant Pests and Diseases.
During the workshop, participants will review and update existing national contingency plans to enhance the countries’ vigilance, as preventive control does not fully guarantee that a crisis will not occur.
Addressing the participants, Nabil Assaf, FAO Representative in Jordan, encouraged the countries to engage and adopt contingency plans as they complement predefined national models for emergency plans.
The training is organized under the USAID/BHA funded project “Desert Locust risk reduction in the Central Region and Horn of Africa” implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in the Central Region (CRC).
Mamoon Alsarai Alalawi, Executive Secretary of the Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in the Central Region (CRC) said, despite ongoing efforts desert locusts remain a persistent threat to the region, therefore, such training will enhance early preparedness among front line countries to address any gaps between calm situations and emergency situations.
Step by step guide to manage locust operations
These emergency plans outline the procedural steps for managing locust-related operations during crises, considering the efficiency and availability of human resources and necessary assets within locust control units.
The training will enable every country to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of all national authorities involved in controlling Desert Locust. Additionally, simulation exercise for campaign management will be conducted.

It is in line with ARDD efforts in advocating for a participatory approach, ensuring collaboration with civil society in urban projects, and supporting government directions and policymaking for sustainability, crisis response, and societal peace.”
She added, “The project specifically sheds a light on Jabal Amman which encompasses over 50 civil society organizations and dynamic migrant and refugee communities. Together, these entities can contribute to overcoming challenges through civic participation in urban planning and facilitating access to essential services for the residents of that neighbourhood. Furthermore, this initiative serves as a valuable opportunity to assimilate and apply international experiences and best practices, and the generation of local knowledge in this significant field.”
This was emphasized by Deema Abu Thiab, the National Programme Coordinator for UN-Habitat Jordan, who explained, “Neighborhoods are central to the story and urban development of Jordan, whereby the challenges and opportunities of the Kingdom are intensely experienced at the neighborhood level, as we experienced during the COVID-19 lockdown, influencing the lives of every resident at every moment.”
Jabal Amman has been central to the modern history of Amman and holds a special place in the city's identity. With its rich history and diverse communities, it presents a unique set of opportunities to envision, in a participatory manner, equitable and sustainable communities. The signing of this MOU signifies a shared commitment by UN-Habitat and ARDD to harness this distinctive neighbourhood’s potential while addressing pressing issues such as urbanization, accessibility, resilience, and sustainability.

Title: Second regional Steering Committee convene on “Resilient Water Solutions Against Climate Change in Jordan and Lebanon” project
Content: 03 October 2023
Amman – In the context of the “Resilient Water Solutions Against Climate Change in Jordan and Lebanon” project, led by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), in partnership with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and national executing entities, the second Regional Steering Committee meeting in Jordan was held on 3 October, followed by visits to project sites on 4 October 2023.
Chaired by the Jordanian Minister of Environment Dr. Muawieh Khalid Radaideh and Lebanese Minister of Environment Dr. Nasser Yassin, the Committee meeting gathered the project’s national coordinators, local authorities, project partners and other relevant stakeholders. The Committee discussed project progress, milestones, challenges, and solutions, and operationalized a concrete platform for critical regional learning in both countries towards climate change adaptation solutions.
The meeting provided critical insight into the areas where regional exchange is mostly needed, with a focus on the two countries, and concluded with measures to further enhance the transfer of knowledge and experiences gained through project implementation. It also concluded with concrete entry points to promote the upscaling, replication and sustainability of the project, and served as a practical learning experience between Lebanese and Jordanian officials while visiting two wastewater treatment and reuse projects in Mafraq and Me’rad, a permaculture site at Jerash University, and the Urban Observatory of Greater Amman Municipality.
In his remarks, Radiadeh highlighted climate impacts on Jordan. “The climate-related challenges facing the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan are significant… rainfall rates have decreased by almost half over the past fifty years, while the share of water per capita has decreased by nearly 80%. Over the years, it has also become clear that climate change would impact various development sectors, including water, agriculture, urban areas, health, and society as a whole,” said Radaideh. “This meeting comes within the context of ensuring the effective implementation of the project, discussing the progression of project activities and benefiting from the diverse experiences in both countries, and working collaboratively to achieve the project’s objectives.”
Meanwhile, Yassin emphasized the importance of regional collaboration to adapt to climate change and stressed the importance of international funding. “Joint efforts amongst Arab states to combat climate change and its implications on the water sector are of utmost importance. There is a need to promote and adopt innovative measures in different sectors such as water, agriculture, management of forests and natural reserves,” said Yassin. “There is an unfulfilled commitment of industrial countries to fund adaptation projects in underdeveloped countries, where pledges committed during different climate summits have not reached 6% of the total commitments,” he added.
UN-Habitat Regional Representative (a.i.) for Arab States Rania Hedaya highlighted water scarcity amid displacement and increased urbanization in the Levant. “Water scarcity is one of the most pressing current issues causing concern for the future of our region. In addition to the effects of climate change, the Arab region is witnessing rapid urbanization accompanied by a large influx of refugees due to the spread of conflicts in the region. As our cities expand, this project’s interventions strive to address the complex interaction between urban growth, migration and climate change in both Jordan and Lebanon,” she said.
“For Jordan and Lebanon, climate change is exacerbating vulnerability in rural and urban communities and in formal and informal communities alike,” said Director of the Arab Centre for Climate Change Policies Cluster at ESCWA Ms. Carol Chouchani Cherfane. “This requires effective solutions that advance climate adaptation,” she stressed. “Your efforts identifying, testing and pursuing these solutions on the ground can be shared with others in the region and around the world.”
The project provides replicable and innovative measures to promote climate change resilience and adaptation in the Arab region, with a focus on promoting climate change and gender mainstreamed urban planning in areas facing extreme weather events, namely governorates of Mafraq and Irbid in Jordan and Zahle district in Lebanon.
Financed by the Adaptation Fund, the project works on enabling local communities to adapt to increasing temperatures and declining precipitation levels that mostly lead to droughts, in addition to the varying rainfall patterns, which negatively affect agriculture. Finally, the project focuses on the sustainable management and use of water resources through promoting water-efficient irrigation methods and permaculture, in addition to using non-conventional water sources, such as treated wastewater and harvested rainwater.
To promote regional knowledge exchange, the project also recently launched the virtual Community of Practice (CoP) “Urban Water and Climate Resilience in the Arab Region,” a platform that brings experts and practitioners together to discuss water-related climate change impacts on cities hosting displaced communities, including discussions around urban adaptation solutions.

Title: UNESCO and Greater Amman Municipality Organise a workshop on the Right to Access Information
Content: 02 October 2023
Amman – Commemorating the International Day for Universal Access to Information IDUAI, UNESCO Jordan and the Greater Amman Municipality organised a collaborative working day. This partnership underscores the organisations' commitment to promoting transparency, enhancing governance, and upholding the democratic right to access information.
"Access to information is the cornerstone of progressive and inclusive societies," stated Mr. Hatem Al Hamlan, Deputy City Manager for social development. "In collaboration with UNESCO, we strive to elevate the Great Amman Municipality as a regional benchmark for best practices. Our goal, through new protocols, is to ensure our citizens have uncomplicated and efficient access to information.
Ms. Min Jeong Kim, UNESCO Representative to Jordan, emphasized the need for a shift in strategy given the law's stagnation. She advocated for creating protocols in institutions that prioritize best practices in information accessibility and are in tune with Jordan's existing legislation. This approach ensures that institutions work effectively within the legal confines while ensuring maximum transparency and access.
The collaborative effort aims to position the Municipality at the forefront in information accessibility, with objectives including the creation of an action plan in alignment with the Jordanian Access to Information Law, capacity building for its officials, and a continuous roadmap for information accessibility.
The discussion, which was held at Al Hussein Cultural Center,  was conducted by  the legal expert Mohammad Qtaishat, aims to pinpoint the Municipality's strategies concerning information access and framing an action plan grounded in best practices, considering both public and departmental feedback.
UNESCO's commitment extends beyond this single event, with a pledged ongoing collaboration with the Municipality to ensure implementation of the day’s outcomes. This partnership's milestones will be featured in the MIL Cities segment during the upcoming Global MIL Week at the Dead Sea.
This collaboration is funded by the Multi-Donor Programme on Freedom of Expression and Safety of Journalists. The Programme enhances UNESCO's mission by channeling funds towards emerging priorities and pressing needs on freedom of expression, access to information, media development, and media and information literacy.

Title: Bank al Etihad and UNICEF renew partnership to empower young climate leaders in Jordan
Content: 01 October 2023
Amman – UNICEF and Bank al Etihad have renewed their partnership for a second year to continue empowering young people in Jordan to engage in climate action both in their communities and through national and global platforms.
Through the partnership, more than 1,500 young people aged 10 to 24 years, from all governorates of Jordan, will be equipped with the knowledge, tools and skills they need to engage in climate action.
In addition, dozens of young climate leaders and champions will receive the training and support they need to develop youth-led solutions to the climate crisis, while taking part in opportunities to advocate for action during key decision-making moments on both the national and global stage.
“Empowering young climate leaders is a promise for a brighter future,” said Nadia Al Saeed, chief Executive Officer of Bank al Etihad. “We are proud to renew our commitment with UNICEF, working hand in hand to equip Jordan's youth with the knowledge and tools they need to drive positive change in the face of climate challenges."
“The private sector is a critical partner for UNICEF to support youth-led innovation and progress on the climate crisis. We are delighted to renew our partnership with Bank al Etihad to give young people in Jordan the skills and opportunities they need to lead climate action for a more sustainable future,” said Philippe Duamelle, UNICEF Representative to Jordan.
With this support from Bank al Etihad, UNICEF will also ensure that young people in Jordan have their voices heard through their participation in the Local Conference of Youth on Climate Change (LCOY) held in Amman on 2-5 October, and as part of the Jordan country delegation attending the COP28 Climate Change Summit in Dubai in November.

Title: Measles-Rubella vaccine in Jordan is safe and effective at saving children’s lives – WHO and UNICEF
Content: 27 September 2023
Amman – The Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine, which is provided free of charge for targeted children in Jordan, is safe and effective at protecting children from deadly disease and outbreaks, said the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) who support the Ministry of Health’s national Immunization campaign.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of Measles vaccination coverage in Jordan has declined alarmingly, with approximately 112,000 children under five years of age (more than 6 out of 10 children in this age group) having missed their routine doses of measles-containing vaccine. The high number of unvaccinated individuals has already led to an outbreak of measles earlier in April 2023, when 163 measles cases were reported in seven governorates.
“Measles is a deadly and highly contagious disease, which is easily prevented through vaccination, but to create herd immunity and shield our communities, it is critical that we achieve a vaccination coverage of 95 per cent or higher of two doses of the vaccine,” said Dr Jamela Al-Raiby, WHO Representative to Jordan.
"Vaccines are one of humanity’s greatest and most remarkable success stories – eliminating diseases and saving countless children’s lives. Building back immunity in Jordan through routine immunization and catch-up campaigns will help protect children and prevent the public health system becoming overwhelmed with outbreaks,” said Philippe Duamelle, UNICEF Representative to Jordan.
The MR vaccine used is procured on the global market from the Serum Institute of India (SII). In 2022, SII accounted for approximately 236 million doses of MR vaccines shipped globally, representing around 80% of all MR vaccines used in the world. SII is one of only two companies prequalified by WHO to make and distribute this vaccine, 81 Member States are using SII MR vaccine across the world.
. The WHO prequalification means that the vaccine meets global standards of quality, safety, and efficacy. WHO follows rigorous standards encompassing potency, thermostability, presentation, labelling and shipping conditions are met and maintained through regular re-evaluation, site inspection, targeted testing and investigation of any product complaints or adverse events following immunization.
WHO recommends using measles rubella vaccine for outbreak response immunization in measles or measles/rubella outbreaks for the countries that have rubella vaccine in the routine immunization programme[1].
Since 2021 UNICEF has procured over 436 million doses of measles-rubella vaccine benefitting 57 countries around the world.
To respond to this threat, the Ministry of Health, with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Children’s Fund (UNICEF), developed a comprehensive measles outbreak response plan, including a key component of supplemental immunization activities for the Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine.
Both UN agencies reiterated their commitment to the Ministry of Health to support our shared goals to strengthen the primary healthcare system, provide health workers with the resources and support they need, and deliver lifesaving vaccines to children.

Title: The Ministry of Agriculture and WFP launch two new interventions under the "No Food Waste" initiative
Content: 20 September 2023
Amman – In a significant step towards addressing the issue of food waste, the Ministry of Agriculture and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), are launching two new initiatives under the national "No Food Waste" campaign.
These initiatives are in alignment with the National Food Security Strategy (2021-2030) and aim to establish efficient food waste management practices while introducing innovative solutions to address this growing challenge.
In the presence of His Excellency Eng. Khaled Al-Hanifat, the Minister of Agriculture and Head of the National Committee for Food Security, WFP signed two crucial agreements today to support the implementation of two initiatives.
The first initiative is a Hackathon for Food Waste Solutions in partnership with cewas, a Swiss organization renowned for promoting sustainable business ideas and innovative solutions. This hackathon will invite participation from small and medium enterprises, individuals, and universities in Jordan. Participants will receive essential support to nurture and scale-up their innovative ideas, ultimately contributing to the reduction of food waste.
The second initiative, 'Enhancing Food Waste Management,' involves a partnership with the Basmat Al-Hayat Association. This association is responsible for collecting surplus food from hotels and redistributing it to communities in need. The partnership aims to test a number of support activities to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of this initiative.
WFP and the Ministry of Agriculture are working on the development of an evidence-based approach to create an enabling umbrella for food waste management initiatives in Jordan, aiming to improve their efficiency and sustainability. Following an initial assessment, WFP has identified 15 local initiatives and conducted an analysis of the challenges they face. The proposed umbrella system will promote coordination and synergy among these initiatives.
H.E. Eng. Khaled Al-Hanifat highlighted the importance of His Majesty King Abdullah II speech at the United Nations, which touched on the human conscience, hunger, and the priority to achieve food security. He also emphasized His Majesty's meeting with the WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain. The minister reaffirmed the ministry's commitment to enhancing food security in alignment with the National Food Security Strategy and Economic Modernization Vision. He stressed the significance of addressing food waste as a significant challenge, especially considering Jordan's limited resources, and encouraged youth participation in finding creative solutions.
WFP Representative and Country Director in Jordan, Alberto Correia Mendes, expressed WFP's unwavering commitment to continue supporting the Jordanian government in operationalizing the National Food Security Strategy, and food waste reduction stands as one of the pivotal pillars within this strategy. He highlighted WFP's multifaceted approach, encompassing research, recommendations, and initiatives that seamlessly align with national priorities and the overarching goal of achieving efficient and sustainable food systems.
Moreover, WFP and the Ministry of Agriculture are preparing to launch a food waste awareness campaign. This campaign will draw upon insights from a qualitative study conducted by WFP, examining the social and economic factors contributing to food waste across various demographics in Jordan.
Jordan's food waste is estimated to be approximately 93 kilograms per person per year, equivalent to 955,000 tons of food. This staggering figure could provide sustenance for approximately 1.5 million people for an entire year. Food waste has direct negative economic, environmental, and social consequences, emphasizing its significance as a challenge that needs to be addressed to preserve precious natural resources.

Title: Swiss Ambassador to Jordan visits Amman New Camp and UNRWA Amman Training Centre
Content: 18 September 2023
Amman – H.E. Ms. Emilija Georgieva, the Ambassador of Switzerland to Jordan and Iraq, visited Amman New Camp and the UNRWA Amman Training Centre in Amman, Jordan. She was welcomed by Olaf Becker, Director of UNRWA Affairs in Jordan, and H.E. Eng. Rafiq Khirfan, Director General of the Department of Palestinian Affairs. The visit included a tour of the UNRWA Amman Training Centre where she was briefed on the vocational training provided to Palestine Refugee youth by UNRWA. Over the past three years, 4,655 students have graduated from UNRWA training centres in Jordan, of which 75 per cent of female students found employment within one year of graduating.
H.E. Ms. Emilija Georgieva, Ambassador of Switzerland to Jordan and Iraq, reflecting on the significance of this visit, commented: “The numbers of graduated students are impressive and speak for themselves. Thank you for your important work and the services you provide to support Palestinian refugees in Jordan.”
Switzerland is currently seconding a Gender Advisor to UNRWA Jordan Field Office to enhance gender mainstreaming within UNRWA policies so that both women and men have equal opportunities to reach their full potential. More recently, Switzerland funded the project, “Enhanced employability of Palestine Refugee youth in the field of digital technology for increased livelihood opportunities” which aims to develop the digital skills of Palestine Refugee youth to increase their employability, and chances to contribute overall to the Jordanian economy. This commitment remains consistent with UNRWA’s overarching objective of enriching the educational environment for Palestine Refugee students, who have found refuge in Jordan.
Mr. Becker expressed his appreciation for the Swiss Confederation’s diverse and substantial support to UNRWA through contributions to the Programme Budget and Emergency Appeals, saying:
"I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Switzerland for their unwavering support and solidarity with UNRWA and Palestinian refugees. Its dedication to gender mainstreaming, and Livelihoods of refugee communities has been exemplary. It is a testament to a commitment to empowering young Palestinian refugees, enhancing their employability, contributing to the local economy and overall, to a more dignified life. We value this partnership to enrich the educational environment for Palestinian Refugee students in Jordan. Together, we are making a tangible difference in their lives”.
Switzerland confirmed an annual contribution of CHF 20 million to the UNRWA Programme Budget in 2023-2024. In addition, in 2023, Switzerland announced a CHF 2.2 million top-up to its Programme Budget at the Agency’s Pledging Conference earlier this year, as well as CHF 1 million for the Emergency Appeal in Lebanon.

Title: Germany's euro 10 million contribution to WFP safeguards food assistance for refugees in Jordan
Content: 10 September 2023
Amman – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Government of Germany jointly announce a vital step in ensuring the continuity of food assistance for vulnerable refugees in Jordan.
Germany's generous contribution of EUR 10 million (US$10.8 million) arrives at a critical juncture, preventing the imminent suspension of food assistance for 410,000 refugees from Syria and other countries living across Jordan in the approaching month of October. The top-up brings Germany’s contributions to WFP’s humanitarian response in Jordan to EUR 50 million (US$54 million) in 2023 alone.
”As the second biggest bilateral donor to the Syria response, Germany remains committed to supporting refugees and host countries. We are glad that our contribution will help to avoid that vulnerable refugee families in Jordan are cut off from much needed food assistance”, the German Chargé d’Affaires, Dr. Florian Reindel, said. “We greatly appreciate the efforts of the Jordanian government and our humanitarian partners such as WFP in addressing the needs of refugees in Jordan.”
"We are deeply grateful for this vital contribution from Germany, which has arrived at a critical moment when WFP was facing the unavoidable scenario of suspending food assistance", said WFP Representative and Country Director in Jordan, Alberto Correia Mendes. "We count on our donor support now more than ever."
Even with this valuable financial support, WFP finds itself in urgent need of an additional US$10 million to prevent assistance suspensions for refugees in November. This funding is critical to ensuring the continuation of food assistance at the current reduced levels until the end of the year.
Thanks to Germany and other donors, WFP transferred US$108 million to more than 465,000 refugees through monthly cash assistance between January and September 2023, allowing refugees to cover their essential food needs and daily expenses. Germany is the second-largest donor to WFP globally and one of WFP’s top donors in Jordan.

Title: UNESCO Jordan Office celebrates the successful conclusion of field activities implemented on three heritage sites in Irbid Governorate
Content: 05 September 2023
Amman - Under the patronage of H.E. Dr. Fadi Balawi, Director General of the Department of Antiquities, the UNESCO Office in Jordan celebrated today in Pella the conclusion of the activities that were implemented in Irbid Governorate (Um Qais, Beit Idis, and Pella) under the EU Madad Fund project “Support to Livelihoods through Cultural Heritage Development.”
The project, falling under the umbrella of the EU Madad Fund, and implemented in close collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the Department of Antiquities, and the International Labor Organization (ILO) aimed at creating livelihoods opportunities for vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees, through the implementation of Employment Intensive initiatives in cultural heritage sites located in Northern Jordan.

Title: Japanese Foreign Minister and delegation visit UNRWA services in Amman New Camp
Content: 04 September 2023
Amman – A delegation from Japan, led by H.E. Yoshimasa Hayashi, Minister for Foreign Affairs accompanied by H.E Kensuke Nagaoka, Assistant Minister, Director General of Middle Eastern and African Bureau, and H.E. Jiro Okuyama, Ambassador of Japan to Jordan, was welcomed by Leni Stenseth, UNRWA Deputy Commissioner-General, Olaf Becker, Director of UNRWA Affairs in Jordan, and H.E. Eng. Rafiq Khirfan, Director-General of Jordan's Department of Palestinian Affairs in Amman New Camp, Jordan.
Dr. Akihiro Seita, UNRWA Director of Health highlighted the 70-year-old solid partnership of Japan and UNRWA, whereby Japan has supported the Agency’s health, education, and relief and social services. Dr. Oroba Al Mousa, UNRWA Chief of Education Programme, Jordan, provided an overview of the education programme serving Palestine Refugee children. She emphasized the programme’s successes and the academic challenges faced, including the learning loss that students suffered due to the COVID-19 crisis during the delegation’s visit to the UNRWA school.
The delegation subsequently visited the UNRWA Health Centre, to see first-hand the Agency’s health programme, health-care services, and notable achievements such as e-health and the roll-out of the mobile application of Mother & Child Health Book (MCH) and Non-Communicable Disease.
During his visit to the school, the Minister Hayashi engaged in pleasant conversations with the students, emphasizing the importance of investing in education. Additionally, he expressed his delight at witnessing the Agency’s initiatives in digital healthcare, a domain the Government of Japan has made substantial contributions.
“How opportune it is for UNRWA to welcome the Foreign Minister and his delegation into our school and health centre, on the year that we celebrate our invaluable partnership with Japan. Japan’s contribution is helping our students recover from learning losses and allowing us to recruit school counsellors to address mental-health challenges. It also supports the Agency’s ability to provide health services. We sincerely thank you for your solidarity and commitment,” said UNRWA Deputy Commissioner-General Leni Stenseth.

Title: His Majesty King Abdullah II calls for intensified efforts to combat tobacco use
Content: 31 August 2023
Amman – The WHO Country Office in Jordan wholeheartedly supports the recent directives of His Majesty King Abdullah II, urging the Government to escalate actions to combat the proliferation of smoking in Jordan, especially among the youth.
Dr Jamela Al-Raiby, WHO Representative to Jordan, commends His Majesty's steadfast commitment and reiterates the importance of collaboration between WHO, the Ministry of Health, other government entities and local communities to effectively curb the spread of tobacco use and safeguard the nation’s health.
In a recent meeting with government officials, His Majesty King Abdullah II underlined the pressing need to intensify efforts to combat tobacco use, particularly among young individuals. WHO stands firmly united with His Majesty in his visionary leadership and commitment to the well-being of the Jordanian people.
Dr Al-Raiby stated, "We proudly stand in solidarity with His Majesty's call to action. WHO, in line with our longstanding commitment since the early endorsement of WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) – a milestone in the promotion of public health – is dedicated to working closely with the Government and local partners to amplify our efforts in addressing the dangers of tobacco use."
According to the latest national Stepwise Survey, conducted by the Ministry of Health with the support of WHO, 66.1% of males smoke tobacco, in addition to 15.9% of men of the same group using electronic cigarettes. This ranks Jordan as one of the countries with the highest rates of tobacco use in the world. WHO and partners have been at the forefront of the fight against tobacco, and these renewed endeavours align seamlessly with the continuous work that has been undertaken since the early adoption of the WHO FCTC. Through strategic partnerships, we develop culturally sensitive campaigns and real actions that educate and empower the public about the multifaceted risks associated with tobacco use.
Furthermore, the recent successful Twitter storm orchestrated by the Ministry of Health and WHO with partners stands as a testament to our dedication in raising public awareness about the hazards of smoking, thereby amplifying the reach of our collective efforts.
The scale of the human and economic tragedy that tobacco use imposes is shocking, and preventable. The tobacco industry is fighting to ensure that the dangers of their products are concealed, but we are fighting back. As part of our ongoing commitment, we extend our appreciation to His Majesty King Abdullah II for his unwavering dedication to the health and prosperity of the nation.

Title: Saudi contribution to WFP will provide critical support to Syrian Refugees in Jordan
Content: 30 August 2023
Amman – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomed today a generous contribution of US$6.8 million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief), to support its operations in Jordan. This funding will provide much-needed support to Syrian refugees residing in camps and arrives just in the nick of time to avert imminent further cuts in food assistance.
The agreement was signed between Engineer Ahmed Al Baiz, Assistant Supervisor General of Operations and Programs, KSrelief and Mageed Yahia, WFP Representative to the GCC.
“As part of KSrelief strategic partnership with WFP, we are pleased to announce an important financial contribution to assist vulnerable Syrian refugees in Jordan,” said Eng. Albaiz. “With great optimism, we hope that this third phase of support for Syrian refugees will successfully achieve its goals and make a substantial impact in alleviating the food insecurity and malnutrition faced by Syrian refugees" he added.
“The Kingdom’s timely contribution will enable us to continue providing essential food assistance to Syrian refugees in camps amidst pressing funding shortfalls”, said WFP Representative and Country Director in Jordan, Alberto Correia Mendes. "This contribution is a testament to the strong partnership between the Kingdom and WFP, which has consistently focused on helping refugees meet their food needs and alleviating hunger for those in need."
Despite this new funding, WFP still urgently needs US$23 million to continue providing food assistance at current reduced levels until the end of the year. Without timely additional funding, WFP will be compelled to suspend assistance for in and out-of-camp refugees in October.
This important support to WFP operations in Jordan is not the first of its kind, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia previously contributed to provide assistance to Syrian refugees residing in camps in 2021 and 2022 with US$12.8 million and US$6 million, respectively. With this year’s contribution, the Kingdom reaffirms its role as a prominent donor supporting vulnerable refugees in Jordan.
WFP has been present in Jordan since 1964 as a strategic and operating partner for the Government of Jordan. Throughout this longstanding partnership, WFP has focused on enhancing the capacities of national institutions, their strategies, systems and programmes, while providing humanitarian and livelihood support to the most vulnerable populations.

Title: Italian Government and UNESCO to support local communities in the World Heritage sites of Petra and Wadi Rum
Content: 23 August 2023
Amman – The Italian Government and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) signed today a 1.5 million Euro partnership agreement for a new initiative in Petra and Wadi Rum, to safeguard cultural heritage and support local communities in engaging more effectively in the protection of the World Heritage sites, through sustainable practices and alternative livelihood opportunities.
This additional contribution to a long-standing partnership between the Government of Italy and UNESCO in Jordan was cemented in the signing ceremony held today at the UNESCO Jordan Office premises, in the presence of the Italian Ambassador to Jordan, Mr. Luciano Pezzotti, the UNESCO Representative in Jordan, Ms. Min Jeong Kim, and representatives from the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS).
During the signing ceremony, Ambassador Pezzotti underscored “the Government of Italy’s commitment to sustain Jordan’s efforts in protecting culture as well as conserving heritage places and manage them efficiently, as a reaffirmation of the Italian dedication to valorize cultural assets and safeguard the rich and diverse living heritage of highly significant places, and provide for international cooperation and assistance in the field of cultural heritage”.
UNESCO Representative, Ms. Min Jeong Kim, thanked the Government of Italy for its generous support and stated that, “UNESCO will work closely with the Government of Jordan, as well as the local authorities and communities, to focus on activities that could help alleviate some of the pressures on the sites due to the exponential increase in the number of tourists in recent years. The ultimate goal of the project is to support the sustainable preservation and development of the World Heritage sites for future generations.”
The two-year initiative entitled “Local Communities and Sustainable Tourism in Petra and Wadi Rum” will contribute to the sustainable protection of the two World Heritage sites, while focusing on empowering local communities to play an active role in the preservation of these invaluable places and creating livelihoods opportunities, especially for the women and youth.
The project will be implemented in close collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the Department of Antiquities, Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority (PDTRA) and the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA).

Title: Over the years, Jordanians maintain steadfast solidarity with refugees – UNHCR study
Content: 16 August 2023
Amman – Over 12 years after the start of the Syria crisis, Jordanians continue to show an outstanding level of sympathy for refugees and their inclusion in health and education systems.
Sympathy of Jordanians towards refugees remains stable at a very high level over a decade after the onset of the Syria crisis. This is a key finding of a new UNHCR survey published on Wednesday. 96 per cent of respondents expressed sympathy, compared to 95 per cent in November 2022 and similar levels in earlier editions of the survey on the perceptions of refugees by the host population in the Kingdom.
78 per cent of Jordanians say they support the continuing inclusion of refugees in the local community and national systems, such as education and healthcare as agreed in the Jordan Compact in 2016. 89 per cent agree that there is a state of coexistence between refugees and host communities.
“The survey’s findings are a testament to the compassion of the Jordanian people. Despite challenges, the survey reflects the country’s unshakable welcoming and hospitable culture towards people fleeing conflict and violence”, said UNHCR Representative to Jordan, Dominik Bartsch. “The survey provides invaluable insights as we work towards building stronger, more inclusive communities.”
The study, conducted for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, by Headway Jordan in May and June 2023, reflects the views of nearly 3,300 Jordanian women and men residing across the Kingdom. Earlier editions of the survey captured the perception of refugees since October 2020.
By listening to the host community, the survey contributes to a nuanced understanding of evolving dynamics and sentiments around refugees and provides valuable data for evidence-based decision-making and effective humanitarian and development programmes.
UNHCR works with the Government of Jordan and partners to ensure refugees access services and are included as contributing members in the Jordanian society and economy. For instance, UNHCR and several reputable educational institutions across Jordan have recently signed agreements to lower tuition fees for refugees of all nationalities to the amounts Jordanian students pay. The achievements made over the years will need the continued support of the donor community.
The survey can be found here.

Title: UN-Habitat and Permaculture Research Institute launch a pilot Permaculture project
Content: 10 August 2023
Amman – UN-Habitat Jordan signed an agreement of cooperation with the Permaculture Research Institute for the "Increasing the resilience of both displaced persons and host communities to climate change-related water challenges in Jordan" project that is funded by the Adaptation Fund which will be hosted within the premises of Jerash University.
In this context, Dr Mohammad Al-Tarawneh, Acting Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, underscored the project's importance in its focus on students and the local community. The enhancement and advancement of sustainable agriculture perfectly resonate with the university's educational objectives, which encompass diverse agricultural study tracks and farming techniques within master's degree programs. Additionally, the university is exploring incorporating permaculture as a dedicated course or practical training opportunity for students pursuing agricultural studies.
Ms. Deema Abu Thiab, National Programme Coordinator of UN-Habitat Jordan, highlighted the program's focus on two main projects in the Jerash Governorate. These projects involve developing a permaculture demonstration site in collaboration with Jerash University and the Permaculture Research Institute and rehabilitating and expanding the Al-Mearad Wastewater Treatment Plant in Jerash. The director emphasized the vital role of the university in achieving project goals by engaging students and the local community in promoting and developing the concept of sustainable agriculture.
The project's core initiatives in Jordan will primarily be located in Irbid and Mafraq. These endeavors encompass implementing rooftop rainwater harvesting systems across residential structures and educational institutions like schools and mosques. Furthermore, the plan involves integrating graywater systems within schools and mosques, enhancing wastewater treatment facilities, introducing innovative and effective irrigation methods for treated water, and establishing a permaculture demonstration site.
Mr. Hussein Muhsen, Regional Project Coordinator, underscored the project's significance, considering it a crucial first step in promoting and implementing Permaculture in Jordan in Jordan and Lebanon on a larger scale. He emphasized the project's potential to provide valuable lessons for future development and expansion of this agricultural approach.
On the other hand, National Project Coordinator Mr. Jawad Dukhgan highlighted the project's educational importance, noting that sustainability is a central objective. The project aims to involve not only students but also the local community. He affirmed the role of the Permaculture Research Institute (PRI) in collaboration with Jerash University and the UN-Habitat Jordan's office readiness to support the project implementation.

Mr. Sam Davies, representative of the Permaculture Research Institute (PRI), expressed the institute's team's readiness to execute the project in collaboration with Jerash University. He highlighted the availability of accumulated knowledge and the institute's preparedness to offer workshops, training courses, and educational sessions for the local community, students, and stakeholders.

Amman – The Italian Government and UN Women signed a 2 million euros agreement to implement the "Women’s Effective Engagement in Shaping the Future of Jordan’s Political Life" project, in a significant step towards promoting gender equality and enhancing women's participation in shaping the future of Jordan's political landscape.
Funded through the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), the overall goal of the project is to support Jordan’s efforts in creating an enabling environment for women’s effective political, economic and social engagement through a legislative system, policies, practices and perceptions that entrench social justice and provide equal opportunities for women.
To reach these objectives, the focus will be on strengthening both institutional and political actors. The project aims to involve a diverse set of stakeholders and social groups so to advocate for political and legal reforms, gender equality and women empowerment. Political parties and actors will be accompanied in the application of gender mainstreaming policy. In addition, crucial attention will be given to social norms and how the role of media improves the perception of women role in Jordanian political life. Finally, gender equality and women empowerment will be advocated for through awareness campaigns aimed at strengthening evidence on women’s political participation and leadership.
Nicolas Burniat, UN Women Jordan Country Representative, stated that, "We believe that when women are empowered and actively engaged in political processes, societies thrive. This partnership with Italy marks a crucial milestone in our collective journey towards achieving gender equality and women's empowerment in Jordan. By combining our strengths and expertise, we are confident that we can drive meaningful change and create an environment where women's voices are not only heard but also influence the future of the nation."
H.E. Mr. Luciano Pezzotti added “The Italian government is committed to supporting the empowerment of women and girls around the world. We believe that women and girls are essential to building a more just and inclusive society. This initiative, which is funded by the Italian government, will help to promote the participation of women in political life in Jordan. By providing training and support to women candidates and political leaders, we can help to create a more level playing field and ensure that women have a voice in the decision-making process.”
The signing of the Agreement reflects the commitment of both UN Women Jordan and Italy to create lasting impact by breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for women to participate effectively in Jordan's political life. Through joint efforts, innovative strategies, and unwavering dedication, the partnership aspires to contribute to a more inclusive and representative political landscape that truly reflects the diverse aspirations of Jordanian society.

The United Nations Resident Coordinator and representatives from 14 UN agencies in Jordan also took part in leading discussion the alongside an enthusiastic cohort of 70 young people representing the Politics Institute, Crown Prince Foundation, We Are All Jordan and the UN Youth Advisory Council.
The objective of the discussions was to foster substantive dialogue on youth-centric priorities in Jordan and to ideate innovative strategies that expedite the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The deliberations revolved around seven themes pivotal in shaping a sustainable future for the youth and propelling the Kingdom's advancement towards the SDGs and 2030 Agenda: education, decent work and volunteerism, climate action, food and water security, political participation and peace, health and equal opportunities.
During the opening, Minister of Youth Mohammed Al-Nabulsi emphasized that this event reflects His Majesty King Abdullah II's vision to promote youth participation in public life and enable them to contribute to the decision-making process. Youth are seen as a crucial pillar in the modernization reforms, aiming to enhance political and economic opportunities for Jordanian youth.
The Minister highlighted that nurturing a young generation of leaders actively involved in political, economic, and social life is a national priority and that this is translated through the National Youth Strategy's pillars and the programs and projects it entails, focusing on youth skill development, capacity building, and their role in peacebuilding, community security, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals.

Ritsema-Anderson further added, "By providing young minds with a platform to raise and discuss ideas with senior decision makers, we unlock a wellspring of creativity, energy, and passion to address complex national and global challenges. I commend the leadership shown by all participating Ministers today and applaud the commitment of young people to be part of finding answers to challenges. The UN is proud to partner with the Ministry of Youth, the Government of Jordan broadly, and with young people in this effort."
The unprecedented convergence of Ministers, UN leaders and young people generated a range of alternatives, initiatives, and solutions to pressing challenges relevant to the priorities of discussion. Outcomes of discussions will be submitted to the Government to propel the youth's voice and vision to the forefront of Jordan's development trajectory.
“Today marks an important step towards strengthening communication channels between one-third of the population - the young men and women - and decision-makers. This engagement is fundamental to breaking the cycles of poverty within Jordanian societies and improving economic and living conditions, providing the basis for nurturing educated and conscious generations. Investing in the youth is paramount to our mission,” said Nourhan Al Gharabli, member of the UN Youth Advisory Council on behalf of the participating youth.
UN agencies participating in the event included: UNFPA, UNICEF, UNHCR, UNIDO, UN WOMEN, WFP, UNRWA, UNDP, UNV, ILO, UN Habitat, FAO, WHO, and UNESCO, magnifying the impact of the collective endeavor.

Title: Switzerland signs USD2 million partnership with UNESCO and the Ministry of Education to support education system strengthening
Content: 20 July 2023
Amman – A signing ceremony was held today, to formalize an additional contribution of USD 2 million from Switzerland to the Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) in support of the “System Strengthening Partnership with Jordan’s Ministry of Education” (SSP) programme, implemented with UNESCO technical support under the leadership of the Ministry of Education.
Swiss Ambassador to Jordan and Iraq, H.E. Emilija Georgieva, signed over the contribution to the UNESCO Representative to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Min Jeong Kim.
This latest contribution follows an initial grant of USD 1,6 million in 2021 when Switzerland joined Canada, Italy and Norway as a member of the Multi Partner Trust Fund for a multi-year initiative to support the Ministry of Education (MoE) in one of the core domains of its Education Strategic Plan (ESP) on system strengthening. With UNESCO’s technical assistance, the initiative provides overall support to the ESP implementation, monitoring and reporting; strengthening core functions in crisis sensitive and evidence-based planning and budgeting; data management; gender responsiveness; partnership and coordination; as well as strengthening institutional and individual capacities in these areas at both central and field directorate levels.
His Excellency the Minister of Education, Professor Azmi Mahafzah, chaired the ceremony which was held at the Ministry of Education. He highlighted that “this additional contribution from Switzerland will support the critical need to ensure that system strengthening efforts of the Ministry of Education continue to be the foundation that underpins the process of a transformative education.” He also reiterated the firm commitment of the Ministry to this partnership supporting system strengthening.
H.E. Emilija Georgieva, Ambassador of Switzerland, stated that “the Jordanian government, particularly the Ministry of Education, has shown unwavering commitment to adopting a holistic and evidence-based approach in its goal to transform the education system (through research and analysis). We firmly believe that such a data-driven approach will provide a solid foundation for the advancement of education in Jordan. Switzerland is proud to continue this partnership and provide support to this significant endeavor.”
UNESCO Representative to Jordan, Min Jeong Kim, stated that “this generous contribution from Switzerland will allow UNESCO to continue our support to the MoE to transform and reinforce its education system to be more resilient and responsive to crisis, while continuing to build robust governance and information management systems for evidence-based planning, monitoring and decision making. The initiative is in line with the Sustainable Development Agenda and Goals, particularly related to SDG4 on education, SDG 5 on gender equality and SDG 17 on partnership.”
The new contribution of USD 2 million will build on achievements made so far under the SSP programme, which was established in 2019, and be used to support the realization of a more resilient and robust education ecosystem in Jordan based on the principles of partnership and coordination. It will also build on previous support to the development of the Education Management Information System (EMIS), which continues to be a key component of the MPTF programme, through the provision of specialized technical support to the MoE to reinforce its capacity to maintain, manage and utilize EMIS for evidence-based policy formulation and planning.
Also in attendance at the ceremony other MPTF members were represented by H.E Tarik Ali Khan, Ambassador of Canada to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, H.E. Espen Lindbæck, Ambassador of Norway to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Ambassador designate to Iraq, and Emilio Fralleone, Charge d’Affaires at the Italian Embassy to the Hashemite Kindgom of Jordan. From the MoE, the Secretary General for Administrative and Financial Affairs, Dr. Najwa Qubeilat and the Secretary General of Jordan National Commission Ibtisam Ayoub was also in attendance, alongside, the Head of the Department of Educational Planning & Research, Dr. Youssef Abu-Alshaar, and the Director of the Queen Rania Center for Education & Information Technology, Engineer Monieb Tashman.

Title: UNHCR warns of “serious consequences for refugees” if funding crisis is not tackled now
Content: 18 July 2023
UNHCR warns of “serious consequences for refugees” if funding crisis is not tackled now.
Amman - “The current lack of funding for the refugee response is undermining the great achievements made in over a decade”, warned Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Representative in Jordan. There is growing concern that Jordan’s ability to include refugees in health and education might be eroded. “Sustained support over the years has allowed Syrian refugees to access the labour market. Now there is an imminent risk that the situation is sliding back into a humanitarian crisis with serious consequences for refugees and host communities.”
Recent announcements by the World Food Programme (WFP) to reduce the value of its monthly food assistance for refugees in Jordan’s refugee camps from 23 to 15 Jordanian Dinars, (some 32 and 21 US$ respectively) comes after several other reductions of assistance in recent months: non-government organizations that used to provide health services left Zaatari and Azraq camps leading to serious shortages and quality issues of remaining health facilities. Due to the funding gap, tens of thousands of vulnerable refugees are gradually being excluded from WFP’s assistance to prioritize the poorest families.
“Jordan has done so much, and donors need to recognize what is at risk”, said Bartsch. Determined and coordinated action is needed to “keep the success story Jordan alive.”
Lack of assistance is already exacerbating the vulnerability of refugees. Data by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, saw the number of refugee families who cannot pay their rent and are at risk of eviction from their homes rise by 66 per cent from December 2022 to February 2023.
Another consequence of lack of assistance is that it may push refugees on to irregular routes towards Europe. UNHCR is concerned about their protection after leaving Jordan as they are exposed to exploitation, abuse, and death. “The recent shipwreck off Greece was a stark reminder that people who do not see a perspective, make desperate choices”, said Bartsch hinting at the Mediterranean crisis 2015/16.

Title: Tight funding forces WFP to reduce food assistance for Syrian refugees in Jordan, including in camps
Content: 18 July 2023
Cairo – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said today that further reductions in food assistance for refugees in Jordan have become unavoidable as funds run precariously low. The food agency is compelled to reduce by one-third the monthly cash assistance for all 119,000 Syrian refugees in Zaatari and Azraq camps.
Starting in August, Syrian refugees in the camps will receive a reduced cash allowance of US$21 (JOD 15) per person per month, down from the previous amount of US$32 (JOD 23). Syrian refugees living in both camps have limited income sources with only 30 percent of adults working – mainly in temporary or seasonal jobs – while 57 percent of camp residents say cash assistance is their only source of income.
“We are deeply concerned about the potential deterioration of families’ food security but as funding dries up, our hands are tied,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Jordan Alberto Correia Mendes. “These reductions are likely to lead to increased negative coping strategies.”
Negative coping strategies, including child labour, withdrawal of children from school, child marriage, and accumulating more debt, have already increased among refugees in camps by 25 percent compared to last year.
The reduction in the level of assistance highlights the urgent challenges faced by WFP in providing crucial support to vulnerable refugees in Jordan. Despite reducing the value of its cash assistance for all refugees living outside camps and gradually excluding approximately 50,000 individuals from the assistance to prioritize the poorest families, WFP still faces a critical funding shortfall of US$41 million until the end of 2023.
Since the onset of the Syria crisis, WFP has steadfastly provided life-saving support to vulnerable Syrian refugees in Jordan, ensuring their access to basic food needs. However, with mounting funding challenges, WFP has been compelled to scale down its response to stretch the limited available resources.
WFP acknowledges the unwavering support of the Jordanian government and its people in hosting Syrian refugees over the years. As the situation evolves, WFP is keenly aware of the shared responsibility to safeguard the well-being of refugees and will continue to work diligently with partners and donors to explore sustainable solutions.
Across the region, funding constraints have forced WFP to scale back assistance in Syria and in Palestine as low funding left the food agency with little room to continue providing assistance at previous levels.
WFP is grateful for the generous support from donors and appeals to the entire international community to support our critical lifesaving and life-changing operations – big or small – to ensure that no hungry families are left behind.

Title: UN in Jordan releases 2022 report, concludes five-year Sustainable Development Framework
Content: 13 July 2023
UN provides support, implements programs worth over US$ 1 billion in 2022
Amman — The United Nations (UN) in Jordan on Thursday released its “Annual Results Report for 2022”. The report also marks the completion of the five-year UN Sustainable Development Framework (UNSDF), which began in 2018. The report showcases the contributions and achievements of 20 UN entities in the Kingdom, encompassing both humanitarian and development initiatives throughout the reporting year.
According to the report, the value of UN programming in 2022 was US$1 billion. Overall, the UN has implemented $4.6 billion of humanitarian and development programmes during the 5-year lifespan of the UNSDF (2018-2022), advancing key priorities and implementing projects in three main areas: Strengthened Institutions, Empowered People, and Enhanced Opportunities.
Working in collaboration with Government, civil society and communities, the UN contributed to the development of national legislation, policies, and strategies that resulted in advancements in economic development, health care and nutrition, education, information management systems, women’s and youth empowerment, and more.
"The UN in Jordan is proud to have contributed to Jordan’s sustainable development in 2022, while also maintaining our crucial support for Palestine, Syrian and other refugees and Jordanian host communities,” commented Sheri Ritsema-Anderson, the UN Resident Coordinator in Jordan, on the results report. “These results are not ours alone, they reflect the joint effort of all partners working together, underpinned by generous donor support.”
Looking forward, the Government of Jordan and UN are finalizing a proposed new Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for the years 2023-2027, prioritizing four key areas of joint work: (1) inclusive, gender-responsive green growth and decent work; (2) social protection and quality basic services; (3) sustainable management of and access to water, food and energy and climate change mitigate and adaptation; and (4) strengthened Government institutions, and accountability, transparency and participation. Twenty-eight UN agencies, funds, programmes and offices will work under the umbrella of this new five-year framework.
“The UN remains a steadfast partner to the Kingdom as it works towards achieving its reform vision and the advancement of the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals, while also continuing its exemplary hospitality to refugees, however, the UN needs sustained funding to do this,” stated Ritsema-Anderson.
“I am deeply concerned by funding shortfalls that are threating to interrupt key activities that support both Jordanians and refugees in the next months. I call on all partners to find ways to sustain our gains, maintain financial support where needed, and achieve humanitarian and development objectives in Jordan. Through collaborative efforts, we can ensure that no one is left behind.”

Title: UN urgently calls on harnessing digital agriculture to combat climate change
Content: 11 July 2023
FAO and ITU hold Digital Agriculture Solutions Forum 2023
Amman – Today high-level officials, United Nations representatives and agri-business field experts have gathered to highlight the need of positioning digital solutions at the heart of agriculture transformation towards more inclusive, sustainable, efficient and resilient agrifood systems, amidst rising challenges of climate change.
“We must identify, develop and sustain national digital agriculture solutions to benefit the agriculture community and ensure a food secure world that benefits the backbone of our food producers – smallholder and family farmers across our region,” said  AbdulHakim Elwaer, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for the Near East and North Africa (NENA).
This came during the Digital Agriculture Solutions Forum 2023 organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in collaboration with CGIAR, to examine and present long-term digital agricultural transformation tools.
Land and water resources in NENA are limited and facing severe stress. Climate change projections suggest more drought and extreme events. In light of this, a transformative approach is needed to support agricultural production systems to become more productive and more sustainable to address these challenges.
“Digital agriculture has the potential to help smallholder farmers become more resilient and improve their livelihoods. However, effective partnerships and incentives are needed to sustain an inclusive digital ecosystem,” stated HRH Princess Basma bint Ali, FAO Goodwill Ambassador for NENA.
FAO and ITU have been working with member countries to develop the E-agriculture Strategy Guide – a framework for a holistic approach to identifying, developing and implementing national digital solutions for agriculture, which has now been implemented in more than 20 countries.
“In order for digital agriculture to be sustainable and impactful, a cohesive government approach needs to be adopted – complimented with inputs from all sectors of society. Stakeholders from both the digital and agriculture sectors have important roles to play, and they should be guided and driven by a national digital agriculture strategy.  ITU and FAO are partnering together to assist countries in the Arab region to adopt such strategies with the goal of accelerating the implementation of the SDGs in the Arab region,” added Adel Darwish, Director of the Regional Office for the Arab States at ITU.
FAO’s global partnerships with ITU and CGIAR ensures the organization’s commitment to the implementation of the FAO Strategy on Science and Innovation in NENA while addressing the dire needs of our members in the region.
During the Digital Agriculture Solutions Forum 2023, discussions highlighted the need to utilize Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to bridge the gap between agricultural researchers, extensionists and farmers, thereby enhancing agricultural production and revenue. In addition, emphasis was given to the transformative potential of remote-sensing technology and sensor equipment in revolutionizing water management practices and fostering sustainable agriculture in the region. Similarly, importance was given to digital financial services, marketing and agriculture insurance as having the capacity to enhance the financial inclusion, profitability and safety nets of smallholder farmers.
The forum hosted an exhibition showcasing innovative practices, from the public and private sector, successfully designed, implemented, and promoted to respond to some of the main challenges of the region.
The Digital Agriculture Solutions Forum is being held in Amman, Jordan from 11-13 July and it is leading up to the Science and Innovation Forum 2023 (SIF), which will be hosted by FAO in October. This year’s SIF will be “Science and Innovation for Climate Action”, aligned with the overarching World Food Forum (WFF) theme “Agrifood systems transformation accelerates climate action”.
FAO’s SIF 2023 will focus on enhancing the accessibility of the most appropriate climate technologies, innovative practices and local knowledge in agrifood systems for climate change adaptation, resilience and mitigation.

Title: UN launches campaign, calling for renewed global ambition and action for the Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 05 July 2023
Public mobilization comes ahead of critical halftime Summit in September at UN in New York
New York - The United Nations, today, is kicking off a communications campaign to rally for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap for people and planet adopted by world leaders in 2015.  Ahead of a critical UN Summit in September, the campaign aims to amplify an urgent call for ambitious new action, showcase the Goals as the blueprint for sustainable progress globally, and galvanize the global public around this shared agenda for our common future.
At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the SDGs is in peril. For the first time in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects.
The 2023 SDG Summit will gather world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 18-19 September to reaffirm their collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to leave no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the world back on track to achieving the SDGs.
Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and countries worldwide, the UN campaign aims to re-energize the conversation about the Goals.
“We want to get everyone on board for the SDGs”, said Nanette Braun, Director of Campaigns in the UN Department for Global Communications. “Our hope is that decision-makers and individual citizens alike will feel inspired to join the conversation and contribute to achieving the Goals with new resolve and ambition.”
Building off the color wheel brand of the SDGs, the campaign uses a dynamic new visual system for its messaging to build momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the SDGs.
One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to take action on the SDGs through the UN’s ActNow initiative across all 17 Goals. From using public transportation, to fundraising for schools or speaking up for equality, the platform lists steps that everyone can take to accelerate progress on the SDGs and create better lives on a healthier planet for all.
A curated group of high-profile influencers, the Circle of Supporters, will galvanize their communities to take individual action on the SDGs and to impress upon decision-makers the urgency to act now.

Title: UNHCR in Jordan Celebrates World Refugee Day, Emphasizing Inclusion and Empowerment
Content: 02 July 2023
Hope away from home, a world where refugees are always included.
Amman - UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, commemorates World Refugee Day, celebrating the resilience, courage, and contributions of refugees to their host communities, while highlighting the importance of inclusion and empowerment.
With the presence of ambassadors and representatives from the international community, heads of UN Agencies and partner organizations, UNHCR organized an evening to celebrate the strong bonds between the refugee and host communities and reflect on the inclusion of refugees in the different sectors.
While refugee crises around the world have only been increasing with time, Jordan has long been and continues to be an exemplary host of refugees and asylum-seekers. This year, UNHCR recorded over 110 million forcibly displaced people, the highest level on records as per UNHCR’s Global Trends report published last week, which has more than doubled in the past ten years. Jordan’s generosity and hospitality towards refugees have opened the door for an inclusive approach, fostering social cohesion and enabling hundreds of thousands of refugees to find safety, protection, and hope away from their homes.
“This World Refugee Day, we also focus on the remarkable resilience and determination of refugees, their potential as envoys of positive change and contributing members of the society. With tens of thousands of refugees enrolled in education and engaged in the labour market here in Jordan, refugees have demonstrated their skills and ability to become self-reliant when the world shows its support. The multiple experiences here tonight, such as Ahmad from Syria, and Adel from Jordan, showed us how much can be achieved when working together” said Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Representative to Jordan. He added “it is now more important than ever to sustain the international support to refugees in Jordan who face multiple challenges on this day and every day.”
World Refugee Day, observed annually on 20 June, serves as a global platform to raise awareness about the plight of refugees worldwide and the urgent need for solidarity and support. This year’s theme, “hope away from home, a world where refugees are always included”, underscores the significance of collective efforts in providing refugees with opportunities to rebuild their lives and contribute to their host communities through inclusion.
This day also serves as a call to action for the international community to strengthen their support for Jordan and other countries hosting large numbers of refugees. Sustained funding is vital to ensure the continuation of essential services and to facilitate long-term solutions for refugees.

Title: UNESCO organises workshop on cartooning in bid to counter hate speech
Content: 25 June 2023
Amman - Recognising the urgent need to counter hate speech, UNESCO organised a three-day workshop in Amman, led by the cartoonist Omar Abdallat.
A group of 10 journalists and visual artists united to harness the power of editorial cartooning, exploring innovative ways to promote diversity and combat hate speech, according to a statement from UNESCO.
Hate speech fuels fear and division, with far-reaching consequences for democracy and social cohesion. In a world where freedom of expression is threatened, cartoons have emerged as a powerful tool to expose injustice, highlight important topics, and ignite empathy and understanding. As prominent cartoonist Omar Abdallat puts it: "Cartooning has the ability to challenge social issues, spark conversations, and inspire change”, read the statement.
The workshop provided an opportunity for these professionals to enhance their skills, expand their portfolios, and enrich the quality of journalism by integrating drawings into their written articles.
Afnan Abu Yahya, a digital journalist, highlighted: "Participants gained insight into the history of caricature, expanding their perspectives and strengthening their visual thinking abilities. This knowledge proved valuable for multimedia reports and addressing political, social, and economic issues.”
Shurooq Al Nsour, an investigative journalist, discussed the integration of editorial cartooning in investigative and data-driven journalism.
Shurooq said: "The workshop explored how caricature can enhance the delivery of targeted content, amplifying visual engagement in journalistic material."
Shurooq stressed the valuable role of editorial cartoons in enriching investigative journalism with visual storytelling, simplifying complex issues, and conveying impactful stories sensitively.
By selecting resonant symbols, caricatures can effectively communicate messages that influence government directions and decisions. Issam Abbadi, a content writer and editor, initially struggled with painting but discovered the power of expression through drawing and symbolism.
Issam explained: “Although I didn't emerge as a master painter from the workshop, I gained valuable insights on interpreting ideas and employing visual representation to convey the intended messages.”
Ikhlas Al Khawaldeh, UNESCO Programme Specialist, said: “This initiative has strengthened the participants’ resilience to hate speech, extremist narratives, and conspiracy theories”.
“In an era where freedom of expression face numerous challenges, caricature remains a powerful force. Through their bold strokes and insightful symbols, cartoonists wield their pens as instruments of change, reminding decision-makers of their responsibilities and inspiring them to reconsider their positions,” she added.
Ibrahim Tonnerieux, a workshop participant, and a visual artist said: "The workshop equipped me with practical knowledge to enhance my drawing skills and effectively convey complex ideas using simplicity and humour. It also deepened my understanding of hate speech and its impact on communities, while providing new avenues for artistic expression."
As a street artist, Ibrahim added: "I plan to utilise this newfound knowledge to create compelling murals that raise awareness about hate speech and its detrimental effects on society”.
These workshop activities were supported by UNESCO's Multi-Donor Programme for Freedom of Expression and Safety of Journalists (MDP).

Title: The Ministry of Agriculture, WFP and FAO launch a food waste management enabler initiative
Content: 25 June 2023
Amman - Under the framework of the No Food Waste Initiative, the Ministry of Agriculture, in collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), launched an enabler project aimed at empowering and supporting local initiatives that work on food waste management in Jordan.
The project will serve as a coordination platform gathering all national initiatives under one umbrella institutionalized under the Ministry of Agriculture and providing tools to maximize the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of food waste management efforts in Jordan across various levels.
During the launch event, the Minister of Agriculture and Head of the National Committee for Food Security, H.E. Eng. Khalid Hnaifat, met with local initiatives that have been working on food waste management where his excellency emphasized the importance of preventing food waste, considering the limited resources in Jordan. He highlighted that wasted food in the country could feed 1.5 million people for an entire year.
“Addressing food waste through multiple interventions is crucial for tackling food security challenges and aligns with the objectives outlined in the National Food Security Strategy,” said Laurene Goublet, WFP Deputy Country Director in Jordan. “Through this project, we aim to empower local initiatives and contribute to the country’s progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.”
On his part, FAO Representative in Jordan, Nabil Assaf, stated: “Prioritizing the reduction of food loss and waste is critical for the transition to sustainable agrifood systems that improve the efficient use of natural resources, lessen their impact on the planet and ensure food security and nutrition.” Assaf also pointed out the importance of integration in addressing the issue of waste and food loss, and that the cost of this phenomenon exceeds the value of food and depletes the limited natural resources in Jordan.
This intervention is part of the broader No Food Waste Initiative launched by the Ministry of Agriculture in November 2022. Recently, the Ministry, in partnership with WFP and FAO, initiated the first formative research focusing on consumption practices that contribute to food waste. This research is a step towards developing a nationwide campaign to raise public awareness about economic and environmental consequences of food waste and encourage actions to reduce it.

Title: UNESCO holds second Festival of Encounter to celebrate diversity of Jordan’s refugee communities
Content: 20 June 2023
Amman - From workshops and games for children to traditional Iraqi dabke, Sudanese dance and music performances, visitors to the Festival of Encounter (FoE) should expect a celebration of the diversity of Jordan’s refugee and migrant communities.
The festival’s second iteration will be held this Friday and Saturday in commemoration of World Refugee Day, marked annually on June 20.
The first edition of the festival was hosted by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS), an international Catholic organisation that advocates for refugees and vulnerable communities. This year, UNESCO has joined JRS as a co-host.
JRS communications and advocacy manager Silvia Mazzocchin told The Jordan Times that this festival seeks “to again create this space and this beautiful moment” following the success of last year’s event.
“Our inspiration to co-host the FoE this year stems from our conviction that sustainable development relies on a strong cultural component,” UNESCO Representative to Jordan, Min Jeong Kim, said in a statement sent to The Jordan Times.
“By creating opportunities for encounter, dialogue and sharing, the FoE serves as a platform for building bridges of mutual understanding, empathy and inclusion among communities that have experienced displacement,” Kim added.
Event goers will find a colourful and diverse space celebrating the refugee and migrant communities from Yemen, Sudan, Syria, Somalia, Eritrea, the Philippines, Iraq and Palestine, according to Mazzocchin.
Activities for children and teenagers will be held throughout the two-day festival, followed by live music and traditional dance performances. A bazaar with hand-made products will be sold during the event, alongside a cultural fair where members of the refugee communities will display traditional clothes and share stories from their homelands.
The festival will conclude with talks titled, “Giving back to the community”, during which change-makers from different fields within refugee and migrant communities will share their experiences engaging in community work with the goal to inspire others, Mazzocchin said.
“Through the FoE, we aim to promote cross-cultural skills and facilitate an environment where different cultures can flourish and thrive together. By fostering respect, understanding and open dialogue, we contribute to lasting peace and the development of a more inclusive society,” Kim said.

Title: The Ministry of Agriculture, WFP and FAO join forces to tackle food waste in Jordan
Content: 15 June 2023
The collaboration supports the No Food Waste Initiative.
Amman – The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), in collaboration with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is launching the first formative research focused on consumption practices that lead to food waste. This research supports the No Food Waste Initiative - a national awareness campaign launched last year to address the critical issue of food waste in Jordan while promoting responsible consumption practices.
The research findings and insights will further guide the development of the national campaign by identifying target audiences, understanding consumption practices, identifying industries with high levels of food waste, and establishing impactful evidence-based interventions and initiatives.
“By raising awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of food waste through evidence-based data, we inspire individuals, organizations, and the public to take ownership of and actively contribute to its reduction,” said Laurene Goublet, WFP Deputy Country Director in Jordan. “Reducing and preventing food waste is an important component of the National Food Security Strategy and contributes to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.”
The staggering global facts on food waste highlight the urgency of this issue. Approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption is wasted worldwide. In Jordan, food waste is estimated at 93 kg per person per year, amounting to 955 thousand metric tons of food that could sustain 1.5 million people for an entire year.
Under the framework of the National Food Security Strategy (2022-2030), the Ministry of Agriculture, with the support of WFP and FAO, is working on multiple interventions to tackle food security challenges, including the No Food Waste Initiative and the first management information system on food security, among others.

Content: 14 June 2023
The young people received three months skills training combined with ‘on-the-job’ training.
Amman - Through the Azem programme from UNICEF and The Business Development Centre (BDC), in partnership with Royal Jordanian, fifty young people graduated as Cabin Crew today at an event in the national carrier’s training centre.
The young people received three months skills training combined with ‘on-the-job’ training - allowing them to develop their foundational, employability and English language skills, while also completing the necessary safety and technical training and receiving a salary. Each of the graduates will be employed by Royal Jordanian to start their careers as Cabin Crew.
“Young people need to be equipped with the right skills to access jobs in the labour market and transform their futures,” said Philippe Duamelle, UNICEF Representative to Jordan. “UNICEF is working closely with the Government of Jordan, civil society and private sector partners to provide young people with the skills, training and support they need to succeed. This partnership between UNICEF, BDC and Royal Jordanian demonstrates how effectively this can be done.”
Samer Majali, Vice Chairman/CEO, Royal Jordanian, said: “RJ, the national carrier of Jordan, has a strategic aim as part of its social responsibility efforts to help Jordanian youth find employment. RJ cooperates with its partners on various programmes that help young Jordanians pursue successful careers in the burgeoning local aviation sector. This partnership with UNICEF and BDC will support young Jordanians who dream of building their careers in air transport.”
"BDC programmes aim to incorporate young Jordanians into non-traditional work sectors, enhance their livelihoods and boost their skills for global competency. With UNICEF’s support and partnering with different sectors, including the aviation industry, and companies, such as Royal Jordanian, our youth programmes aid economic growth and reduce unemployment in Jordan," said Ghaleb Hijazi, BDC General Manager.
Azem is part of UNICEF’s Learning to Earning programme - supporting vulnerable adolescents and youth to access meaningful employment and income through training and entrepreneurship support that reflects the needs of the labour market. The On-the-Job Cabin Crew training is generously supported by the United States Government.

Title: UNIDO's "Creative Jordan" Empowers Textile Value Chain, Celebrates Winners of KHAYT Fashion Design Competition Finale
Content: 14 June 2023
Amman – Funded by the Italian government, KHAYT Fashion Design Competition Finale, a flagship event under "Creative Jordan” project, organized by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in partnership with the Garment Design & Training Services Center (GSC), concluded the first round of Spring/Summer collection. This remarkable event not only showcased the Spring/Summer outfits designed by nine talented designers in 2023, but also aimed to support Jordan's textile value chain, generating employment opportunities, and fostering economic growth in Jordan.
Distinguished speakers, including Eng. Sulafa Mdanat, the Country Representative of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in Jordan, H.E. Mr. Luciano Pezzotti, Ambassador of Italy to Jordan, Mr. Emilio Cabasino, the Head of the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) Amman, and Eng. Jumana Kilani from the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Supply, delivered opening remarks, setting the tone for an evening of creativity, innovation, and collaboration. Their presence highlighted the significance of supporting the textile industry to drive economic opportunities in Jordan.
The runway showcase segment commenced with an introduction of the event theme and goals. The competition rules and judging criteria were briefly explained, setting the stage for the nine designers to present their extraordinary creations. Each participant had a designated time slot to captivate the audience with their unique outfits. The runway showcase demonstrated the exceptional talent and vision of the designers.
A side event featured insightful speeches by Dr. Jinjiang Yan, project manager at UNIDO HQ, who shared the remarkable outcomes of the project and announced the opening of the textile hub established at GSC. Dr. Yan expressed gratitude to donors partners, participants, and attendees, recognizing their indispensable support in making the event a resounding success. Eng. Ihab Qadri, the representative of the leather and garment industries sector at the Jordan Chamber of Industry, and Mr. Hassan Nsour, Acting CEO of the Garment Design & Training Services Center (GSC), shared their insights and experiences related to the fashion and textile industry. Engaging the audience through a Q&A session, the speakers fostered dialogue and encouraged interaction, contributing to the enrichment of the event.
The highly anticipated Award Ceremony celebrated the exceptional talents of the participating designers. At the end of the event Sanaa Mohammad was announced as the winner of this round of the competition in various categories, such as Best Design, Most Innovative, and others, highlighting his/her exemplary contributions to the fashion competition. The deserving winners were presented with prestigious awards and offered congratulatory remarks and were able to share their joy and gratitude.
Guided by the transformative concept of upcycling, Sanaa ingeniously breathed new life into the surplus fabric that amassed within factories. With meticulous craftsmanship, she seamlessly repurposed and redesigned these remnants, harmoniously blending elements of the past and present. The invaluable lessons passed down from our ancestors resurfaced as she artfully incorporated traditional patchwork techniques, reminiscent of the time-honored quilts and blankets crafted by generations before her.
Inspired by the splendor of mosaics, Sanaa saw how small fragments, when woven together, could birth breathtaking artistic masterpieces. Drawing from this realization, her designs emerged as a testament to environmental conservation and the profound impact of reducing waste in the fashion industry. Each garment radiated a harmonious blend of elegance and sustainability, exemplifying the beauty that can be found in repurposed fabric.
From this transformative concept, a remarkable capsule collection emerged—a manifestation of Sanaa's unwavering commitment to reviving discarded fabrics. What could have easily been consigned to landfills or burned became a captivating symphony of unique and feminine pieces, brimming with timeless charm.
KHAYT fashion design competition, as part of the “Supporting the Textile Value Chain to Create Employment and Economic Opportunities in Jordan” project under the name “Creative Jordan”, made a significant impact in supporting Jordan's textile value chain by providing employment opportunities and contributing to the economic growth of the country.

Title: Driving Change: Jordan Hosts the 2023 Annual Technical Consultation on Female Genital Mutilation
Content: 14 June 2023
Amman – Jordan is hosting this week the 2023 Annual Technical Consultation of the global joint programme of UNFPA-UNICEF on the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). This consultation brings together more than 100 participants, key stakeholders and experts from more than 22 countries- including countries not supported by the Joint Programme, such as Indonesia, Liberia, Niger, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania- to exchange lessons, achievements, and challenges in the implementation of the programme.
The Joint Programme, now in its 2nd year of the fourth phase of implementation (2022-2030), strives to create a world free from FGM, where every girl and woman has a voice, choice, and agency. By partnering with governments, civil society, development partners, and communities, the Joint Programme supports the development of policies, access to services, empowerment of girls and women, and social and gender norms change.
“We need to consider how we work amidst the rising tide of conflict and instability that is enabling millions of more cases of FGM to take place” stated HRH Princess Basma, who is the Goodwill Ambassador of UNFPA, in a recorded message at the opening of the consultation meeting, “We must address the worrying trend of health personnel performing FGM, giving this ghastly practice a sheen of respectability. And we must continue to work to promote women and girls agency and leadership, empowering them to affect change and end this terrible practice,” She added.
The three-day Annual Technical Consultation provides a platform for staff from UNFPA and UNICEF to share experiences, progress, and strategies for adaptation. In-depth discussions and reflections focus on intervention areas, including the humanitarian-development nexus, cross-border issues, medicalization, gender-transformative acceleration, climate change, and social and behavior change.
Since 2012, Jordan - which has the second highest share of refugees per capita in the world - has received migrants and asylum seekers from countries with high FGM prevalence rates, such as Sudan, Somalia. and Yemen.
UNFPA’s recent research investigating on the magnitude of the FGM phenomenon among non-Syrian refugees shows generally declining rates of the practice since the arrival in Jordan, and yet showed evidence of FGM still occurring, with unaddressed needs for the women and girls survivors, in particular when seeking counselling and healthcare services. (Female Genital Mutilation among non-Syrian Refugees/migrants in Jordan report)
“One is too many, forcing even one girl or grown woman to be subjected to any form of harmful practices is outrageous, let alone millions of girls around the world.” Said Laila Baker, UNFPA Arab State Regional Director. “To me FGM is about a girl being denied forever the right to protect her own body and dignity, the right to feel or sense normal human feelings of intimacy in the future and most importantly to feel like a “whole complete woman.” Baker added.
The Amman meeting provides an advocacy opportunity for the host region. Senior government officials are joining the opening ceremony, and representatives from the selected country/region are sharing their experiences in addressing FGM.
UNFPA remains committed to achieving zero gender-based violence and harmful practices including eliminating FGM globally and protecting the rights and well-being of every girl and woman.

Title: Ministry of Education, UNESCO holds Joint Education Strategic Plan Annual Review
Content: 13 June 2023
Amman – Under the Patronage of the Minister of Education, H.E. Prof. Azmi Mahafzah, the Ministry of Education (MOE) kicked-off a two-day joint review of the progress made in 2022 in implementing its Education Strategic Plan (ESP) with education stakeholders and partners.
In preparation for the event, which includes participants from the Royal Hashemite Court, the Prime Minister’s Performance and Delivery Unit (PMDU), Ministry of Education, Ministry of Planning and International Coordination, education sector partners and stakeholders, the MoE published its ESP annual report for 2022.
The report, which forms the basis for the annual review meeting, summarizes progress on all six ESP domains (Early Childhood Education, Access, and Equity, System Strengthening, Quality, Human Resources and TVET) in 2022, while identifying key challenges and recommendations that will inform strategic planning for 2023/2024. The ESP annual report states that 2022 was marked with recovery from the adverse effects of Covid-19, and significant progress in all ESP domains are noted despite the number of priorities that remain to be addressed in the education sector, such as Technical and Vocational Education and Training or universalization of KG2.
The joint annual review meeting will provide MoE staff and education stakeholders in Jordan with the chance to exchange on these conclusions, and further identify key actions that can jointly be taken to achieve the Kingdom’s educational goals. Among those are the need to set up the necessary foundations to achieve compulsory and free KG2, further investment in communication and IT infrastructures, scaling up teacher training, and reforming the national TVET system.
Joint renewed commitments to the right to education for all was done by MoE and partners, in line with SDG4 to ‘Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all “and the National Commitment of Jordan at the UN Transforming Education Summit (TES) in September 2022. The meeting will also be an opportunity for policy dialogue on key issues of education financing, partnership, and coordination.
Gender equality in education will also be a central thematic area of the discussions in the next two days. Both in terms of progress made, as well as taking the opportunity to share the results of the mid-term review of the implementation of the ESP’s Strategy for Gender Equality in education (SMGEE) and to discuss the update of the related Gender Equality Action Plan (GEAP). Progress on gender issues in education has been observed in Jordan, but there are still persistent challenges, including a reverse gender gap in education, with lower attendance and performance recorded amongst boys.
During the opening of the joint annual review, His Excellency said “We have a strong determination to progress together, while striving to realize the goals of the Public Sector Modernization and Economic Modernization Vision, while building upon our achievements in the education sector. Our objective is to enhance the quality, competitiveness, and outcomes of the educational process across all levels, aligning them with the national priorities, and standards to ensure sustainable development and modernization”.
The co-chairs of the Education Development Partners Group also commended the Ministry of Education for all the work that has been done under the ESP, especially in ensuring that refugees are included within the ESP. “There is a need to continue ensuring that inclusion of refugees (Syrian and non-Syrian), girls and disabilities is prioritised across the education sector, directorates schools and within the systems”.
The support provided to the MoE for the development of their 2022 ESP annual review report is part of ongoing technical assistance to the MoE by UNESCO and its International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) under the System Strengthening Partnership (SSP), currently being implemented under a Multi-partner Trust Fund (MPFT) supported by Canada, the Italian Agency for Development and Cooperation (AICS), Norway, and Switzerland.

Title: The Ministry of Agriculture, WFP and FAO hold workshop to guide the development of Jordan’s first food security management information system
Content: 12 June 2023
Amman – The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), in collaboration with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), organized a three-day technical workshop to validate a set of food security indicators identified for the development of Jordan’s first management information system on food security.
The system, which comes within the framework of the National Food Security Strategy (2022-2030), aims to enhance national capacities to monitor progress on food security objectives and SDG targets and guide the decision-making process for relevant actions related to food security. Reaching a consensus on the indicators is crucial for establishing an efficient and robust system.
The workshop was held under the patronage of H.E. Eng. Khalid Hnaifat, Minister of Agriculture. In his opening remarks, Minister Hnaifat said: “We are proud of what has been accomplished in recent years, particularly the noticeable improvement in Jordan's ranking on the global food security index, where Jordan jumped from 62nd place in 2020 to 47th place in 2022. Despite the decrease in freshwater allocated for agriculture by over 20% in the past decade and the significant increase in population, Jordan has achieved a self-sufficiency rate of 61.4% in 2021”.
"The development of the National Food Security Management Information System is a significant milestone for Jordan and will enable concerned stakeholders to make informed, evidence-based decisions for a food-secure Jordan,” said Laurene Goublet, WFP Deputy Country Director in Jordan. “WFP remains committed to continue supporting the government with the operationalization of the National Food Security Strategy, in line with Jordan’s Economic Modernisation Vision.”
The outcomes of this workshop will serve as a foundation for the development of the National Food Security Management Information System. The aim is to launch the first run of a fully functional system by the end of 2023. This comprehensive platform will enable monitoring and analysis of food security in Jordan based on agreed-upon local and global indicators. It will provide analytical reports and timely early warning feeds to concerned stakeholders, ensuring proactive responses to food security challenges.

Title: UNICEF and DAA bring economic empowerment opportunities to vulnerable youth in Jordan through hydroponic farming
Content: 08 June 2023
Jerash – UNICEF and Dar Abu Abdallah (DAA) have partnered on a sustainable hydroponic project in Jordan to deliver training and income-generating opportunities to vulnerable young people, aged 18 to 24 years.
Under this project, which covers 11 locations across Jordan, the ‘Bab Amman’ hydroponic farm in Jerash was officially opened today. This project aims to empower youth with the skills they need to carry out demand-driven farming using modern, environmentally friendly techniques that increases productivity and conserves water.

“We are immensely grateful to UNICEF for their support and strategic partnership with Dar Abu Abdullah. Today marks a milestone as we are opening our fourth hydroponic farm, 'ADDAR Farm - Bab Amman,' which will not only provide young people with the means to generate a stable source of income, but also contribute to the sustainable development of our community. This transformative project, was made possible by the unwavering dedication of UNICEF and our local partners, which is considered a significant step towards improving the livelihoods of vulnerable youth in Jordan. By equipping them with the necessary skills and resources, we are empowering these young, fostering a brighter future for all.” Samer Balkar, Director General of Dar Abu Abdullah said.

The visit coincides with the 70th anniversary of the partnership between Japan and UNRWA and highlights Japan’s continued commitment and support to UNRWA and Palestine Refugees.
The Princesses were joyfully received with songs performed by students at the UNRWA ANC Preparatory Girls School No.2 where they were briefed about Palestine Refugees, UNRWA services and Amman New Camp. They also learned about the UNRWA education programme, challenges such as learning loss and improving the mental health among students and how UNRWA is making efforts to address them.
During a lively tour inside the school, the Princesses had an interactive dialogue with UNRWA Student Parliamentarians, who talked about their roles as student representatives of the school and their community, challenges they face in their education, and their ambitious aspirations for the future.
At the UNRWA health centre, the Princesses were briefed about the health program and how UNRWA has been protecting the health and wellbeing of the Palestine Refugees. This includes the innovative e-health services, the Maternal and Child Health Mobile Application (e-MCH), and the “Your Health” Non-Communicable Diseases Mobile Application (e-NCD).
In expressing their gratitude for Japan's support, UNRWA officials emphasized that this support is vital and enables the Agency to keep essential services uninterrupted and demonstrates the international responsibility and solidarity with Palestine Refugees.
"We are deeply honored by the visit of Her Imperial Highness Princess Takamado and Her Imperial Highness Princess Tsuguko of Takamado and very grateful for Japan's unwavering support for UNRWA and the Palestine Refugees," said Olaf Becker.

Title: FAO strengthens forest reporting for a greener, more sustainable future in the Near East and North Africa region
Content: 29 May 2023
Regional workshop in Amman (Jordan) to strengthen technical capacities for the Global Forest Resources Assessment
Amman - Representatives from countries in the Near East and North Africa gather this week in Amman, Jordan, for a four-day workshop organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for the compilation of crucial forest data estimates for the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA 2025).
The Near East and North Africa regional workshop will contribute to improving the quality and consistency of the data reported to FRA 2025. By presenting transparent, reliable and comprehensive overviews, FRA will equip stakeholders to make informed decisions that impact forests and their sustainable management.
The workshop has been opened today by Her Royal Highness Basma bint Ali, in her role as FAO Goodwill Ambassador for Near East and North Africa, and His Excellency Eng. Khalid Hnaifat, the Minister of Agriculture in Jordan, at the presence of FAO Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf.
Around 15 forest experts officially nominated by their countries joined from Algeria, Bahrein, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Tunisia to improve reporting on forest data, understanding FRA 2025 terms and definitions, guidelines, and the effective use of the dedicated online platform for compiling their country reports.
This workshop will provide an opportunity for the national correspondents to review and update the previous reports to ensure that data is as complete, consistent and transparent as possible and to improve the quality and reliability of the FRA 2025 estimates. The participants will test innovations, such as geospatial tools, and will also have the opportunity to address specific problems of the region and benefit from the experiences of other countries.
Data and knowledge for a greener, more sustainable future
FAO has been conducting periodic assessments of forest resources at the request of its Members Countries. These assessments serve as a vital tool for improving our understanding of the world’s forest resources, conditions, management and uses. “Together, we have the power to make a significant impact on the preservation and sustainable management of our forests. Let us seize this opportunity to exchange knowledge, build partnerships, and pave the way for a greener, more sustainable future”, H.R.H. Princess Basma bint Ali said in her opening.
H.E Eng. Khalid Hnaifat, the Minister of Agriculture in Jordan emphasized “the importance of international cooperation in addressing the global challenges facing our forests. We are committed to actively participating in regional and international initiatives that promote knowledge exchange, capacity building, and collaborative action. By working together, we can tackle issues such as illegal logging, forest degradation, and the loss of biodiversity, ensuring a sustainable future for our forests.”
FAO Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf said that “FRA, in collaboration with other partners, work to reduce overlaps in the data collection and the reporting burden on countries, minimizing the duplication, and increasing the quality and consistency of the reported data.”
FAO’s FRA is the official source of data for the two global indicators of Sustainable Development Goal 15 and provides important data for monitoring forest cover change and other parameters that will help assess progress towards the climate targets and those of the UN Strategic Plan on Forests.
FRA offers a wealth of information that provides a holistic perspective on the world's forests and the transformations they undergo. The latest assessment, FRA 2020, examines the status of, and trends in more than 60 forest-related variables in 236 countries and territories in the period 1990–2020. This extensive dataset enables the formulation of well-informed policies, implementation of effective practices, and strategic investments in the field of forestry.
In March 2023, FAO launched a strategy for FRA 2025 capacity development and data collection, marked by a series of regional workshops to provide technical assistance and guidance to the national correspondents. In addition, these meetings serve as a valuable forum to exchange information and good practices. FRA 2025 reporting and data collection process will be completed by the end of 2023, followed by the data analysis and preparation of the official FRA 2025 publication and other products.
The Near East and North Africa regional workshop was funded by the European Union which has been supporting the development of FRA 2025.

Title: UNESCO supports Ministry of Education to launch its Crisis and Risk Management Strategy
Content: 21 May 2023
Amman – The Minister of Education, H.E. Prof. Azmi Mahafzah, launched the Crisis and Risk Management Strategy for the Ministry of Education in Jordan (2023-2027) marking an important step towards strengthening the education sector’s response to crisis.
The Crisis and Risk Management Strategy aims to ensure that the Ministry of Education (MoE) can guarantee a safe and secure educational environment and continuity of quality education in the face of the different risks and hazards facing Jordan. The strategy focuses on addressing the risks posed to education in Jordan by identifying key system-wide strategic actions to ensure that education actors, including schools and students, can develop a localized and decentralized approach to crisis and risks management.
The Strategy was developed with the technical support of UNESCO and its International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) through an extensive Kingdom-wide consultative process. It is aligned with Jordan’s Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy (2023-2030) developed by the National Center for Security and Crises management (NCSCM). It is also anchored in the Ministry’s Education Strategic Plan (ESP) 2018-2025 with crisis and risk management as an enabler of system strengthening to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all.
Ms. Min Jeong Kim, UNESCO Representative to Jordan, congratulated the Minister of Education for the development of the Strategy. “Once again, Jordan has demonstrated its commitment to ensuring that all children and youth can exercise their right to education. By institutionalizing crisis sensitive planning, the Ministry is paving the way for a more resilient, efficient and responsive education system for the Kingdom”.
“Risk Management is a regional and international priority, and requires strengthening of national policies, strategies and plans in line with international frameworks such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. This is what the Ministry of Education has successfully achieved” said H.E. Mr. Saleh al-Sheyyab, Director of Strategic Planning from the National Center for Security and Crisis Management.
H.E. Prof. Azmi Mahafzah thanked UNESCO and IIEP for their support in the development of the Strategy and stressed on the importance of partnerships at all levels as a key pillar for crisis and risk management. “Thanks to the support of our partners in this important area, and in cooperation with the NCSCM, the Ministry of Education will be able to further ensure that it can meet its commitments towards ensuring the delivery of quality education during crisis. This is part of our Government priorities, including in our ESP and Economic Modernization Vision” he said.
In addition to the launch of the Strategy, the MoE, also with UNESCO/IIEP support, has recently established for the first time a Risk Management Unit, which will have central role in the implementation of the Strategy. The Unit, alongside key MoE officials, is already working on a costed-operational plan.
The support provided to the MoE for crisis sensitive planning is part of UNESCO’s ongoing technical assistance being provided to the MoE under the System Strengthening Partnership (SSP), currently being implemented under a Multi-partner Trust Fund (MPFT) supported by Canada, the Italian Agency for Development and Cooperation (AICS), Norway, and Switzerland.
The Crisis and Risk Management Strategy was launched under the Patronage of H.E. the Minister of Education, and attended by representatives from the NCSM, the National Center for Cybersecurity, and key education sector partners and stakeholders.

Title: UNHCR and Yarmouk University sign MoU to lower fees for all refugee students
Content: 18 May 2023
Irbid - UNHCR recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Al Yarmouk University aiming to facilitate the access of refugee students to higher education in the undergraduate and graduate programmes of this prestigious institution by reducing financial barriers.
Thanks to this initiative, several thousand refugee students of all nationalities will have the possibility to study everything from Architecture to Law to Medicine in Al Yarmouk University starting from the first semester of the academic year 2023-2024, at a lower fee. Exempting them of the international students’ fees will provide them the opportunity to study at the lower, regular (non-competing) rate of a Jordanian student.
“UNHCR welcomes that refugees will be charged the same fees as their Jordanian peers”, said UNHCR Representative Dominik Bartsch, “this important step will allow more young refugees to live up to their full potential professionally, whether in Jordan or in their home country”.
Later this month, UNHCR is launching a series of roundtable meetings with boards of trusties and presidents of other public universities in the Kingdom, in an effort to cooperate with these institutions to ensure refugee students can access quality education without major obstacles, as part of the 15by30 goal. 15 stands for 15 per cent enrolment of refugee students at higher education institutions, while 30 stands for by 2030. UNHCR contributes US $45,000 to assist Al Yarmouk University in establishing three smart hall rooms, to support the development of the infrastructure of the country’s higher education scene.
The 15by30 goal is part of the broader Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4), and is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the UN in 2015. The goal recognizes that education is essential for achieving sustainable development and reducing poverty, inequality, and social exclusion. This includes investing in teacher training and professional development, improving infrastructure and learning materials, and leveraging technology and innovation to enhance learning outcomes.
This comes timely as the United Nations celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights later this year, and this initiative aligns with Article 26 on the right to education for all. The generous collaboration by Al Yarmouk University reflects the continuous hospitality of Jordan as a host country to hundreds of thousands of refugees, and the contribution of its national institutions to preserve the basic rights of refugees.

Title: FAO Regional training workshop aims at building regulatory capacity to align trade, food safety and quality measures in order to enhance intra-regional trade
Content: 08 May 2023
Amman - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is holding a regional workshop in Amman, Jordan on enhancing food trade in the Near East and North Africa Region: Food safety and trade facilitation over four days, from 8-11 May, in cooperation with the International Trade Center (ITC) and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
The workshop was inaugurated under the patronage of His Excellency Eng. Khalid Hnaifat, the Minister of Agriculture in Jordan with the presence of FAO Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf, and the Eng. Amjad Rashaideh, head of food directorate at the Jordan Food and Drug (JFDA). The workshop is attended by mid-senior level officials responsible for trade, food security and food safety related issues, from relevant ministries such as the trade, commerce, agriculture, health and/or authorities such as the customs and food safety
The workshop aims at improving the understanding of the government officials, national authorities and other relevant target groups of the science based standards (e.g. codex), transparency and traceability as well as harmonizing food safety processes and customs check. It will explore the trade-related aspects of food safety with agriculture, health and trade officials and experts examining the challenges and opportunities arising from rapid technological change and digitalization in food systems, in addition to new technologies which offer tools that can assist in managing food safety risks and help trade flow more smoothly.  Furthermore, discussions will explore how to ensure low- and middle-income countries can use and benefit from these tools.
H.E Eng. Khalid Hnaifat, the Minister of Agriculture in Jordan, while inaugurating, stated that, “The Ministry of Agriculture in Jordan attaches the utmost attention to the issue of food safety with the aim of ensuring the circulation of safe and secure products for consumers. Various control methods are being applied in cooperation with all agencies and public and private sectors to ensure safe and high-quality products, which constitutes a solid barrier in the face of violating agricultural products. From access to internal or external markets.”
FAO Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf, confirmed that “Improving food safety is an essential element of improving food security, which exists when populations have access to sufficient and healthy food. At the same time, as food trade expands throughout the world, food safety has become a shared concern among both developed and developing countries.” He added “Governments in many countries have established new institutions, standards, and methods for regulating food safety and have increased investments in hazard control.”
The Head of Food Directorate at the JFDA, Eng. Amjad Rashaideh referred to the institution's relentless endeavor to advance in the field of control and to contribute to the safety and security of food through good planning of control programs and through investing in human resources with experience and competence in the field of food control, both local and imported.
FAO Senior Economist and Regional Head of Strategy and Policy, Mr. Ahmad Mukhtar, highlighted the importance of a roadmap and regional action plan to harmonize the regulatory standards, enhance cooperation and facilitate safe intra-regional trade. He pointed out the uniqueness of this Workshop by inviting variety of stakeholders, and particularly holding the Private Sector Roundtable.
Capacity Development is at the heart of FAO's mandate. In FAO’s view, Member Countries lead and manage their own development process, while FAO supports them in this endeavor by strengthening their capacities to achieve their own goals in food security, nutrition and agricultural development. FAO targets its capacity development support at individual, organization and policy level.
Food security is a major challenge in the Arab region. Agricultural production in Arab countries, which continues to be an important livelihood for many of the poorest, is failing to keep up with the demands for accessible and stable food supplies for the region’s burgeoning population.  With the expanding populations are increasingly reliant on food imports through trade.  Therefore, trade is critical for achieving food security in our region. For details, please have a look at https://www.fao.org/3/cc2302en/online/cc2302en.html
Many countries are looking to increased intra-regional trade as an opportunity for growth. Several regional economic communities (RECs) have developed or are developing various agreements to facilitate intra-regional trade in some cases with separate protocols to guide the regulation of animal health, plant health and food safety within the community.

Title: Jordan joins League of Arab States, UNODC in signing Regional Framework for Arab States (2023–2028)
Content: 26 March 2023
Cairo - In continuation of the strong cooperation between the League of Arab States (LAS) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the “Regional Framework for the Arab States (2023 – 2028)” was signed and the “Arab Plan for Prevention and Reduction of the Dangers of Drugs to Arab Society: Towards Effective Handling of the Issue from a Social Perspective” was launched today Sunday the 26th of March at the LAS Headquarters. H.E. Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Secretary-General of LAS and H.E Ms. Ghada Waly, UNODC Executive Director co-signed the aforementioned Regional Framework (2023 – 2028).
The signature of the Framework and the launch of the Plan included the participation of H. E. Ms. Nivine El Kabbaj, Minister of Social Solidarity of the Arab Republic of Egypt and Permanent Member of the Executive Office of the Council of Arab Ministers of Social Affairs, H. E. Maryam Bint Nasser Al-Misned, Minister of Social Development the State of Qatar and Chair of the 42nd session of the Council of Arab Ministers of Social Affairs, and with the presence of the Permanent Member States’ Ambassadors at LAS, a number of Ambassadors of different countries, in addition to Heads and Representatives of United Nations bodies and agencies.
The Regional Framework for the Arab States 2023-2028 acts as the overarching strategic framework for cooperation between UNODC and LAS. It frames how UNODC will strengthen, prioritize, customize, and deliver support to the Arab region in effective response to some of the most pressing challenges faced by these countries and in connection with UNODC’s mandates and specialties.
The Regional Framework articulates six focus areas for guiding UNODC-implemented programming at the regional and national levels and they are: a balanced approach to drug control, strengthening the response to organized crime, combating trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants, action against corruption and financial crime, preventing and countering terrorism and violence, and strengthening crime/violence prevention and criminal justice.
Furthermore, the Regional Framework applies six key accelerators across all programmatic interventions to speed up progress and maximize efforts towards fast-tracking the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and they are: partnerships, women and girls, innovation, science, and forensics, human rights, youth and children, and inclusive and people-centered programming. The programme will also support UNODC’s partnership expansion with Member States in the region to include current vital Ministries and Institutions relevant to youth, solidarity, education, culture, human rights, countering corruption; in addition to previous partnerships with the Ministries of Justice, Interior, and Health.
The event also saw the launch of the Arab Plan for Prevention and Reduction of the Dangers of Drugs to Arab Society: Towards Effective Handling of the Issue from a Social Perspective. This important plan represents a regional social framework for combating drugs in the Arab States by highlighting the social dimension of drug demand reduction in the context of its negative impact on social development in specific and sustainable development in general. This is also at the heart of efforts to achieve the Arab Declaration adopted by LAS in 2016 to implement the Sustainable Development Agenda 2023. The present document provides an indicative vision for guiding Arab action towards a comprehensive and integrated response based on scientific evidence and consistent with Arab specificity of this phenomenon. The Plan aims to build national strategies and action plans that meet national requirements and includes a number of initiatives, projects and activities that achieve their objectives in complementarity with Arab efforts to combat the supply of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances through comprehensive actions that include proactiveness and social resolution.
The Arab Plan’s dimensions showcase the methods of how to address this phenomenon from a social perspective and in line with Arab countries’ regulations and conditions in order to implement effective interventions including related multidimensional social and development consequences and to strengthen Arab efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The important dimensions of the Plan include community prevention, rehabilitation and social integration, addressing drug-related harm and its consequences, as well as the dimensions and themes in support of the Plan's areas of action, namely international cooperation, scientific research and innovation, coordination mechanisms, governance, implementation, measurement and impact assessment.

Through the new collaboration we have with IOM, these critical needs shall be addressed enabling JAF to provide effective and life-saving interventions for its members and Syrian refugees as well.”
Given the strong commitment of JAF in upholding the territorial integrity of Jordan against the increased presence of smugglers at the North-East border, as well as a need for the readiness of JAF to respond to any other potential emergency situations that might arise in the area, support to increase the medical capacity to provide urgent trauma care along the North-Eastern border area has never been more urgent.” said H.E. Mrs. Tajma Kurt, Chief of Mission, IOM Jordan.
The long-standing collaboration between the Governments of Japan, Jordan, and the International Organization for Migration is reflected in a recently completed project, inaugurated in Aqaba on 02 March 2023, where the project successfully contributed to the drafting of guidelines that would support the Jordanian Border Authorities to effectively address issues with communicable diseases, such as but not limited to COVID-19.
The project also included infrastructure improvement of medical facilities as well as the provision of medical equipment at four prioritized points of entry; Karamah, Jaber, Wadi Araba, and Al-Durra.
In addition to the Introduction of Migration Information and Data Analysis System (MIDAS) Health Module through the establishment of MIDAS workstations and the provision of the related trainings, the project enables the Jordanian Border authorities and the Ministry of Health to collect, store and process the travelers’ health data and exchange information between border posts in a speedy, accurate and secure manner.
As the leading intergovernmental organization in the field of migration; IOM promotes humane and orderly migration for the benefit of all and is committed to supporting Member States to improve their preparedness and establish adequate response mechanisms to protect crisis-affected people crossing the border while ensuring the national sovereignty and border security of the state is maintained.

WFP provides assistance through cash transfers, which allows refugees to buy the food of their choice at contracted supermarkets and bakeries inside the camps.
“Ksrelief is keen to support food security around the world and we work with many humanitarians' assistance to all. In this project, we are glad to continue our work with our strategic partner WFP to help Syrian refugees in Jordan,” said Mr. Fahad Alosaimi, Director of Urgent Aid Department at Ksrelief. Mr. Fahad adds, “we hope that this project has achieved its intended objectives and significantly contributed to addressing food insecurity of the Syrian refugees.
“We value our growing relationship with the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre and are thankful for their continued support, which enabled us to assist some of the most vulnerable refugees in Jordan,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Jordan Alberto Correia Mendes.
With the support of donor partners, WFP is providing monthly cash-based assistance to 465,000 refugees living in camps and host communities in Jordan who rely on humanitarian support to meet their food needs. Refugee families living in communities receive assistance through cash transfers, whereas those living in camps receive electronic vouchers based on blockchain technology and an iris scan payment system.

Title: UNESCO organizes trip to discover the hidden treasures of Rihab
Content: 18 March 2023
Amman - UNESCO Jordan Office, in collaboration with Friends of Jordan Festivals, organized a half-day trip to Rihab for about 100 people, to give them the opportunity to discover the hidden treasures of Rihab, including its many churches decorated with stunning mosaics. Most of these churches date back to the late sixth or early seventh century, and among them, St. George Church, stands out as one of the oldest churches in the world, with a cave beneath it that might have been used for Christian worship as early as AD 33.
Jordan is a country that is famous for its rich cultural and historical heritage. Its landscape, ancient ruins, and unique architectural marvels are breathtaking, and tourists never cease to be amazed by them. One such destination that captures the essence of Jordan's cultural heritage is the village of Rihab. Located in the northern part of the Kingdom in the Mafraq Governorate, Rihab is a fascinating place that offers a glimpse into the country's past.
Through the Project “Support to Livelihoods through Cultural Heritage Development” under the EU Madad Fund, UNESCO, in close collaboration with ILO, is carrying out light conservation and site maintenance works in six of these churches, through cash-for-works initiatives targeting people from local communities and Syrian refugees. This initiative seeks to promote sustainable socio-economic development and mitigate the immediate need for employment creation among young vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees while also paving the way for longer-term investments in cultural heritage preservation.
This trip was also the occasion for the visitors to discover locally made handcrafted items, and try delicious homemade food prepared by the Rihab Women’s Association, which supports women from the local communities by empowering them and providing them with opportunities to showcase their talents and earn a decent living.
Through initiatives such as this, UNESCO aims to promote greater community engagement in the rehabilitation and conservation of heritage sites in Jordan. The organization believes that by involving the local community, more people will benefit from the revenue generated by tourism, ensuring the sustainable development of the country's cultural heritage.

Ireland and Jordan are close partners in enabling UNRWA to fulfill its mandate towards Palestine refugees. In 2022, Ireland contributed EUR 8 million to support the work of UNRWA. I was especially happy to have talked to JoYS students about their project, achievements, and their experience with the Jordan Young Scientist programme. I wish them all the best with the exhibition in June.”
The Jordan Young Scientist programme was created to motivate and reward youth who study science, mathematics, engineering, and technology abilities. JoYS was established in partnership with the Embassy of Ireland, Jordanian Ministry of Education, Crown Prince Foundation, and Queen Rania Foundation.
“JoYS helped us become motivated and enriched our experiences and creativity when we interacted with other students participating in this initiative,” Nadia, a 9th grade Palestine refugee student, said with excitement. She and her two classmates, with the help of their teacher, were able to design and create an irrigation system for their school’s plants.
Ambassador Marianne Bolger added: “Ireland is a committed supporter of the Palestinian people, as reflected by the priority we devote to our collaboration with UNRWA. It was a privilege to visit their programmes in Amman New Camp today and see how UNRWA is helping Palestine refugees. I am pleased that we cooperated with UNRWA to expand the young scientists’ programme to include Palestine refugees from their schools. Fostering inclusion is a key goal for JoYS and we have received applications from all over Jordan and across all schools’ sectors in 2023.”
UNRWA Deputy Commissioner-General Stenseth highlighted: “Ireland’s frequent support to UNRWA is a testament of its confidence.

Title: FAO launches a project focusing on the transformation of food systems in Jordan
Content: 06 March 2023
Amman - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), launched today a project to focus on the transformation of food systems in Jordan through the regional project “SFS-MED - a multi-stakeholder initiative for sustainable food systems in the Mediterranean”, funded by Italy.
In line with the agreement signed between the three parties, FAO conducted an inception workshop to present the program to all partners and the related departments, to highlight the importance of the stakeholder role in Food system, and to share with them the proposed action plan. The workshop also aims to coordinate between partners and maintain a communication channel to support and develop the planned activities.
The workshop was held under the patronage of his Excellency Eng. Khaled Hnaifat, Minister of Agriculture and attended by a group of selected stakeholders and government partners.
This project aims at accelerating progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the Mediterranean region. Country and regional-level activities look to promote multi-stakeholder dialogues around key levers for food systems transformation, reinforcing cooperation across the Mediterranean.
On behalf of H.E Eng. Khaled Hnaifat, Minister of Agriculture, the Secretary-General Eng. Mohammad Hairy stated, "Jordan is committed to continuing to work towards the transformation to sustainable food systems, building partnerships, strengthening the institutional environment, and working with the international community and the United Nations organizations to ensure the provision of appropriate funding. In addition to giving high priority to research and technology, and knowledge exchange regarding food systems.”
FAO Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf, said, “Country-level activities in line with the project’s outputs are foreseen in Albania, Jordan and Morocco. Country support will strengthen national and sub-national stakeholders’ capacities to promote a systemic approach to agri-food policies, strategies and interventions; formulate SFS-aligned project and investment proposals; as well as facilitate resource mobilization.” He added, “In Jordan, the transformation of the food system will be guided by the strategic objectives and guiding principles of the Food Security Strategy, with the engagement of a multiplicity of stakeholders at a central and local level, including farmers, private sector, Government representatives, women and civil society.”
By choosing food loss and waste management as a lever for food systems transformation, the project aims at improving value chain and market efficiency and influencing consumer behaviors.
Through addressing food loss and waste issues in Jordan, the ultimate goal of the project is to improve food security, incomes and nutritional status of the population, as well as environmental sustainability in Jordan and the Mediterranean countries, through the development of more inclusive, efficient and sustainable food systems.
FAO has strategically partnered with the International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (CIHEAM),  Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA) for a  collaboration that brings together and capitalizes on each organization’s mandate (scientific, technical, political), and comparative advantages, reflecting the holistic dimension of sustainability.
The initiative has also been selected as an affiliated project of the One Planet Network’s Sustainable Food Systems Programme, a multi-stakeholder partnership comprising more than 190 members, united to implement the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with the goal to accelerate the shift towards more sustainable food systems.

Title: FAO project to accelerate food systems transformation pathways launched
Content: 26 February 2023
Support from Italy enables multi-stakeholder approaches to sustainable food systems in the Mediterranean

Amman/Rabat/Rome/Tirana – Food systems stakeholders in Albania, Jordan, and Morocco have gotten a boost from a project funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Italy and implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to operationalize their food systems transformation pathways. “SFS-MED: a multi-stakeholder initiative for Sustainable Food Systems in the Mediterranean” is an inter-regional project   that reaffirms Italy’s continued commitment to supporting the follow-up to the UN Food Systems Summit which took place in September 2021
This project aims at accelerating progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the Mediterranean region. Country and regional-level activities look to promote multi-stakeholder dialogues around key levers for food systems transformation, reinforcing cooperation across the Mediterranean.
“With sustainable food systems now integrated in the new national Strategy on Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries in Albania, the SFS-MED project will focus, inter alia, on the agro-tourism sector, which has the potential to be a lever for sustainable transformation of food systems, by advancing the country's green economy approach” said Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative in Albania.
According to Nabil Assaf, FAO Representative in Jordan, “the national UN Food Systems Summit dialogue is the pathway towards transforming Jordan’s food systems to more efficient and sustainable ones that contribute to improved availability and self-reliance, access to nutritious food and healthy diets for all Jordanians at all times by 2030, building on the high priority and momentum given to food security and food systems at national and international levels during the third decade of the 21st century, and in line with the vision of His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein towards achieving food security”.
In the words of Jean Senahoun, FAO Representative in Morocco, “in Morocco, the SFS-MED project will support the implementation of the national strategy “Génération Green 2020-2030” with the aim to improve the resilience and sustainability of food systems through a focus on policy, institutional and governance framework, capacity development and scientific research”.
Country-level activities are set to build capacities of food systems actors to embrace a systemic approach to agrifood, as well as to leverage funds and mobilize investments for transformative actions and country projects. Project work will also reinforce the connections across Mediterranean countries, promoting country-to-country exchange building on common interests and shared priorities for food systems transformation in the region.
These activities are implemented within the framework of the “SFS-MED Platform”, an initiative co-developed by FAO, the International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (CIHEAM), the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), and the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA).  As an affiliated project of the One Planet network’s Sustainable Food Systems Programme, the SFS-MED Platform is a forum for multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaboration, a network for strengthening knowledge sharing and capacity building, and a catalyst for regional cooperation on priority themes for sustainable food systems transformation in the Mediterranean.
This support also leverages previous activities of the platform at a regional level, such as the organization of three UN Food Systems Summit Dialogues in partnership with CHEAM, UFM, and PRIMA The dialogues were instrumental in identifying some of the critical entry points for food systems transformation in the Mediterranean, which were reflected in a stocktaking exercise published in December 2021.
The dialogues have also inspired an ongoing series of technical webinars to exchange about food-systems-related themes such as food waste management, the Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystems (WEFE) nexus, the role of innovation for small and medium enterprises, the role of consumers, etc.

Title: New green playground in an UNRWA school for girls inauguratad
Content: 20 February 2023
Amman - Bernhard Kampmann, Ambassador of Germany to Jordan, and Tamara Alrifai, Director of External Relations and Communications of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), inaugurated a green play area at the Talbieh Girls’ School, in the presence of Mr. Olaf Becker, Acting Director of UNRWA Affairs in Jordan.
The transformation of the 150 m2 playground was funded by the Government of Germany, following a visit by the German Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, to the Talbieh camp for Palestine refugees in February 2022, where she met students in the Talbieh Girls’ School, run by UNRWA. The students talked with her about their studies, their ambitions, and their wish for a greener camp, with playgrounds and recreational spaces in the otherwise densely built and populated camp.
In a letter read out by Ambassador Kampmann, the German Foreign Minister said: “I am glad that we were able to provide this support – I am convinced that every child deserves a good school, and also one with a beautiful schoolyard. With this project, we want to show that we see the people that UNRWA serves every day and the dedication of UNRWA staff: teachers, doctors, and the humanitarian personnel.”
Both UNRWA and Germany are invested in ensuring environmental sustainability, thus aligning over a shared vision for a green environment. With German support for Palestine refugees, UNRWA is contributing to the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda.
“We are thrilled to see a playground with trees and plants,” said Tamara Alrifai. “UNRWA is strongly advocating for greener camps and for recreational areas for camp residents, including children. Here, it is the children’s right to play and to safety that Germany is directly supporting. It would be fantastic if similar green spaces were replicated across all UNRWA camps in the region,” she continued.
In his speech, Ambassador Kampmann also thanked UNRWA for their immediate support to Palestine refugees affected by the earthquakes last week: “Our hearts and thoughts are with those affected by the disastrous earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. We are grateful for UNRWA’s assistance to Palestine refugees – especially in times of hardship, but also every day here in Jordan.”
Germany generously funds programmes and initiatives that protect the human rights of Palestine refugees across the region and contributed approximately 190 million euros to UNRWA operations in 2022.

Title: BADIA, UN-Habitat sign an agreement of cooperation on climate change resilience
Content: 01 February 2023
Amman - Under the patronage of Her Royal highness Princess Basma Bint Ali, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Hashemite Fund for the Development of the Jordan Badia, the United Nations Human Settlement program (UN-Habitat) and The Hashemite Fund for the Development of the Jordan Badia signed an agreement of cooperation on February 1st, 2023 for the “Increasing the resilience of both displaced persons and host communities to climate change-related water challenges in Jordan” project that is funded by the Adaptation Fund.
The director of the Hashemite Fund for the Development of the Jordan Badia, Jamal Trad Al-Fayez, stated that the project aims to relieve the pressure on natural water sources by resorting to non-traditional, alternative sources in agriculture, in the face of drought and extreme heat and changing patterns of rainfall which has become a major source of concern. He also pointed out that the Al-Mafraq-Badiya area, which has hosted a large number of refugees in recent years, has led to an increase in pressure on available water quantities and infrastructure, which has put the water supply and sanitation systems at risk.
Al-Fayez stressed that the Fund will work through this project to implement and manage the reuse of treated wastewater from the Al-Mafraq treatment plant, and establish agricultural projects in the western North Badiya region, through the establishment of new and effective recycling technology, as well as building the capacities of farmers and raising awareness about water management and effective irrigation systems.
The Senior Urban Program Officer at UN-Habitat, Lubna Shaheen, stated that the program focuses on four strategic goals, aimed at reducing spatial inequality and poverty in communities, enhancing shared prosperity for cities and regions, promoting climate-related actions and improving urban environment, and preventing and responding to crises in urban areas effectively.
The Regional Project Manager at UN-Habitat, Hussien Muhsen, emphasized that this is the first regional project from the Adaptation Fund in our region, stressing the importance of sharing knowledge and experiences between Jordan and Lebanon in this context, especially in adaptation implementation aspects. The project also looks into expanding the adaptation knowledge scope through creating a community of practice that involves all projects and initiatives in the region, and this will be led by the UN-Habitat Regional Office for the Arab States in Cairo and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia in Beirut.
On the other hand, Engineer Jawad Dukhgan, the National Project Manager at UN-Habitat, Jordan, emphasized that the project will boost the recognition and visibility of the region, especially with regards to addressing climate change. The impact will first be seen within the community and among decision-makers, highlighting the significance of future initiatives. The focus will be on improving the environment and quality of life, such as promoting sustainable water collection practices and distribution through rooftop rainwater harvesting and grey water systems in residential buildings, schools, and mosques. Additionally, upgrading wastewater treatment plants, implementing new irrigation technologies using treated water, and creating a Permaculture demonstration site at the University of Jerash.

Resilient water solutions against climate change project
The project is funded by the Adaptation Fund and implemented by UN-Habitat in cooperation with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia – ESCWA and national executing partners in targeted countries. The project aims to increase the resilience of both displaced persons and host communities to climate change-related water challenges in Lebanon and Jordan.

Title: Ministry of Education and UN Jordan observe the Intl. Day of Education
Content: 24 January 2023
“Conference discusses ways to scale up efforts to implement Jordan’s commitments to transforming education.”
Amman - The Ministry of Education (MoE) and the United Nations on Tuesday hosted a one-day conference to convey the outcomes and Jordan’s commitments to the Transforming Education Summit (TES), convened by the UN Secretary General last year in response to the global learning crisis.
Titled “Post-Transforming Education Summit”, the conference was organized with support from UNESCO and UNICEF to observe the International Day of Education, which is celebrated this year with a call for maintaining strong political mobilization around education to chart the way to translate commitments during the global summit and global initiatives into action.
During the opening ceremony, Minister of Education Azmi Mahafzah said education is a fundamental human right due to its "unique ability to develop knowledge, behavior, and values needed in communities to build a just, sustainable, and prosperous future."
Jordan's commitment came as part of a response to the global post-pandemic education crisis regarding equality, comprehensiveness, and quality, he added, indicating the need to renew global financial and political commitment to education and forge ahead with achieving the fourth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 4), which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
For his part, Dominik Bartsch, the UN Resident Coordinator a.i. stated: “We must reimagine education systems to enable all children and young people to reach their full potential. We must ensure that learning empowers individuals and societies to both reshape the present and lead us to a more just, sustainable, resilient, and peaceful future.”
The event brought together over 80 participants from the government and non-government organizations, UN agencies, development partners, civil society organizations and youth, where Jordan’s National Statement of Commitment to transform education towards the achievement of SDG4 ‘Education for All’ was presented. Participants also discussed ways to scaleup efforts and mobilize further partnerships to support Jordan in implementing these commitments and for translating this commitment into action.
Jordan’s commitments include the universalization of Kindergarten 2 providing enabling, safe, healthy, and accessible learning environments and support systems for all children, with special emphasis on children vulnerable to exclusion from and within education; adopting preventive measures for future potential crises, through the development of a risk and crisis management strategy; optimizing the planning of school infrastructure, maintenance and resources to accommodate increased demand, safety and accessibility for all; further investing in the MoE’s Education Management Information System for evidence-based policy making; and reforming the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) system, to enhance quality and relevance, and respond to the requirements of the labour market.
During the event, speakers and panelists highlighted that to advance progress towards SDG4 and to invest in people and bring out their full potential, education and training must be prioritized, whilst political will and financial commitment must be maintained.
The panel deliberations validated the priority areas for action in Jordan for the transforming education agenda and discussed how to translate them into action through mobilization, including political and financial, and further alignment. The conference concluded by renewing Jordan’s commitment to accelerate progress towards SDG4 and to ensure the right of children and young people to quality education and lifelong learning.

Title: UN-Habitat, GAM and Greater Irbid Municipality officially launch Amman and Irbid Spatial Profiles
Content: 13 December 2022
Amman - UN-Habitat Jordan, in partnership with the Greater Amman and Irbid Municipalities, officially launched the Amman and Irbid Spatial Profiles.
The spatial profiles were developed under the framework of the “Urban Planning and Infrastructure in Migration Contexts (UPIMC) Programme”, funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). UPIMC Programme supports a number of municipalities that host displaced populations, in developing long-term strategies that build on their resilience to face future challenges. The UPIMC programme endeavours to foster multisectoral collaboration between UN-Habitat, national and local governments, humanitarian actors, development partners, as well as international financial institutions to develop sustainable interventions that build inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable settings. The programme is implemented in three countries, Cameroon (Douala), Egypt (New Damietta), and Jordan (Amman and Irbid).
The spatial profiles comprise a spatially focused, cross-sectoral, situational analysis of urban areas hosting local communities and migrant populations. These spatial profiles will provide local stakeholders with a comprehensive spatial understanding of the existing situation as a basis for decision-making, long-term urban development strategies, and infrastructure investment planning.
Mr. Ahmad Malkawi, the City Manager of Amman, explained that the UPIMC programme assists the Greater Amman Municipality in addressing urban challenges, highlighting that this evidence-based study can guide the different development actors in the country to work together as one hand in the design and implementation of projects and to provide a better quality of life for residents in Jordan.
Mayor of Irbid, Mr. Nabel Al Kofahi, highlighted UN-Habitat continuous support and their work in Jordan, particularly in developing infrastructure as well as enhancing the quality of life for people. Mr. Al Kofahi shed light on the Irbid Vision 2030, which states that Irbid is "A green, smart city that is attractive for investment and brings happiness to its people." He highlighted that the vision has happiness as its main goal, which entails that the municipality puts the human being at its core, working on social programs, public services, and infrastructure network developments.
"We are very proud of the partnership we established with Greater Amman and Irbid Municipalities. The UPIMC program is aligned with UN-Habitat's mandate, which is promoting transformative change in cities and urban areas through knowledge, policy advice, technical assistance, and collaborative action, to leave no one and no place behind”, added Ms. Lubna Shaheen, Senior Urban Programme Officer at UN-Habitat Jordan.
Ms. Caroline Tissot, Deputy Head of Mission, Regional Head of Cooperation from the Embassy of Switzerland, expressed Switzerland's interest in supporting such projects by saying: "Urbanization everywhere is a global phenomenon and the rapid influx of displaced populations to urban settings have made spatial, economic, and social impacts. To grasp and leverage this growth, we really need to have data and understand the problems to be able to make policies. Making policies means we need to tackle the issues with long term solutions." She continued by acknowledging that Jordan is strongly affected by these developments, and that is why the collaboration, and the Spatial Profiles are very important for making informed decisions.

Title: WHO and Ministry of Health launch national nutrition strategy 2023–2030
Content: 11 December 2022
Amman - The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the World Health Organization, have launched the 2023–2030 national nutrition strategy, which aims to achieve better nutrition levels in Jordan.


The Minister of Health Professor Feras Al Hawari said that the strategy reflected the commitment of the Government and other stakeholders in achieving better levels of nutrition for all segments of society. The strategy is in line with the national vision and highlights the necessity of achieving economic and social development goals.
WHO's Representative to Jordan Dr Jamela Al-Raiby noted that, “Proper nutrition is essential for good health and a fundamental right of every human being. Lifestyle changes, as in other counties of WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region, and the accompanying changes in diets, which have become rich in nutrient-poor and energy-dense foods have led to increased levels of obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Other conditions include micronutrient deficiencies, low levels of breastfeeding and continued undernutrition among some groups in the community.
The launch was followed by a dialogue session among key nutrition stakeholders about how to effectively coordinate efforts to achieve the vision, goals and actions outlined in the implementation framework of the national nutrition strategy within the established time schedule.
The strategy is important because it constitutes a roadmap to guide the efforts of the State and relevant partners to improve nutrition for the entire population, including women of reproductive age, children under 5, adolescents and older people.
WHO is committed to continue supporting the Ministry of Health and other national partners in preventing malnutrition, overweight and obesity, micronutrient deficiencies, and diet-related noncommunicable diseases and to promote sustainable healthy diets, guided by regional and global goals.

Title: FAO concluded strengthening the epidemiological capacity of the Government of Jordan’s veterinary services training program
Content: 08 December 2022
Amman – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with funding from the Defense and Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)- USA and in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Royal Veterinary College - UK concluded the Field Epidemiology Training Program for Veterinarians (FETPV) which was launched on August 21st,2022.
The launching of the Field Epidemiology Training Program for Veterinarians was followed by three months mentorship training period that aimed to produce competent field veterinary epidemiologists in Jordan who can interact with animal owners, investigate, assess, analyze, and report the findings of outbreak investigations effectively and rapidly. The program has also improved veterinarians’ capacity for animal disease prevention, detection, and response.
FAO conducted a scoping mission to Jordan with the support of the Directorate of Veterinary Services (DVS) in October 2019 to identify and provide the necessary support for strengthening veterinary services in Jordan. Furthermore, in March 2022, FAO together with the Royal Veterinary College London carried out a follow-up mission to Jordan to assess veterinary epidemiology training needs and gaps. Based on the findings of these two FAO missions and the positive feedback received from the Directorate of Veterinary Services and taking into account the recommendations of the Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) evaluation, the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), and the National Action Plan for Health Security, it was agreed to provide support for epidemiology capacity building in Jordan.
Field epidemiology skills and capacities are at the core of veterinary workforce development as they enable the early detection, prevention, control and management of animal diseases, including zoonoses. One of FAO’s core mandates is therefore to support countries in developing their epidemiology capacity. This activity is within the framework of the project "Strengthening Global Veterinary Epidemiology Capabilities and Rapid Regional Disease Surveillance", which assesses the specific needs of Jordan to develop a training program that fulfils these gaps. And an assessment will be carried out in a systematic and harmonized way to allow better data interpretation and comparisons across countries.

Southern Jordan Valley - The Ghor Al Safi Zaha Cultural Centre and Park has been officially inaugurated. This park and community centre were developed and implemented by UN-Habitat, UNOPS, and ILO, in cooperation with Zaha Cultural Centre and the Municipality of the Southern Jordan Valley.
At the inauguration, Mr. Youssef Al-Bawat, the Mayor of the Southern Jordan Valley Municipality, called the new community center "a model for developing talent and creativity and for enhancing the growth and awareness of the community from an early age," and explained that "this center calls for improving the standard of living for the Southern Jordan Valley."
This was further emphasized by Ms, Rania Sobeih, the CEO of Zaha Cultural Centre, who expressed the community’s “need for centers concerned with creativity and innovation, outside of academic education." She also highlighted that, thanks to the strong partnerships of this joint programme, “Today, despite all the challenges, we are able to stand here in the Zaha Cultural Center in Ghor Al-Safi."
Dr. Lubna Shaheen, the Senior Urban Programme Officer at UN-Habitat, explained that, due to the integrated participatory approach of the programme, the local community were also essential partners. She added that  “Sustainability is the basis for the success of this project, so we worked on building partnerships with the Municipality of the Southern Ghor and the Zaha Cultural Center, who in turn will operate and manage the park and the community center.”
Highlighting the significance of this joint work, Silvia Gallo, the UNOPS Head of Programmes said, “I’m very proud to be here today and see what UN agencies can do when they join forces and work with local authorities and communities.”
“This place is buzzing with life and hope,” said Frida Khan, the Country Coordinator of the ILO office in Jordan, praising the transformation. She added that this programme “represents the best of partnerships,” including between the UN agencies and with civil society, public institutions, and the private sector, and highlighted “the commitment of the municipality to its community.”
The park now includes inclusive and safe play areas for all ages, with a specific consideration of children with disabilities, shaded seating areas, a multi-use area designated for social and cultural activities and for a market, which will serve as a platform for the creation of livelihood opportunities for vulnerable women, as well as an area that is allocated for the implementation of sustainable agriculture methods. The community centre within the park will host the different social, cultural, and capacity building activities, including the tailored training on entrepreneurial skills and livelihood creation to enhance socioeconomic conditions of women. A community needs assessment was conducted to ensure that the community’s needs are met through the operational plan of the park and community centre.
This park and community centre were developed under the “Socio-Economic Empowerment of Vulnerable Women in Ghor Al Safi through Improving Access to Safe, inclusive and Green Public Spaces” programme. This programme is considered the first of its kind in the area and will benefit the 37,040 Ghor Al Safi inhabitants, of which 46% are women, as well as those from neighbouring communities. It contributes to Jordan's social and economic recovery post-COVID-19 and has sought to unlock the transformative power of safe and green public spaces for strengthening livelihood opportunities and enhancing the socioeconomic empowerment of vulnerable women in Ghor Al Safi, which will aid in easing the household and financial tensions.
This joint programme was funded by the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Multi Partner Trust Fund. It is possible thanks to the contributions to the UN Response and Recovery Fund by the governments of Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Republic of Korea, Finland, New Zealand, Croatia, Iceland, Thailand, Slovak Republic, and Cambodia.

Amman - World Antimicrobial Awareness Week is an annual global campaign that aims to increase awareness about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and to encourage best practices among the general public, health workers, farmers, animal health professionals and policy-makers to avoid the further emergence and spread of drug-resistant infections.

In line with this year’s theme “Preventing antimicrobial resistance together” the World Health Organization in Jordan organized a series of events and activities to increase public awareness of AMR and increase cross-sectoral collaboration acknowledging AMR as a global threat to humans, animals, plants and the environment.

Marking the start of the Week, under the patronage of Her Royal Highness Princess Alia Bint Al Hussein, the World Health Organization, in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture held a high-level meeting to discuss the threat of AMR in Jordan and ways to further raise public awareness. The event was attended by the Minster of Health H.E Professor Firas Hawari and the Minister of Agriculture H.E Khalid Heneifat in addition to key AMR stakeholders.
The WHO country office in Jordan and partners engaged in activities with schools such as storytelling, face painting and art competitions, in collaboration with the Royal Health Awareness Society.
WHO together with Jordan University, Jordan Student Pharmaceutical Association and the Jordan Association for Dental Students also organized an awareness-raising walk at the university and a seminar was held at the Hashemite University that discussed the rational use of antimicrobials.
A twitter storm event was held that brought together communication colleagues from different stakeholders from ministries, United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations in combined efforts to disseminate key AMR messages. As a result, 3 hashtags about AMR trended in Jordan for the whole day.
World Antimicrobial Awareness Week is a global campaign that is celebrated annually to improve awareness and understanding of AMR and encourage best practices among the public, One Health stakeholders and policy-makers, who all play a critical role in reducing the further emergence and spread of AMR. The challenges of AMR are complex and multifaceted which is why WHO continues to call for a multisectoral approach to address the threat and increase collaboration to collectively combat AMR in Jordan.

Title: FAO concludes the regional workshop on the Sound Management of Pesticides in Jordan
Content: 30 November 2022
Establishing a Regional Pesticide Management Network in the Near East and North Africa is a Key Recommendations of the Workshop
Amman - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) concluded the regional workshop on the Sound Management of Pesticides in the Near East and North Africa (NENA) region, which lasted for three days, from 28 to 30 November, in the Jordanian capital, Amman. The workshop came in cooperation with the FAO Plant Production and Protection Division (NSP) and the Ministry of Agriculture in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
The workshop introduced a set of recommendations on the Sound Management of Pesticides, calling for the adoption of the Farmer Field Schools (FFS), the launch of a training program for pesticide applicators, in addition to the creation of a regional information base to assess the risks of pesticides in coordination with FAO. At the end of the workshop, the recommendations also emphasized the need for the countries of the NENA region to cooperate into the reduction of pesticide smuggling by unifying and harmonizing legislation and adopting an electronic system for the validation of pesticide registration certificates.
“The responsibility of all stakeholders and operating parties in this sector lies in exerting great efforts and employing appropriate expertise for the better use of pesticides and the reduction of their residues in food,” emphasized Dr. Thaer Yaseen, Regional Plant Protection officer at FAO Office for the Near East and North Africa. "Our goal is to secure sufficient, safe, and sustainable food for all,” added Yaseen.
During the workshop, participants from NENA received training on the guidelines for the registration of microbial, botanical, and semi-chemical pesticides as well as on how to mitigate the risks of highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs). The training also touched on the International Code of Conduct for Pesticide Management, and guidelines for Pesticide Quality Control and Advertising, in addition to explaining guidelines on compliance and enforcement of a pesticide regulatory program.
“According to FAO data, the global use of pesticides has reached 4 million tons in terms of active ingredients, which has led to an increase in health and environmental problems,” said Gu Baogen, FAO NSP Senior Agricultural Officer. On the other hand, it is expected that "the world will reach more than 9 billion people by 2050, which requires a 60% increase in food production while preserving the natural resources and ecosystems of the Earth, and addressing the challenges caused by climate change and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” added Gu.
During the workshop, the participants called for stricter penalties for violators in the field of pesticides, stressing the importance of FAO's support to the countries of the region in getting rid of obsolete pesticides and pesticide containers.
For his talk, Mohamed El-Hadi El-Sidatt, FAO North Africa Plant Protection Officer, stressed the need to take measures at the national level to implement the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm conventions to protect human health and the environment from the effects of pesticides and hazardous waste. "Decision-makers must be aware that the good management of chemicals, as directed by FAO, contributes to reducing the financial resources directed to the health sector for the treatment of serious diseases,” he added during his participation in the workshop.
“Many national authorities in the NENA countries face serious challenges that impede the effectiveness of the registration system, including the insufficient number of staff and the lack of an appropriate registration system," Nabil Assaf, FAO Representative to Jordan, stated. "The limited technical expertise, the absence of risk assessment tools, and the limited access to information mean that the comprehensive assessment and recording of pesticides is not generally possible,” added Assaf.
Pesticides play a significant role in the agricultural sector, achieving food security and improving farmers' livelihoods. Whereas the negative effects of pesticides on the environment and non-target beneficial organisms are often much greater than the benefits of using them to control pests, as they cause damage to the ecosystem, pollute water and soil, and affect human health.

Title: Under the Patronage of Her Royal Highness Princess Alia Bint Alhussien - Launching of World Antimicrobial Awareness Week 18 - 24 November 2022
Content: 20 November 2022
Amman - Jordan is commemorating, along with the rest of the world, the World Antimicrobial Awareness Week (WAAW) under this year’s theme, “Preventing antimicrobial resistance together.” WAAW is an annual global campaign to raise awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and to promote best practices among One Health stakeholders to reduce the emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens.
High rates of antimicrobial resistance have been reported in countries at all income levels. The result is that common diseases are becoming increasingly untreatable, and lifesaving medical procedures riskier to perform.
Because the drivers of antimicrobial resistance lie in humans, animals, plants, food and the environment, a sustained One Health response is essential to engage and unite all stakeholders around a shared vision and goals. WHO Country Office in Jordan, in collaboration with the Offices of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), are assisting Jordan in the implementation of your plans through the “One Health AMR” approach.
Under the patronage of Her Royal Highness Princess Alia Bint Al Hussein, Ministries of Health and Agriculture, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), held a high-level meeting with key stakeholders to renew joint support for AMR and ways to raise public awareness of the phenomenon.
During the event, His Excellency the Minister of Agriculture, Eng. Khaled Hanifat, said, "I am pleased to enhance the cooperation between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health, as today a memorandum of understanding will be signed between the Ministries of Health and Agriculture to join hands in confronting zoonotic diseases." H.E explained the main role of the Ministry of Agriculture in combating the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, as it works to encourage the wise use and management of antimicrobial products in animals, monitor veterinary medicines in terms of their manufacture and import, monitor the type and use of antimicrobial products in animals, and also works to raise awareness among farmers. Furthermore, encouraging the application of international standards to avoid the risk of antimicrobial resistance.
The Minister of Health, H.E. Dr Firas Al-Hawari, emphasized that Jordan has taken several steps to address the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance. Jordan has joined the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) since 2018 and established its national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.
The Minister added that despite the achievements that have been made, there are still lots of required efforts to confront this threat in Jordan. This could be through awareness raising; taken actions by the concerned parties; implementing new measures and tools to maintain the balance between access to antimicrobials when needed and rationalize their use and stewardship in human, animal and food sectors.
His Excellency explained that the Ministry of Health aims to strengthen collaboration across sectors and civil society to combat antimicrobial resistance. This includes coordination with ministries of Agriculture, Environment, Water and Irrigation in addition to Jordan Center for Disease Control, Jordan Food and Drug Administration, Royal Medical Services and other governmental and societal organizations.
H.E appreciated the role of the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the United Nations Environment Program in supporting Jordan's efforts to address the threat of antimicrobial resistance using the "One Health Approach", and their technical support to Jordanian ministries and institutions to reduce the burden of this phenomenon locally and address it better.
The FAO Representative to Jordan Eng Nabil Assaf said “Antimicrobial resistance requires a One Health approach and combines effort of human and animal health sectors to achieve a paradigm change in antimicrobial use is a major priority for FAO and that is why we are here together today.” He added, “Antimicrobial Resistance – is a global threat and the consequences of antimicrobial resistance include the failure to successfully treat infections, leading to increased mortality; more severe or prolonged illness; production losses; and reduced livelihoods and food security. It is the role of everyone to Spread Awareness, Stop Resistance.”
On her side WHO Representative to Jordan Dr Jamela Al Raiby stressed that “The challenge of addressing the threat of antimicrobial resistance is real, is urgent, and it affects us all. That is why this year’s theme calls for cross-sectoral collaboration to preserve the efficacy of these important products.”
WAAW derives its importance from the fact that it brings together various sectors and aims to prevent antimicrobial resistance by raising awareness for the entire population. The challenges of AMR are complex and multifaceted which is why WHO and FAO will continue to call for a multisectoral approach to addressing the phenomenon and increased collaboration to raise awareness of AMR among the public and key stakeholders to collectively combat AMR in Jordan.
During the meeting, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture signed a protocol to collaborate on One Health and fighting Zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance. After the meeting, joint workshop and simulation exercise for strengthening diseases surveillance, and information sharing at the human animal interface have started.

Khaled Hnaifat.
This initiative targets Jordanian and Syrian Refugees by enhancing their capacities to successfully participate in efficient sustainable agri-food system, building their capacities for decent work opportunities and enhancing the resilience of the target groups to poverty and hunger.
Norwegian Ambassador Espen Lindbæck said, “We are very happy to enter into this new partnership between FAO and the Norwegian Embassy in Jordan. This project, aiming to enhance the transformation to more efficient, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable agri-food systems in Jordan, is highly needed to meet the challenges in the agriculture sector. With this, food security for Jordanians and refugees in marginalized communities will be sustained, and the opportunities for decent work opportunities will be enhanced. We are also very pleased that the FAO will implement this project in close coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture, meeting the aims of the Jordanian Government to ensure food security in Jordan and develop sustainable ways of agriculture. In a world that is seeing increased tension and insecurity, national food security, and especially for the most vulnerable, should be on the top of our agenda.”
FAO representative in Jordan, Nabil Assaf, said, “With the agri-food sector in Jordan supporting the livelihoods of about a quarter of the population, there is a greater urgency to address food security. It is one of the largest sources of employment for working-age refugees and women in rural communities.” He added, “The Programme is aligned with FAO-Government Priority 2: Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resources Management. It is also aligned to the Regional Initiatives “Water Scarcity” and “Building Resilience for Enhanced Food Security and Nutrition.”
His Excellency Eng. Khaled Al-Hunaifat affirmed the Ministry's appreciation for the role played by the Norwegian Embassy and the FAO in Jordan in supporting sustainable agricultural systems. He stressed on the need for concerted efforts to serve the interests of citizens in marginalized communities, find opportunities to support rural communities and women in particular, and the need to implement projects aimed at optimal utilization of available water resources, as this project reflects the possibility of integrating activities to achieve food security, preserve water resources, and create suitable opportunities to improve livelihoods.
The project’s overall aim is to contribute to the sustainable achievement of food security among rural Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanian hosts, by enhancing their capacity to successfully participate in efficient sustainable Agri-food systems and building their capacities for decent work opportunities as well as advocating for food waste reduction which has a profound effect on sustainbility,food security and rural development through training sessions. As such the project will address the capacity building, assets, financing, and employment needs of the targeted beneficiaries, through a series of activities related to capacity enhancement, asset distribution, access to micro-financing, access to markets, and job creation.
Furthermore, the project will select the beneficiaries based on socio-economic criteria through FAO, CBOs involved in the agricultural/Agri-food value chains, and in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture. The selection will encourage the inclusion of different community categories, including vulnerable; Syrian refugees, women-headed-houses, people with disabilities, and elderly people who are still able to deliver the activities and respond to the objectives of the project. The project will have a particular focus on youth empowerment and enhancing their employment status to ensure sustainable income generation and nutrition status. Overall, the project will target 300 beneficiaries through which 50% will be women, of which 70% will be Jordanians, and 30% will be Syrian refugees in host communities and will create jobs for 300 workers.

Title: UNICEF and partners celebrate inclusion and child rights on World Children’s Day
Content: 20 November 2022
Amman - Events are taking place across Jordan today to celebrate World Children’s Day - UNICEF’s annual day in support of the realization of children’s rights - with a special focus this year on inclusion for every child.
World Children’s Day, which marks the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) by the UN General Assembly on 20 November 1989, is a day of action for children by children. Children in UNICEF-supported Makani centres will be taking part in theatre and musical activities focused on child rights, while a football match organized together with Special Olympics Jordan will highlight the power of sport to drive inclusion.
“Every child has the right to an equal start in life, to be included and to be protected,” said Samuel Kipngetich Too, Acting Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “This year World Children’s Day is particularly momentous coming after the adoption of the Child Rights Law, a historic achievement from the Government of Jordan and the National Council of Family Affairs, to help improve children’s wellbeing and development.”
“The year 2022 is a special year for children of Jordan with the adoption of the Child Rights Law, allowing Jordan to enter its second centenary, realizing the importance of investing in childhood, and realizing the law’s compatibility with the Economic Modernization Vision, including the law’s emphasis on educational reform as a basis for economic development”, said Dr. Mohammad Miqdadi, the Secretary-General of the National Council of Family Affairs.
The Child Rights Law aligns with Jordan's adoption of the CRC over three decades ago, Jordan’s Vision 2025 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – as well as Jordan’s position as a pathfinder country to end all forms of violence against children in line with the CRC.
UNICEF will continue to work with the Government of Jordan and all national institutions to ensure that all girls and boys in Jordan have full access to their rights and that their voices are heard and acted on, leaving no one behind.

Title: UNESCO and UNHCR support handbook to boost skills on reporting on migrants and refugees
Content: 09 November 2022
Amman - With support from UNESCO and UNHCR, the Arabic version of the “UNESCO Handbook for Journalism Educators: Reporting on Migrants and Refugees” has now been launched: a valuable tool in a region which hosts both the largest and oldest refugee population in the world.
The launch event, under the patronage of Princess Rym Ali, was hosted by the Jordan Media Institute (JMI) in Amman, Jordan, on Saturday, 5 November 2022. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, expressed his support for the handbook in a message videotaped especially for the occasion.
UNESCO was represented by the Head of the Jordan Office, Min Jeong Kim.
According to co-editors Susanne Fengler and Monika Lengauer from the TU Dortmund University in Germany, the UNESCO handbook addresses journalism educators in the Arab region in a “first, genuine and unabridged translation that aims to support responsible reporting on migrants and refugees.”
It represents an important additional resource for journalists and journalism educators in a region which only last year counted a total of 16 million forcibly displaced and stateless people, according to the UNHCR.
Princess Rym, founder of the JMI and a former journalist herself, highlighted: ”Words matter, proper use of terminology matters, knowledge of treaties and conventions matter – above all understanding the reasons for refuge and migration and, beyond the statistics, the human stories matter.”  She added that “this handbook fills the gap within journalism education in our region”.
In his address, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said, referring to the handbook: “As it covers the perspectives from origin, transit and asylum countries, it equips future journalists with the skills to explain complex realities leading to human suffering and allowing for solutions to their plight.”
The UNESCO representative to Jordan Min Jeong Kim commented: “People on the move is a major global phenomenon that calls for high expertise in reporting. The Arab region is no exception, and this handbook offers universal insights as well as those specific to the region”.
A keynote speech was delivered by Jane Arraf, the New York Times’ Baghdad bureau chief. She highlighted the responsibility of journalists to “convey as full a picture as we can about a subject which has become so divisive in so many parts of the world.”
Editors Fengler and Lengauer represented the team of editors and authors from the Erich Brost Institute for International Journalism (EBI) and the Institute of Journalism at TU Dortmund University in Germany. They underlined the relevance of publishing the Arabic translation as the first in a series of full translations: "The Arab region continues to play a major role as countries of origin, transit and asylum. We very much hope that the handbook will support Arab educators and students at universities and in training institutions, as well as practicing journalists in their reporting on migration and forced displacement, and in curbing disinformation and misinformation.”
The original English version of the handbook was peer-reviewed by a group of international, including Arab, scholars. Fatma Louati, who translated it into Arabic, explained that this “is the only Arabic resource based on up-to-date and peer-reviewed research that we Arab journalism educators have currently at hand”.
The handbook is based on six years of extensive scientific work by the Dortmund research team and its editors Fengler, Lengauer and Anna-Carina Zappe, as well as numerous international conferences and workshops with scholars and journalists representing countries of migrants’ and refugees’ origin, transit, and reach.
Over 30 international guest authors have contributed to the project, including Arab researchers.
In addition to the original English version and the new Arabic translation, versions in French, Spanish and Kiswahili will be launched soon.
The handbook is available free online on the UNESCO International Programme for the Development of Communication resource hub: https://bit.ly/3U3PR5g

Content: 09 November 2022
Amman - FAO Director-General QU Dongyu today met Prime Minister Bisher Al-Khasawneh of Jordan as part of his two-day visit to Amman.
Qu noted that Jordan is a sizeable country and should play a decisive role in the region. He saluted the leadership of His Majesty King Abdullah II in addressing food security bottlenecks and said he was ready to implement the visions set out by His Majesty with regard to cooperation between FAO and Jordan. Qu had met His Majesty King Abdullah II at the Basman Palace on Tuesday.
During his meeting with the Prime Minister, the FAO Director-General called on Jordan to enhance its role in the region in harnessing science and technologies and provide data to address food insecurity, the climate crisis and water scarcity. Jordan should also support technological start-ups in the agricultural sector as a means of attracting younger generations to work in local food production.
The Prime Minister expressed Jordan’s commitment to making a contribution to food security in the region and called for FAO's technical assistance in tackling the challenge of rural unemployment. Al-Khasawneh also highlighted the need for Jordan to attract more investment to enhance its food storage capabilities and expressed appreciation for the strengthening of the FAO-Jordan partnership under Qu's leadership.
The two leaders also discussed issues related to the mandate of  FAO, including the key priority areas set out in the FAO Strategic Framework 2022-2031.
Workshop on water efficiency
Together with Jordan’s Minister of Agriculture, Qu also attended an inception workshop for the project “Building resilience to cope with climate change in Jordan through improving water use efficiency in the agriculture sector (BRCCJ)”. The event was held under the Prime Minister's patronage and brought together key stakeholders to mark the start of the seven-year project’s activities, which will increase the country’s resilience to climate change by ensuring the long-term sustainability of its water management systems.
Project partners gathered to discuss the implementation of project activities – valued at USD 33.2 million – in four Governorates in the Dead Sea Basin – Karak, Madaba, Tafilah and Maan – which are particularly vulnerable to climate change and climate-induced water scarcity.
The event also saw the participation of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the main financier of the project, as well as partners and co-financiers, including representatives from Jordan’s Ministries of Environment, Agriculture , and Water and Irrigation; and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
“Jordan is one of the most water-stressed countries in the region and in the world, made worse by climate change. This project is an important contribution to the country and the region’s climate action agenda. It will help the country address the complexity of the climate crisis,” Qu said.
Agricultural Research Center
Also on Wednesday the Director General visited the Jordanian National Agricultural Research Center, where geospatial mapping technologies are being piloted to help policy makers to better formulate water consumption policies in agriculture. Qu called for Jordan to participate in the FAO Hand-in-Hand Initiative and thereby use the Hand-in-Hand Geospatial Platform.

Title: FAO launches a project to enhance climate change adaptation in Jordan
Content: 09 November 2022
Amman - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Jordan held an inception workshop for the project “Building resilience to cope with climate change in Jordan through improving water use efficiency in the agriculture sector (BRCCJ)”.
The event was held under the patronage of the Prime Minister, Dr. Bisher Al-Khasawneh, attended by FAO Director-General, QU Dongyu and brought key stakeholders together to mark the start of the seven-year project’s activities, which will increase the country’s resilience to climate change by ensuring the long-term sustainability of its water management systems.
Participants discussed the core elements of the project, such as implementation plans to increase the country’s water supply through the storage of treated wastewater and rooftop water harvesting, and by reducing household water consumption through the use of water saving devices.
Project partners gathered to discuss the implementation of project activities – valued at USD 33.2 million – in four Governorates in the Dead Sea Basin – Karak, Madaba, Tafilah and Maan – which are particularly vulnerable to climate change and climate-induced water scarcity.
The event saw the participation of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the main financier of the project, as well as partners and co-financiers, including representatives from Jordan’s ministries of Environment (MoE), Agriculture (MoA), and Water and Irrigation (MWI); FAO; and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
FAO Director-General, Mr. QU Dongyu stated that, “Jordan is one of the most water-stressed countries in the region and in the world, made worse by climate change. This project is an important contribution to the country and the region’s climate action agenda. It will help the country address the complexity of the climate crisis.”
On behalf of the Prime Minister, Engineer Khaled Hnaifat, Minister of Agriculture, explained that water resources are among the most important challenges facing the agricultural sector, which needs concerted efforts at the national and regional levels. And the international community to help Jordan improve the efficiency of use, whether at the level of legislation or initiatives that can contribute to providing the quantities of water needed for the agricultural sector.
The GCF Forest and Land Use Specialist, Marc Dumas-Johansen, said, “The project will shift the paradigm in the agriculture sector from looking at crop productivity per unit of land to crop productivity per unit of water. By reducing the demand on groundwater sources through efficient cropping and water use practices, the project will bolster vulnerable farmers' climate resilience - particularly women who play a critical role in Jordan’s agricultural sector.” He added, “The lessons we will learn from this project will be extremely important to the global community allowing us to replicate and be inspired when developing and implementing projects in other places in the world facing similar challenges.”
The main objectives of the workshop were to strengthen collaboration between all project partners, including GCF, the Government of Jordan, non-governmental partners and stakeholders. Part of the session was dedicated to reviewing the Project Implementation Manual and confirming the respective roles, responsibilities and interventions of the Executing Entities within their respective mandates.
Overall, the Inception workshop underscored the urgent need to take action and address the impacts of climate change at the country and regional level, particularly in drylands and vulnerable ecosystems, where rural communities’ livelihoods are at risk.

Title: FAO Director-General meets His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan
Content: 08 November 2022
Amman - FAO Director-General QU Dongyu today met His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan at the Basman Palace on the first of his two-day visit to the country.
The meeting covered means of bolstering cooperation between Jordan and FAO, especially in supporting agricultural enterprises and addressing food security and climate change challenges.
King Abdullah expressed appreciation for the support that Jordan receives from FAO in developing the national food security strategy.
His Majesty called for stepping up regional and international efforts, as well as close coordination, to counter the impact of global crises on food security and other challenges.
Director-General Qu spoke about FAO's programs in Jordan, the main one of which is supporting the Kingdom's national food security strategy to strengthen food supply and storage, ensuring sustainable development.
Meeting with Minister for Agriculture
Qu also had a bilateral meeting with Jordan's Agriculture Minister, Khalid Al- Hanifat. The Director-General commended Jordan on its achievements in the area of food security over the past years and briefed him on some of the key initiatives taken by FAO, including its recent World Food Forum and its flagship Hand in Hand Initiative, which supports the implementation of nationally led, ambitious programmes to accelerate agrifood systems.
The minister thanked Qu for his leadership and expressed strong support for the ongoing positive changes taking place at FAO, adding that Jordan would like to see this momentum continue in the years ahead. The minister noted that Jordan has many programmes supported by FAO to address its challenges in the area of food security, nutrition and climate change, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The two also discussed the many challenges facing Jordan and the region in terms of food security. These include climate challenges, water scarcity, regional conflicts and war, refugees, as well as surging agricultural input prices.
Looking ahead, the Director-General said bilateral cooperation between FAO and Jordan should focus on water efficiency, mechanization and agricultural machinery for small scale farmers, and the digitalization of agrifood systems.
The minister said he fully agreed with the Director-General's proposals and highlighted the importance of FAO’s support for Jordan’ Initiative for a Food Security Hub for the Region, a regional network designed to make full use of digital technologies and provide timely data for early warning and anticipatory actions in agriculture.
Field visit with Her Royal Highness Princess Basma bint Ali
Accompanied by Her Royal Highness Princess Basma bint Ali, FAO Goodwill Ambassador for the Near East and North Africa Region, the Director-General also conducted a field visit to the Royal Botanic Garden of Jordan to better understand Jordan’s efforts and initiatives to conserve biodiversity for mitigating the impacts of the climate crisis.
In the Royal Botanic Garden, the Director-General tasted locally produced olive oil, which is supported by the FAO Investment Centre, through investment interventions by the International Financial Institutions (IFIs).

Title: KOICA supports UNICEF to engage vulnerable youth in Jordan with equitable opportunities, social cohesion, and climate resilience
Content: 06 November 2022
Amman - Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) Country Director Mr. Dongsung Seo, and UNICEF Acting Representative, Shairose Mawji, met to formally announce the start of a three-year partnership that will see USD $6 million for the project “Support to Equitable Opportunities, Social Cohesion, and Climate Resilience for Vulnerable Youth and Communities in Jordan as Part of the Humanitarian-Development Nexus”.
The contribution from KOICA will provide much-needed funding to build the climate resilience of communities living in remote and vulnerable areas of Jordan by improving their access to safe water and sanitation. Children and young people will be empowered through climate change education and environment advocacy in climate action clubs. Additionally, the partnership will harness young people’s creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit to support their successful transition to adulthood. Much-needed digital skills enhancement activities will also be offered to vulnerable youth to prepare them for future-ready employment.
“I am delighted to announce that UNICEF Jordan and KOICA are once again working together to support the vulnerable groups of women, youth, children and those with disabilities in Jordan,” said Dongsung Seo, Country Director of KOICA Jordan Office.
“We believe that another success story will be created with the long-established teamwork of KOICA and UNICEF and the participation of the competent Jordanian government and local partners.”
“UNICEF warmly welcomes the continued commitment and generosity of the Korea International Cooperation Agency,” said Shairose Mawji, UNICEF Acting Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “Jordan is already on the frontline of the climate change crisis. This funding will support UNICEF’s efforts to build the resilience of children and young people, who are most at risk, to live in a climate-changed world.”
Last month, KOICA co-supported the Local Conference of Youth Jordan (LCOY), a youth-led event held in advance of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27). Over 100 young people mobilized from every governorate in Jordan attended the two-day event to develop solutions and recommendations for urgent climate action on a national and global level.
A new youth climate leaders programme, ‘Sawn’ (‘to protect/preserve’ in Arabic) was also launched at the end of the LCOY to provide 36 adolescent and youth with the training and skills they need to lead climate action locally and globally over the next year. The young climate leaders will engage 10,000 more children and youth in community-based, environmental initiatives and advocacy.
This project comes as a continuation of KOICA's support to children in Jordan and around the world through projects such as "Full Realization of Vulnerable Girls and Boys Rights from 2017 to 2020/$6M" which was also a collaboration with UNICEF.

Title: UN Women launches Guidelines for Leadership and Skills Development of Women in the Private Sector
Content: 31 October 2022
Amman - Under the patronage of H.E. Wafa Bani Mustafa, Minister of Social Development and Chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Women’s Empowerment; UN Women and ILO joint programme “Promoting Productive Employment and Decent Work for Women in Egypt, Jordan and Palestine” With generous funding from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), launched the Guidelines for Leadership and Skills Development of Women in the Private Sector during the Breaking the glass ceiling event on October 31st 2022.
Among the main challenges that hinder women’s participation and retention in the labour market is the glass ceiling that prevents them to break through to reach leadership and decision-making positions. This glass ceiling constitutes of cultural and structural factors, many of which are deeply rooted and reflected at the institutional level. Women face significant horizontal and vertical gender-based segregation in the labour market where, they are concentrated in entry and mid-level jobs, and only a few are reaching decision-making positions. Despite all the efforts women in Jordan still hold under 5% of board positions and around 78% have no women on their boards. Meanwhile, for private shareholding companies, women members constitute only 9.1% of senior management, and only 2.6% of those companies have women chairs. Jordan’s numbers are among the lowest in the world, even in comparison with other countries in the Middle East.1
The UN Women and ILO joint programme “Promoting Productive Employment and Decent Work for Women in Egypt, Jordan and Palestine” aims to address the structural causes of inequalities that hinder women from enjoying equal opportunities for decent work. One of the main vehicles used for this purpose is the partnership with the private sector to support a gender-responsive private sector that attracts, retains, and promotes women. The primary tool UN Women uses to engage with the private sector is the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs), which is used as an instrument for the execution of gender equality and women’s empowerment practices in the private sector. UN Women designed the Guidelines for Women’s Leadership and Skills Development in the Private Sector to address the gap in leadership representation of women in the private sector in Jordan by informing and supporting the introduction, implementation and institutionalization of actions and practices that enhance women’s access to leadership and skills development opportunities.
Ms. Aisha Mukhtar, Deputy Representative of UN Women in Jordan, stated: “As UN Women, this is our third year of engagement with the private sector in Jordan for strengthening corporate delivery on gender dimensions of 2030 Agenda through Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) and we are very proud that Jordan now has the second highest number of WEPs signatories in the Arab States region. We hope that these guidelines for leadership and skill development of women in the private sector will further support the growing national WEPs Network in Jordan to adopt and strengthen institutional policies and practices for enhancing women’s access to leadership and decision-making opportunities.”
UN Women developed these Guidelines in partnership with a range of key stakeholders, including the Government, Women’s Empowerment Principles signatories from the private sector, the Jordanian National Commission for Women, civil society, associations of employers and employees and development partners.

Title: UNV organises activities for Jordanian youth in collaboration with UNDP and UNICEF
Content: 31 October 2022
Giving Jordanian youth the ownership to achieve Sustainable Development Goals
Amman - To promote national volunteering among Jordanian youth, UNV organized activities in collaboration with UNDP and UNICEF Country Offices in Amman.
These activities aimed at celebrating International Youth Day — are also seen as giving youth the ownership to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.
Amman - Under the theme of Intergenerational Solidarity: Creating a World for All Ages — UNV and UNDP hosted an interactive career mentoring clinic for Jordanian youth at the Heart of Amman Hub on 13 August 2022. Participants included 30 young people from UNDP’s Youth Leadership Programme, student ambassadors from Jordan, and national UN Youth Volunteers.
In partnership with King Abdullah II Fund for Development and a private sector telecommunications company, the event offered participants one-on-one sessions with employers and currently serving UN Volunteers. In addition, it was a platform for youth to improve their skill set, learn about market trends, and get information about volunteering opportunities so that they can be better prepared for their respective career paths.
Also in Amman, UNICEF and UNV hosted a youth-focused activity from 12 to 14 September 2022, which was attended by 18 national youth volunteers. The purpose of this three-day workshop — to improve interpersonal and communication skills, and promote volunteering for the 2030 Agenda. There was also a hands-on training to find innovative solutions for sustainable development challenges.
The first day of the workshop centered on learning different personality types, and key social skills such as active listening and positive dialogue.
Learning about different types of personalities was a very helpful exercise which helps me better understand others. When combined with the deeper knowledge I acquired from the sessions on communication skills, I hope this will help my future interpersonal interactions be more positive. -- Khalil Alostaz, national youth volunteer and member of the United Nations Youth Advisory Council (UNYAC) in Jordan.
The second day included a session on stakeholder mapping and an interactive exercise on communication styles. On the third day, an introduction to the 2030 Agenda was presented, followed by a discussion on innovative and localized solutions to achieve the SDGs.
We took a deep dive into leadership, volunteerism, and the SDGs, which I believe offers us the chance to help our society and build a more equal world. -- Joanna Zreineh, national youth volunteer and ambassador of Nahno Platform for National Youth Engagement and Volunteering.
The participants also had the chance to interact with former UN Volunteers, Ahmad Hijazi and Abdelghaffar Alawi, who shared insights about their inspirational volunteering journey and how it helped them move forward with their careers.
Be flexible when facing challenges in your career path. Don’t be afraid to take a step back or to start over. This might be what you need to move forward again, and with more momentum. -- Ahmad Hijazi, former UN Volunteer with UNDP Jordan.
Jordanian youth present a great, untapped potential for sustainable development in the region. Trainings such as the ones collaborated together with UNDP and UNICEF offer opportunities for youth to take on a more active role to achieve the SDGs.
We look forward to co-hosting more events of this kind with our UN partners in Jordan and across the region. Through volunteering, Arab youth can serve as a powerful accelerator of much needed positive change, and create a more equal and inclusive future. At the same time, volunteering equips the young with invaluable skills and experiences, which set them on the path to impactful lives. -- Ouarda Derafa, UNV Portfolio Manager in the Arab States.

Title: UNESCO Jordan joined forces to commemorate the Global Media and Information Literacy Week 2022
Content: 31 October 2022
Amman - About 60% of the global population and 70% of youth is using the internet. Thus, ensuring citizens have the skills needed to think critically about media and information in the digital age is no doubt one of the defining challenges of our time.
The information available through multiple media has escalated the complexity of this environment, posing new challenges for individuals in evaluating and understanding it.
UNESCO in Jordan partnered with the Jordan Media Institute recognize this new tech complex world and are actively involved in developing awareness and foundations for young people and community to provide media literacy.
To traverse and thrive in a world where misinformation and disinformation campaigns have become a part of everyday exchanges, it is important to create an informed citizenry and a complementary cluster of abilities necessary to use information effectively.
UNESCO and the Jordan Media Institute efforts in this direction are exemplary since the first joint MIL initiative that was started in 2016. It was long before the exponential rise in disinformation, increasing influence of digital platforms, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
"In the current ecosystem of complex and sometimes contradictory messages and meanings, it is hard to conceive of the public good being advanced if the public is disempowered in the face of opportunities and threats. Each individual needs to be equipped with media and information literacy competencies to understand the stakes and to contribute to and benefit from information and communication opportunities." said Ms Min Jeong Kim, UNESCO Representative to Jordan
Every year, the Global Media and Information Literacy Week, is commemorated from 24 to 31 October; this is a key week to reflect on how information and media content is accessed and assessed worldwide, both online and offline.
Youth received particular attention this year within the framework of the Youth Forum organized today by the Jordan Media Institute with the support of UNESCO. Short workshops and discussions within the youth networks are organized to encourage youth to blog about media and information literacy and intercultural dialogue.
Keeping in mind the well-being of the public with the need to empower them with the right information, such an event was conceived. The MIL endeavor is aimed to engage youth in the creation and dissemination of MIL knowledge and resources as leaders and peer educators, and to increase awareness for the prevention and resilience to disinformation.
In 2020, the Jordanian government approved a four-year national strategy on MIL (2020-2023) under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education. In addition to that, the National Center for Curriculum Development (NCCD) has recently launched the curricular framework for “media education” at schools through the integration of media concepts into most subjects across all levels of school education in the Kingdom, including in private and public schools.
The Jordan Media Institute is the implementing arm of the national strategy; the Institute has trained more than 3410 youth, teachers, faculty members, and school students across Jordan on Media and Information Literacy (MIL) skills.
"For decades investing in education has been the drive of development for countries. In this digital era, societies need empowerment in Media and Information Literacy skills, especially youth to engage and thrive in the virtual space. Whether interacting on the social platforms or engaging with the virtual reality, for entertainment or education, or seeking knowledge, the key word is discernment. The joint Media Information Literacy programs between UNESCO and JMI address this need to serve the cause of public interest." said Dr. Mirna Abu Zaid, Dean of the Jordan Media Institute
UNESCO’s Multi-donor Programme on Freedom of Expression and Safety of Journalists supports and champions media and information literacy initiatives across the globe. These efforts resulted in 25 countries taking steps to develop national policies and strategies on media and information literacy, carrying out training in close to 100 countries based on the Media and Information Literacy Curriculum, expanding the UNESCO Media and Information Literacy Alliance with members in 113 countries, supporting 300 youth organizations, 100 of which are in Africa, integrate and strengthen MIL in their policies and operations, reaching hundreds of thousands of young people.

Title: UN Women and GIZ, in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour, launch report on the impact of COVID-19 on the economic participation of women in Jordan
Content: 20 October 2022
Amman - Under the patronage of H.E. Mr. Nayef Stetieh, Minister of Labour, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and UN Women organised an event on Wednesday, 19 October 2022, to launch a report on the impact of COVID-19 on the economic participation of women in Jordan and discuss its main findings and recommendations of a study.
The report was prepared by the Centre for Evaluation and Development for GIZ and UN Women, with the generous support of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).
The event was attended by H.E. Mr. Farouk Hadidi, Secretary General of the Ministry of Labour, H.E. Eng. Maha Ali, Secretary General of the Jordanian National Commission for Women (JNCW), Ms. Kordula Mehlhart, Head of Development Cooperation at the German Embassy in Amman, Ms. Elisabeth Girrbach, GIZ Jordan Country Director and Mr. Nicolas Burniat, UN Women Representative, as well as representatives of the Government of Jordan, international development partners, private sector and non-governmental organisations.
While low female labour force participation in Jordan has been documented for decades, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this further. In the second quarter of 2022, the unemployment rate in Jordan was 22.6 percent, according to the Department of Statistics, with female unemployment at 29.4 percent and male unemployment at 20.7 percent.
The event provided an opportunity for policy makers, civil society representatives, the private sector and development partners to discuss long-standing and emerging barriers, opportunities and policy implications related to women’s labour force participation in Jordan, including panels specifically around raising awareness to change harmful gender norms which adversely affect women’s economic participation and creating gender-inclusive work environments. The findings and recommendations of the study presented in the event show how the pandemic has aggravated the economic crisis and brought new challenges to the labour market.
Mr. Farouk Hadidi, Secretary General, Ministry of Labour, said, “Unemployment is concentrated, by large, among women in Jordan and across different governorates. This requires all parties to work collaboratively, the government, the private sector, local community organizations, and donor countries, to resolve this issue. The representative Jordanian government, through the national program for employment, which is implemented by the Ministry of Labour, provided around 5050 job opportunities for women, i.e., 57 percent of all job opportunities provided, which amount to nearly 9000 job opportunities within the program, and that is during the last 5 months.
He noted as well that there are requirements that must be met in the work environment in order to increase women’s participation in the labour market, especially that which is related to providing a transportation network that serves all areas to guarantee women can reach their workplace safely and comfortably. Also, providing a decent and appropriate work environment will help increase the rate of women’s participation in the Jordanian labour market across different sectors and economic activities.
H.E. Eng. Maha Ali, Secretary General of JNCW, stated that despite Jordan’s progress in the Global Gender Gap Index from ranking at 138 in 2020 to 131 out of 156 countries in 2021, women still suffer from a set of challenges that impede their access to equal opportunities and the full realization of their human rights without discrimination or violence.
She added that the JNCW works in accordance with the axes of the National Strategy for Women in Jordan 2020-2025, which aims to contribute to raising the rate of economic participation of women, in order to ensure the achievement of equity and equality of rights, to contribute to the creation of a women-friendly work environment, to support positive social norms, attitudes, and roles for gender equality and women's empowerment, through the implementation of joint programmes and projects with official and civil government agencies.
Ms. Kordula Mehlhart from the German Embassy in Amman said, ‘’Women are key for sustainable development. We work together with the Government of Jordan to address structural challenges of the labour market and its institutions to improve the economic participation of women in Jordan. Unlocking women’s potential can contribute to boosting economic growth from inside the society.”
“UN Women is committed to continuing supporting the Government of Jordan in its efforts, together with the Ministry of Labour, the Inter-ministerial Committee for Women’s Empowerment and the Jordanian National Commission for Women, to ensure that plans developed to operationalize the Economic Modernization Vision mainstream gender equality and the participation of women in the economy and actively support women’s labour force participation as a driver and accelerator for the reform,” said Mr. Nicolas Burniat, Representative of UN Women in Jordan.
In a panel on the role of social norms in women’s economic participation, Ms. Maria Selin, Head of Regional Development Cooperation at the Swedish Embassy in Amman, stated that “A vital starting point for increasing women’s economic participation is to work with men to address the double burden of care-giving and paid work. Societies can only fully prosper when women and men have equal opportunities to combine work with family life.”
Key recommendations emerging from the study highlight the need to position women at the centre of economic recovery plans, increase efforts to engage all segments of society in addressing restrictive gender roles and stereotypes, prevent and address harassment of women in public and in the workplace,  strengthen capacities of businesses to provide resources to ensure gender-inclusive work environments, establish programmes for the sectors and governorates most affected by the pandemic, and launch initiatives to reintegrate women who had lost their jobs during the pandemic back into the labour market.
The event emphasized that Jordanian women are well-educated and represent a crucial resource for the economy which is still significantly underutilized. Economic growth in Jordan can be sustained through their better economic and social integration.

Title: Young people from across Jordan mobilize to take climate action during the Local Conference of Youth on Climate Change (LCOY)
Content: 20 October 2022
In the presence of HRH Princess Aisha Bint Feisal and HRH Princess Sara Bint Feisal, a new youth climate leadership programme is launched
Amman - In the presence of HRH Princess Aisha Bint Feisal, HRH Princess Sara Bint Feisal, and His Excellency the Minister of Youth Muhammad Al-Nabulsi, the Ministry of Youth concluded the two-day Local Conference of Youth (LCOY) concluded today, hosted in partnership with UNICEF, Generations For Peace and Nahno, and supported by Bank al Etihad and KOICA.
The youth-led event concluded with a clear call from young people in Jordan ahead of the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt next month for immediate and effective climate action to protect the most vulnerable communities, provide greater resources for youth-led green initiatives and prioritize the participation of children, adolescents and youth in the response.
LCOY Jordan takes place under the banner of “YOUNGO”, the official youth constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It provided a platform for 100 adolescents and youth from all governorates in Jordan to participate in discussions, interactive sessions and workshops with experts on youth climate activism and policy formation. The Minister of the Environment attended the first day of the conference, encouraging the youth participating to find solutions to the climate crisis in Jordan.  A set of recommendations developed by youth over the two days will be delivered to the Ministries of Environment and Youth and presented by the youth at COP27.
His Excellency the Minister of Youth Muhammad Al-Nabulsi noted that hosting of the LCOY and the launch of Sawn by the Ministry of Youth comes as a response to royal directives promoting youth participation in decision-making, especially in the response to climate action. “You are the generation most affected by the future impacts of climate change and you are also best equipped to be part of the response with your innovative solutions and environmental initiatives that can help mitigate and respond to the effects of climate change.”
“Climate change impacts everyone but the future belongs to young people,” said Shairose Mawji, Acting Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “It is really inspiring to see young people becoming leaders for positive change in their communities and nationally. Their message is loud and clear – the world must act now to prevent catastrophic climate disaster and to protect and prioritize children, adolescents and youth in the response.”
Dr Mohanned Arabiat, President of GFP, said, "We believe that young people are the main players who can impact climate issues, they are the generation that is at risk of being most affected by the consequences of climate change, but they are also the generation that is most capable of preserving the planet."
At the closing ceremony of LCOY,  a new climate youth leadership programme was launched. Sawn (‘to protect/preserve’ in Arabic) will provide 36 adolescent and youth from all governorates in Jordan with the training and skills they need to lead climate action locally and globally and to become powerful advocates for building a more sustainable future in a climate-changed world.
Each youth climate leader will also train additional young people from their governorates to implement local initiatives that will urgently build their communities’ resilience to the negative impacts of climate change. This is particularly important in Jordan where the expected rising temperatures and reduced rainfall will exacerbate existing water scarcity issues and put children most at risk. A number of the youth climate leaders were also selected to join the official delegation of Jordan to attend COP27.

Title: UNICEF and ILO support youth to prepare for work through Job Search Clubs in Jordan
Content: 19 October 2022
Amman – More than 400 young people in Jordan who have completed intensive, career-related training to support their successful transition to the labour market as part of the Job Search Clubs from UNICEF and the ILO, in coordination with the Ministry of Youth, were celebrated during an official event in Amman. The Minister of Youth, Mohammad Al Nabulsi, and Deputy Head of Mission of Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Pier de Vries, took part in the ceremony, along with the youth’s facilitators and representatives of partner organizations.
The Jobs Search Clubs programme is supported by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, through the PROSPECTS partnership, and implemented by the Business Development Centre (BDC). To date, 80 facilitators have been trained, including Ministry of Youth staff in different governorates and volunteers in refugee camps, to deliver youth training and to continue supporting young people as they seek employment with one-on-one follow up.
“The Ministry has contributed along its partners, including national institutions, international organizations and civil society in preparing, training and empowering young people to enter the labour market,” said Jordan’s Youth Minister Muhammad al-Nabulsi. “We are supporting youth in their quest for suitable job opportunities, while also preparing the facilitators who are working with them across the country’s centres.”
“The PROSPECTS partnership is a flagship programme of the Netherlands, focused on supporting vulnerable Jordanians and refugees, women and youth. This partnership invests in protection, learning and earning. We are very happy to see that 400 youth have already been part of this project, and many more to come in the near future,” said Pier de Vries, Deputy Head of Mission of the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
“We are very happy about the Job Search Clubs facilitators’ achievements and the results coming from these first few months of the joint implementation of the project in Jordan,” said Frida Khan, ILO Jordan Decent Work and Country Coordinator. “Supporting Jordanians and Syrian refugee youth to look for, find and access decent employment is key for the ILO’s mission in the country. As a result, we look forward to following their imminent and future success on the local job market.”
“When youth are empowered with the skills and information that they need to access meaningful employment and be jobs-ready, the possibilities for their futures are endless,” said Shairose Mawji, Acting Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “We are proud of our partnership with the Ministry of Youth, ILO and BDC, supported by the PROSPECTS partnerships, to provide youth with the job-search tools they need to find meaningful employment in a challenging labour market.”
“We are very pleased to be the implementers of the Job Search Clubs programme,” said Ghaleb Hijazi, General Manager of Jordan Business Development Center. “This project is unique in its the search for market’s opportunities and needs, connecting young people to reach their most appropriate opportunities.”
Based on two-week job search support activities, the JSCs bring together different individuals facing similar challenges to enter the labour market. Young people receive intensive coaching by the new trained facilitators on job search-related skills. Following an initial assessment of their personal interests, skills and occupational goals, the members learn how to gather job leads from various sources, conduct job interviews, fill out applications, write CVs and handle stressful situations, among others.
At the end of the two-week intensive programme, jobseekers benefit from a further three-month window in which they will receive assessments on their employment status by the UN agencies.
The JSC is an ILO methodology, providing youth with activities set to help them find suitable work within a short period of time. The programme fosters peer-to-peer exchanges among young job seekers, creates new connections, while allowing them to hone their job search abilities, matching their qualifications and skillset.
The Job Search Clubs programme is set to help boost youth employment in the country. Prior to COVID-19, the unemployment rate among young people in Jordan was 32 per cent, but this has increased due to the impact of the pandemic. According to the Jordan Department of Statistics (DoS), unemployment for youth in the 15-24 age bracket has reached over 46 per cent in the second quarter of 2022, affecting more than 63 percent of young women and 42 percent of young men in the country.

Title: On World Food Day: FAO, WFP call for healthy and affordable food, for everyone, everywhere
Content: 16 October 2022
Amman – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) - the leading UN agencies working towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 of Zero Hunger by 2030 - joined efforts to commemorate World Food Day in Jordan.
A ceremony was held under the patronage of Her Royal Highness Princess Basma Bint Talal, at the Royal Botanic Garden, hosting guests from several ministries, national institutions as well as donor and international community members.
This year, World Food Day is being marked at a time when the world is facing profound challenges in terms of food security caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, which are exacerbated by conflicts and other humanitarian emergencies. Prices have risen sharply and fertilizers have become very expensive for many farmers; the number of food insecure people continues to rise.
Under the theme “Leave no one behind. Better production, better nutrition, better environment and better lives,” World Food Day calls for the transformation of agri-food systems to ensure that everyone everywhere has access to enough, affordable, safe and nutritious food to lead active and healthy lives. It also calls for action across sectors to ensure that our agri-food systems deliver enough, affordable, nutritious and safe food for all.
HRH Princess Basma bint Talal said that the world’s ongoing crises have exacerbated the problems that individual nations previously faced, posing a threat to the present and future of food security for millions of people worldwide.
Her Highness also stated that the equivalent of 40 per cent of the world’s population cannot afford a healthy diet, and that approximately 193 million people suffered from food insecurity last year and required assistance. In addition, more than half a million people died from starvation, a 400 per cent increase over the previous year, she said.
Her Highness said that the Arab region’s conflicts and crises drove many people into poverty and hunger.
These increased problems associated with the spread of desertification, particularly in the Arab region and in Africa, as well as globally through natural disasters like fires, floods and droughts that threatened vegetation cover and hastened the collapse of vital ecosystems, Petra reported.
She applauded the WFP and FAO for their efforts in addressing environmental risks and disasters, for helping displaced people and refugees, and for collaborating with Jordan’s Supreme Council for Food Security to address the most pressing issues that are increasingly affecting people.
Princess Basma emphasised the significance of urging governments and partners to prioritise the SDGs, particularly the goal related to eliminating hunger and assisting in the provision of suitable healthy foods, while also pointing out the private sector’s contribution to efforts to ensure that people have access to healthy food.
“This year’s World Food Day comes at a time when Jordan and the world are confronted with unprecedented global challenges affecting global food security as a result of climatic and political factors, the spread of malnutrition patterns, and water scarcity,” H.E. Khaled Hunaifat, the Minister of Agriculture. “One of the most water-scarce nations in the world, is making progress towards building a comprehensive national system based on sustainable food production, bolstering local production, forming partnerships with other countries to diversify food sources and enacting laws and policies to ensure food security in all situations. Jordan wants to concentrate on using cutting-edge food production technology to support the diversification and stability of the food supply chain, as well as to prevent resource waste and ensure food safety.”
“Food security and healthy nutrition has also been at the forefront of the UN’s support to Jordan. The United Nations in Jordan is committed to work with the government and the people in Jordan towards equitable, affordable, safe and sustainable and reliable access to water, food and energy. This is one of our priorities for the UN’s cooperation in Jordan over the next five years,” said Dominik Bartsch, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. in Jordan.
Nabil Assaf, the FAO Representative stated that “Rising food prices affect all of us, but the impacts are felt the most by the vulnerable and by countries already experiencing a food crisis. Today 3.1 billion people around the world still cannot afford a healthy diet. Hunger continues to rise and it affected 828 million people in 2021.” He added, “Now, more than ever, we need to harness the power of solidarity and collective action. Our agrifood systems hold great potential for a more equitable and prosperous future, as they are interlinked to many areas of our lives and economy – from agriculture to natural resources, to energy, to health, and many more. Agriculture is among the most cost-effective humanitarian interventions.”
“The global food crisis will push more families into food insecurity, emphasising the programme’s commitment to addressing Jordan’s food security challenges,” WFP Representative and Country Director, Alberto Correia Mendes said.
World Food Day is observed every year on 16th October in remembrance of the day when FAO was founded in 1945, this year marks the 77th Anniversary of FAO.  Since its inception, FAO has accompanied government institutions and other relevant stakeholders in their effort of implementing the general Zero Hunger agenda, and related country strategies and actions. This collaboration represents the cornerstone of combating hunger and malnutrition.

Title: WeRise, a new mobile game app for youth to promote gender equality in the MENA region
Content: 02 October 2022
Amman - Dozens of young people from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, opinion leaders and representatives from governments and the United Nations launched today in Amman ( Jordan) a new game app called WeRise that aims to promote gender equality. WeRise was developed by youth and for the youth, with more than a hundred of young volunteers from six MENA countries who developed the game’s contents with support from UN Women.
WeRise is an edutainment app for smartphones, available in Arabic, French and English languages on android and ios stores, through a multitude of competitions, word puzzles and more, which highlights the important role young people can play in bringing people together to promote gender equality, societies closer, and women’s and men’s rights and voices equal.
“We strongly believe in the role of young women and young men to make communities and societies more just, inclusive and as a result more prosperous for all. Young people are a repository for progress of societies across the Arab region, including in the area of the rights of women and girls. Edutainment is a globally rising industry, expected to grow to 8.1 billion in the next ten years. And that is why UN Women together with its partners are part of this exciting development of a fun and informative app, that will equip Youth throughout the Arab States and even globally, with further knowledge around gender equality, making them even stronger agents for change within their communities and societies at large”, said Susanne Mikhail Eldhagen, UN Women Regional Director for Arab States.
UN Women and young volunteers from Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Tunisia and Jordan developed this game with support from the governments of Sweden and The Netherlands, to question gender stereotypes and change attitudes towards discriminatory gender roles in the MENA region. The development of WeRise was done under the framework of the UN Women’s regional programme, ‘Men and Women for Gender Equality’, whose goal is to promote social norms and behavioral change in favour of gender equality.
“I am truly excited about the WeRise game app and hope it contributes to engaging more and more young men and women for gender equality and women’s empowerment in Jordan and across the MENA region. It’s encouraging to see the creativity in using gaming as a platform to educate, raise awareness and foster discussions on gender roles and stereotypes” said H.E. Alexandra Rydmark, Sweden’s Ambassador to Jordan.

Title: UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Muzoon Almellehan returns to Jordan to meet refugees affected by the COVID-19 education crisis
Content: 02 October 2022
Nearly a decade since Syrian education activist Muzoon first arrived in Jordan as a young refugee, she returns at the beginning of a new academic year to inspire children to get back to learning following one of the world’s longest COVID-19 school closures
Amman - During a three-day visit across Jordan, UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Muzoon Almellehan warned that refugee children have experienced severe loss to their learning, having endured almost two years of COVID-19 school closures, threatening to reverse the gains made since they fled conflict.

“Children whose lives have already been devastated by conflict are now facing a second crisis of learning loss. Children have missed so much schooling they do not know how to read, write and recognise numbers.” said Muzoon. “An entire generation of vulnerable children are at risk of dropping out of school altogether, leaving them exposed to early marriage, child labour and worsening mental health.” 

Today, on the start of a new academic year in the country, Muzoon met children at a UNICEF-supported Makani (‘My Space’) centre in Amman. Makani centres provide vulnerable children and youth with safe spaces to develop new skills, access learning support and take part in activities including art, music and sports. The Makani programme has reached nearly half a million children and youth of all nationalities since it started in 2015. 

On Thursday, Muzoon will for the first time return to Za’atari refugee camp, where she sought refuge as a 13-year-old with her family nearly a decade ago after fleeing the war in Syria.

“Returning to Za’atari will be emotional for me. It was the first place I called ‘home’ after fleeing my beloved country. The struggles that children and families living in the camps face often weigh heavily on my mind. Yet, while it was one of the most difficult periods of my life, it is also were I found my voice as an education activist, and that changed my course forever,” said Muzoon.
UNICEF is working with the Government of Jordan to help children in host communities and refugee camps stay in school and accelerate and recover their education. UNICEF is supporting teachers to assess children’s learning levels and provide learning recovery programmes; and reaching children forced to drop out of school with non-formal education and training.

“This week’s start of a new academic year – where in-person learning resumes – brings hope to Jordan’s children. By acting now to accelerate learning and narrow the education gap, especially among the most vulnerable children, we can provide children with the building blocks of learning they need to reach their full potential,” said Shairose Mawji, Acting Representative, UNICEF Jordan.

During the visit, Muzoon also met young people engaged in volunteering, entrepreneurship, green jobs creation, social innovation and climate activism to hear about their community involvement, as well as their ideas and solutions to improve the lives of young people in Jordan and help protect them from the worst impacts of climate change and water scarcity.

Content: 27 September 2022
The 13-member council will serve as an advisory board to the UN team in Jordan
Amman - The United Nations (UN) on Tuesday announced the establishment of its first Youth Advisory Council (UNYAC) in Jordan, which will serve as an advisory board to inform the work of the UN on youth affairs in the Kingdom.
The Council is established in alignment to the UN Youth Strategy 2030, which seeks to significantly to strengthen the UN’s capacity to engage young people and benefit from their views, insights and ideas.
In addition, the Council, established in collaboration with the Crown Prince Foundation (CPF), will support national and UN-led advocacy and initiatives including on the Sustainable development goals (SDGs) and will engage in raising awareness on gender, peace, and human rights in different governorates of the Kingdom.
“Decisions that involve young people cannot be done in the absence of their voices and participation. Thus, youth empowerment and engagement in decision-making is a key priority for the United Nations”, said Mr. Ghulam M. Isaczai, UN Resident Coordinator a.i and Humanitarian Coordinator in Jordan.
He added that the Council announced today is part of the UN’s commitment to engage and listen to the voices of young people in Jordan. It also provides an opportunity to assist them with developing stronger leadership skills. “This Council is part of our clear commitment to ensure that young people in Jordan fully and meaningfully participate in our work and are empowered and advise us on priorities and what matters to them, and to their lives and their future”.
Dr. Tamam Mango, CEO of the Crown Prince Foundation (CPF) said: “On behalf of the Crown Prince Foundation (CPF), we are honored to host this unique initiative at the premises of our university, Al Hussein Technical University, which fosters a pioneering model in technical education. CPF strives to always provide diverse and relevant opportunities for the youth of Jordan”. She added: “CPF is proud to be part of the establishment of the first UN Youth Advisory Council to support young leaders and their institutions. We believe that this Council is a testament to the collaborative efforts of different organizations and will allow for better integration and the systematic scale of what were previously individual efforts. In essence this networking will allow us to better achieve our collective goals of diversity and inclusion.
The Council is comprised of 13 members— who are all between the ages of 15 and 24 years old — include aspiring students, business developers, startups, innovators, and human rights advocates.
Members of the Youth Council will serve for a period of two years.

Title: Multiple crises halt progress as 9 out of 10 countries fall backwards in human development, UNDP report warns
Content: 21 September 2022
The world must jolt itself out of its global paralysis to secure the future of people and planet by re- booting its development trajectory
New York - The world is lurching from crisis to crisis, trapped in a cycle of firefighting and unable to tackle the roots of the troubles that confront us. Without a sharp change of course, we may be heading towards even more deprivations and injustices, warns the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The latest Human Development Report, “Uncertain Times, Unsettled Lives: Shaping our Future in a Transforming World”, launched today by UNDP, argues that layers of uncertainty are stacking up and interacting to unsettle life in unprecedented ways. The last two years have had a devastating impact for billions of people around the world, when crises like COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine hit back-to-back, and interacted with sweeping social and economic shifts, dangerous planetary changes, and massive increases
in polarization.
For the first time in the 32 years that UNDP have been calculating it, the Human Development Index, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standard of living, has declined globally for two years in a row.
Human development has fallen back to its 2016 levels, reversing much of the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. The reversal is nearly universal as over 90 percent of countries registered a decline in their HDI score in either 2020 or 2021 and more than 40 percent declined in both years, signaling that the crisis is still
deepening for many.
While some countries are beginning to get back on their feet, recovery is uneven and partial, further widening inequalities in human development. Latin America, the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have been hit particularly hard.
“The world is scrambling to respond to back-to-back crises. We have seen with the cost of living and energy crises that, while it is tempting to focus on quick fixes like subsidizing fossil fuels, immediate relief tactics are delaying the long-term systemic changes we must make,” says Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.
“We are collectively paralyzed in making these changes. In a world defined by uncertainty, we need a renewed sense of global solidarity to tackle our interconnected, common challenges.”
The report explores why the change needed isn’t happening and suggests there are many reasons, including how insecurity and polarization are feeding off each other today to prevent the solidarity and collective action we need to tackle crises at all levels. New calculations show, for instance, that those feeling most insecure are also more likely to hold extreme political views.
“Even before COVID-19 hit, we were seeing the twin paradoxes of progress with insecurity and polarisation. Today, with one-third of people worldwide feeling stressed and fewer than a third of people worldwide trusting others, we face major roadblocks to adopting policies that work for people and planet,” says Achim
Steiner. “This thought-provoking new analysis aims to help us break this impasse and chart a new course out of our current global uncertainty. We have a narrow window to re-boot our systems and secure a future built on decisive climate action and new opportunities for all.”
To chart a new course, the report recommends implementing policies that focus on investment — from renewable energy to preparedness for pandemics, and insurance—including social protection— to prepare our societies for the ups and downs of an uncertain world. While innovation in its many forms—technological, economic, cultural—can also build capacities to respond to whatever challenges come next.
“To navigate uncertainty, we need to double down on human development and look beyond improving people’s wealth or health,” says UNDP’s Pedro Conceição, the report’s lead author. “These remain
important. But we also need to protect the planet and provide people with the tools they need to feel more secure, regain a sense of control over their lives and have hope for the future.”

Title: FAO conducts a workshop on the Good Emergency Management Practice Bio-Threat in Jordan
Content: 18 September 2022
Amman - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) launched today a workshop on the Good Emergency Management Practice - Bio-Threat (GEMP-BT). The workshop is tailored to veterinary services and law enforcement agents from Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon to present the new approach and notions of Good Emergency Management Practice (GEMP) and a brand new module addressing the risk of bio-threats, under the project “Building resilience against agro-terrorism and agro-crime threats to animal health.”
The workshop was under the patronage of his Excellency Eng. Khaled Al-Hunaifat, Minister of Agriculture and was attended by partners, Jordanian and Regional veterinarians and relevant stakeholders.
The GEMP-BT  training, which was implemented by an FAO team and a representative from the OIE regional office, with INTERPOL supporting remotely, enabled participants to gain an understanding of the significance of potential biological threats to animal health and production; apply the GEMP methodology to preparing to respond to agro-terrorism and agro-crime; become familiar with the prerequisites for prevention, surveillance, detection and response to agro-terrorism and agro-crime, and adapt them to specific contexts and situations; and understand the specifics of handling, securing and tracing evidence.
The FAO Representative in Jordan Eng. Nabil Assaf, said, “FAO, the World Organization for Animal Health and INTERPOL are partners in this international project to build sustainable global resilience towards animal health emergencies caused by terrorism and agricultural crime.” He added that, “FAO's Emergency Management Center for Animal Health has begun holding training programs on Good Emergency Management Practices, a reference document on key principles that help veterinary services standardize and improve their ability to prepare and respond quickly and appropriately to animal health emergencies. This tool is complemented by a module that specifically addresses aspects of surveillance and response to criminal or terrorist acts that require cooperation between veterinary services and law enforcement.”
Dr Ghazi Yehia. OIE Regional Representative for the Middle East stated that, “The World Organization for Animal Health actively supports its members to all hazards and multi-sectoral approach to plan for emergencies including animal health emergencies that might originate from crime and even terrorism.”
On behalf of HE Eng. Khaled Hnaifat, Minister of Agriculture, the Chief Veterinary Officer at the MoA, Eng. Issam Hawwa, said, “The Ministry of Agriculture is developing many long-term strategies for the agricultural sector and its various fields, such as the National Strategy for Agricultural Development 2016-2025.therefore, the MoA has prepared the national strategy for managing crises and disasters in the agricultural sector by taking several strategic steps, the most important of which is analyzing and evaluating the reality of the Ministry of Agriculture’s handling of these crises and identifying the general challenges that the ministry can face. ”
The project “Building resilience against agro-terrorism and agro-crime threats to animal health.”  is funded by the Global Affairs Canada and implemented by a consortium gathering the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Criminal Police organization (INTERPOL) and is being implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Jordan Armed Forces. Through its activities, including this workshop, the project aims to strengthen collaboration between veterinary and law enforcement authorities to build sustainable global and regional capacity in the event of an animal health emergency resulting from an act of agro-terrorism or agro-crime against animals.
Middle East is one of the three-targeted regions together with North Africa and Southeast Asia, and Jordan has been selected as a pilot country. It is expected that many countries will benefit from the outcomes of this innovative project.

Title: FAO/EBRD in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture conduct trainings on best practices on olive oil milling and olive oil quality
Content: 14 September 2022
Amman - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and with the support of the European Union (EU), are organizing two training sessions on  best practices in olive oil production for key players in Jordan’s olive oil sector. Participants in the training include policy-makers, government officials, large and small millers, and international business leaders, specialists from development institutions and investors. The trainings are organized specifically with the General Syndicate of Jordanian Olive Oil Mills Owners and Olive Producers and the Centre for the Promotion of Imports from developing countries (CBI).
The objectives of this training on milling best practices is to raise awareness among MoA’s agroengineers and mill technicians on the best practice to adopt and pitfalls to avoid in order to produce extra virgin olive oil. From harvesting, transportation, milling to storage, the international expert will go through the different steps of the production process and provide information on the practices to adopt, for example setting up the equipment and the variables to control during the production process, and their impact on the final quality of the product in terms of chemical and organoleptic properties of the oil. The training will be complemented by olive oil tasting sessions, as it is key for millers to also be able identify the positive and negative attributes in the olive oil.
As a result of the training, millers would have consolidated knowledge on the production best practices on milling efficiency and olive oil tasting. This will allow developing the domestic market and improving the visibility of Jordan olive oil on international markets as a producer of extra virgin olive oil.
This initiative is part of a project supporting the olive oil sector by developing sustainable value-chains through knowledge products and technical assistance under the EBRD-EU Value Chains Competitiveness Programme to enhance the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This programme draws on valuable experience in analyzing and addressing key constraints to the agri-food sector’s development in the SEMED region, in particular in the olive oil value-chain (Morocco, Tunisia, West Bank and Gaza Strip).
Within this project, the FAO Investment Center, in cooperation with the FAO Representation in Jordan, prepared a sector review study to assess the performance of the sector, its opportunities and gaps for transforming the olive oil sector. The sector review will be discussed at the beginning of next month with officials from the public and private sector. In terms of technical assistance, several workshops have been already conducted for olive oil SMEs, including a virtual training on differential strategies on international markets and on olive oil production best practices along the value-chain. The project also contributed to an evaluation of farming practices in selected olive producing farms.
The FAO Representative in Jordan, Engineer Nabil Assaf, stated, "Olives constitute 20% of the total cultivated areas with an estimated area of 570,000 dunums and 72% of the total fruit trees. Olive oil is one of the principal agri-food products in Jordan and a strategic crop from an environmental and socio-economic perspective as it is estimated to provide employment to about 80 000 households.The olive oil industry is an important source of employment for rural Jordanians. The country produces an average of 23,400 tonnes of olive oil per year, but most is sold in bulk to domestic consumers.”
The Director of the Olive Directorate at the Ministry of Agriculture, Engineer Osama Kattan, said, "The government of Jordan, represented by the Ministry of Agriculture, has sought to support the olive sector, given the increasing importance of the olive sector in the national economy, and in coordination with all official and private agencies that deal with the olive tree and olive oil in cultivation and manufacturing and trade within a well-established institutional base, in addition to coordinating with international institutions operating in Jordan to take advantage of their capabilities in serving this sector.”
Within the framework of the training, Mr. Zidan Al-Manaseer, the General Manager of the Modern Jordanian Company for Food Industries, which is hosting the training, stressed the importance of this training to the mill owners before the oil production season, to improve the levels of modern machinery and to improve the quality of Jordanian olive oil.
With demand for olive oil rising across the globe, Jordan’s olive oil sector has excellent potential to grow and tap into new markets, including export markets. And a stronger, more competitive olive oil industry would create jobs along the supply chain, especially for young people.
FAO and the EBRD will build on the experiences gained during the trainings – including support for the promotion of better olive oil quality in Jordan – to foster dialogue and cooperation between the public and private sectors to achieve a more efficient and inclusive olive sector.

Title: Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway, H.E. Ms. Anniken Huitfeldt, visits PSD in Amman
Content: 31 August 2022
Amman - On behalf of the Public Security Directorate of Jordan (PSD), Brigadier General Dr. Mutasem Abu Shatal, Acting Director of PSD, hosted the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway, H.E. Ms. Anniken Huitfeldt, at PSD’s headquarters in Amman on Monday, joined by the Representative of UN Women Jordan, Mr. Nicolas Burniat.
The visit was part of the longstanding, multistakeholder partnership between the governments of Jordan and Norway in promoting the participation of women in the military and security sectors, which falls under Jordan’s National Action Plan to implement UNSCR 1325 (JONAP).
In his welcoming remarks, Dr. Mutasem Abu Shatal expressed commitment of both the directorate and the country to women’s empowerment. “Today, we, at the PSD in particular, and in Jordan in general, view women as the foundations of each family, and institution. We support women in public security to reach the level of self-realization, unleash their energies, capabilities, and creativeness on the job, and to stand side by side with their fellow male colleagues in decision-making processes.”
JONAP’s 2021 annual report highlighted the plan’s national ownership, which recorded a 1.63% increase in the number of uniformed women in the PSD. As for the percentage of women deployed in peacekeeping missions, the PSD saw an increase of 4.2%. The directorate’s implementation of Gender-Mainstreaming Strategies (2021-2024) and gender-responsive policies has also resulted in the appointment of 49 gender focal points and officers across all governorates.
Mr. Nicolas Burniat commended the significant achievements made by PSD on strategic, tactical, and operational levels. “Jordan has been recognized as an example of national leadership for the effective localization of the Women, Peace and Security agenda. The deployment of women police officers in the first line of response continue to make differences within the framework of peacekeeping operations, and UN Women looks forward to strengthening our partnership on the JONAP as we move to its second phase” said the UN Women Jordan Representative.
H.E. Ms. Anniken Huitfeldt also lauded the partnership between Jordan and Norway in advancing the Women, Peace and Security agenda. “I am delighted to be here today, as a close partner of the Jordanian National Action Plan (JONAP),” she said. “The increase in women’s participation in the security sector has played a crucial role in ensuring women’s perspectives and needs are taken into account in decision-making processes. The implementation of JONAP has set an example in the region and beyond, enabling more women to take responsible roles in society. To this end, I am pleased to announce Norway's commitment to JONAP II through the pooled fund, as we are very proud of the achievements made, especially towards women’s contribution to peacebuilding.”
The Norwegian delegation was then briefed on the role of Family and Juvenile Protection Department in protection from and response to gender-based violence, the role of gender ambassadors, and the participation of women leaders in the directorate. The meeting also included a presentation by the Gender Office on the key results achieved under JONAP in collaboration with UN Women and the Jordanian National Commission for Women (JNCW).
The visit concluded with a discussion on the challenges and lessons learnt regarding women in leadership positions, in addition to future plans for implementing the PSD’s gender-mainstreaming strategy.

Content: 24 August 2022
Amman  – Representatives from the Embassy of Japan in Jordan, the Royal Medical Services (RMS) and UNOPS came together to mark the completion of the project which revitalized three critical RMS health facilities.
Funded by the Government of Japan and implemented by UNOPS, the “Urgent Operational Capacity Support to the Royal Medical Services for COVID-19 Response” project aimed at enhancing the operational capacity of the RMS to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide critical health services. Under the project, UNOPS rehabilitated and equipped the emergency department at the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, and rehabilitated the Intensive Care Units at Prince Zaid Hospital in Tafileh and Prince Ali Hospital in Karak, including upgrading of six isolation units.
Speaking at the ceremony, Dr. Yousef Zreikat, Director General of the Directorate of the Royal Medical Services said: “Collaboration between the Government of Japan and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has been extensive in many fields. Healthcare in particular, has received a great deal of support in the form of training, exchange of knowledge and expertise, and renewing of some of our outdated medical facilities.”
The Ambassador of Japan to Jordan, H.E. Mr. SHIMAZAKI Kaoru said: “Based on the solid bilateral relationship with Jordan, Japan has been providing supports to enhance the operational capacity of RMS since 2019, helped by close collaboration of JAF. In response to COVID-19 ramifications, the role of RMS is becoming increasingly crucial in Jordan’s health care system. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to RMS for their efforts in providing essential medical and humanitarian services not only to vulnerable Jordanians, but also to Syrian refugees to mitigate the various impacts of COVID-19.”
“Today’s occasion is a testament of the strong partnership between the Government of Jordan, the Royal Medical Services, the Government and the people of  Japan, and UNOPS - in supporting Jordan’s health sector and its capacities.”, said Muhammad Usman Akram, Director of UNOPS Multi-Country Office in Amman.

Title: Syrian refugees: UNHCR warns of a resurging humanitarian crisis in Jordan
Content: 22 August 2022
Funding falls short of meeting basic needs – UNHCR alone lacks 34 million US $ for health and cash assistance.

Amman - The refugee situation in Jordan may become a humanitarian crisis in a matter of months if urgent funding is not provided, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, warned in Amman on Monday. UNHCR alone lacks 34 million US $ to implement life-saving health and cash programmes in 2022. “Refugees still suffer from the economic hit from Covid-19, the cost-of-living crisis and now also from rising utility tariffs”, said UNHCR’s Representative Dominik Bartsch. “If no action is taken now, human suffering and the cost for the international community will be much higher”, he stressed.
Jordan hosts some 760,000 refugees, mainly Syrians (670,000), Iraqis, Yemenis and other nationalities. Over 80 per cent live among Jordanians in the communities. According to UNHCR’s recent vulnerability radar (VAF), their socio-economic situation in and outside camps is increasingly precarious. More and more refugees feel compelled to borrow money to buy food or pay their rent. 85 per cent of Syrian refugee households and even 93 per cent of refugees from other countries were holding debt in the first quarter of 2022 (up from 79 and 89 per cent in the third quarter of 2021). All refugees outside camps were three times more exposed to eviction threats than in 2018.
Food insecurity among refugees is also on the rise. A worrying 46 per cent of refugee parents say, they eat less so that younger children have enough on the table. In addition, an increasing number of families are sending their children to collect rubbish and earn a few Jordanian Dinar which leads to school dropout. A few weeks ago, refugees currently receiving food assistance were notified that the amounts will have to be reduced for lack of resources. “This announcement is a clear warning sign about rapidly declining international support”, said Bartsch. “We are very concerned about the increasing despair among refugees who see themselves confronted with yet another experience of uncertainty.” UNHCR received over 400 calls on its helpline in the first week after the announcement and numerous messages from worried refugees through other channels.
“In the name of refugees and the organizations supporting them, I appeal to the international community not to forget Jordan and its refugees,” the UNHCR Representative said. “If funding does not come fast, it is feared that the situation is going to slide back into a humanitarian crisis in a few months’ time”, Bartsch warned.

Title: FAO launches training to strengthen the epidemiological capacity of the Government of Jordan’s veterinary services
Content: 21 August 2022
Amman - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with funding from the Defense and Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)- USA and in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Royal Veterinary College - UK launches the Field Epidemiology Training Program for Veterinarians (FETPV).
The four-week training will be delivered in two sessions over a 3-month post-mentorship training period. The main objective of this training is to produce competent field veterinary epidemiologists in Jordan who can interact with animal owners, investigate, assess, analyze, and report the findings of outbreak investigations effectively and rapidly. The program is also expected to improve veterinarians’ capacity for animal disease prevention, detection, and response.
FAO conducted a scoping mission to Jordan with the support of the Directorate of Veterinary Services (DVS) in October 2019 to identify and provide the necessary support for strengthening veterinary services in Jordan. Furthermore, in March 2022, FAO together with the Royal Veterinary College London carried out a follow-up mission to Jordan to assess veterinary epidemiology training needs and gaps. Based on the findings of these two FAO missions and the positive feedback received from the Directorate of Veterinary Services and taking into account the recommendations of the Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) evaluation, the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), and the National Action Plan for Health Security, it was agreed to provide support for epidemiology capacity building in Jordan.
Field epidemiology skills and capacities are at the core of veterinary workforce development as they enable the detection, prevention, control and management of animal diseases, including zoonoses. One of FAO’s core mandates is therefore to support countries in developing their epidemiology capacity. This activity is within the framework of the project "Strengthening Global Veterinary Epidemiology Capabilities and Rapid Regional Disease Surveillance", which assesses the specific needs of Jordan to develop a training program that fulfils these gaps. And an assessment will be carried out in a systematic and harmonized way to allow better data interpretation and comparisons across countries.

Title: A unique scholarship programme that makes university studies possible for refugees, turns 30 – DAFI
Content: 18 August 2022
Amman - UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, marks the 30 years anniversary of DAFI, the Albert Einstein German Academic Refugee Initiative Fund, a scholarship programme which allowed generations of refugees around the globe to go to university.
The programme was introduced to Jordan in 2007, and has provided 978 young refugees from in and outside camps with the means to pursue higher education opportunities in Jordanian universities over the years, of which 119 are currently enrolled, and an additional 15 joining this year. DAFI ensures gender balance, with 62 per cent of the currently enrolled students being young ladies. Refugee students from Syria, Iraq, Sudan, and other countries, are majoring in a variety of fields, from medicine to engineering, linguistics, and computer sciences, among many other studies.
The DAFI scholarship covers tuition fees, books, transportation expenses and a subsistence allowance. Without this support, many refugees would never have the chance to access higher education, taking into consideration the relatively high tuitions fees in Jordan, in a time where many refugees encounter challenges in securing their most basic needs.
Mohammad, who arrived from Syria as a child, is about to complete his bachelor’s degree in Arabic literature: “I am one semester away from graduation, thanks to the DAFI scholarship programme” he says, looking forward to starting a new chapter in his life.
As of July 2022, 223,266 refugees in Jordan are between 18 and 35 years old, an age that comes with high expectations to complete their education and achieve their life goals. However, access to higher education remains a major challenge for the majority.
“Higher education represents the beacon of hope for youth, motivating young women and men to achieve and be productive members of the host community, but also be part of the reconstruction of their home country when the time comes”, says UNHCR Representative to Jordan, Dominik Bartsch, to underline the necessity to invest in the access to higher education for refugees.
This initiative would not have seen the light without the generosity of the Government of Germany, which for the past 30 years has been upholding higher education for refugees globally, and the Said Foundation, a prime supporter of refugees in the region. The programme is also generously funded by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Hikma Pharmaceuticals.
Ms. Catherine Thomé, Chief Executive at Saïd Foundation said: “We are immensely proud of our partnership with the DAFI programme. The programme empowers talented young people and enables them to become drivers of positive change in their communities and host communities. We have a great admiration for DAFI scholars, whose determination, resilience, and passion, give us real hope for a brighter future.”
The chargé d’affaires at the German Embassy in Amman, Mr. Florian Reindel, added: “refugees must not be seen as a burden, but as assets to society. As the biggest donor to the DAFI scholarship programme, Germany is proud to provide young bright refugees with access to higher education and a perspective for their future”.

Title: UNDP Assistant Administrator visits Jordan, discusses youth, education, and private sector
Content: 31 July 2022
Amman - The UN Development Programme (UNDP) Assistant Administrator, Usha Rao-Monari has returned from a four-days visit to Amman, Jordan, where she attended the Regional High-Level Forum on Young People’s Learning, Skilling, Social Inclusion and Transition to Decent Work, and met with government officials, local communities, private sector representatives, development partners and members of the United Nations in Jordan.
Rao-Monari’s visit focused on development challenges and opportunities in Jordan and explored UNDP’s role in supporting development and reform efforts, and in strengthening partnerships with national institutions, the private sector, UN and international partners.
UNDP has operated in Jordan for over 45 years and works across the country to assist Jordanians and refugees to meet their most urgent needs, contribute to sustainable development and bring about real change in people’s lives. While the challenges Jordan faces are unpredictable, UNDP is strategically positioned to provide support on policy coherence and dialogue through mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other priorities across national and local development plans and strategies.
In meeting with Jordan’s Minister of Water and Irrigation, H.E. Eng. Raed Muzaffar Abu Al-Saud, Rao-Monari highlighted collaboration opportunities between UNDP and the ministry to advance SDG implementation, particularly the goal on clean water and sanitation for all (SDG 6).
“Addressing the effects of climate change on the fragile water resources will require effective coordination between countries in the region and exchange of climate data and technical experiences. UNDP is well-positioned to advance this approach through South-South Cooperation”, said. Rao Monari.
Another critical area is youth empowerment, as Jordan has one of the youngest populations in the world with 63 percent under the age of 30.
“The current wave of technological change has the potential to strengthen the abilities and productivity of workers, including young people, at all skill levels and create new and more flexible ways of participating in the workforce, strengthening inclusivity and social cohesion in the process,” said the Associate Administrator at the Regional High-Level Forum on Young People’s Learning, Skilling, Social Inclusion and Transition to Decent Work.
“But this potential can only be unlocked if countries make the right investments in education, upskilling and reskilling large cohorts of the population and designing a labour policy fit for the 21st century Young people have a crucial role to play in this sense, said the Associate Administrator at the Regional High-Level Forum on Young People’s Learning, Skilling, Social Inclusion and Transition to Decent Work.”
Collaboration with the private sector was a third critical theme of the visit and impact investment has emerged as one of UNDP’s focus areas in the Arab States region. In Amman, Ms. Rao-Monari launched the report “Seeds of Impact”, a joint initiative of Beyond Capital and UNDP which showcases the sustainability journey of funds and businesses that drive social and environmental impact in Jordan, while generating profit.
To further strengthen partnerships for stronger development impact, the Associate Administrator thanked partners for providing support to UNDP Jordan in a meeting with Ambassadors and International Development organisations and highlighted the work on women’s economic empowerment, financing for development and mitigation of the Syrian crises on host communities.
Ms. Rao-Monari also met with the Heart of Amman Programme partners, which works to build inclusive societies by promoting social cohesion and citizen participation and facilitating broad stakeholder engagement in development.
Concluding the visit, Ms. Rao-Monari met H.E. Mr. Nasser Shraideh, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, to express appreciation for the strong partnership, reiterating UNDP’s commitment to support the government’s vision and efforts on political and economic reforms, including efforts to Leave No One Behind, decentralization and local economic development.

Title: Empowering women and adolescent girls with the “Me and My Mobile” course
Content: 31 July 2022
Amman - Following its success over the last three years, UNFPA Jordan’s “Me and My Mobile” course is back for a fourth run this year. Partnering with one of the region’s leading mobile telecom companies, Zain Jordan, and Noor Al-Hussein Foundation Institute for Family Health, the “Me and My Mobile” course has the empowerment of adolescent girls and women at the core of its mission.
Over two months, the course will be offered twice to two different groups of women and adolescent girls from Sweileh and Zarqa. Each course will run for 8 weeks, with each session providing training on how to use their smartphones to safely set up an email account, connect with their peers, explore online educational and employment opportunities, develop their knowledge of social media and Instagram marketing, and use period tracking app to improve their knowledge of sexual and reproductive health.
To further promote the prevention and response to gender-based violence (GBV), UNFPA Jordan has expanded the 2022 “Me and My Mobile” curriculum to include a session dedicated to strengthening the participants’ awareness of cybercrimes and methods of reporting online sexual harassment. Collaborating with legal service providers, the participants will learn to use new smartphone apps to protect themselves and feel safer.
As one of the participants in the course expressed, “It is important for me to learn how to face cyberbullying on social media and share this information with other girls,” Yasmine, 15 years old.
Kicking off its first session last week, the “Me and My Mobile” course aims to bridge the gap between women and adolescent girls and their male counterparts in terms of their access to and use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in their daily lives.
Lama Al-Sa’d, GBV Program Associate at UNFPA Jordan commented, “The Me and My Mobile course will feed into UNFPA’s efforts to build skills among women and girls that go beyond traditional gender roles. Offering a new course on how to use smartphones to gather information is one way to ensure young women are connected with a set of digital opportunities to benefit them privately and in pursuing careers.”

Title: JONAP Programme Board presents Framework for the Second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security
Content: 26 July 2022
Amman - On behalf of the Chair of the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Women’s Empowerment, Her Excellency Wafa’a Bani Mustafa, Minister of State for Legal Affairs, Dr. Salma Nims, the Secretary General of the Jordanian Commission for Women (JNCW), convened the Programme Board of Jordan’s National Action Plan (JONAP) on the United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (WPS) on Thursday, 21 July 2022.
JONAP, recognized globally as a good practice in United Nations Secretary General Annual Reports, has contributed to regional security and stability as a catalyst for replication on global and regional levels. Since its inception, women have been represented in greater numbers in the security sector and in decision-making roles, with significant advances made in the gender responsiveness of the justice sector. The programme has reached 21,181 women and girls with prevention and protection services on gender-based violence.
Recognizing the importance of gender equality and the role of women in peace and security, JONAP represents a unique framework that brings together the Government, security and military sectors, civil society organizations and other national institutions to create a gender-responsive security sector, with meaningful participation of women in peacekeeping, peacebuilding, preventing radicalization and violent extremism and access to gender-sensitive humanitarian services by Jordanians and Syrian refugees.
On behalf of the donor consortium supporting the JONAP implementation, which includes the Governments of Canada, Cyprus, Finland, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom, H.E. Donica Pottie, Ambassador of Canada to Jordan, commended Jordan’s commitment to the Women, Peace and Security agenda, and said, “JONAP is also an excellent example of partnership. We commend UN Women and JNCW for their effective and insightful implementation, their diligent collaboration with all partners and their commitment to ensuring a broad and comprehensive consultation process to inform the next phase”.
Dr. Salma Nims, Secretary General of The Jordanian National Commission for Women, provided an overview of the achievements and lessons learned from the implementation of JONAP, highlighting that since 2018, the participation of women across Jordanian security and military institutions, has increased by 2.2 per cent. She also noted the increase in the representation of women in UN peacekeeping missions from 8.65 per cent since the beginning of JONAP to 11.5 per cent in December 2021. She presented the framework for the next phase of the programme, JONAP II, which will continue to leverage the national ownership and leadership to advance WPS agenda, with strengthened focus on gender, climate, and security as well as youth, peace and security.
Brigadier General Dr. Mutasem Abu Shatal, Assistant for Administration and Human Resources, Public Security Directorate and Colonel Maha Al-Nasser, Director of the Military Women's Affairs Department, Jordanian Armed Forces acknowledged the achievements made by women in the security sector agencies, which have also been actively engaged in enhancing national protection mechanisms, particularly prevention and protection services for survivors of domestic violence, reaffirming their commitment to foster an enabling environment for women’s participation. Dr. Nawal Al Jawhari, Director of Judicial Institute in Jordan, commended the close partnerships fostered between the justice sector and key stakeholders through JONAP.
Representatives from the civil society, Ms. Wesal Abduallah from Arab Woman Organization, on behalf of Coalition 1325, Ms. Hiba Haddaden, Madaba Cultural Forum for Children, on behalf of community-based organizations and grassroot women’s groups, and Ms. Nuha Muhreiz, representing the Jordanian National NGOs Forum, highlighted the importance of building the capacity of civil society organizations through JONAP, providing recommendations on localization of the principles of WPS for the next phase of the programme.
Ms. Aisha Mukhtar, Deputy Representative of UN Women in Jordan, praised the strength of national ownership of the plan in her concluding remarks regarding the significance of the Jordanian national plan as a model for its comprehensive design, cross-sectoral cooperation, and effective financing mechanism. She stated, "We look forward to continue our excellent cooperation in the second phase to build on the tangible gains made thus far and to accelerate and bolster the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1325 in Jordan."
The meeting concluded with the approval of the annual work plan for the first Jordanian national plan 2022 and the presentation of a framework for the next phase, for the second Jordanian national plan to activate Security Council Resolution 1325, which will continue to benefit from national ownership and leadership to advance the women's, security and peace agenda with a stronger emphasis on gender, climate, and security, in addition to youth, peace, and security.

Title: As summer droughts bite from Italy to India, Economist Impact study in Jordan shows what awaits a world in water deficit
Content: 21 July 2022
Amman - A new study by Economist Impact, commissioned by UNICEF, warns that serious socio-economic consequences await countries around the world as they battle both rising temperatures, climate change and a crunch on food prices - with children and women disproportionately affected.
According to Tapped out: The costs of water stress in Jordan, one of the most water-stressed nations in the world is a blueprint for growing water shortages globally as demand continues to outstrip supply. Included in the study findings:
Like much of the world, Jordan is facing a declining supply of freshwater and ever-growing demand, exacerbated by the fact that around 50% of the water supplied is lost due to technical or commercial losses. The study also highlights that women and girls are disproportionately affected by inadequate water access due to their role in domestic activities and the importance of sanitation for dealing with menstruation, pregnancy and infant care. Inadequate access to proper sanitation and hygiene will also have a knock-on effect on national efforts to increase the participation of women in the workforce.
With tensions over water resources rising in the Middle East and North Africa region as the climate heats up, the study emphasises the importance of dialogue and diplomacy needed to enhance water security. Jordan as a downstream country currently obtains 40% of its water from transboundary basins, leaving it heavily dependent on its upstream neighbours.
The study includes recommendations for policy choices that can reduce water stress and help protect vulnerable populations and the economy. New desalination projects, reduced water loss and leakage revisions to the water tariff schedule can significantly minimise growth in water stress and the resulting damages. Meanwhile, regional cooperation for an integrated management of rivers and aquifers that are shared with neighbouring countries would strengthen regional water security. The international community also has a role to play by providing monetary assistance and resources.
Commenting on the report, lead author Matus Samel said: “Jordan may be an outlier because it is one of the most water stressed parts of the world, but it is a blueprint for where a world in water deficit is going. In nearly every part of the world, demand is greater than supply and climate change is drying up critical water supplies. Without swift action to make water systems everywhere more efficient, we are facing a water crunch that will eclipse the food crunch we are already experiencing.”
Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan, added: “Climate change and water scarcity is a child rights crisis. Taking urgent action now to protect this extremely precious resource is not only in Jordan’s best interest but, as this study shows, a regional and global imperative to protect the livelihoods of this and future generations. UNICEF will continue to work closely with the Government of Jordan and partners to support capacity building to identify and address the risks to WASH services posed by climate change and water scarcity.”

Title: UN-Habitat support Amman City to launch the first report analysing SDGs at the local level in the Arab Region
Content: 13 July 2022
Amman - Crucial to understanding the state of cities and building their resilience is up-to-date information, data and analyses of urban contexts and trends. The Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) will discuss its experience regarding the Voluntary Local Review (VLR), a subnational report that assesses the progress of local governments in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in a session on the margins of the High-Level Political Forum on 11 July.
The meeting of the HLPF in 2022 is held from 5 July to 15 July 2022 under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council, focusing this year on the theme of “Building back better from the coronavirus disease while advancing the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”.
The session on the margins of the High-Level Political Forum is organized by the UN Regional Commissions, including United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), to discuss increased policy coherence and accelerated implementation of the 2030 agenda, giving experience from different regions.
Forty-four countries are expected to carry out voluntary national reviews (VNRs) of their implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development .
The lack of urban data collection tools is one of the challenges of advancing urban development. Addressing this challenge, UN-Habitat, ESCWA and the United Cities and Local Governments - Middle East and West Asia Section (UCLG-MEWA), in close cooperation with GAM, led the development of the VLR, which is the first of its kind in the Arab region.
The VLRs mechanism has become an essential tool for cities around the world in reporting and tracking SDGs progress. “We hope to continue to support the collection and analysis of data at the local level in order to achieve effective urban development that is adequate to the Arab region,” Dr. Erfan Ali, UN-Habitat regional representative for the Arab region, said about the importance of VLRs.
In the Arab region, following an inclusive and participatory approach, two cities have started developing their VLRs, namely, Amman, Jordan, and Agadir, Morocco, with more cities due to begin the process later this year.

Title: Cascading global crises threaten human survival and the SDG roadmap is the way forward
Content: 07 July 2022
New York – The climate crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and an increased number of conflicts around the world have placed the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in jeopardy, according to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022, released by the United Nations today.
The Report highlights the severity and magnitude of the challenges before us, with these cascading and intersecting crises creating spin-off impacts on food and nutrition, health, education, the environment, and peace and security, and affecting all the SDGs, the blueprint for more resilient, peaceful and equal societies.

COVID-19 AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
According to the latest data presented in the Report, the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc across the Goals and its effects are still far from over. Global “excess deaths” directly and indirectly attributable to COVID-19 reached 15 million by the end of 2021. More than four years of progress in alleviating poverty have been wiped out, pushing 93 million more people worldwide into extreme poverty in 2020. An estimated 147 million children also missed more than half of their in-person instruction over the past two years. The pandemic also severely disrupted essential health services, derailing hard-won progress on SDG 3.

CLIMATE EMERGENCY
Meanwhile, the world is on the verge of a climate catastrophe where billions of people are already feeling the consequences. Energy-related CO2 emissions for 2021 rose by 6 per cent, reaching their highest level ever and completely wiping out pandemic-related declines. To avoid the worst effects of climate change, as set out in the Paris Agreement, global greenhouse gas emissions will need to peak before 2025 and then decline by 43 per cent by 2030, falling to net zero by 2050. Instead, under current voluntary national commitments to climate action, greenhouse gas emissions will rise by nearly 14 per cent over the next decade.

WAR IN UKRAINE
The war in Ukraine is creating one of the largest refugee crises of modern time. As of May 2022, over 100 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes. The crisis has caused food, fuel and fertilizer prices to skyrocket, further disrupted supply chains and global trade, roiled financial markets, and threatened global food security and aid flows. Projected global economic growth for 2022 was cut by 0.9 percentage point, due to the war in Ukraine and potential new waves of the pandemic.
The world’s most vulnerable countries and population groups are disproportionately impacted. Women have suffered a greater share of job losses combined with increased care work at home. Some evidence suggests that violence against women has been exacerbated by the pandemic.
Young people continue to have higher unemployment rates than before the pandemic, and child labour and child marriage are on the rise. Least developed countries struggle with weak economic growth, rising inflation, major supply-chain disruptions, policy uncertainties, and unsustainable debt.

A ROADMAP OUT OF CRISIS
Today, we are on the verge of a critical juncture. Either we fail to deliver on our commitments to assist the world's most vulnerable, or we step up our efforts to rescue the SDGs and deliver meaningful progress for people and planet by 2030.
“The road map laid out in the Sustainable Development Goals is clear,” stated Mr. Liu Zhenmin, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. “Just as the impact of crises is compounded when they are linked, so are solutions. When we take action to strengthen social protection systems, improve public services and invest in clean energy, for example, we address the root causes of increasing inequality, environmental degradation and climate change.”
The report also emphasizes that to emerge stronger from the crisis and prepare for unknown challenges ahead, funding our data and information infrastructure must be a priority for national governments and the international community.
Additional key facts and figures:
·       The combined crises could lead to an additional 75 million to 95 million people living in extreme poverty in 2022, compared with pre-pandemic projections.
·       About 1 in 10 people worldwide are suffering from hunger and nearly 1 in 3 people lack regular access to adequate food.
·       Immunization coverage dropped for the first time in 10 years, and deaths from TB and malaria increased.
·       In 2020, the global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by an estimated 25 per cent, with young people and women most affected.
·       In 2021, an estimated 17 million metric tons of plastic entered the world’s ocean and the volume of plastic pollution entering the ocean is expected to double or triple by 2040.
·       About 24 million learners from the pre-primary to university level are at risk of not returning to school.
·       The number of Internet users surged by 782 million to reach 4.9 billion people in 2021 from 4.1 billion in 2019.
·       In low-income countries, the total public and publicly guaranteed debt service to export ratio rose from an average of 3.1 per cent in 2011 to 8.8 per cent in 2020.
The Sustainable Development Report 2022 presents data provided by over 200 countries and areas around the world. While this year’s report demonstrates the dire impacts of the current crises on the 17 Goals, it clearly demonstrates that realizing the SDGs is the remedy needed to address our global challenges. To achieve the SDGs demands urgent transformative action and evidence-based approaches at a global scale.

Title: UNFPA in Jordan honors Mama Munira - the first midwife in Jordan
Content: 28 June 2022
Amman - The United Nations Population Fund in Jordan, UNFPA, celebrated an exceptional woman and mid-wife, Ms. Munira Shaban.
“Mama Munira” was honored in recognition of receiving the Medal of Excellence from His Majesty, King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein, her outstanding contribution to Midwifery in Jordan and her service as a mid-Wife at the UNFPA-supported Sexual and Reproductive Health Clinic in Zaatari Refugee Camp.
“Munira celebrates her 50th year working as a nurse and midwife in Jordan. Today, she serves some of the most vulnerable women and families in Zaatari Refugee Camp, who live under extraordinary circumstances. We are proud that Munira is part of UNFPA’s efforts reach its strategic goals for 2030, of zero preventable maternal deaths”, said Ms. Ensherah Ahmad, UNFPA in Jordan Representative
The event was attended by H.E. Maria Hadjitheodosiou, EU Ambassador to Jordan, H.E. Alexandra Rydmark, Sweden's Ambassador to Jordan, H.E. Donica Pottie, Ambassador of Canada to Jordan, H.E Norwegian Ambassador to Jordan, Espen Lindbæck and Dr. Ya’rub Ajlouni, JIHASi CEO.
“Today, in Zaatari Camp, I feel honored to provide refugee women and families with the knowledge and awareness I gained over the years about sexual and reproductive health. At the age of 4-years old, I became a refugee when my family fled our home in Jerusalem. Life was difficult, but I was determined to pursue my dream of becoming a mid-wife and obtain the highest level of education in my field”, said Munira.
Born in Jerusalem in 1944, Munira lived with her family in the city of Salt in Jordan until she completed high-school. She went on to complete a 3-year training in Midwifery at the Augusta Victoria Hospital in Jerusalem. She returned to Salt, three years later, becoming Jordan’s first certified mid-wife.
During the event, Mama Munira was presented a letter of gratitude from UNFPA Executive Director, Dr. Natalia Kanem, congratulating her on receiving this royal honor, and on her life-long service in preventing maternal morbidity and mortality for thousands of women and babies.
In her letter, Dr. Kanem wrote, “UNFPA believes that midwives following your legacy should have a greater role in leadership and governance to drive advancements in health policies and service deliveries. With such dedication, you proved to be an invaluable resource and a great role model”.

Title: Ministry of Education, HCD endorsed Jordan Declaration on Inclusion and Diversity in Education in partnership with UNESCO, GIZ
Content: 26 June 2022
Amman, 27 June 2022 - Education stakeholders and partners in Jordan made a firm commitment to every child’s right to a quality education by declaring that inclusion and diversity must be the very foundation upon which education must build back better from the devastating impact of the pandemic.
The Jordan Declaration on Inclusion and Diversity in Education was endorsed under the leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Mired Raad Zeid Al Hussein, President of the Higher Council for the Right of Persons with Disabilities (HCD), and His Excellency Prof Wajih Owais, Minister of Education (MOE), together with various national and international education partners at the High-Level Policy Dialogue “Towards greater inclusion and diversity in education for better learning outcomes” on June 26, 2022. This crucial step in Jordan’s journey towards the right to education for all was organized in partnership with UNESCO and GIZ on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.
“Inclusive Education is the most effective means to improve learning outcomes, prevent discriminatory attitudes and behaviours, address the health and well-being of all learners, ensure space availability and the right to education for all,” said HE Prof Owaiss.
The high-level event brought together over 70 officials and representatives from the Ministry of Education and other line ministries, HCD, development partners, international and national stakeholders and non-governmental and community-based organizations, who reiterated their commitment to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) by 2030 to "Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all". They committed and agreed to jointly advocate for and work towards putting learners’ inclusion and diversity at the heart of education post Covid-19 and to address the ‘Transforming Education’ agenda.
Over the past decades, Jordan has taken some important steps towards inclusion within the education sector. This is, in line with the government’s ambition to lead the region towards greater equality amongst persons with and without disabilities. The High-Level Policy Dialogue deliberated on the opportunities and challenges in key areas and tracks to transform education in the country. Panel discussions which brought together government officials, education and development partners, the civil society, as well as student and youth representatives addressed a wide range of education themes and issues that are crucial to move towards greater inclusion and diversity.
The adopted Jordan Declaration on Inclusion and Diversity in Education highlights the definition of inclusion and diversity in education and 10 groups of children most vulnerable to exclusion from and within education reached through wide national consultations in 2021. The Declaration also outlines nine areas of action to achieve greater inclusion and diversity in Jordan, specifically through system strengthening; operationalized legal frameworks; better data collection and access; improved equitable funding and sustainable programming; systematic capacity and professional development; better and safer learning environments, coordinated advocacy and planning; removing barriers and mainstreaming inclusion; and better and more relevant learning.
“Protecting the right to education of its learners and ensuring equal opportunities for all, especially after the COVID pandemic that has exacerbated disparities and inequalities, the Jordan Declaration also brings the country closer to fulfilling its obligations under the Convention Against Discrimination in Education,” said Min Jeong Kim, UNESCO Representative to Jordan.
Ms Elisabeth Girrbach, GIZ Jordan Country Director, applauded the remarkable milestone that has been achieved today. She iterated that, inclusive education is an obligation and not a luxury, nevertheless it takes a concerted effort of all stakeholders and will not happen overnight. This joint vision and understanding reached with the Declaration on Inclusion embraces the diversity of abilities and background found among children in the schools across Jordan and makes sure no learner will be left behind.
“Inclusive education for children with disabilities is a huge challenge, I wish we had started 30-40 years ago…” stated HRH Prince Mired before the signing ceremony. “There are millions of good practices from countries that have done it before us. We must learn from them and speed up the process. We must own the problem. This is our issue. There are sceptics but we must prove them wrong. We have to succeed. These are our children. We are serious. The Ministry of Education is serious. We have the political will and ownership. His Majesty the King is very serious about this issue. We have all the elements in place. All we have to do is pull up our sleeves and get down to it. For our work to be sustainable, we have to do it, and be in the driver’s seat. We have to move forward and upwards… forward and upwards!”
The endorsement of the Declaration on Inclusion and Diversity in Education is timely as it comes right before H.E Minister of Education’s participation in the Ministerial Transforming Education Pre-Summit taking place at UNESCO in Paris, 28‐30 June 2022. The pre-summit will provide the Jordanian delegation the opportunity to inspire other countries by sharing key milestones already achieved in the education sector. This will feed into the Transforming Education Summit to be held at the United Nations in September 2022. The Summit aims to mobilize action, ambition, solidarity and solutions with a view to transforming education between now, 2030 and beyond. “I will be proud to bring with me our commitment for action through the Jordan Declaration on Inclusion and Diversity in Education” said HE Prof Owaiss in his closing remarks.

Title: UNHCR celebrates refugee contributions to Jordanian society
Content: 20 June 2022
Amman - On 20 June, World Refugee Day, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is honoring Jordan’s continued hospitality in welcoming and hosting refugees. Focusing on the right to seek safety, World Refugee Day this year will showcase how refugees from multiple nationalities have been able to find a safe haven in Jordan but also rebuild their lives and become a productive part of society.
“World Refugee Day is not only an occasion to remember the hardship and pain refugees have gone through in fleeing their countries, but also the strength, courage and determination they have shown in the years since,” said Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Representative to Jordan.
To mark the occasion, UNHCR is holding a public event in Amman which will run from 6PM to 8PM on 20 June at the Ras al Ain Hangar During the event refugees from different nationalities will share their stories as well as music, dance, art, food, and different aspects of their cultures. The Jordanian band AutoStrad will also be performing.
Supported by the Greater Amman Municipality, and in the presence of H.E. the Minister of Interior, Mazin Farrayeh and the Head of the Syrian Refugee Affairs Directorate, Brigadier General Tareq Azar, ambassadors of donor countries, UN agencies, NGO organizations, and the general public, the event brings together all sectors of Jordanian society to showcase the skills of refugees and the generosity of the Jordanian host community.
The overwhelming support of Jordanians towards refugees is reflected in new data released by UNHCR this week, which shows that 96% of Jordanians are sympathetic towards refugees. This figure has increased from 92% in just six months. Additionally, the majority of Jordanians – 81% of the survey respondents – say they support the inclusion of refugees within Jordanian national systems such as health and education.
Commenting on these findings, Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Representative to Jordan, said “The positive publicsentiment towards refugees is a cornerstone for their continued acceptance and inclusion within Jordanian society. On World Refugee Day, we would like to celebrate Jordan and its people, who demonstrate their generosity and kindness at times when global displacement has reached unprecedented levels.
Figures taken from UNHCR’s latest Global Trends report, released in June, show one in every 14 people in Jordan is a refugee and that globally, the number of people fleeing war, persecution and conflict has exceeded 100 million in 2022. This is the highest level that UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency has seen in over 70 years.
Jordan currently hosts hover 760,000 refugees, 85 per cent of whom live outside of refugee camps in urban areas. The continued generosity of the Government of Jordan and the hospitality of its people over the past decades has been key to safeguarding the refugees’ access to safety and asylum. As a result, Jordan is globally recognized as an example of how to welcome people forced to flee.
Despite this, 64 percent of refugees in Jordan continue to live on less than 3JOD per day. As revealed by UNHCR’s recent Vulnerability Assessment, although most refugees in Jordan earn their own income through work and are self-sufficient, the amount of money they survive on is not enough to pull them out of poverty.
UNHCR continues to call for solidarity and responsibility-sharing from the international community, not only for those UNHCR protects, but also for Jordan as host country given the major social and economic impact of hosting refugees.

Title: FAO Jordan paves the way to a greener future
Content: 13 June 2022
Amman -The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) inaugurated its new solar-energy system at its premises in Jordan. With its launch, the system is expected to enhance business continuity and reduce the climate impacts of FAO Jordan, all while decreasing energy costs and promoting sustainable development in the region.
Amongst the distinguished guests in attendance, the launch ceremony included the participation of H.E Dr. Muawieh Radaideh, Minister of Environment, H.E Ms. Amani Al Azzam, Secretary General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Dr. AbdulHakim Elwaer, FAO Assistant Director General (ADG) and Regional Representative for the Near East and North Africa, and Rodrigo de Lapuerta, Director of Logistics Services Division, CSL. Further attendees included the Corporate Environmental Responsibility and FAO Jordan teams, as well as colleagues from the UNDP Green Energy Team, whose constant support was invaluable to the realization of this project.
In line with FAO’s Corporate Environmental Responsibility Strategy (CER) 2020-2030, the CER team of CSLI, the FAO Jordan office, and the UNDP Green Energy Team pave the way towards a low carbon FAO with this 13kWp grid-tied solar PV system installation. The system will be able to cover approximately 50% of the office’s electricity consumption and save approximately 11 tonnes of CO2 emissions every year.
H.E Dr. Muawieh Radaideh, Minister of Environment, stated “Today's celebration goes beyond installing a solar energy system to having supporters to deliver the message that energy efficiency is key.”
H.E Ms. Amani Al Azzam, Secretary General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources congratulated and valued the commitment of FAO Jordan towards a green future.
“FAO Jordan is one of the first FAO Offices in the region that turned to solar energy to power its operations with the installation of a Solar PV system, in a remarkable effort to curb its carbon footprint.”  said Dr. AbdulHakim Elwaer, FAO Assistant Director General (ADG) and Regional Representative for the Near East and North Africa.
FAO’s Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf, said “With energy efficiency initiatives that will increase the sustainability of our facilities, FAO Jordan is paving the way towards the 45% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, as stipulated by the FAO Corporate Environmental Responsibility Strategy 2020-2030.” he added “Today we are taking action to lower our greenhouse gas emissions to ensure a viable future for us and the generations to come.”
Rodrigo de Lapuerta, Director of Logistics Services Division, said “This system is the product of a lot of hard work and collaboration between the FAO Jordan office and UNDP and FAO teams. The principles that have defined this project, namely teamwork, determination, a passion for environmental issues, are the foundations that FAO use to walk the talk, and will be the crucial drivers for the attainment of the SDGs, as well as the fight against climate change.”
Switching to renewable energy has strong environmental incentives, namely saving CO2 emissions, effectively reducing the carbon footprint and burden on the environment. This supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, while also promoting green energy solutions and inspiring local communities to adopt similar solutions

Title: Child Labour Task Forces launches nationwide activities on occasion of World Day Against Child Labour 2022
Content: 12 June 2022
Amman - The Secretary-General of the Ministry of Labour, Farouk Hadidi, on behalf of the Minister of Labour Nayef Stetieh, launched a series of national activities on occasion of the World Day Against Child Labour 2022 in the Haya Cultural Centre. The 2022 theme of this world day, which falls on June 12 every year, is “Universal Social Protection to End Child Labour”.
Those participating in these national events include the Ministries of Labour; Education; and Social Development; the Juvenile and Family Protection Department of the Public Security Directorate; the National Council for Family Affairs; the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); the International Labour Organisation (ILO); Tamkeen for Legal Aid and Human Rights; Plan International; Arab Renaissance for Democracy and Development (ARDD); Terre des hommes; the Jordan Hashemite Fund for Human Development (JOHUD); International Medical Corps (IMC), Save the Children, Rowad Al-Khair Association and the Institute for Family Health (IFH).
All participating ministries, governmental entities, organisations and associations are existing members of the Child Labour Task Force, and are implementing a series of national week-long activities, starting with a launching event, which included a panel discussion wherein children from the Jordanian Child Parliament took to the podium to ask panel members (select decision-makers and relevant partners from the Child Labour Task Force) a series of questions surrounding child labour. Additionally, a freeze mob was conducted by children from JOHUD.
During his opening remarks, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Labour, Farouk Al-Hadidi, announced that the Ministry of Labour, in partnership with the Child Labour Task Force, launched a campaign for 2022 under the title of #StillAChild to shed light on the national efforts being made to combat child labour, while focusing on the issue of working children and how to help them. Moreover, Hadidi called for more national efforts to reduce child labour by governments, employers and workers alike, in addition to the participation of the local community, civil society institutions and the media.
Furthermore, Hadidi indicated that the Ministry of Labour had established a specialised department to deal with child labor issues since 1999, matching the time that the Jordanian labour law aligned with international conventions on combating child labour. The law forbids the employment of children under the age of 16, and also forbids the employment of children in dangerous work environments before the age of 18, provided that their working hours do not exceed six-a-day, and that they do not work during the night time, on official holidays, or the weekend.
Hadidi emphasized that reducing child labour requires concerted efforts from all governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, in addition to efforts from society, families, civil society institutions and employers in the commitment and application of all relevant legislation that preserves the rights of children, especially the right to an education and attempting to minimise the number of children in the labour market in order to prepare them to return to school.
Following Hadidi's remarks, the Secretary-General of the NCFA, Dr. Mohammad Miqdadi, confirmed that the NCFA, under the directives of Her Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah is working to give priority to issues surrounding childhood, including an emphasis on child labour. Miqdadi indicated that through its chairmanship of the Child Labour Task Force, the NCFA was able to coordinate and integrate efforts among all concerned parties. He pointed out that this event embodied the spirit of the participatory approach and is an opportunity to emphasize the implementation of the national framework to combat child labour that was approved in 2021. This national working document defines technical methodologies and responsibilities for all parties concerned with childhood issues, and mechanisms for responding to cases of children in work situations, and provides comprehensive and integrated services in the best interest of them. Moreover, Miqdadi emphasized the importance of the government's recent approval of the draft Child Rights Bill, which is one of the pillars of early childhood, and constitutes a major achievement for providing protection and care for children.
Following Miqdadi, the Director of the Juvenile and Community Security Directorate at the Ministry of Social Development Ahmed Al-Zaben said, "child labour is considered one of the economic and social problems at both local and international levels due to its close connection with the rights of the child guaranteed by local legislation and international conventions".
Zaben stressed that the Ministry of Social Development is keen to provide a sound environment and a healthy upbringing for the child, as a child labour department has been established within the Ministry and many agreements have been concluded with charities and partner institutions to provide psychological and social support to working children and their families after transferring cases from the relevant authorities. Zaben pointed out that there is a draft system for the protection of working children in contravention of the legislation in force, and this system will be sent to the Legislation and Opinion Bureau to proceed with the procedures for its enforcement, indicating that the importance of this system comes by granting legal powers to deal with working children within a judicial framework that guarantees the rights and best interests of the child and guarantees this mandatory system. This system guarantees a legislative mandate that ensures consistent and integrated application, accountability and good governance in dealing with working child cases for all relevant institutions in order to achieve the best interest of the child.
The head of the Education Department in the Ministry of Education, Nabeel Al-Hanaqta, said that the Ministry of Education contributes, in cooperation with partners, to providing alternative educational opportunities for out-of-school children, indicating that the Ministry's programmes aim to withdraw children from the labor market and provide them with the skills necessary to empower them in society, whilst also taking the necessary measures to reduce children dropping out of school in the first place.
Following Hanaqta, the head of the Juvenile and Family Protection Department of the Public Security Directorate, Colonel Firas Al-Rasheed said, “It is necessary to view child labour from the perspective of its potential risks and abuses, under conditions that may be harmful to the physical, intellectual and emotional health, in order to move away from a narrow point of view by looking at simple financial return, and seeing that the social return on investments into children's education, especially at the primary level, indicates that a decrease in illiteracy rates directly contributes to an industrial and technological renaissance”. Rasheed added that children's lives away from exploitation and danger contribute to cognitive, emotional, social and moral development, in addition to healthy physical development that enhances their psychological and social balance and limits violence in all forms.
The Head of the Technical and Program Quality Department at Plan International Jordan, Hamida Jahama said, "through our interventions, we seek to reduce the risks on working children while focusing greatly on young girls to support and protect them. This comes through applying holistic approaches that we believe in and through direct work with the children themselves.”  Jahama also noted that the first circle of support to these children are their parents and society as a whole through campaigns and community initiatives to reduce the worst forms of child labour.
The Executive Director of Tamkeen for Legal Aid and Human Rights, Linda Al Kalash, indicated that Tamkeen is implementing a programme on child labor and begging issues, entitled “Preventing and Minimizing Child Labor in Hazardous Sectors in Jordan”, which aims to develop the institutional capacities of entities working on child labour and begging issues, and also aims to gain support by raising the overall technical capabilities through training on the aforementioned issues. 
Mariyampillai Mariyaselvam, Chief of Child Protection, UNICEF Jordan spoke of the organization’s commitment to the Government of Jordan to help eliminate all forms of child labour in Jordan: from working with NCFA to coordinate efforts under the Child Labor National Frame Work, to the Ministry of Labour to work with business and owners and communities to prevent child labour occurring, as well as supporting the Ministry of Social Development to provide multisectoral services for working children.
“Child labour robs children of their childhood and their true potential, as well as denying them their rights to education and protection. UNICEF is committed to supporting the Government of Jordan and partners to end all harmful forms of child labour and to give children the future they deserve.”
The ILO Country Coordinator and Gender Specialist Farida Khan said, “In its fight against child labour in the future, the ILO is focusing on achieving universal access to social protection and gradual expansion of access to comprehensive, adequate, sustainable, gender, age and disability-inclusive social protection, through the establishment of national social protection schemes and improved access to social services and agricultural insurance for communities that depend on agriculture for their livelihoods”. 
Khan emphasised ILO's commitment to scaling up work in order to accelerate the efforts of stakeholders to prevent and eliminate child labour, prioritizing the worst forms of child labour, particularly in the agricultural sector, by making decent work a reality for adults and youth above the minimum age for work, as well as recognising the rights of children to education and ensuring that everyone has access to free, quality, equitable and inclusive education and training.
Finally, the UNHCR Jordan representative, Dominik Bartsch, said that data and research indicates the precarious situation facing refugees and that a percentage of families are trying to adapt through very negative strategies, which may include child labour.  
He underlined UNHCR's commitment to working with local stakeholders and national institutions to identify the causes of this phenomenon while providing practical solutions to mitigate these harmful practices.

Title: Ministry of Education Launches EMIS Policy
Content: 06 June 2022
Amman - The Secretary General for Administrative and Financial Affairs, H.E Dr. Najwa Qubeilat, on behalf of the Minister of Education, H.E. Prof. Wajih Owais, launched the Ministry of Education (MoE)’s Education Management Information System (EMIS) Policy.
Her Excellency, Dr. Najwa Qubeilat, started by thanking all Ministry of Education staff in Jordan for making EMIS one of the Kingdom’s most successful digital initiatives, marking an important milestone in the governments’ long-term commitment to strengthening evidence-based decision making in the education sector.
“Today’s launch comes at an important time where we as a Ministry are working to streamline our procedures to achieve the ambitious goals laid out in our Education Strategic Plan. The operationalization of the EMIS Policy will be a critical next step, and I am pleased that we have brought together all of our key stakeholders and partners on the occasion of this launch, with the joint goal of ensuring that the Ministry’s EMIS serves its ultimate purpose, which is to enhance education delivery throughout Jordan” she said.Mr. Borhene Chakroun, UNESCO’s Director of the Division for Policies and Lifelong Learning Systems, who attended the launch event as part of his official mission from Paris to Jordan, congratulated the Ministry of Education for the launch of the EMIS Policy.
“Jordan is already leading by example, as a country that has successfully managed a very large and complex EMIS system for many years. The endorsement of the EMIS Policy is an important opportunity to strengthen the foundation of a strong and sustainable EMIS system,” said Mr. Borhene Chakroun.
He also highlighted that Jordan has the potential to become a role model for other countries striving for better evidence-based policy making.
The EMIS Policy will enhance the EMIS enabling environment by clearly delineating key roles and responsibilities, as well as outlining the necessary resources, governance mechanisms, and procedures for an efficient and sustainable management of the MoE’s EMIS. This will, in turn, ensure quality assurance, accountability, inclusion and resilience for the entire education system in Jordan. The Policy also provides a framework that mandates the integration of different datasets and software across different MoE departments allowing the Ministry to consolidate its digital ecosystem for education.
In 2016, the Government of Jordan officially adopted the Open-Source Education Management Information System (OpenEMIS) as their main data platform. It is a core MoE planning tool that provides accurate, timely, integrated, comprehensive, and disaggregated data on students, teachers, staff, schools, field directorates, and infrastructure. Furthermore, it provides reports that are used to produce statistical digests, and indicators, which serve decision-makers at all administrative levels to inform ministry, school, and field directorate policy evaluation and formulation. As of today, EMIS is used by over 2 million users across the Kingdom, covering all 7,400 public schools.
The EMIS Policy was developed with UNESCO technical support, under the System Strengthening Partnership (SSP) with the Ministry of Education programme, implemented under a Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) with Canada, Italy, Norway, and Switzerland.  Support under the SSP aims to strengthen the core policy, planning, and monitoring functions and capacities, and includes technical assistance to the MoE in areas of data collection, analysis, and utilization through their OpenEMIS platform. OpenEMIS was first supported in Jordan in 2014 through funding by the European Union Delegation to Jordan and UNESCO technical assistance.
UNESCO’s support to Jordan’s EMIS strategically aligns with the goals in the recently extended Education Strategic Plan (ESP) 2018-2025, with EMIS as a key component of the System Strengthening Domain of the ESP., as and contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG4, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, and the Education 2030 Agenda.
The ceremony was chaired by the Secretary General for Administrative and Financial Affairs, H.E Dr. Najwa Qubeilat, on behalf of the Minister of Education, H.E. Prof. Wajih Owais, and was also attended by MoE officials from central and field level, as well as education partners, and national stakeholders, including members of the private sector.

Title: ARDD holds meeting on advancing localization of UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security
Content: 05 June 2022
Amman - A roundtable on "Gender Justice and UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security" was held on Monday, 30 May 2022, by ARDD, under the patronage of H.E. Ms. Wafa’a Bani Mustafa, Minister of State for Legal Affairs and Chair of the Inter-ministerial Committee for Women’s Empowerment, and in partnership with the UN Women. Participants discussed advancing the localization of UNSCR 1325 on Women, Security and Peace within the Jordanian National Action Plan (JONAP), including measures to ensure women’s participation in decision-making processes, their roles in peace and security and issues related to protection in relevant United Nations reporting systems and program implementation mechanisms.
Speaking at the meeting were Ms. Samar Muhareb, Chief Executive Director, ARDD, Ms. Sana’a Al-Banawi, Information and Knowledge Management Specialist for JONAP at the Jordanian National Committee for Women (JNCW) and Mr. Ziad Al Sheikh, Representative, UN Women Jordan.
H.E. Ms. Wafa’a Bani Mustafa spoke about the importance of advancing the UNSCR 1325 locally, with consideration to the context, to ensure its effective implementation. She also highlighted women’s suffering at times of wars and crises, when inequality and discrimination against women are higher, increasing their vulnerability, as well as the fact that even though women are disproportionately affected, they are essential in processes towards establishing peace and security, a fact that is rarely taken into account.
She also emphasized on the importance of working with partners in the second phase of JONAP through an inclusive process, increasing the number of women in political and security positions and enhancing their participation in peacekeeping to ensure localization successfully in the second phase of the JONAP.
According to H.E. Bani Mustafa, more important than enacting laws is ensuring accountability when it comes to implementing them.
“We should not be overwhelmed by the process of enacting laws, or consider it sufficient, but make sure that they are properly implemented, and that sufficient budget is allocated for their application,” she said.
Ms. Muhareb considered the last 10 years being difficult, saying that during this time “We got to know many women in Jordan whose lives have changed several times due to various crises”.
She stressed the importance of partnerships and coordination, which significantly impacts the implementation of UNSCR 1325, adding, “During our work, many things were achieved, while some needed, immediate and strategic objectives were not, which proves that we have to work harder and innovate as much as possible, especially since challenges still exist.”
Ms. Al-Banawi spoke about the importance of civil society and its key role in establishing and contributing to the global terminology surrounding women, peace and security, which in turn supports the implementation of local plans advancing UNSCR 1325.
“Participatory work and a holistic approach were a great motivation to create a national and feasible plan,” said Al-Banawi, adding that the JNCW commends the Jordan National NGOs Forum (JONAF), recognizing its important role in addressing the local priorities and the impact of the pandemic.
Mr. Sheikh spoke about moving forward in an integrated manner, building on the impressive results achieved from implementation of the first phase of JONAP, which brought relevant stakeholders together.
He thanked the governments of United Kingdom, Canada, Finland, Norway, Spain and Cyprus for supporting JONAP.
Dr. Sanaa Jelassi, Senior Adviser for Gender Justice, and Youth Programs at Al Nahda Research and Thought Center, reviewed the main results of the participatory research and policy briefs prepared in cooperation with JONAF within the framework of the “Strengthening Capacities of Women-led Civil Society Organizations on Evidence-Based Advocacy and the Women, Peace and Security Agenda” project, which has been implemented partnership with UN Women since 2019. The project included the preparation of four research papers and ten policy briefs concerning the pandemic and its consequences, which dealt with the issues of women’s financial fragility and debt, the redistribution of care work in Jordan, the localization of research on domestic violence, and the adoption of a local approach to humanitarian action to assess and address these challenges.

The attendees also discussed the lessons learned around enhancing the UNSCR 1325, agenda, especially the experience of JONAF in responding to and reaching local communities during the crisis, the roles of the civil society, intersectionality of UNSCR 1325, among others.
The meeting issued several recommendations including continuing to work at all levels to support UNSCR 1325 agenda, leveraging partnerships between Government agencies, civil society organizations and the security sector and ensuring support towards the sustainability of localization efforts.
In her concluding remarks, Ms. Muhareb stressed the importance of continuing the dialogue to achieve harmony among the various parties concerned, ensuring the participation of women in maintaining security, stability and peace and building the capacities of workers to participate and contribute meaningfully to humanitarian and development work.

Title: Inaugurating Al Zohour Green Triangle Pilot Project as a mitigation measure against flash floods in Amman
Content: 31 May 2022
Al-Zohour Green Triangle pilot project was inaugurated in Ras Al-Ain in the presence of His Excellency the Japanese Ambassador, Mr. Shimazaki Kaoru, the Deputy Mayor of Amman, Mr. Muhammad Rasmi Al-Qaisi, and the National Programme Coordinator of the United Nations Human Settlements Program (UN-Habitat), Eng. Deema Abu Thiab.
Al-Zohour Green Triangle is part of a bigger project called, “Strengthening the Social Stability and Resilience of Vulnerable Jordanian Communities and Syrian Refugees in Amman against Flash Floods," funded by the Government of Japan and implemented in cooperation with the Greater Amman Municipality. This project aims to strengthen the government and community’s resilience and capacities to better manage flash floods. This was done through community consultations, awareness raising campaigns, training, and capacity building on flash flood resilience, as well as through piloting flood mitigation measures that can be replicated in different areas using sustainable stormwater drainage systems and green infrastructure approaches.
The pilot project is a demonstration of green infrastructure, or what is known as “Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems" (SUDS), which is a set of water management practices that aim to harmonize modern drainage systems with natural water processes by adopting techniques to deal with surface water run-off through the collection, storage, and cleaning of rainwater before it is slowly re-released into the existing stormwater system. Eng. Deema Abu Thiab explained that this project seeks to demonstrate two concepts for rainwater management, namely “bio-retention and rainwater detention”, whereby it aims to improve the protection and resilience against flash floods in the city of Amman by providing a series of above-ground bio-retention areas and an underground rainwater storage tank with a capacity of 2500 m3. She further stressed that this pilot project is located in one of 120 sites identified for the implementation of short- and medium-term green stormwater infrastructure interventions through the “Flood Risk Assessment and Hazard Mapping Study” of Amman.
His Excellency the Japanese Ambassador, Mr. Kaoru, expressed his appreciation for the completion of the project and the productive cooperation between the Greater Amman Municipality and UN-Habitat Jordan Programme.
Mr. Al-Qaisi explained that this project is being implemented for the first time in the city of Amman as part of the Municipality’s strategy to reduce the risks of climate change and that its importance stems from the Municipality’s keenness to increase the city's and communities resilience against flash floods and to enhance the social stability of those most affected.
In his speech on behalf of Amman Mayor, Dr. Yousef Al Shawarbeh, Mr. Al-Qaisi valued the strategic partnership with UN-Habitat and their efforts in addressing urban challenges associated with rapid urbanization and in mitigating the negative effects of climate change. He thanked the Japanese government for its continuous support of infrastructure projects in Amman, which will raise the quality of life in the city. He additionally showed his appreciation to the supervising technical team from GAM for their fruitful efforts in implementing the project.

Title: UN Headquarters Observes International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on 26 May
Content: 23 May 2022
Two peacekeepers from Jordan to be honoured posthumously at United Nations ceremony
UN Headquarters will observe the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on Thursday, 26 May 2022. Secretary-General António Guterres will lay a wreath to honour the nearly 4,200 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948 and will preside over a ceremony at which the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal will be awarded posthumously to 117 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their life serving under the UN flag last year.
Among the peacekeepers to be honoured posthumously are two from Jordan:  SSgt Awad Ra'eD Awad Al Shloul and Col. Tareq Sabbah Suleiman Al-Naimat who both served with the United Nations Integrated Multidimensional Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).
Jordan is the 34th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys 639 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, Cyprus, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Sudan and South Sudan.
During a special ceremony, the Secretary-General will award the “Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage” posthumously to Captain Abdelrazakh Hamit Bahar of Chad, who served with the United Nations Integrated Multidimensional Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). The medal is named for a Senegalese peacekeeper who was killed in Rwanda in 1994 after saving countless civilian lives. This is the second time the medal has been awarded since the inaugural medal was presented to Captain Diagne's family in his honour in 2016.
The Secretary-General will also award the ‘2021 Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award’ to Major Winnet Zharare, a Zimbabwean military observer, who served with the UN Mission in South Sudan. Created in 2016, the Award “recognises the dedication and effort of an individual peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.”
In his message, the Secretary-General said: “Today, we honour the more than one million women and men who have served as UN peacekeepers since 1948.  We pay tribute to the nearly 4,200 heroes and heroines who sacrificed their lives in the cause of peace. And we are reminded an age-old truth: peace can never be taken for granted. Peace is the prize. We are deeply grateful to the 87,000 civilian, police and military personnel now serving under the UN flag who are helping to realize the prize of peace worldwide.”
The theme for this year’s observance is “People. Peace. Progress. The Power of Partnerships.”  According to the Secretary-General, “Around the globe, UN peacekeepers work with Member States, civil society, humanitarians, the media, the communities they serve and many others, to foster peace, protect civilians, promote human rights and the rule of law and improve the lives of millions of people.”
Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said: “Every day, UN peacekeepers work to protect vulnerable people in the world’s most fragile political and security situations. The dangers they face are greater than ever, with increasing global tensions, ever-more complex threats from terrorist attacks to organized crime and the use of Improvised Explosive Devices as well as a surge in mis and disinformation targeting our missions and the communities we serve. Despite these challenges, peacekeepers persevere alongside our many partners in the collective pursuit of peace. Today, we thank them for their tremendous contribution and remember with great sorrow our colleagues who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving the cause of peace.”
The International Day of UN Peacekeepers was established by the General Assembly in 2002, to pay tribute to all men and women serving in peacekeeping, and to honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace. The General Assembly designated 29 May as the International Day of UN Peacekeepers in commemoration of the day in 1948 when the UN’s first peacekeeping mission, the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), began operations in Palestine. Since then, more than 1 million women and men have served in 72 UN peacekeeping operations.

Title: UNICEF and Mercy Corps launch the first interactive playground in Azraq Refugee Camp
Content: 23 May 2022
Azraq Camp, Jordan (May 23, 2022) - With UNICEF support, Mercy Corps launched today the first interactive playground in Azraq Refugees Camp, as part of their ongoing efforts to support children with disabilities and ensure their inclusion in education. The event was attended by representatives from UNICEF, MOE, Syrian Refugee Affairs Directorate (SRAD), Mercy Corps Jordan, and other NGOs working in Azraq Camp.
The interactive playground is a novel idea designed and built by Mercy Corps and volunteers, responding to the need of children living in Azraq camp Village 5 to play, learn, discover and engage through accessing a space that offers a unique experience.
What makes this playground unique is that it is the first of its kind in Jordan, created purely from scrap materials to a cost close to zero. And that it ensures access to all children including those with disabilities.
In his welcoming remarks, Darius Radicliffe, Mercy Corps Jordan Country Director, said “This inclusive interactive playground is a signature achievement that proves ability to make something of value from minimal resources.
The playground stations and equipment were all created in the Azraq camp adaptation workshop. The workshop, which is supported by UNICEF, is run by Syrian volunteers under the supervision of Mercy Corps technical staff. It applies advanced problem-solving skills and the creative use of scrap materials, and leadership to provide tools, equipment and smart solutions for children including those with disabilities.
In his speech, Seraj Hassouneh, representative of the Directorate of Education / Zarqa II, emphasized the significance of supporting children with disabilities and getting them to a point where they can depend on themselves and face the future. Then he praised the efforts of UNICEF and Mercy Corps in completing this important achievement for children in Azraq camp.
Tanya Chapuisat Representative, UNICEF, said “This playground provides a vital space for children to interact and learn through play, an opportunity that children missed out on during the pandemic. That this space has been built by the community, through the work of Syrian volunteers, and using recycled materials is particularly inspiring.”
Ms Chapuisat also thanked the government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the United States Government for their generous support and ongoing commitment to UNICEF’s Inclusive Education Program in Azraq.
When presenting the playground, Maisa Asmar, MC Inclusive Education Program Manager said that “The team, including the Syrian volunteers, create value everyday through implementing design thinking principles to come up with solutions that respond to true needs of the population.
This interactive playground was created to offer experiential learning to children who have never left the camp before. For instance, children may learn animal and fruit names and types by playing games, as well as how to transform kinetic energy into electricity.
Mercy Corps has been supporting inclusive education for children with disabilities since 2008. Our holistic approach provides Jordanian and Syrian children with disabilities with personalized support, trains and builds the capacity of teachers to identify children with disabilities and provide them with the needed support. The Program ensures access to equitable learning opportunities and works with parents and community members to raise the awareness of disability and the right of children with disabilities to education.

The inauguration took place under the patronage of H.E. the Assistant Chief of staff for planning, Organization and Defense Resources of JAF, Brigadier General, Dr. Yousef Al Khatib, in the presence of the H.E. Ambassador of Japan to Jordan, Kaoru Shimazaki and the H.E. Chief of Mission of IOM in Jordan, Tajma Kurt.
The facilities inaugurated today include office space and the accommodation for female officers with an isolation room equipped with necessary Personal Protective Equipment.
This project also supported JAF and Royal Medical Services (RMS) to enhance the capacity for public health preparedness and response to cross-border communicable diseases by providing information sessions to 94 officers. The information sessions focused on topics of migration health, COVID-19 Infection, prevention, and control (IPC) response measures as well as mainstreaming rights-based approach and gender equality. To ensure the transferability of its knowledge within JAF, Training of Trainers (ToT) sessions were also conducted for selected 11 officers.
“As we are all aware, Jordan enjoys excellent relations with Japan and strong cooperation with the IOM Jordan. This relation is driven by a shared common values and interests, having said that, we in Jordan, more particularly in JAF look forward to enhancing our relations to promote peace, stability, and socio-economic development not only in this region but globally,” H.E. Brigadier General, Dr. Yousef Al Khatib, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Planning, Organization and Defense Resources stated.
H.E. Kaoru Shimazaki, Ambassador of Japan to Jordan stated “The Government of Japan is grateful to work closely with IOM since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in this important field, namely the border management which is one of the essential components for the regional stability. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for the efforts of both JAF and IOM to realize our projects.”
“The completion of this project represents the continued successful cooperation between the IOM, JAF, and the Government of Japan. The facility we launched today will certainly allow JAF to increase the number of deployed female officers, which in turn will result in better protection and safety of all the people who are residing in Jordan,” said Her Excellency Ms. Tajma Kurt, Chief of Mission, IOM Jordan.
As the leading intergovernmental organization promoting humane and orderly migration for the benefit of all, IOM is committed to supporting Member States to improve their preparedness and establish adequate response mechanisms to protect crisis-affected people crossing the border while ensuring the national sovereignty and border security of the state is maintained.

Title: Girls Shine: A New Center in Za’atari Camp puts Adolescent Girls in the Lead
Content: 15 May 2022
As part of its continuous efforts to further gender equality and address the physical and emotional consequences of gender-based violence, UNFPA Jordan Country Office in partnership with Save The Children Jordan opened today the Adolescent Girls Empowerment Led (AGEL) Center in Za’atari camp. More than 100 adolescent girls and parents attended the event. Adolescent girls from the center inaugurated the event with a performance of a play titled, “Child Marriage”, a Rap performance and a Zumba dance.
The opening of the center was attended by Her Excellency, Donica Pottie, Ambassador of Canada to Jordan, Mr. Robert McInturff, Senior Regional Refugee Coordinator of the United States Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, Save the Children Jordan CEO, Diala Al Khamra, and UNFPA Jordan Country Representative, Ms. Enshrah Ahmed.
Situated in the heart of the Za’atari Market, the Adolescent Girls Empowerment Led (AGEL) Center is the first of its kind in the camp. AGEL, also known as the "Girls Shine Center" among the community, has become a hub for more than 300 adolescent girls months before its official opening. It is the only center in Zaatari that is open, exclusively, to adolescent girls.
“When we saw the eagerness of adolescent girls to join the activities and trainings offered by the center, we were thrilled. Our goal is to help adolescent girls realize their potential and become leaders in their community”, said Balqees Shahin, Project Field Officer at AGEL Center, Save the Children.
The AGEL center consists of a large covered courtyard and four rooms along its perimeter. The courtyard is the main social area where extracurricular activities such as painting, handicrafts, drama rehearsals and Zumba sessions take place. The surrounding four rooms are reserved for training sessions, informal meetings, a child-care center and a room for counselling services. “When I have some free time, I go to the AGEL center so I can read books and spend time with friends. I feel heard and respected by the mentors who work here. I can share my opinions without fearing a bad reaction”, said Sara, an adolescent girl who frequents the center.
Since its inception in 2012, Za’atari refugee camp has become the world’s largest camp for Syrian refugees. More than 9,700 adolescent girls between the ages of 10 years-old and 19 years-old live in the camp.
In addition to the hardships they face as refugees, adolescent girls often bear the responsibility of helping their parents with caring for their younger siblings, and they do not have access to safe spaces to help them cope with stress, build their resilience and develop the skills to thrive.
“Adolescent girls living in Zaatari camp are vulnerable to becoming victims of violence, child marriage and adolescent pregnancy. We are committed to empowering adolescent girls in the face of those risks because we believe that adolescent girls can lead the way to change when they are given the right opportunities”, said Save the Children Jordan CEO, Diala Al Khamra.
To address the challenges faced by the adolescent girls, the center’s team of mentors and adolescent girls have received trainings in Life Skills, Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). The goal of the training is to empower them to advocate for themselves and other adolescent girls in the community, and to enhance their access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. The center also provides training sessions for parents to raise their awareness about gender-based violence (GBV) and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). They also encourage them to protect and support their daughters as they make their journey towards womanhood.
“When adolescent girls are empowered to take better care of their health, and build their social and financial skills, they can draw on those skills to solve problems, make better decisions and become leaders in their community. At UNFPA  we believe that initiatives like the AGEL center will help achieve our three zeros: zero unmet need for contraception, zero preventable maternal deaths and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices such as child marriage”, said UNFPA Jordan Country Representative, Ms Ensherah Ahmad.
The opening of the center was attended by Her Excellency, Donica Pottie, Ambassador of Canada to Jordan, Embassy of Canada to Jordan, Mr. Robert Mcinturff, Senior Regional Refugee Coordinator at the U.S. Department of State: Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, Save the Children Jordan, CEO, Diala Al Khamra, and UNFPA Jordan Country Representative, Ms. Enshrah Ahmed. The group also visited the SRH Clinic, the Women and Girls Safe Space, the Youth center in Zaatari camp.
*The Adolescent Girls Empowerment Led (AGEL) Center in Za’atari camp is generously supported by Canadian Government and United States Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM)
*Names of adolescent girls have been changed for protection.

Title: Italy and FAO launch a project to increase the resilience of the vulnerable communities in Southern Jordan
Content: 10 May 2022
Amman – The Government of Italy and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), launched today a project to increase the resilience of the Jordanian vulnerable communities through the “Sustainable Production and Utilization of Agro-natural Resources (SPUAR)” initiative, funded by Italy through the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS).
In line with the agreement signed by the parties, FAO conducted an inception workshop to acquaint stakeholders and programme partners with the scope and outlines of the project, in addition to covering the implementation strategy and work plan.
As Ambassador Pezzotti highlighted, “Italy and FAO are joining efforts to counteract the impact of land degradation, drought and desertification in Jordan, through sustainable natural resource management. Land degradation poses a serious challenge to sustainable development, and identifying critical knowledge gaps, opportunities of land productivity and strategies to increase land users’ perception of sustainability is pivotal to foster economic, social, and environmental changes”.
The workshop was held under the patronage of his Excellency Eng. Khaled Al-Huneifat, Minister of Agriculture in the presence of H.E Mr. Luciano Pezzotti, Italian Ambassador to Jordan, Mr. Emilio Cabasino, the Director of Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) Amman, as well as Eng. Nabil Assaf, FAO Representative in Jordan and attended by a group of selected stakeholders and government partners.
The scarcity of water resources is one of the main challenges for Jordan and a limiting factor for economic development, especially for the agriculture sector. The demand on water resources is increasing with time for both agriculture and non-agricultural purposes, as the agricultural sector consumes around 510 million cubic meters (51%) of the annual available fresh water.
H.E the Minister of Agriculture, Eng. Khaled Al-Huneifat explained that “the challenges facing food security in the Kingdom, the most important of which are conflicts in the region, put pressure on Jordan’s natural resources, in addition to climate change, where the rainfall percentage in the southern regions did not exceed 25% last year, and this year it did not exceed 33%, and we, in Jordan count on our friends to strengthen the resilience of Jordanians, as this project will positively impact Ma'an responding to its needs .”
FAO Representative, Eng Nabil Assaf stated that, “This project is aligned with FAO and the Government of Jordan’s Country Programing Framework (CPF)’s priority 2: Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resources Management and priority 3: Resilience of rural and peri-urban livelihood. Hence, under this program, FAO will improve irrigation water use efficiency and productivity, strengthen the capacities of stakeholders in adopting the upscaling, and improve community- based natural resource management technologies and practices, including the supply of relevant climate smart technological inputs that enhance agricultural productivity and competitiveness of crops and livestock production. In the process, FAO will focus on crosscutting issues such as gender and climate change.”
This project comes in recognition of the importance to support the agriculture sector and sustainable management of natural resources. It targets vulnerable communities and their access to socio-economic infrastructures in the governorate of Ma’an, which is the largest in Jordan and, according to the poverty report issued by the Jordanian Department of Statistics, one of the poorest, with a poverty ratio of 27%.
“This initiative is particularly interesting in view of for the priorities of the Italian cooperation on sustainable development linked to agriculture and livelihood opportunities,” said Mr Cabasino, AICS Amman Director. “It is our aim that the responsible use of agro-natural resources (land, water, vegetation) in the Governorate of Ma'an will support the economic revitalization of the rural communities in this area”.
The SPUAR initiative aims at establishing a sustainable enterprise using the agro-natural resources (land, water, vegetation) available in the targeted governorate. Within the coming two-years, the project aims at targeting a total of 120 households (660 persons), including female headed households, youth and people with disabilities, with actions that include rooftop water harvesting systems and provision of food processing equipment, as well as a capacity building programme to equip beneficiaries with the necessary skills to maximize the use of agro-natural resources and enhance their livelihood.
In addition to improved food security and income-generation opportunities, the project will result in soil and water conservation through their sustainable management, and will ultimately contribute to empower local rural communities.

Title: FAO conducts the Surveillance Evaluation Tool workshop in Jordan
Content: 08 May 2022
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and the Jordanian Armed Forces launched today the of an assessment mission that will use FAO’s Surveillance Evaluation Tool (SET) and its Bio-Threat module to develop a tailored action plan to improve animal disease surveillance, including the detection of agro-terrorism and agro-crime affecting animal health, under the project “Building resilience against agro-terrorism and agro-crime threats to animal health.”
The project is funded by the Global Affairs Canada and implemented by a consortium gathering the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Criminal Police organization (INTERPOL)  and will be implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Jordan Armed Forces.
The inception workshop was under the patronage of his Excellency Eng. Khaled Al-Hunaifat, Minister of Agriculture and was attended by partners and relevant stakeholders.
The inception workshop aimed to present to the Jordanian authorities the assessment mission itself as well as the other phases of the project that will help develop a response to risks related to animal health and the use of animal pathogens as a threat. Following this workshop, a mission for 12 days, will take place in Jordan with the objective of identifying gaps and needs for the epidemiologic surveillance system of animal diseases and the specific surveillance of agro-terrorism and agro-crime threats.
Following the assessment phase, training and exercise materials will be tailored to local needs and available resources. The training will focus on strengthening collaboration between veterinary services and law enforcement authorities to improve their ability to detect and sustainably respond to animal health emergencies related to agro-crime and agro-terrorism.
The project also introduces new tools for the Good Emergency Management Practices (GEMP) such as facilitation kit and a specific module on the intentional use of pathogens related to agro-crime or bio-terrorism affecting animal health.
The FAO Representative in Jordan Eng. Nabil Assaf, said, “This project will use the Surveillance Evaluation Tool (SET), which is a normative FAO tool that has helped more than 20 countries in Africa and Asia to assess and develop action plans to improve their animal disease surveillance systems and detection of unusual animal health events that may be related to agro-terrorism or agro-crime in collaboration between law enforcement agencies and veterinary services.”
On behalf of HE Eng. Khaled Hnaifat, Minister of Agriculture, the Assistant Secretary-General for Livestock, Eng. Ali Abu Nukta, said that “It is necessary to raise the level of veterinary services within the governmental and private sectors, starting with the livestock sector in the Ministry of Agriculture, to be a single unit ready to deal with any accidental event that negatively affects humans, animals and the environment, and as a result on the national economy and national security.”
Middle East is one of the three-targeted regions together with North Africa and Southeast Asia, and Jordan has been selected as a pilot country. It is expected that many countries will benefit from the outcomes of this innovative project.

FAO’s work in the Near East and North Africa
Eliminating food insecurity and malnutrition are persistent challenges in the Near East and North Africa. The structural dependence of its countries on food imports, make the region highly vulnerable to shocks, increasing the inability of entire communities to feed themselves. Recent conflicts and civil instability in many countries of the region have also compounded the situation. As a result, hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition are widespread and require comprehensive and urgent intervention.
FAO is helping governments face these challenges by improving the capacity of countries to collect, produce and analyze data for policy formulation. This is done by strengthening their commitment and accountability and by coordinating efforts for joint action. FAO also provides direct support to improve the livelihoods of millions of small farmers and rural communities, especially in countries undergoing conflict where the Organization help farmers and their families recover from crises.

Princess Basma bint Ali to speak at World Forestry Congress
In one of her first official engagements as FAO Goodwill Ambassador, Princess Basma bint Ali is scheduled to speak at a high-level session of the XV World Forestry Congress on May 2 where FAO will launch it’s flagship publication, The State of the World’s Forests 2022, which includes data, analysis and trends on the status of forests, and their benefit to societies.

Title: 64 percent of refugees in Jordan survive on less than 3 dinar a day
Content: 30 March 2022
Collaboration between UNHCR and the World Bank draws on wealth of new data about refugees in Jordan
New data released by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, highlights the remarkable resilience of refugees, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence shows that the living conditions of refugees are improving, with most families generating their own income.
Despite this, most refugees remain on the brink of falling into poverty. 64 percent* of refugees currently living on less than 3JOD a day. In addition, 90 percent of refugee families say they employ at least one negative coping strategy, such as reducing food intake or buying household goods on credit, to get through their day to day.
“We stand at a crossroad of the refugee response in Jordan,” stated Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Representative in Jordan. “The improving situation for refugees reflects the impact of our collective efforts over the past years, yet this can easily be reversed. Refugees remain vulnerable, and more needs to be done to support their self-reliance.”
The 2022 Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF) is a comprehensive and rich analysis of the refugee population in Jordan. Surveying over 10,000 refugee families, this analysis usually takes place every two years although the recent assessment was delayed due to the pandemic. Results are designed to monitor changes in refugee vulnerability over time, inform the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and support programs aiming to strengthen the self-reliance of refugees.
In addition, UNHCR Jordan and the World Bank MENA Poverty team collaborated to determine for the first-time monetary poverty among refugees in Jordan. Using the international poverty line of 5.5 dollars*, equivalent to about 3 dinar per day, the data shows that without assistance, three quarters of refugees would be poor. Thanks to assistance, the percentage drops to 64 percent.
“The released data in the VAF can be a powerful tool for evidence-based decision making to inform Jordan’s refugee response. Continued joint humanitarian-development analyses will utilize the new data to explore how to enhance the targeting efficiency of assistance, and thus its effectiveness,” stated Holly Benner, Resident Representative for the World Bank in Jordan.
For the first time, this year’s assessment has also examined the situation of refugees living in refugee camps. In comparison to the out of camp population, evidence shows that camp residents fare better in areas such as health and education but, due to a lack of employment opportunities, are more reliant on humanitarian aid. 52 percent of out-of-camp families report having access to income from work compared to 25 percent in refugee camps.
In both camp and out-of-camp settings, findings highlight that having one family member employed is not enough to meet monthly household needs. As a result, the number of Syrian refugee families holding debt, increased by 39 percent in comparison to 2018.
Increased debt is having a knock-on effect on standards of living. Refugees living in out-of-camp settings are increasingly resorting to living in unsafe homes in sub-standard conditions. Most refugees also have no written rental agreement and almost 20 percent of those surveyed received a threat of eviction in 2021.
On a more positive note, the benefits of including refugees in national systems can clearly be seen. 80 percent of refugee children have attended school over the last year - despite the challenges of remote education - while child labor remains minimal.
In the field of health, however, more needs to be done to ensure that the most vulnerable families are receiving the support they need. In comparison to 2018, there has been a 13 percent increase in Syrian refugees who needed medical care but were unable to access it.
In total, 760,000 refugees are currently registered with UNHCR in Jordan which constitutes the second largest proportion of refugees per capita in the world. Only 17 percent of refugees live in refugee camps, with the majority living in towns and cities across the Kingdom. This vast array of new evidence about the situation facing refugees in Jordan will help to inform not only UNHCR’s new multi-year strategy for 2023-2025, but also wider discussions on the next iteration of the refugee response in Jordan, ensuring support for the autonomy of refugees while continuing humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable.

Title: EU-funded agricultural grants to support agricultural activities & job creation awarded by FAO
Content: 28 March 2022
With funding from the European Union, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Jordan, in cooperation with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture, awarded vulnerable Jordanian farmers, smallholders and small family-based agri-food enterprises with financial grants. The grants that were awarded to successful project proposals, will allow the recipients from across Jordan to implement agricultural activities and job creation programmes for Syrian Refugees and Jordanians host communities.
The awarding ceremony was held in Karak under the Patronage of H.E. Eng. Khaled Al-Hnaifat, Minister of Agriculture, and the EU Deputy Head of Cooperation Ms. Sirpa Tulla.
This support programme is within the framework of the EU-funded Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis (MADAD) project “Enhancing resilient livelihoods and food security of host communities and Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon through the promotion of sustainable agricultural development.”
The call for proposal was launched in September 2021 through the Ministry of Agriculture website, with the aim of supporting Climate Smart Agricultural – CSA initiatives targeting specific locations in seven governorates: Ma'an, Madaba, Ajloun, Irbid, Balqa, Karak and Tafileh. The awarded projects were selected and evaluated by the project’s Technical Screening Committee, according to the criteria envisioned in the guidelines. The grant covers 85% of the projects’ costs and the costs of five labourers from Syrians refugees and Jordanians host communities.
H.E Minister of Agriculture, Eng. Khaled Al-Hanaifat, confirmed that this project is in line with the National Plan for Sustainable Agriculture, which supports pioneering projects for youth, as well as projects that support rural communities and empower women. The project is being implemented in a number of governorates. He indicated that the ministry will work to sustain cooperation for such projects, which support the ministry's efforts within its current strategy.
The Deputy Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation in Jordan, Ms. Sirpa Tulla said that “the signing of these first Grants Agreements under this project is beyond symbolism.

Title: UNICEF launches Jordan’s first Impact Sourcing platform
Content: 23 March 2022
Under the patronage of His Excellency Mr. Ahmed Hanandeh, Minister of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship, UNICEF and Digital Opportunity Trust Jordan (DOT) launched today the Bridge, Outsource, Transform (B.O.T.) Impact Sourcing platform, connecting skilled freelancers from vulnerable communities with digital micro-employment opportunities.
B.O.T platform enhances vulnerable youth, especially young women livelihoods through enabling them to access micro tasking opportunities in the digital sector, this access is particularly relevant for vulnerable youth, whose access to the formal labor market is limited by their gender, location, and socio-economic status.
The programme design was informed by an in-depth analysis of the Jordanian Labor Market needs, and it equips young people, with basic and advanced digital skills trainings, so they are empowered to access different employment opportunities, whether freelancing, microworks, or full-time employment.
“We are proud to be part of launching the B.O.T. Platform, which is aligned with the Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship’s role, of enhancing youth's digital skills to prepare them for the labor market and provide them with freelance work opportunities.” Said Ahmad Hanandeh, Minister of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship.
“The ministry is continuously working on the creation of initiatives and projects supporting both the youth and the private sector companies by providing the needed digital skills to the labor market, such as The Graduates Internship Program (GIP), The Youth, Technology and Jobs (YTJ) Project, The National Upskilling –ICT Programme.” He added.
“Ensuring access of young people to services and productive assets, that will better facilitate their transition to work is a priority in the UN 2030 youth strategy. UNICEF’s Digital Skills for A Better Future Programme addresses geographic, economic, and social factors to close the digital gap, facilitating access to meaningful employment opportunities, with a focus on women and people with disabilities.” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
“DOT strives to provide the best support to the youth participating in the training programmes. Our programmes are based on skills required in the Jordanian labor market, that will enable participants to secure temporary job opportunities,” said Hamza Al-Shraideh, DOT Country Director, “The B.O.T platform provides a network for experienced youth to find temporary opportunities in the Jordanian job market and focuses on spreading awareness of the concept of freelancing and remote work.”
B.O.T. platform is part of UNICEF Digital Skills for A Better Future Programme, aimed to equip vulnerable youth, aged 17-24, with demand driven digital skills for better income generation opportunities, and a smooth transition into productive adulthood.
Since 2019, the Digital Skills for A Better Future Programme trained more than 3000 youth (70% females), across nine governorates.560 trainees were provided with work placement opportunities, and others found remote freelance opportunities through the B.O.T. digital platform, generating more than more than 9000 JD of income in 2021.
The B.O.T. platform is generously funded by the Prospects Partnership from the Government of the Netherlands.

Title: UNRWA Student Wins the UNICEF Environmental Project: Layan’s Environmental Awareness
Content: 23 March 2022
“I believe that raising awareness is key to protecting the environment, that’s why the idea of creating this video occurred to me,” said Layan Al Bairouti, a Palestine refugee student at the UNRWA Baqa’a Preparatory Girls’ School (No.1) in Jordan. Layan entered her environmental awareness video to the UNICEF Environmental Project under the theme “reducing plastic”. Representing her school, Layan’s video ranked first out of 300 submissions in the Middle East and North Africa region. This International Women’s Day and United Nations Gender Equality Month, UNRWA is celebrating Palestine refugee women and girls who pioneer ways to mainstream climate action in their communities as part of their everyday lives. Together with their communities, they foster gender equality today, for a sustainable tomorrow.
“It feels great to know that my video won at the regional level,” said Layan. “I decided to create the animation video because I wanted to address my peers in a different way and inspire them to be, like me, interested in protecting the environment.”
Her short, animated video included her fellow eighth graders and enabled them to share their voices and deliver the important message of climate action for a better environment. The video showcased some environmentally-friendly best practices, such as reducing the use of single use plastic and recycling. In her video, Layan also encourages community action to reduce pollution, which harms both animals and environment. “I feel sad when I see on the TV and on the internet the negative impact of plastic waste on our planet’s wildlife.” Layan added, “We can change that. We need to save our planet. It’s our responsibility.”
“I am proud of my daughter’s achievement”, says Siham, an UNRWA Teacher at Baqa’a Preparatory Girls’ School (No.1). She continues, “Layan is a big friend of the environment and I fully support her interest!” With her mother’s assistance, Layan managed to create the awareness video using a cartoon video maker app called “TweenCraft”. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, technology was a useful way for me, as a mother and teacher, to make the process of online learning easier. I created instructional materials and offered interesting new ways for students to learn and work together,” she said.

Title: UN: Recycled wastewater provides a window for Jordan to address water scarcity
Content: 22 March 2022
As climate heats up, affecting Jordan’s already exhausted water resources, expanding wastewater treatment provides one opportunity to increase water availability for irrigation that consumes about one half of the country’s total water supply, the United Nations said on Monday.
Jordan is the second most water scarce country in the world, with its annual renewable water resources are less than 100m3 per person, significantly below the global threshold of severe water scarcity of 500m3 per person.
Climate change, among other challenges- population growth-, is projected to stress Jordan’s limited water resources, negatively impacting the county’s agriculture, with the rural poor and the rural poor women and girls the most likely to bear the brunt of these impacts.
In a policy brief titled “Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems (DWATS) as a Climate Change Adaptation Option for Agriculture in Jordan”, the UN said, in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Jordan has put forward the use of non-conventional water resources as an adaptation option, with the expansion of decentralized wastewater treatment as one of the country’s goals in its 2008-2022 Water Strategy.
Jordan already operates 34 wastewater treatment plants that provide 14% of total water supply, and treated wastewater reused in agriculture accounted for about 25% of the total amount of water used for irrigation.
However, despite tackling this non-conventional water resource in Jordan’s policies, there are several challenges that hinder the full achievement of this goal.
These challenges include the weak coordination between several government institutions with overlying responsibilities, as well as the lack of institutional and staff capacity. Moreover, the price of treated wastewater for irrigation is set administratively and may not reflect true cost of operation, while the DWATS in small Jordanian communities is disadvantaged as an option by scattered populations, small size, inability to afford DWATS tariffs, and the lack of social acceptance for wastewater reuse.
To ensure successful expansion of decentralized wastewater treatment systems in Jordan, the UN recommends:
The brief launched today is the third of a series of policy briefs that aim to inform decision making and ensure synergy with other national and international frameworks. The release of the policy brief coincides with the World Water Day (WWD) annually observed on 22 March.
This year’s WWD is observed under the theme Groundwater: making the invisible visible.
In a message released on this occasion, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said humanity’s demand for water is growing.  “Pressure on water resources is increasing due to overuse, pollution, and climate change.  Droughts and heatwaves are becoming more intense and more frequent.  Sea-level rise is driving salt-water intrusion into coastal aquifers.  Groundwater aquifers are being depleted”.
He added that some 20 per cent of the world’s aquifers are being overexploited. “In many places, we simply do not know how much of this precious resource might exist.  We need to improve our exploration, monitoring and analysis of groundwater resources to protect and better manage them and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals”.
To galvanize action on water for sustainable development, the United Nations will host a Water Conference next year. Formally known as the 2023 Conference for the Midterm Comprehensive Review of Implementation of the UN Decade for Action on Water and Sanitation (2018-2028) – the event will take place at UN Headquarters in New York, 22-24 March 2023, co-hosted by Tajikistan and the Netherlands.
The Conference shall be preceded by regional and global preparatory meetings, as appropriate, and informed by existing water-related meetings at the regional and global level.

UNDP and Jordan Strategy Forum (JSF) signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate in providing analysis, policy dialogue, and advocacy aimed at informing key national development processes relevant to local economic development. Particular focus will be given to equitable budget allocations as part of Jordan’s decentralisation reforms as well as economic aspects of local investment decisions both by the government and the private sector.
Joint activities will inform UNDP’s initiatives, and JSF efforts towards achieving economic development, sustainable growth, and prosperity for all Jordanians, leveraging respective comparative advantages, expertise, and partners. The collaboration is expected to support legislation and policies that contribute towards enhancing the economic environment.
“Every country’s fiscal relations is an evolving system, continually responding to changes in economic, demographic and political variables. I am pleased that UNDP and JSF will work together and with national partners to gather the best global experiences, generate reliable and accurate data, and develop quality advice on local investment policies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in Jordan” said Resident Representative of UNDP Jordan Randa Aboul-Hosn.
The Jordan Strategy Forum's CEO, Nesreen Barakat, stated that cooperation with the United Nations Development Program falls within the framework of expanding the circle of partnerships & collaborations with institutions and organizations of common interest whose aim is to formulate a local development index at the governorate level in Jordan. The index includes five areas (with sub-indicators) and these are health, education, infrastructure, economic activities, and social conditions. This effort should provide a base for the development of the governorates, which will in turn, reflect on the prosperity of all citizens of the governorates.

Title: Young innovators contribute to improving reliable access to nutritious food in Jordan
Content: 15 March 2022
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) yesterday awarded seed funding to five young women and men, to help them launch their start-ups that will positively impact food security in Jordan.
The winners were among 22 young people between 18 and 26 years old who received entrepreneurship and food security training to turn their ideas into action as part of the WFP/UNICEF Youth in Food Security Innovation programme.
The programme ended with a pitch day for twelve finalists, including 10 women, who presented their ideas to a panel of experts.
The five winning innovations – ranging from healthy school meal alternatives, managing solid waste, to recycling carbon dioxide – will receive seed funding of 2800 JOD and mentorship to help bring their ideas to life and contribute to making sure everyone in Jordan will have reliable access to adequate and nutritious food in the future.
“WFP has been innovating since the first use of commercial airlines to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance, 60 years ago. Today, we use cutting-edge technologies like blockchain to deliver digital cash assistance. Innovation is in our DNA,” said WFP Jordan Country Director, Alberto Correia Mendes. “We deeply believe that these talented young people with their brilliant ideas and the support from WFP and UNICEF can become the backbone of food security in the future.”
“Young people in Jordan have the ideas that can transform the world and tackle the greatest challenges facing their generation including climate change, water scarcity and food insecurity. Our partnership with WFP is helping to turn that potential into real and meaningful action,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
These innovative projects all help address Jordan’s most pressing food security issues; rising population, water scarcity, low agricultural production, unemployment and the growing impact of climate change.
The WFP/UNICEF programme ensures that entrepreneurs and start-ups working on food security solutions are given the support they need to bring their ideas to scale and create employment opportunities for young people.
WFP’s innovation programme has been made possible through generous support from the Governments of Australia and Ireland. UNICEF’s Youth Social Innovation programme is generously supported by the Government of the Netherlands.

Title: UNDP, Ministry of Environment launch Gender Equality and Climate Change in Jordan Analysis in Celebration of International Women’s Day 2022
Content: 08 March 2022

Minister of Environment, Dr. Muawiya Al-Radaydeh Tuesday 9/3/2022, in the presence of the Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme UNDP Randa Aboul- Hosn and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Environment Dr. Mohammad Al-Khashashneh, sponsored the launch ceremony of Gender Equality and Climate Change in Jordan Analysis by UNDP and the Ministry in celebration of International Women Day. The analysis is the first of its kind report addressing climatic impacts on women in several sectors in Jordan.
In the ceremony a discussion took place about the outputs of the analysis at several levels, including public policies, executive technical programmes and institutional frameworks so as to identify the gender gap in climate action, opportunities and benefits that can be achieved by bridging the gap and achieving gender justice in all of programmes addressing adaptation and mitigation of climate change. The analysis also described a general roadmap to gradually pave the way towards gender-responsive climate action.
“The launch of the report today comes at a time of momentum at the national and international levels. Observers of environment action in Jordan acknowledge His Majesty the King’s political will and support for sustainable development and protection of our natural resources and his directives to successive governments to prioritize it given its direct impact on the livelihoods, health and well-being of citizens,” said the Minister of Environment Muawieh Radaideh.


Radaideh added that the gendered dimension of climate change is key for achieving sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also fulfils the commitments articulated in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Paris Climate Accord and Enhanced Lima Climate Workplan for Gender. He noted that the Jordan National Climate Change Policy (2013-2030) (JNCCP), the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and the Third National Communication report (TNC) all pledged to address gender inequalities through mainstreaming a gender equality perspective in relevant climate change adaptation and mitigation policies, strategies and action and thus developing local transformational approaches that promote gender equality and challenge the power dynamics at household, community and sectoral levels. This is pivotal to adopting more gender responsive solutions while advancing and progressing towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
"The United Nations Development Programme acknowledges the important role of women in advancing the development in Jordan. UNDP supports many initiatives and projects aimed at empowering women economically, socially and politically because women play a significant role in raising a healthy family that is the cornerstone in building a coherent community effectively contributing to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals,” said UNDP Resident Representative Randa Aboul-Hosn. Al-Hosn added that UNDP is always keen, through its special partnership with various Jordanian national institutions, to develop cooperation frameworks to implement joint programmes so as to empower women and ensure their engagement in all economic, social, political and environmental agendas in general and climate action in particular.
The world celebrates on March 8 the International Women's Day, and this year's theme is women and girls who lead the task of adaptation, mitigation and response to climate change to build a more sustainable future for all. The analysis focuses on assessment of women's needs in the climate action and aims to promote gender equality in climate action and disaster risk reduction, one of the signifianct global challenges we face in the twenty-first century.

Title: UN recommends strengthening coordination between entities to implement Jordan’s “Food Security Strategy”
Content: 28 February 2022
Achieving food security has been identified by the Government of Jordan as a priority of increasingly national importance, which has led to the adoption of the National Food Strategy 2021-2030 and its first Action Plan. Jordan also participated in the UN Food Systems Summit that was called for by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in 2021, leading to the announcement of the UN Food Systems Coordination Hub which was recently established in Rome.
In a policy brief titled “Towards the Implementation of Jordan’s Food Security Strategy”, the UN reports that while Jordan has not yet experienced serious food availability issues, significant challenges including a fragmented legislative framework, the need for improved water use, dependence on imported foods and the socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19, could affect the country’s food security.
Jordan imports nearly $4 billion worth of food and agricultural products annually. The country is resource-poor in water and energy; the annual water share per capita is less than 100 m3.
The strain on Jordan’s food security has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had an impact on all areas, affecting the Sustainable Development Goals set out in the 2030 Agenda.
Figures from the “Jordan Food Security Update: Implications of COVID-19”, showed that among Jordanians, 53% are vulnerable to food insecurity and around 3% of households are food insecure.
To strengthen food security in Jordan, ensure successful implementation of the National Strategy and its Action Plan, and accelerate realizing the “Zero Hunger Goal” under the  2030 Agenda, the UN recommends:
The brief launched today is the second of a series of policy briefs that aim to inform decision making and ensure synergy with other national and international frameworks.

Title: FAO conducts a field tour to its Hydroponics, Aquaponics and Fish Hatchery project in Jerash
Content: 22 February 2022

The Representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf, carried out a field visit today to the hydroponics, aquaponics and fish hatchery systems in the AlFaisal nursery in Jerash Governorate, in the presence of H.E the Minister of Agriculture, Eng. Khaled Al-Hanaifat, H.E Minister of Water, Eng. Mohammed Al-Najjar, and H.E Ambassador of the European Union to Jordan, Mrs. Maria Hadjitheodosiou.
The visit included a presentation about the project " Introduction of Aquaponics and Hydroponics in Support of Effective Use of Water", which supports and enhances the national competencies and capabilities regarding the management, design and implementation of hydroponics projects, in addition to a tour of the modern farming systems in the AlFaisal nursery.
The tour aims to shed light on the hydroponics, aquaponics and fish hatchery systems implemented by FAO to emphasize the importance of adopting such projects to raise the efficiency of water use compared to traditional agriculture, in addition to benefiting from modern agricultural projects to provide job opportunities for agricultural engineers and investment opportunities for farmers.
In his opening remarks, FAO Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf, praised the continuous efforts of the Ministry of Agriculture to develop the sector, and said, “Hydroponics helps reduce the consumption of water, fertilizers and pesticides, and therefore it is considered one of the most sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural systems, as well as an attractive factor for investors, especially young people.” The project mainly seeks to prepare the appropriate environment for the use of integrated hydroponic systems in Jordan. Assaf also referred to the new strategic framework launched by FAO for the period 2022-2031, which seeks to support the 2030 Agenda through the "Four Betters", which are better production, better environment, better nutrition, and better life.
For his part, H.E Minister of Agriculture, Eng. Khaled Al-Hunaifat, confirmed that these projects support the ministry’s efforts in the national plan for sustainable agriculture, which works to develop water-saving projects in light of the expansion of production according to crops with added economic value, in addition to building the capacities of agricultural engineers through the use of modern technologies. And the generalization of these crops, especially that the ministry has allocated, through its financing program, interest-free loans for the purposes of projects that use modern technologies to provide water.
Eng. Jaafar Al-Emyan, the project coordinator, gave a presentation about the project objectives, implemented activities and achievements. A multi-model hydroponic system was designed and installed; a fish hatchery system, an aquaponics system in the Faisal nursery in Jerash, and an aquaponics system in the Northern Shouna Agriculture Directorate. A three-month theoretical and practical technical training has been conducted under this project, where 64 newly graduated agricultural engineers and farmers were trained on economic feasibility study and financial management of such projects to increase their employment opportunities in the sector.
This joint project falls within FAO’s regional initiatives on water scarcity and encouraging small-scale family farming across the Near East and North Africa to address water scarcity and encourage family farming systems. It is also part of Jordan's 2025 vision, which aims to improve national water security and agricultural productivity.

Title: UNICEF donates cold chain equipment to support immunization of children in Jordan
Content: 08 February 2022
UNICEF has donated essential cold chain equipment to the Ministry of Health to ensure the safe storage and delivery of vaccines to support the routine immunization of children and mothers. This comes after a donation of 1.3 million doses of Polio vaccines from UNICEF to the Ministry to keep children safe and healthy.
The handover of equipment to the Ministry of Health includes four cold rooms for the safe storage of vaccines, six refrigerated vehicles to transport vaccines, 150 vaccine refrigerators and ten vaccine freezers to enhance storage capacity in health centers across the country, and more than six hundred electronic devices to ensure vaccines are kept at the correct temperature to remain effective.
"The Ministry of Health values our partnership with UNICEF and the continuous support for the National Immunization Programme, in addition to their ongoing support to enhance national capacities and make sure we provide all children in Jordan with routine vaccinations including Jordanian children, Syrian refugees, and all the residents of Kingdom; keeping all children healthy and limit the spread of diseases,” said The Ministry of Health’s Secretary-General for Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases, Dr. Raed Al-Shboul,“UNICEF’s generous donation will enhance the level of health services provided to citizens, all donation items will be distributed to hospitals and health service delivery sites across all governorates and districts.”
“Vaccines save lives. UNICEF is committed to supporting the Government to ensure that every child in Jordan is kept safe and healthy through routine immunization and the cold chain is the backbone of all vaccination campaigns,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
The cold chain is the system for safe storage and transport of vaccines. Vaccines must be continuously stored in a limited temperature range – from the time they are manufactured until the moment of vaccination. Temperatures that are too high or too low can cause a vaccine to lose its potency - its ability to protect against disease.
Routine immunization has been mandatory in Jordan since 1979 and all children, regardless of their nationality, have the right to receive free vaccinations. The donation of polio vaccines as part of the National Immunization Programme for children will help to maintain Jordan’s polio-free status which the country has had since 1992.
A robust and well-functioning cold chain will also support the safe transport and storage of COVID-19 vaccines. Leveraging its global supply chain, UNICEF has supported the Government's COVID-19 response efforts through the donation of ventilators, syringes, PPE and hygiene items for frontline workers, as well as supporting the national communication campaign and the procurement and transportation of COVID-19 vaccines as part of the COVAX Facility with the Ministry of Health and partners.
UNICEF is also supporting the Ministry of Health’s first national cold chain equipment inventory to help modernize the existing system, making it ready to respond to any future expansions to the immunization programme.
UNICEF’s support to the national health system to strengthen child immunization is generously supported by the United States Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.

Title: Refugee vaccinations against COVID-19 increase in Jordan
Content: 08 February 2022
Video footage is available here: https://we.tl/t-syY18CfsS7
Data provided by the National Centre for Security and Crisis Management (NCSCM) and collated by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, reveals that over half of refugees aged 18 and above living in Jordan have been vaccinated against COVID-19. In addition, when looking at vaccination rates among refugees living in Za’atari and Azraq Camps, 90 percent of adult refugees have received one or more doses of the vaccine. It has been one month since the implementation of Defense Order 35, which requires proof of vaccination against COVID 19 to access public premises and other facilities across Jordan.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNHCR Jordan has been working closely with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and NCSCM. As of November 2021, vaccination centers have been in operation at UNHCR Registration centres in Amman, Mafraq and Irbid. Over the last three months, approximately 10,000 refugees have been inoculated at these centres.
In January, UNHCR also started operating mobile vaccination centres at community centres located across Jordan in partnership with the NCSCM and, the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development (JOHUD) Refugees and Jordanians alike can approach these centres to take their COVID-19 vaccine without any prior appointment. UNHCR Jordan remains grateful to the Government of Jordan for including refugees in the national response since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Additionally, since December, UNHCR has been providing refugees with a small compensation package to cover refugee transportation to the closest vaccination centre. So far, 130,000 refugees have withdrawn their compensation.
“Over the last few months, we have seen significant progress in facilitating refugee vaccinations in Jordan,” said UNHCR Jordan Representative, Dominik Bartsch. “Amid the current spike of COVID cases in Jordan, it is reassuring that refugee communities remain committed to getting vaccinated.”
In this respect, a network of refugee volunteers has been supporting the fight against misinformation on the COVID-19 vaccine and encouraging those who have hesitations to get vaccinated. Doctors and nurses are also on hand at the vaccination centers to provide medical advice as needed. Current campaigns are focused on boosting vaccination rates among adolescents, women, and the elderly.
“The presence of vaccination centres in our communities has had a positive impact on the number of refugees getting vaccinated. It makes it much easier for refugees, like me, to get vaccinated close to home in a safe and welcoming environment,” said Hajj, a Sudanese refugee community volunteer working at the Nuzha Community Centre in East Amman.

Title: UNESCO and Republic of Korea donate 166 laptops to ensure equitable continuity of learning for Jordanian and Syrian students
Content: 02 February 2022
As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the education sector, many children and youth from less advantaged backgrounds are struggling to continue learning as lessons go online. In order to minimize learning disruption and to ensure equitable continuity of learning, 166 Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanian youths enrolled in Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) training courses, within the framework of UNESCO’s ongoing project funded by the Government of the Republic of Korea, received laptops and internet subscriptions.
The project ‘Provision of TVET, On-the-Job Training and Entrepreneurship Education to Youth Affected by the Syria Crisis in Jordan’, implemented in partnership with Luminus Technical University College (LTUC), is enabling 92 Jordanians and 74 Syrians, including 92 female students, to study in three disciplines: Business, Creative Media Production, and Information Technology.
The internationally accredited TVET programmes, which combine practical learning with subject and theory content, allow students to complete an eight-month course in their respective fields of study, followed by a one-month on-the-job training to reinforce the knowledge and skills they acquired.
While visiting the students at LTUC Amman campus, UNESCO Representative to Jordan, Ms. Min Jeong Kim, stressed the importance of this donation to ensure the continuity of learning through blended approaches, combining face-to-face and e-learning. She stated that the remote learning approach also contributes to enhancing students’ digital skills, which are critical for the labour market. Ms. Kim also highlighted the importance of the partnership with the Government of Korea in contributing to improve the employability prospects of young men and women affected by the Syria crisis in Jordan.
Ambassador Lee Jae-wan emphasized that the Korean government is keen on helping the continuity of education of Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanian students amid the prolonged COVID19 pandemic through supporting TVET training courses. He hoped that the laptops and Internet access will help in their effective learning to graduate with enhanced skills and abilities.
Students who benefited from the donation expressed their thanks and gratitude to UNESCO and the Government of Korea. They explained that the laptops did not just facilitate their current studies and enhanced their digital and research skills, but that they will also be crucial after they complete their courses and graduate, since they will use them to work as  freelancers or on their own business projects.
Ibrahim Janseez, Syrian student enrolled in the Business course, shared that receiving the laptop has helped him to study and solve assignments, and gives him the opportunity to be more creative in his efforts to start a new business after the training programme is over, which will support his family income, and contribute to the community as a whole.
Hayat Al-Dos, Jordanian student in Information Technology, shared that “after receiving the laptop, I started to study for longer hours to get higher grades and search for job opportunities to support myself financially”.
Phase IV of the UNESCO training programme supports the ongoing efforts of the Government of Jordan to integrate e-learning into education system and is fully aligned with national policies and strategies such as the National Youth Strategy (2019-2025), Jordan Vision 2025, Jordan Response Plan for the Syria Crisis (JRP) (2020-2022), and Jordan Human Resource Development Strategy (HRDS) (2016-2025). A total of 761 students (440 Syrians, 321 Jordanians) have benefitted from the project since its inception in 2016, with the majority finding employment opportunities.

Title: FAO and RSS sign an agreement to support community engagement in integrated forest fire management
Content: 01 February 2022
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Royal Scientific Society (RSS) signed today a letter of agreement to support community engagement in integrated forests fire management.
This agreement falls within the activities of “Enhancing the capacity of the forestry sector to control and manage forest fires in Jordan” project which addresses the country technical capacity needs and support the Ministry of Agriculture / Forestry Department as well as the local communities neighboring the forests in regards to forest fire management.
FAO Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf, said” this agreement is a continuation of FAO’s support to the Government of Jordan and to the agriculture sector in facing natural disasters and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), mainly SDG2- Zero Hunger, to eliminate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. Also, supporting the national efforts to control forest fires and alleviate their effects to be endorsed in the national forestry sector policy and is expected to improve the sector’s capacity and contribution to the national development process.”
The Vice President and Executive Director of Sustainable Solutions Sector at the RSS, Engineer Rafat Assi, said, "The forest cover is  limited and it is essential to control forest fires in the Kingdom." He stressed on the role of local communities and their awareness in dealing with neighboring forest fires and their involvement in controlling it.
Moreover, the letter of agreement consists of multiple activities such as conducting awareness raising campaigns, develop plans to actively engage local communities in forests fire management, develop community-based forest fire management initiatives, as well as investigate the potential of community based traditional governance modalities in forests fires management as well as the legal issues related to such engagements. These activities will be implemented in the upcoming five months.
Forest protection is a pillar of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15: “Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss”.

Title: UNHCR survey reveals positive Jordanian attitude towards refugees
Content: 26 January 2022

The survey, which covered representative samples comprising of 3,229 Jordanians from Amman (1,754), Irbid (916), Karak (299), and Mafraq (260), is the third wave of a bi-annual survey conducted by NAMA SIS on behalf of UNHCR examining the perception of refugees among the Jordanian public.
Key findings also highlight that 76 percent of Jordanians believe that the Government’s approach towards refugees has been positive, echoing the results of surveys conducted in June 2021 and December 2020.
“Jordanians remain steadfast in their commitment to helping refugees,” said the UNHCR representative in Jordan Dominik Bartsch.
“But as refugees become increasingly intertwined in Jordanian society, we can no longer just consider their needs in isolation,” he concluded.
Indications of growing fatigue among the Jordanian host community are also emerging in the survey. Compared to previous rounds of the survey, an increase among those who believe that the Jordanian Government has done more than it needs to help refugees was observed. More people also agreed with the statement that Jordan should focus on helping Jordanians, not refugees.
When looking at the effect of refugees on the Jordanian economy, more than three quarters of respondents indicated that jobs, wages and access to services have been negatively affected by refugees. However, most Jordanians said that the pandemic had not changed their perception of refugees, although most believed that they had been more adversely affected in comparison to their refugee neighbors.
“Over the past 3 waves of this survey, we have seen a changing trend in Jordanian public opinion towards refugees that is associated with the worsening economic conditions of Jordanians. As this study shows, of the 59% of Jordanians who believe refugees affected Jordan’s economy, 78.4% of them reported that refugees affected their economic situation negatively. His Excellency Dr. Fares Braizat, the Chairperson of NAMA Strategic Intelligence Solutions.
Moreover, 68% of Jordanians believe that refugees receive more support and 62% view that too much money is being spent on refugees. While the pandemic exacerbated Jordan’s economic woes, 91% of Jordanians say that they have been affected negatively and 81% of Jordanians reported that they suffered more than refugees. This empirical evidence demonstrates that declining positivity towards refugees is linked to the worsening economic conditions of Jordanians.” said His Excellency Dr. Fares Braizat, the Chairperson of NAMA Strategic Intelligence Solutions.
At an event launching the survey on 26 January 2022, representatives of the international community in Jordan reemphasized their support to bolster efforts to support refugees and Jordanians alike and work towards the greater inclusion of refugees in national systems.

Title: Jordan issues record number of work permits to Syrian refugees
Content: 25 January 2022
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, today welcomed the major progress achieved in Jordan in including Syrian refugees in the country’s labour market. In 2021, a record 62,000 work permits were issued to Syrians, according to figures published by the Government and UNHCR. This is the highest annual number since work permits for Syrian refugees were introduced. 
 
Syrian refugees have been allowed to work in several sectors of Jordan’s economy since 2016, after the international community committed funding and expanded trade facilitation under the Jordan Compact, an initiative to improve access to education and legal employment for Syrians forced to flee their homes.  
 
“Refugees can play a significant role in the Jordanian economy, and so they should,” said the UNHCR Representative in Jordan, Dominik Bartsch.
“Allowing refugees to work also reduces the need for humanitarian aid, like cash grants, which could be channeled to support the most vulnerable among them.”
Jordan hosts 760,000 refugees and asylum seekers registered with UNHCR. Of those, some 670,000 are from Syria, making Jordan the No. 2 host of Syrian refugees per capita globally behind Lebanon. The 62,000 work permits include 31,000 flexible ones – also a record – which allow refugees to move between similar jobs in the same sector, as well as among employers and Governorates. UNHCR Jordan works closely with the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions to inform Syrians about the benefits available.  
 
The initiative puts Jordan at the forefront of global efforts to give both refugees and host communities access to decent work, as promoted by the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR). A recent UNHCR report on progress in indicators under the GCR showed that many refugees still lack access to decent work. Globally, only 38 per cent of refugees live in countries with unrestricted access in practice to formal employment, including wage-earning jobs or self-employment.  
 
“Even in countries with laws allowing refugees to work, getting a job is often very difficult, especially with high unemployment rates in host countries,” said Ayman Gharaibeh, UNHCR’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.
“The devastating impact of COVID-19 on host economies is another obstacle for refugees trying to access the labour market. Increased support to host countries is critical to help economies recover, and that would make it easier for refugees to work.
“Given a chance,” he added, refugees can bring innovation, reliability, regional networks and technical know-how to the workplace and make significant contributions locally.”  
 
Previously, Syrian refugees in Jordan were mostly allowed to work only in agriculture, construction and manufacturing. Last year, some were given exemptions to work in other sectors, including as healthcare professionals to help fight COVID. And since July 2021, Syrian refugees have been able to get work permits in all sectors open to non-Jordanians. This means they can now work in services and sales; crafts; as skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers; plant and machine workers; and in basic industries. 
 
As Jordan rebuilds from the pandemic, UNHCR is committed to keep working with its partners and the authorities to increase employment opportunities for refugees and Jordanians alike. “With the pressing need to support Jordan’s economic recovery from COVID, it’s great to see more refugees than ever being able to contribute,” added Bartsch. 
 
Despite this, significant challenges remain. With an unemployment rate of 23 percent in Jordan, many refugees who hold work permits still struggle to find jobs and support their families.  And only Syrian refugees in Jordan are legally allowed to work. Those from other countries, including Iraq, Yemen, Sudan and Somalia, are not able to apply for permits. UNHCR Jordan is advocating for non-Syrian refugees also to be given the opportunity to work.

Title: A determined vocational education graduate leads his way to success
Content: 24 January 2022
Amro Matahen, a 22-year-old Jordanian vocational education graduate shared his professional journey with UNESCO
Amro Matahen, a 22-year-old Jordanian vocational education graduate shared his professional journey with UNESCO, which started in March 2019, when he came across a Facebook advertisement on Luminus Technical University College (LTUC) Facebook page, promoting new TVET training programmes and encouraging youth from all educational backgrounds to apply. Amro’s application to study electrical and electronic engineering was successful and when accepted he felt ‘as if the doors to my future just opened up for me”.
The electrical engineering course was offered within the framework of the “Provision of TVET, On-The-Job-Training and Entrepreneurship Education to Youth Affected by the Syria Crisis in Jordan” project, through a strong partnership between the Government of the Republic of Korea and UNESCO ...
In July 2020, Amro graduated from LTUC and received his BTEC level II [1] Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
Apart from relevant technical and theoretical subjects, which are very much in demand in the job market in Jordan, Amro also benefitted from training on CV writing and how to apply for jobs. These soft skills are as important and give confidence to the students invited for a job interview.
In February 2020, Amro conducted a one-month on-the-job-training (OJT) as part of the programme at a smartphone shop called “Future Dream Mobile”, where he got hands-on training in cellphone maintenance and repair, sales, project management, and staff management. Already at this point, he realized that “only a minority of workers in this field truly master mobile maintenance and those who do will earn a better salary than those who only work in sales.’
The shop owner recognized Amro’s potential, stating that “since day one, I have seen a strong level of persistence and love for what he does. That’s why I decided to offer him a job, after completion of his OJT, first as a salesperson and then I promoted him to a Senior Repair Agent”.  Amro took this job offer and nearly a year later beginning of 2022, he still works for Future Dream Mobile.
In fact, he is now a branch manager, running an entire “Future Dream Mobile” shop. This new responsibility has really boosted his morale and self-confidence and provides him also with a steady income. He is glad that he found a job despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the full lockdown of the country in March 2020, which Amro used to start his own YouTube channel, where he would post videos and tutorials on smartphone design and repair.
Amro has come a long way and looking back, he would definitely study at LTUC again, as well as recommend the programme to others who are looking for technical and vocational training that prepares them for the labor market.
This UNESCO project supported by the Government of the Republic of Korea is still on-going, benefitting 166 students as (74 Syrians, 92 Jordanians (92 females, 74 males) in 2022. It is fully aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 4 “Ensuring inclusive and quality education for all and promoting lifelong learning".

Title: Schools should be ‘last to close, first to open’ Multilateral agencies in Jordan call for continued prioritization of education during COVID-19
Content: 19 January 2022
All agencies and the World Bank recognized the efforts made to date by the Government of Jordan to prioritize school opening, with significant investments made to date to ensure that the necessary measures are in place for safe learning and that both children and teachers have the skills and tools they need to effectively catch up.
The heads of three UN Agencies in Jordan - UNESCO, UNICEF and WHO – and the World Bank called on the Government of Jordan to avoid reversing years of progress in education by continuing to apply the safe reopening framework that seek to keep in-person learning at schools available for the majority of students. The longer that COVID-19 measures keep classrooms closed in Jordan, the greater the impact on children and youth.
“Time is of the essence to help children who have already lost almost two years of in-person learning." Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
“Time is of the essence to help children who have already lost almost two years of in-person learning. The focus must be on getting the most vulnerable children who are facing a shadow pandemic of child labour, early marriage and mental health issues, and are most at risk of dropping out, back to school,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has already placed restrictions and immense pressures on children everywhere. Returning to school should be an exciting time for them and contributes to their physical and mental development. It’s where they get to learn, grow, interact with others. Dr Jamela Al-Raiby, WHO Representative to Jordan.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has already placed restrictions and immense pressures on children everywhere. Returning to school should be an exciting time for them and contributes to their physical and mental development. It’s where they get to learn, grow, interact with others. School closures in Jordan should not be considered an option like they were earlier in the pandemic, given that the country has been a regional leader in effectively preparing schools for reopening, with high vaccination coverage, guidance and training for teachers; hygiene and sanitation materials; as well as physical distancing and rotation,” said Dr Jamela Al-Raiby, WHO Representative to Jordan.
“Early indications from the recent mid-term review of Jordan’s Education Strategic Plan (ESP) already point to alarming learning and equity losses due to the pandemic." Min Jeong Kim, Representative, UNESCO Jordan.
“Early indications from the recent mid-term review of Jordan’s Education Strategic Plan (ESP) already point to alarming learning and equity losses due to the pandemic. Stronger prioritization on reopening schools and keeping them open and mainstreaming of remedial education approaches within public schools will be critical especially for children from low-income households, children with special needs, and refugee children,” said Min Jeong Kim, Representative, UNESCO Jordan.
“Disruptions to instructional time in the classroom can have a severe impact on a child’s future ability to learn." Holly Benner, Resident Representative to Jordan, The World Bank.
“Disruptions to instructional time in the classroom can have a severe impact on a child’s future ability to learn. Learning losses can far exceed the actual school closure time. The pandemic threatens to undo years of hard-earned progress in the education sector in Jordan, and further closures might reverse the important progress of remediation efforts and result in additional learning losses,” said Holly Benner, Resident Representative to Jordan, The World Bank.
The cost of keeping schools closed is significant as children who fall behind in their education are more likely to drop out, affecting Jordan’s human capital outcomes and the ability of young people to access jobs and economic opportunities in the longer term. Simulations suggest that students have lost up to 0.9 years of schooling in Jordan, adjusted for quality. It is estimated that in Jordan students’ future earnings may fall as much as 8 percent.
School closures disproportionately affect younger children, those with limited digital access, children with disabilities, girls, refugees, and children living in poverty. School is critical for children beyond learning – it helps them to socialize and develop, and for some children, school is the only place where they feel safe.
The multilateral agencies reiterated their continued support to the Ministry of Education to get all children back to learning in the second semester as soon as possible.

Title: Launching the National Reproductive and Sexual Health Strategy for the Years (2020-2030 )
Content: 15 January 2022
Jordan has made important achievements in the field of reproductive health, especially in reducing the maternal mortality rate, by providing advanced health care for mothers in hospitals.
The Higher Population Council, in cooperation with the United Nations Population Fund, launched the National Reproductive and Sexual Health Strategy for the years (2020-2030), during a ceremony under the patronage of the delegate of the Minister of Health, Dr. Firas Al-Hawari, Secretary-General of Administrative and Financial Affairs in the Ministry of Health, Dr. Elham Khreisat,with the participation of the relevant national authorities.
The Secretary-General of Administrative and Financial Affairs at the Ministry of Health, Dr. Elham Khreisat, confirmed that Jordan has made important achievements in the field of reproductive health, especially in reducing the maternal mortality rate, by providing advanced health care for mothers in hospitals.
She indicated that the ministry is working hard to improve the quality of health services provided, both preventive and curative, to raise the level of reproductive health services and implement the goals of the national agenda.
She indicated that maternity, childhood and family planning services are provided free of charge in all centers affiliated with the Ministry, by qualified health cadres in about 520 centers. They include maternal care during pregnancy and after childbirth, childcare up to five years of age, family planning services, counseling services and health education. In addition to providing immunization services for pregnant mothers and children, early detection of breast cancer, and investigation of domestic violence.
She added that the ministry provides health services to Syrian citizens and refugees living in remote areas, by expanding the provision of maternity and childhood services to include some sub-health centers in the north and central regions, where these centers now provide some maternal and child services such as vaccination, pregnant care, postpartum and family planning. Comprehensive referral centers have been approved and established in all governorates of the Kingdom and provided with the necessary medical devices and tools to evaluate and follow up high-risk pregnancies.
The Secretary-General of the Higher Population Council, Dr. Abla Amawi, stressed that this strategy, which was prepared by the Council in cooperation with the United Nations Population Fund, is a frame of reference for the various partners in Jordan, through which it is possible to develop, harmonize or include institutional plans. The necessary interventions to achieve comprehensive access to services and information Integrated reproductive and sexual health to contribute to the well-being of families in Jordan.
She pointed out that the strategy is based on evidence, data and lessons learned from international, Arab and national reports and studies, and takes into account the specificity of the situation in Jordan with regard to the priorities of reproductive and sexual health issues. It will also contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030, especially the third goal on health and well-being.
She identified that the desk review of studies, reports and strategies related to reproductive and sexual health, showed that there are a set of challenges to achieving reproductive and sexual health goals in Jordan, the most prominent of which is the limited integration between sexual and reproductive health programs and primary health care programs in health centers and women's services, and obstetrics in hospitals, shortage and weakness in programs that evaluate the level of sexual and reproductive health services currently provided in the public and private sectors, the extent to which service providers adhere to the approved protocols and the extent to which beneficiaries are satisfied with them, the weakness of sexual and reproductive health services provided to Syrian refugees, and the existence of financial, social, cultural and awareness barriers that prevent them from reaching these services, the weakness of services directed at sexual health and sexually transmitted diseases, and the health of adolescents and youth in government health centers, and the lack of an integrated package of basic services related to sexual and reproductive health directed to these age groups, and many other challenges.
For his part, the United Nations Resident Representative in Jordan Anders Pedersen stressed that the United Nations Population Fund is working to ensure that sexual and reproductive health and rights remain at the heart of development, as the International Conference on Population and Development establishes a clear link between reproductive health, human rights and sustainable development.
He added: "Failure to meet sexual and reproductive health needs deprives individuals of the right to make critical choices about their bodies and their future and will have a subsequent impact on the well-being of their families and future generations. Denial of these rights exacerbates poverty and gender inequality.”
The strategy included four strategic objectives within four axes: the environment axis, through the development of supportive and enabling legislation and policies for integrated sexual and reproductive health issues, and the services and information axis, which is achieved by providing integrated sexual and reproductive health services and information of quality to the entire population (individuals) in all regions of the Kingdom, and the community axis, which deals with achieving positive societal trends, beliefs and behaviors towards reproductive and sexual health issues, in addition to the sustainability and governance axis, which focuses on developing integrated, institutionalized and sustainable sexual and reproductive health services and information within effective sector partnerships.
The strategy was developed by following the strategic planning methodology that is based on broad participation, coordination and cooperation with all stakeholders through the involvement of all governmental and non-governmental institutions, civil society organizations, the private sector, relevant scientific and research institutions, and donors working in Jordan in the field of sexual and reproductive health issues with the support of The United Nations Population Council, based on the analysis of the current reality of reproductive and sexual health issues, and its comparison with global indicators in this field.
On the sidelines of the launch ceremony, several discussion sessions were held over two days, dealing with several topics related to the participation of the relevant authorities. The session on the first day dealt with the topic of "Implementing a Comprehensive Package of Sexual and Reproductive Health Services".
On the second day, three discussion sessions will be held on the topics, quality of care: sexual reproductive health services, strengthening the health response to gender-based violence, and national standards for youth-appropriate sexual and reproductive health services.

Title: UNHCR welcomes new funding from Japan to support refugees in Jordan
Content: 13 January 2022
As the Middle East continues to face challenges related to large-scale protracted displacement and the shock of COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of Japan has renewed its commitment to support refugees in Jordan with USD 4,925,925. This contribution will allow UNHCR Jordan to further support the Government of Jordan and assist refugees who have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, UNHCR Jordan has observed an increase in gender inequality and gender-based violence as well as risks faced by children such as school drop-out and child labor. These compounded challenges are reversing years of progress achieved before the pandemic. In 2021, through the support of donors, UNHCR has been able to combat some of these effects through offering refugees both face-to-face and remote counselling to facilitate access to key services, and will continue to do so over the coming year.
As such, the generous contribution from the Japanese government will enable UNHCR to provide protection services for refugees including the most vulnerable groups, such as children and gender-based violence survivors. Funding will also go towards improving shelter and enhance community-based protection mechanisms.
“Increased vulnerability among refugee populations in Jordan necessitates a strong response. We welcome the support from the Japanese government, as we strive to offset the inequalities provoked by the pandemic” said UNHCR’s Representative in Jordan, Dominik Bartsch.
In addition, funding from Japan will support UNHCR to strengthen its community-based approach to protection. Through a network of community centres located throughout the Kingdom, UNHCR seeks to actively engage refugees in decisions impacting their lives and strengthen links with Jordanian host communities. In the current context of COVID-19, community centres have been key to provide refugees with information about a range of services including health, protection, non-food item distributions and livelihood opportunities.
UNHCR is grateful for the support from the Japanese people and welcomes the continued partnership with the Japanese embassy, to assist most vulnerable refugees in Jordan.

Title: SRSG Najat Maalla M’jid concludes mission to Jordan with call for unified response to end violence against children
Content: 16 December 2021
During the visit, Dr. Najat met children, youth, women and communities who are being empowered to exercise their rights and participate in a violence-free environment for all children, as well as consulting with Government, non-governmental organizations, civil society, international agencies and donors..
Concluding her mission, Dr. Najat highlighted that in 2022, the Government of Jordan will submit its second Voluntary National Review (VNR) on SDGs at the High-Level Political Forum and the Amman Voluntary Local Review (VLR) – the first VLR in Arab region. Those Voluntary Reviews are a critical part of the accountability architecture for the SDGs.
Reporting on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an excellent opportunity to assess progress made in ending violence against children and to move away from silo and unsustainable approaches and implement an integrated system, including child, gender, disability sensitive social and child protection  services, parenting support, access to safe learning, healthcare including mental health, as well as justice. This integrated approach echoes the interdependence of children’s rights and of the SDGs.
“Investing in children’s protection, development and wellbeing cannot wait. Investing in children is essential for building an inclusive, peaceful, just and resilient society that keeps children safe from harm and leaves no one behind,” said Dr. Najat Maalla M’jid, SRSG on Violence against Children.
The Secretary General of the National Council for Family Affairs, Dr. Mohammad Fakhri Makdadi, stressed on the urgent need for  the endorsement of Child’s Rights Law, which will enable Jordan to fulfil its international legal obligation under  Convention on the Rights of the Child as well it will further enable Jordan to address existing legislative gaps that have emerged in the mechanisms of granting the rights to children.”
“We need to protect children and young people from harm. All violence against children is preventable. The Government has committed itself to prepare the Voluntary National Review (VNR) for presentation at the High-Level Political Forum in July 2022, which is a key opportunity to identify ways to accelerate the Sustainable Development Agenda and children’s rights while “building forward better,” Said Anders Pedersen the UN Resident and Humanitarian for the UN in Jordan.
“The SRSG-VAC’s mission has reinforced the importance of making ending the prevalence of violence against children a whole of Government and whole of society priority,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “Investing in the protection of younger generations will allow future generations to flourish, allowing children to grow into healthy and productive adults.”

Title: FAO launches a project to formulate a sustainable aquaculture strategy in Jordan
Content: 14 December 2021
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) and Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) launched today a project funded by FAO to formulate a sustainable aquaculture strategy in Jordan. The implementation of the activities will start in January 2022 and will continue until December 2022.
In line with a technical cooperation agreement signed between the three parties last month, FAO conducted an inception workshop to acquaint stakeholders and programme partners with the scope and outlines of the project entitled:  “Support the formulation of Sustainable Aquaculture Strategy in Jordan". The workshop also covered the implementation strategy and work plan.
The workshop was under the patronage of his Excellency Mr. Nasser Shraideh, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation and attended by representatives from the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Water and Irrigation, the National Agricultural Research Center, in addition to the Association of Fish Breeders and Marine Biology, and the Jordan Aquaponics Association.
The objective of the project is to support the Government of Jordan in developing proper planning and sector management tools for sustainable aquaculture development to contribute to increasing fish productivity in rural agricultural communities and the private sector through the development of well-managed technical practices and the strengthening of technical capabilities in aquaculture innovation - Including training on biologically secure fish farms and solar energy - solar powered fish farms, water recycling systems using high-tech filters and treatment to reduce water consumption through establishing a pilot Fish hatchery project).
The overall and long-term impact of the project is to increase national production of fish products, and to contribute to food security through the availability of an important local source of animal protein.
FAO Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf, said, “Aquaculture in small farmer systems provides high quality animal protein and essential nutrients, especially for nutritionally vulnerable groups, such as pregnant and lactating women, infants and preschoolers. It also provides this protein at prices generally affordable to the poorer segments of the community.” “It creates ‘own enterprise’ employment, including jobs for women and children, and provides income through sale of what can be relatively high value products.” Added Assaf.
On behalf of the Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, H.E Dr. Marwan Al-Refai, confirmed "this project comes within the framework of the implementation of Jordan National Food Security Strategy that was recently adopted by the government. It is an innovative pilot project that will enable us to test the possibilities of spawning and raising fish on land using sea water, providing the required knowhow, and identifying the strengths and challenges that it might encounter.’ He also praised the role of FAO in promoting agricultural development, food security and climate adaptation in Jordan.
Mr. Abdullah Abu Al-Awali from ASEZA stated, “The Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority is fully confident that this project, will contribute to achieving the goals of protecting the marine environment and fish wealth in the Gulf of Aqaba. It will also enable the authority to assess the success of fish farming operations on land and to identify the challenges in this field.” He added that “it is anticipated that this project will contribute to strengthening and raising the capabilities of the fishermen community and local cadres in Aqaba in the field of fish farming.”

Title: All human, all equal: Rebuild better, fairer, greener UN in Jordan calls for 2022 to be a year of action for human rights
Content: 11 December 2021
On the occasion of Human Rights Day, observed annually on 10 December, the UN urged that the realization of the 2030 Agenda should be grounded in meaningful participation, safe-guarding civic space, freedom of expression and association, the right to peaceful assembly, access to information, social dialogue, transparency and accountability.
Addressing the National Governmental Conference “Decreasing Inequalities and Enhancing Human Rights in Jordan” on Saturday, Anders Pedersen, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Jordan said: “successive financial, humanitarian and the latest health crises- COVID-19- have hampered the realization of the 2030 Agenda and have had a long-lasting and multidimensional impact, especially on millions of young people worldwide, including in Jordan”.
Thus, protecting rights of young people through access to quality education, training, mental health support, decent jobs and social protection, is critical, stressed Pedersen, adding that the “COVID generation” runs the risk of falling prey to mounting inequality and poverty”.
According to Pedersen, women have also been severely affected, through job losses, facing increased gender-based violence and lacking political participation, - as are persons with disabilities, people living in poverty, older persons, migrants and refugees.
He referred to the 2030 Agenda, which is underpinned by human rights, as “the comprehensive blueprint for sustainable recovery from the pandemic and to further advance the realization of human rights for all people everywhere, without discrimination”.
The Government of Jordan will present its assessment of progress made in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda through submitting a Voluntary National Review report to the United Nations in July 2022, which, as Pedersen highlighted, “provides an opportunity to take stock and accelerate protection and promotion of human rights including through the Universal Periodic Review process in 2023 -with the meaningful participation especially of young people”.
The United Nations stands ready to support the implementation of recommendations addressed to Jordan by United Nations human rights mechanisms, which could build a BETTER, FAIRER and GREENER future for all, concluded Pedersen.
Human Rights Day, celebrated annually, to honor the adoption of the Universal Declaration for Human Rights in 1948.
This year’s theme is “Equality”. Article 1 of the Universal Declaration stipulates - “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” and the principles of equality and non-discrimination are at the heart of human rights and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which aims at “leaving no one behind”. According to the World Inequality Report 2022, the MENA region is the most unequal region in the world where the share of the top 10% of income is around 58%.
“Inequalities stem from policy choices. We need to reverse years of under- investment in economic, social and cultural rights, and be bolder in repositioning public expenditure to prioritize people and their rights,” said Christina Meinecke, Senior Human Rights Adviser to the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Jordan.
She added that “rebuilding fairer requires reversing long-standing practices of inequality and poverty and strengthening the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. That vision is at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, captured in SDG 10: reduce inequality within and between countries”.

Title: UNHCR Jordan doubles its efforts to vaccinate refugees against COVID-19
Content: 08 December 2021
“Protecting refugees is at the core of what we do at UNHCR, and this includes ensuring that everyone has the means to receive their COVID-19 vaccine,”
Based on data from the Ministry of Health and National Centre for Security and Crisis Management, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency in Jordan, currently estimates that as of the end of October 135,000 individuals - 33 percent of Syrian refugees - aged 12 years old and above living outside of refugee camps are vaccinated against COVID-19.
Since 31 October, UNHCR has opened three mobile vaccination units in its registration centers in Amman, Mafraq and Irbid in partnership with the National Centre for Security and Crisis Management and the Ministry of Health. Over 1,300 refugees have already been inoculated through this exercise. It should be noted that some 55% of eligible refugees (12 years and above) in Zaatari and Azraq camps have already been vaccinated, thanks to available vaccination centers in both camps.
Additionally, starting this week, UNHCR is distributing a small cash amount to all refugees living outside of refugee camps who have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The distribution of 7.5 JOD per fully vaccinated refugee is designed as a compensation for the transport costs refugees incurred when receiving their vaccination.
“Protecting refugees is at the core of what we do at UNHCR, and this includes ensuring that everyone has the means to receive their COVID-19 vaccine,” said Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Jordan Representative. “In support of the Government of Jordan’s efforts to increase vaccination rates, we are doing everything we can to encourage vaccine uptake among refugee populations,” he added.
As part of this initiative, refugees living in Jordan are encouraged to verify their vaccination status with UNHCR. Refugee families will subsequently receive an SMS with instructions as to when and how their vaccination cash will be ready to collect. Refugees who are already vaccinated should receive their cash assistance in December while distributions to those who will take their vaccine in the coming weeks will take place in January.
“I received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine over two months ago but at the time it wasn’t easy as the vaccination centre was far, and we did not have enough money to cover the taxi fare. I will now tell all my neighbors about this cash distribution if they receive the vaccine,” stated Mohammad, a Syrian refugee in Amman, after collecting 40 JOD in recognition for the fact that 5 individuals in his family had received the vaccine.
In line with Ministry of Health policies, UNHCR Jordan continues to urge all refugees to get their COVID-19 vaccine, including the booster dose for the ones who have received their last dose over 6 months ago. Additionally, as of January 2022, in line with the Government’s Defense Orders, refugees and asylum seekers will need to be vaccinated to visit UNHCR Registration Centres in Jordan or present a recent negative PCR test.

Title: Eight refugee doctors honoured for contributions to Jordan’s public hospitals amid pandemic
Content: 08 December 2021
UNHCR celebrated eight doctor’s contribution to the COVID-19 response in Jordan by presenting them the volunteer service award.
UNHCR rewarded eight refugee doctors, including five Syrians, two Iraqis and one Yemeni, for their voluntary work in public Jordanian hospitals during the pandemic, in collaboration with the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme and the Ministry of Health.
UNHCR Representative in Jordan Dominick Bartsch expressed his pride and happiness with the doctors’ achievement, saying: “We are very happy to have UNV refugee doctors who are currently working as health professionals to provide essential medical services under the ministry of health for the COVID response in the Kingdom.”
“These professionals put their expertise to the disposal of society, especially as refugees who are giving back to Jordanian society and the government,” Bartsch said during the ceremony.
Bartsch thanked the doctors and congratulated them for winning the UNV award.
UNHCR Spokesperson Lilly Carlisle said that this has been a venture UNHCR has undergone alongside the UNV, with the help of the Ministry of Health’s exemption to allow the refugees to work as doctors in Jordan.
“When the pandemic hit, we contacted the Ministry of Health to get refugee doctors to help fill in some gaps the health system Jordan was facing and they gave these eight doctors the permits. They have been working since June and had of their contracts extended until December 2022 in recognition of their great work,” Carlisle told The Jordan Times on Tuesday.
Carlisle noted that refugees in Jordan have a wide range of expertise and UNHCR works to make them self-reliant so they can contribute to society while they are in the Kingdom.
“Refugee doctors contributing to the COVID-19 response in Jordan is a great step towards achieving that, especially now with the current third wave,” she continued.
She added that many of the doctors work in emergency units in hospitals at the front line of COVID-19 response every day.
“Today was a really important recognition of what they have done so far and what they will achieve next year,” Carlisle said.
She noted that highly skilled refugees “deserve to use their skills after spending years studying and training to provide for their families and themselves. Their skills should not go to waste”.
Carlisle indicated that UNHCR received over 300 applicants who wanted to work in the medical sector.
“We are still trying to get more permits for more people to work as doctors, nurses or pharmacists, as there are still gaps for refugees to contribute to,” she said, noting that the doctors received a stipend for their work.
Abdulrazak Darkashly, a Syrian refugee doctor who volunteers in Al Bashir Hospital, expressed his gratitude and happiness for getting the permit to work and practise his profession.
“It is a humanitarian profession and it was necessary for all doctors to contribute to the COVID-19 response and I wanted to offer my services,” Darkashly told The Jordan Times on Tuesday.
Darkashly noted that it has not been easy during the pandemic, as there is a lot of pressure on the medical staff, “but it becomes easier when more experts and health professionals are involved”.
Basma Tamimi, a Yemeni doctor at one of the Kingdom’s hospitals, expressed her happiness to be part of the UNV programme.
“I am very proud of this achievement and very glad to be able to help the people especially during the pandemic we are going through,” she told The Jordan Times.
Tamimi also expressed her excitement to give more during the next year while working as well.

Title: FAO inaugurates 22 rehabilitated agricultural centres through EU-funded project in Jordan
Content: 06 December 2021
The renovation was made possible through the “Enhancing resilient livelihoods and food security of host communities and Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon through the promotion of sustainable agricultural development” project that is funded by the European Union through its Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian crisis (MADAD). The project is implemented by FAO in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture, World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).
The handover ceremony was held under the Patronage of H.E. Eng. Khaled Hnaifat, Minister of Agriculture, and the Deputy Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation in Jordan, Ms. Sirpa Tulla, in Jarash Governorate, which is one of the 22 rehabilitated centres across the 12 governorates; Amman, Irbid, Balqaa, Salt, Karak, Tafileh, Aqaba, Ajloun, Zarqa, Madaba and Mafraq. These facilities underwent rehabilitation works and were provided with equipment and tools required to host training programmes on climate-smart agriculture, sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of Syrian refugees and host communities.
H.E Minister of Agriculture, Eng. Khaled Al-Hanaifat, confirmed that this project supports the ministry’s efforts in developing agricultural guidance and placing it within its guiding path for the sector, in a way that ensures the availability of training for farmers towards crops with more economic value, adequate for market requirements, and support food security.
Hanifat valued this support and cooperation from the partners, which represents a real and tangible achievement and alignment with the Ministry’s plans to develop and modernize the cadres of the Ministry and the agricultural sector.
The Deputy Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation in Jordan, Ms. Sirpa Tulla said that, “The rehabilitation of 22 National Agricultural Training Facilities is within the framework of the “Enhancing resilient livelihoods and food security of host communities and Syrian refugees in Jordan through promoting sustainable agricultural development” project funded by the EU through its Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis (MADAD), We are very proud to see the progress of the excellent partnership developed with the Government of Jordan and our UN partners."
FAO’s Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf, said “The conflict in Syria has triggered the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Refugees from Syria are the biggest refugee population from a single conflict in a generation. FAO is glad to be in the forefront of the implementation of the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis (MADAD FUND) and contribute with our partners WFP and IFAD to addresses the socio-economic needs of Syrian refugees while also supporting overstretched local communities and their administrations.” he added “The new 22 training centres inaugurated today will enhance the ability of MOA and farmer groups to develop capacity of host and refugee’s communities.”
“We cannot ignore the importance of investing in natural ecosystems in a country like Jordan that has been impacted by climate change and stressed by limited natural resources. The EU-funded Madad project presents a great opportunity for the three Rome Based Agencies to work together under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture to support Jordan address its climate change challenges while creating sustainable livelihood opportunities to the most vulnerable.”Said Alberto Correia Mendes, Representative and Country Director of the World Food Programme.
The rehabilitation of the agricultural extension centres and building the capacity of their staff will enhance the farmer’s skills as individuals and groups, because after several years of conflict, refugees from Syria in the region and communities hosting them continue to require protection and assistance, with complex and evolving needs.
The new facilities will be used to run capacity building for farmers (Jordanian and Syrian refugees) as well as training of trainers - TOT to provide skilled teachers to support all current and planned education activities. The training supported by the project will focus on promoting climate-smart agriculture (CSA) with the aim of achieving three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes; adapting and building resilience to climate change; and reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions, where possible.
Background

Title: Italy and FAO partner to increase the resilience of the vulnerable communities in Jordan
Content: 28 November 2021
The Ambassador of Italy to Jordan, Fabio Cassese, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Representative in Jordan, Nabil Assaf, signed today a EUR 1 million agreement to increase the resilience of the Jordanian vulnerable communities through the Italy-funded “Sustainable Production and Utilization of Agro-natural Resources (SPUAR)” project, during a ceremony attended by the Head of Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) Amman, Emilio Cabasino.
The initiative targets vulnerable communities and their access to socio-economic infrastructures in the governorate of Ma’an, which is the largest in Jordan and, according to the poverty report issued by the Jordanian Department of Statistics, one of the poorest governorates in the Country, with a poverty ratio of 27%.
“In recognition of the importance to support the agriculture sector and sustainable management of natural resources in a Country like Jordan challenged by desertification, drought and land degradation“, said Ambassador Cassese, “Italy’s partnership with FAO focuses on actions to counteract the detrimental impact of resource scarcity upon human development and poverty”.
The scarcity of water resources is indeed one of the main challenges for Jordan and a limiting factor for economic development, especially for the agriculture sector. The demand on water resources is increasing with time for both agriculture and non-agricultural purposes, as the agricultural sector consumes around 510 million cubic meters (51%) of the annual available fresh water.
“In response to the current water scarcity status in Jordan, this project will be implemented in Southern Jordan targeting the most vulnerable households in Ma’an governorate with an enabling environment for women's enhanced participation, by establishing non-conventional water resources from collecting rain water for the benefit of agriculture and the enhancement of the well-being of the targeted beneficiaries”, said Mr Nabil Assaf.
The initiative aims to establish a sustainable enterprise using the agro-natural resources (land, water, vegetation) available in the targeted governorate. “Within the two-year project,” added Mr Cabasino, “we aim to target a total of 120 households (660 persons), including female headed households, youth and people with disabilities, with actions that include rooftop water harvesting systems and provision of food processing equipment, as well as a capacity building programme to equip beneficiaries with the necessary skills to maximize the use of agro-natural resources and enhance their livelihood”.
In addition to improved food security and income-generation opportunities, the project will result in soil and water conservation through their sustainable management, and will ultimately contribute to empower local rural communities.

Title: Launching of the 2021 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence campaign
Content: 27 November 2021
On Saturday, under the patronage of H.E. Wafaa Bani Mustafa, Minister of State for Legal Affairs and representative of the Inter-ministerial Committee for Women’s Empowerment, the 2021 edition of the international campaign 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence was launched under the theme “Together to end violence against women in the public and political spheres.”
During the launching ceremony organized by the Jordanian National Commission for Women (JNCW) and the Shama’a Network with the support of the UN in Jordan and Plan International, Her Excellency joined partners in the global stand to combat violence against women during the 16 Days campaign, while calling for increased efforts to enhance the protection of women and preserve their right to life and live in dignity.
She also emphasized the Government’s commitment to combating all forms of violence considering the positive impact it has on accelerating sustainable development, and building a healthy society in which all men and women can participate in the decision-making process.
Bani Mustafa also noted that there is a political support in Jordan, under the reign of His Majesty King Abdullah II, to promote the role of women and empower them in different fields.
In particular, she referred to the proposed legislative amendments to enhance women’s political life, such as the propositions of the Royal Committee for the Modernization of the Political System to the Constitution, which are being discussed in the Parliament. This includes the amendment to Chapter 2 of the Constitution in terms of adding specific references “Jordanian women”, as well as the addition of an item under Article 6 aiming to encourage women’s empowerment and protection from violence and discrimination.
She also recalled to the draft Election Law, which requires general lists for political parties to include women as well as to increase the number of seats for women appointed in local councils across all Governorates.
She explained that the Political Parties law includes dedicated provisions to encourage women’s participation, emphasizing the importance of women and youth to access leadership roles in political parties. The draft Law also requires 20% of the party’s founding members to be women.
Her Excellency also recalled the societal and cultural challenge present among certain segments of that society that still challenge women’s ability to exercise their rights to live a life free from violence .
Dr. Salma Al-Nims, Secretary-General of JNCW, explained in her remarks that the 16 Days campaign is a starting point to effectively move towards combating discrimination and violence against women in politics. This year’s theme is the result of a specific study conducted by JNCW and its partners, that will continue to work on the issue in the upcoming year, intensifying joint efforts to promote the rights of women and girls in Jordan and to empower them.
Dr. Nims indicated that beyond the selected theme, JNCW continues to work on and raise awareness on all forms of violence against women, including economic and social violence, femicide and any discriminatory issues that women may face.
On that, she said: “The National Strategy for Women in Jordan 2020-2025 identifies ending violence against women as a priority area of action both at the national and governorate level. As such, JNCW will continue to work with all partners to combat all forms of violence against women and girls by focusing on legislative reforms, including the development of dedicated policies and plans, improving services, building and raising awareness, and changing discriminatory behaviors. Despite the multiplicity and diversity of forms of violence, its root causes are the same. Hence, JNCW works to strengthen positive power relations in the family and in the society to confront and end all forms of violence.
Dr. Nims presented the main findings of the study conducted by JNCW in 2021 on political violence against women, which served as the basis to identify this year’s theme for the campaign. She added that the findings are available to those who are interested.
“The United Nations joins our national partners in calling for zero-tolerance to violence against women in politics and we reaffirm our commitment as your partner to promote an enabling environment for women’s political participation in Jordan” said Mr. Ziad Sheikh, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator ai.
In her remarks, the Director of Plan International, Ms. Muna Abbas indicated that women’s participation in the public and political life shall begin in the early years in order to raise girls’ awareness about their capacities and to increase their understanding in their right and ability to interact in the public space without fear of marginalization and bullying.
Through its programmes, Plan International works with girls and young women to strengthen their leadership skills and to support them accessing leadership roles in different contexts. Plan International also works to increase societal awareness on the important role of girls, young women and women play in all fields and to break stereotypes and misconceptions about women's ability to participate, engage and positively influence the political life and public space.
The campaign will be rolled out through a holistic media campaign that leverages key messages and awareness raising material targeting all segments of the society to expand outreach at a larger scale. This includes visuals and video streams on social media in additional to thematic media products and audio messages that will be broadcasted on radio. More than 500 activities, sessions, workshops, and virtual events will be conducted by partners throughout across all governorates of Jordan.
The campaign will also include an online social media storm led by JNCW and its partners, titled “the Orange Hour”, which will take place on Saturday, 4 December at 8PM. This event is dedicated to share information relevant to the campaign, particularly with regards to political violence against women.
Overview of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence campaign
The 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence is an international campaign which takes place each year and runs from 25th November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, to 10th December, Human Rights Day. The campaign is widely known as the “16 Days Campaign”, which is utilized as an organized strategy by individuals and organizations across the world to call for the prevention and elimination of violence against women and girls. The campaign initially launched by the Center for Women’s Global Leadership in 1991. Since 2007, Jordanian civil society organizations, JNCW, UN agencies and members of the international community joined efforts to support social mobilization in the Kingdom through the implementation of several events to raise awareness on gender-based violence.
Everyone is invited to join the campaign on social media using the hashtag #16DaysJo and #لها_مكان_ومكانة
Overview on the “Shama’a Network” On 10 December 2007, in conjunction with the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and at the end of the 16 Days campaign, the Shama’a Network was established as a national network to eliminate violence against women. In recent years, the Shama’a Network contributed to raise awareness on violence against women and its devastating consequences, which not only harm the survivor's personal life but also the safety of families and community. The Shama’a Network is a way to unite the efforts of many individuals and organizations working at the local level to combat violence against women.

Title: UNICEF highlights the climate crisis on World Children’s Day
Content: 20 November 2021
Children and young people all over the country are joining their peers worldwide to speak out on the issues affecting their lives, from climate change and inequality, to mental health and education disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and calling on adults to build back a better world, especially for the most vulnerable children.
“The climate crisis and water scarcity pose an unprecedented threat to the rights of all children and youth in Jordan. This World Children’s Day they are delivering a clear message to adults – we must act with urgency to protect their futures, said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan
For World Children’s Day, UNICEF also unveiled the Big Changes Start Small mural in Amman focusing on water scarcity in Jordan. The mural created by young artist Batool Edais, aims to inspire children and youth to hold adults accountable for creating a safe and sustainable future and take an active role in creating and implementing the solutions needed to solve the climate crisis.
Also, to mark the day, events and festivities took place across the country with children and youth in UNICEF-supported Makani centers, while the iconic heritage site Petra joined UNICEF’s global Go Blue campaign in support of child rights.

Title: His Royal Highness Prince Charles visits refugees in Jordan
Content: 17 November 2021
As part of his visit, Prince Charles met with members of Nuzha’s Community Support Committee (CSC) who act as an important bridge between communities and UNHCR.
Luai vividly remembers the moment when armed militias entered the hospital where he was working in Mosul, Iraq and issued an ultimatum that they had two weeks to leave otherwise they would be killed. As a member of Iraq’s Christian population, Luai did not hesitate. Within ten days his family had packed up everything they could fit into their small car and fled in Jordan.
It was 2015. Six years later, Luai, his wife Rana and three children still live in the two-room apartment they first rented in East Amman. Their perspectives to return home are dim.
“We are tired psychologically,” says Rana. “Often I can’t bear to think more than an hour ahead in time. Life is hard.”
Luai, Rana and their three children are pictured at Al Nuzha Community Centre in Jordan
Although the family have slowly got used to life in Jordan, their children are enrolled at the local church school and they have made friends with their neighbors, day to day expenses remain a challenge. Although Luai was a nurse back in Iraq, non-Syrian refugees are not allowed to work in Jordan, leaving them completely dependent on humanitarian assistance.
As a result, Luai and Rana are just one of the 33,000 vulnerable refugee families who receive cash assistance from UNHCR Jordan every month. Supported by donors such as the UK, the family got the chance to meet with His Royal Highness, Prince Charles, during his recent visit to Al Nuzha Community Centre in Amman, Jordan.
Established in 2018, Al Nuzha Community Centre was one of the first community centers in Jordan to provide a place to gather and exchange s for both Jordanians and refugees of different nationalities. Managed by UNHCR and the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Development (JOHUD), the centre aims to promote peaceful coexistence between refugees and host communities.
As part of his visit, Prince Charles met with members of Nuzha’s Community Support Committee (CSC) who act as an important bridge between communities and UNHCR, reporting challenges that refugees are facing in Jordan as well as advocating on their behalf for increased services, work opportunities and designing educational activities for all ages.
Amitab, an Iraqi refugee and member of UNHCR’s Community Support Committee, speaks to HRH Prince Charles
“Every day we have refugees come to us in the community centre, or contact us via WhatsApp or Facebook to ask for help. We try to guide refugees to where they can find support or refer them to UNHCR if they need urgent protection services.” Amitab, an Iraqi refugee and member of Nuzha’s CSC, explained to Prince Charles.
More recently members of the committee have taken on a role in allaying refugee fears or misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine, to boost the vaccination rate among refugees in Jordan.
“It was a pleasure to welcome HRH the Prince of Wales to our community centre today – said Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Representative in Jordan. We count on the UK to maintain its support to Jordan, which continues to generously host over 750,000 refugees.”
Since 2019, the UK has provided approximately $33 million towards UNHCR’s cash assistance program in Jordan, providing a lifeline to the most vulnerable refugees in the Kingdom.

Title: Launch of the Final Round of COVID-19 Youth Volunteers’ Taskforce
Content: 16 November 2021

In continuity of the efforts to build the capacities of the COVID-19 Youth Volunteers’ Taskforce functioning as part of the national initiative launched by the Ministry of Interior (MoI) in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Jordan, and with the support of the Government of Norway, 60 young men and women from the governorates of Aqaba, Tafilah and Ma’an participated in the Fourth and final round of the Training programme of the Youth Taskforce at the Crowne Plaza Dead Sea Hotel. The Youth Volunteers’ Taskforce will work within their local communities to raise awareness on COVID-19 preventive measures, and support boosting the vaccination rates. Governor Mohammad Al-Sarhan, director of the Local Development Directorate at the Ministry of Interior, delivered welcoming remarks thanking UNDP and the Government of the Kingdom of Norway for supporting this initiative. Al-Sarhan lauded the efforts and partnership with the Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship MoDEE, Dar Abu Abdullah and the Royal Health Awareness Society. He then briefed the youth on the plans of MoI to prepare the Youth Taskforce for work in the field.
Mr. Baker al-Hiyari, Senior Programmes Specialist at the Governance and Peace Pillar at UNDPs Jordan Country Office, elaborated that UNDP in cooperation with MoI implemented many projects that supported decentralization and local and economic development, and that the youth are the most negatively affected from the COVID-19 pandemic. “All our projects support decentralization, and as youth are the majority in your communities, it was important that you lead and implement such initiatives. These new challenges require fresh energies.”  He added that the local governments and health organizations were the first respondent institutions in the fight against COVID-19. With the support of the Norwegian Government, UNDP was able to support those institutions and strengthen their resilience against COVID-19 as part of the Network of Local Governments project, and this initiative is an essential part to reach our goals and achieve our shared vision of a safe and prosperous Jordan.
UNDP supports programmes and policies that promote the civic and political participation of young people and qualify them to be partners in decision-making at the national and local levels.
Mr. al-Hiyari introduced the participants to the network of Local Governments project that aims to promote transparency and accountability, enhance community outreach at the local level and link decision makers with youth and local communities.
The training programme introduced COVID-19 preventive measures and vaccinations, and trained the participants on Sanad Application, communication skills and how to deal with resistance to vaccination and safety measures in local communities. The trained 240 young men and women from all over Jordan, will support the MoI Inspection Teams in the field as they raise the awareness of public and private and advise establishments and individuals on the relevance of the COVID-19 vaccination and its direct link to the recovery of the economy and safe functioning of all sectors of the economy.

Title: UNHCR distributes winter cash assistance to refugees in Jordan
Content: 10 November 2021
As winter approaches, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency in Jordan, has started the process of distributing one-off winter cash assistance for refugees across the country.
Over 76,000 refugee families (approximately 290,000 individuals) from a variety of nationalities – including Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan and others – have already received winter cash assistance throughout the last couple of weeks.  Further distributions are subsequently planned to cover all the 23,000 refugee families living in Za’atari and Azraq refugee camps over the coming weeks.
In total, UNHCR aims to support almost 100,000 refugee families in Jordan over the course of this winter, distributing approximately USD 35 million of funding to the most vulnerable refugee families. This has been possible thanks to flexible funding support from donors such as Germany, the United States, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Japan. The 2021-2022 UNHCR Winter regional appeal can be accessed here.
The distribution of winter cash assistance early in the cold season is instrumental in helping refugees prepare for winter. Last year, 90 percent of refugees who received assistance said that it helped them to improve their living conditions and reduce stress. UNHCR estimates that 46 percent of refugees in Jordan need winter assistance this year.
The majority of refugees receiving winter cash assistance tend to spend their money on rent and food. In addition, in 2020, 32 percent of refugees reported they spent the money on heating and fuel and 30 percent on utilities and bills. UNHCR expects refugees to spend their assistance in similar ways this year.
“The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased needs of refugees during winter is a potentially disastrous combination. Winter assistance this year is more crucial than ever as a protection tool to help the poorest refugees keep a roof over their heads and their families safe from the cold,” commented UNHCR Deputy Representative, Carolyn Ennis.
After receiving an SMS alerting them that their cash assistance is ready, refugees living in towns and cities will be able to collect their money at Cairo-Amman Bank ATM’s using UNHCR’s fraud-proof biometric iris-scanning system. The cash is intended to cover refugee needs throughout the coldest months of winter. The amount of money that refugees receive is determined based on their family size and varies from USD 263 for a single person to USD 564 for a family of 7.
UNHCR’s winter cash assistance is distributed to refugee families who are eligible under UNHCR’s vulnerability criteria. Special attention is given to female-headed households, the elderly, people with medical needs as well as survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.

Title: UNICEF study unveils the social and economic aspirations of young people in Jordan
Content: 09 November 2021
The nationally representative study reveals that from 2020 to 2021, while Jordan’s youth population is increasingly educated their transition to adulthood is not meeting their aspirations. The jobs that young people aspire to have are unattainable, leading to a challenging transition from school-to-work and delays in financial independence, marriage, and starting their own families.
“This critical phase of adolescence and young adulthood will shape the future of a generation and even the country. UNICEF will continue to work with the government of Jordan to engage all of Jordan’s vulnerable adolescent and young people in activities that will facilitate their social and economic engagement, with particular focus on young women.” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
“Youth economic empowerment is a national priority that requires joint efforts from all sectors,” Said Mohammad Nabulsi, Minister of Youth, “The Ministry of Youth  has developed training programmes to enhance youth capabilities and entrepreneurial skills,  launched national leadership forums, localized youth initiatives in youth centers, sparing no effort in supporting young entrepreneurs, channeling their energies, and promoting their economic and social participation.”
The study, implemented by Saint Catherine University, generates evidence-based recommendations for policies and programmes. In addition to introducing young people to the benefits of different educational choices to help them achieve their aspirations, the study stresses the importance of stimulating labour demand, creating women-friendly workplaces and opening a greater variety of employment sectors to Syrians.
This study is part of the evidence generation pillar of UNICEF’s Learning to Earning programme that aims to empower vulnerable youth in Jordan through formal and self-employment interventions, as well as digital skills and career counseling.
This intervention has been generously funded by the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States.

Title: UN-Habitat launches new regional project to increase the resilience of displaced persons and host communities in Jordan & Lebanon
Content: 01 November 2021
The United Nations Human Settlements Programme’s (UN- Habitat) Regional Office for Arab States, Jordan Country Programme and Lebanon Country Programme together with the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Water and Irrigation in Jordan, and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (UN ESCWA) launched a regional project titled, “Increasing the resilience of both displaced persons and host communities to climate change related water challenges in Jordan & Lebanon”.
The project of nearly USD 14 million, is funded by the Adaptation Fund and will run for four years. It is implemented in partnership with the governments of Jordan and Lebanon, through their Ministries of Environment as well as other national and local authorities, UN agencies, local NGOs, research institutes, universities, CBOs and private sector.
"Jordan suffers numerous challenges as a result of climate change, many of which relate to the lack of water, as it is ranked the second most water scarce country in the world - The Adaptation Fund project is in-line with the plans and strategies being implemented by the Ministries of Environment and Water and Irrigation in Jordan." said Dr. Mohammed Al Khashashneh, Secretary General of the Ministry of Environment in Jordan
"The sustainable water management approach adopted in this project is very important in reducing demand on unsustainable water sources, and we seek to replicate the pioneering adaptation interventions in other regions across the Kingdom later on, through one of the most important components of the project 'knowledge management'. The Ministry is willing to work hand in hand with UN-Habitat, provide the necessary guidance and support, to ensure this project a success. " he added.
In Jordan, the cities of Irbid and Mafraq were selected as the project’s target location due to recurrent droughts, extreme heat and a shift in rainfall patterns have recently become major concerns for these areas. Over the past ten years, both cities witnessed a significant influx of refugees. This has placed additional pressure on pre-existing water scarcity and under-developed water and wastewater infrastructure networks.
“UN-Habitat works to support cities and urban areas to adapt by building resilience and reducing the impact of climate change, creating new economic opportunities and improving the ability to live in safe and just environments,” said Dr. Erfan Ali, Regional Representative of Arab States, UN-Habitat
The launch of this project comes after an inception workshop, with the participation of Jordan and Lebanon’s Ministers of Environment, who will chair respective national project steering committees, with other key stakeholders, in order to outline and endorse the project’s work-plan and implementation process.
“We need to take bolder steps to confront the challenge of climate change and focus on the importance of resilience and adaptation - what the Secretary-General called the forgotten half of the climate change equation without which we have no hope of achieving our common climate goals,” said Dr. Mounir Thabet, Deputy Executive Secretary, UN ESCWA
"The priority adaptation measures in Jordan were selected based on long consultations with national and local governmental entities, key stakeholders and local communities including refugees, they include rainwater harvesting, greywater treatment and reuse systems, upgrading of Al-Maerad, Al-Akaider and Mafraq wastewater treatment plants, efficient irrigation of treated wastewater and a permaculture demonstration site at the Jordan University of Science and Technology campus." said Deema Abu-Thiab, National Programme Coordinator of UN- Habitat Jordan.
"Executing partners with extensive experience in the field of water management in Jordan were selected and will play a huge role in ensuring the sustainability of the project after its implementation, and replication of interventions across the kingdom." she added.
The aim of this project will be achieved through four components: manage urban risks and vulnerabilities, improve awareness, ownership, and capacities to respond to climate change, expand unconventional water harvesting and supply options, using innovative and replicable techniques and improving knowledge and policies and regulations to increase urban resilience in the region.

Title: Jordan Media Institute concludes project on Awareness and Capacity Building for Gender-Sensitive Reporting
Content: 27 October 2021

The Jordan Media Institute (JMI) concluded a project aimed at raising awareness and promote joint advocacy on gender-sensitive reporting on women in the workforce with the goal to foster an enabling narrative in the media for women in the labor market, shedding light on their expertise and vital contribution to Jordan’s economy.
Implemented in partnership with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), the project focused on strengthening media and information literacy through gender-sensitive lens, while building the capacities of journalists and media professionals to produce gender-sensitive media content and to report on gender-based violence cases.
“The media plays a critical role in addressing and guiding the public perception on supportive workplaces that nurtures professionalism in lieu of traditional stereotypical gendering of qualifications,” said Dr. Mustafa Hamarneh, Chief Executive Officer of JMI.
“The training was critical in promoting a greater sense of awareness in the narratives that foster an environment conducive to the empowerment of women as productive members of Jordan’s labor market” he added.
Through a comprehensive five-day training workshops on “Capacity Building for Gender Equality in the Media”, 65 journalists and media professionals, who were selected from a pool of applicants, were trained on how to apply gender-sensitive reporting tools and techniques to create media content that empowers women and promotes gender-equality in the workplace, with a particular focus on mainstreaming gender-responsive language.
"The partnership between the JMI and UN Women is fundamental to promote more gender responsive reporting on the role and impact of women in the public discourse. In this sense, the workshops organized by the Jordan Media Institute and UN Women are remarkable. They are taking into account the importance of the journalist role when report news regarding women and how it needs to be reported in a gender-sensitive way to create a new narrative. We are sure that the guidebook for journalists that launched by the JMI will have a relevant impact on the topic.” said Eleonora Banfi on behalf of AICS.
The trainings were followed by online conversations delivered by four guest speakers who shared their experiences and recommendations on gender-sensitive reporting in their professional experiences. The speakers included the Director-General of the Jordan News Agency (Petra), Faiq Al-Hijazin; former Amnesty International Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), former Agence France Presse (AFP) bureau Chief for MENA, and JMI board member, Randa Habib; former minister of state for media affairs and communication, Dr. Mohammad Al Momani; and Jordanian journalist and human rights activist, Rana Husseini. To further create awareness, recordings of the presentations and discussions were shared on JMI’s YouTube channel and social media platforms.
“UN Women recognizes the significant role media plays in advancing women’s economic empowerment. Through their work, they can shed light on women’s equal contribution to Jordan’s labor market and economic growth” said Hazar Asfoura on behalf of UN Women.
During the event partners launched a digital guidebook to support journalists and media professionals in covering gender-sensitive issues and gender-based violence, which is going to be available on JMI’s platforms. The guidebook includes tutorial videos, case study clippings, useful social and legislative information pertaining to gender sensitive reporting, and guidelines on covering related issues, such as the empowerment of women in the workplace through media coverage.

Title: UN Day marked with call for climate risk-resilient Jordan
Content: 24 October 2021
A major decline in precipitation and a rise in extreme weather events are harming both water and food security in Middle East and North Africa, including Jordan, which are among the world’s most water-stressed and climate-vulnerable regions, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Anders Pedersen said on Sunday.
Delivering a speech on the occasion of UN Day, which was hosted by Al Balqa Applied University, RC Pedersen said that the UN has been collaborating effectively to support the Ministry of Environment to advance climate action in the Kingdom.
Pedersen added that this “collaborative spirit” has resulted in the development of the National Climate Change Policy 2021-2050 under the leadership of the United Nations Development Programme and with valuable contribution from UNICEF, WFP, UN-Habitat and UN Environment.
The UN official noted that the policy aims to achieve a pro-active, climate risk-resilient Jordan, to achieve a low carbon but growing economy, with healthy, sustainable, resilient communities, sustainable water and agricultural resources, and thriving and productive ecosystems in the path towards sustainable development.
“The UN, led by FAO and FAO has supported national efforts in developing the national food security strategy action plan, a sector that will be hugely impacted by the climate change if no proper preparedness plans are in place,” he added.
Pedersen said that this year, “while we are marking the Day, we are focusing on Action for Climate, as UN Secretary General announced 2021 as a ‘crucial year’ for climate change.”
“In a statement early this year, the UN Secretary General stressed that by COP26 [which is taking place next month] at the latest, all countries need to come forward with significantly more ambitious nationally determined contributions, with 2030 targets consistent with a net zero pathway,” the UN coordinator noted.
Since 1948, October 24 has been celebrated as United Nations Day marking the ratification of the UN Charter in 1945, by the majority of signatories, including the five permanent members of the Security Council, according to the statement.
Also speaking during the ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Local Administration Tawfiq Kreishan said that Jordan has realised achievements in adopting partnership frameworks between the public and private sectors in dealing with climate change.
Secretary General of the Environment Ministry Mohammed Khashashneh announced the completion of the update of the “National Policy for Climate Change” that will be referred to the Cabinet for accreditation before embarking on implementing its recommendations.
In this regard, Khashashneh noted that this policy covered a timespan ranging between 2022 and 2050, and provides “a clear vision” to deal with climate change until 2050.
Water Ministry Secretary General Jihad Mahamid warned against the impacts of climate change on water resources in the Kingdom. He expects precipitation to decline by 13.6 per cent or 12.9 millimetres for each year by 2035.
President of Al Balqa Applied University Abdullah Zu’bi talked about the initiatives that the university launched and implemented to contribute to realising the Sustainable Development Goals.

Title: UNICEF and Dar Abu Abdallah launch women center to counter the economic impacts of COVID19
Content: 18 October 2021
The center, located in the Za’atari district, will employ more than 70 Jordanians and Syrian refugees and provide them with capacity building courses in new and transferable skills, including financial literacy and leadership courses.
The workshop at the women’s center will establish a viable production line, with a wide range of products, including 150,000 Non-Medical masks to support the national COVID-19 prevention response, and a variety of other garments. The production line will be accompanied with marketing campaigns designed to promote and market the products of the workshop.
“Only 15 per cent of women participate in the labor force in Jordan, compared to 67 per cent of men, and COVID-19 is further widening the gender gap in labor force participation.” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
“This partnership aims to create ademand driven economic engagement opportunities, that will empower women and youth contributing to their financial inclusion and build a better post-COVID-19 world”.
“Our mission is to empower the most vulnerable communities through programmes that sustain their livelihoods and improve the well-being of their families. Leading to breaking out of the cycle of poverty,” said Samer Balkar, Director General, Dar Abu Abdullah, “
“Through our partnership with UNICEF during the previous years, we provided the most vulnerable families with training and access to short term employment opportunities. Today, this center will contribute to providing those families with a stable source of income and sustainable job opportunities.”
To meet international export standards, the center is established based on the European and World Bank Standards in areas of Human Resources, Social Impact and Environment. Employees choose to work full shift, half shifts or get paid per piece depending on their personal needs. The center will also allow working from home for an additional number of women.
UNICEF and Dar Abu Abdullah partnership aims to facilitate access to self-employment opportunities and increase food security for most vulnerable households, through the establishment of 50 green rooftops. Connecting households with green rooftops with private sector buyers, to ensure these households receive monthly financial income.
Furthermore, it improves the sustainability of local community-based organizations, with the establishment of small projects and the creation of linkages with the market. In addition to helping vulnerable adolescents and youth in their smooth transition into active and productive adult life through the leadership programmes.
This partnership is part of the Amaluna UNICEF programme that has been supporting 3,500 vulnerable youth across Jordan with market-driven and accredited skills for meaningful employment opportunities. The programme has achieved a 70 per cent employment rate and supported the establishment of 274 women and youth-led social enterprises.

Title: Belgian Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities Policy visits Baqa’a Palestine refugee camp in Jordan
Content: 03 October 2021
The Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities Policy H.E. Ms. Meryame Kitir visited the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) installations in Baqa’a camp. H.E. Kitir was accompanied by the Ambassador of Belgium to Jordan H.E Mr. Filip Vanden Bulcke, Chief of Staff of the Minister Ms. Anke van Lancker, the Diplomatic Advisor of the Minister Mr. Bart De Wolf, Director and Deputy Director of UNRWA Affairs in Jordan, Ms. Marta Lorenzo and UNRWA staff.
While at the UNRWA Camp Improvement Committee office, H.E. Ms. Kitir was briefed on progress made by the government-led equitable COVID-19 vaccination campaign currently being implemented in three UNRWA health centres, including Baqa’a, Zarqa and Irbid.
During the visit at the UNRWA Baqa’a Girls’ School, the delegation was briefed about the state of the Palestine refugee population in Jordan and recent developments in UNRWA operations across the Middle East. Special attention was paid to the vulnerabilities faced by ex-Gazan refugees and Palestine refugees from Syria. In addition, the Agency’s adaptation of operations to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, as well as the Agency’s priorities to better address the needs of Palestine refugees, were highlighted - with a focus on the Education in Emergencies (EiE) programme which UNRWA adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that Palestine refugee children can continue benefit from their right to quality, safe and inclusive education amidst crisis and conflict. The Kingdom of Belgium has offered vital support to the UNRWA EiE Programme since 2016.
At the UNRWA Baqa’a Health Centre, the delegation had the opportunity to witness firsthand the UNRWA response to COVID-19 and was briefed on how the Agency’s Health Programme ensures service continuity and abides by protective measures through investing in digitization. This includes smart phone applications and telemedicine services to ensure that refugees receive quality health care safely, avoiding gatherings and overcrowding.
“I am very impressed by what the many staff members of UNRWA manage to achieve here every day. They have done a great deal to enable young people to continue to benefit from education despite the coronavirus. With their efforts to vaccinate people inside the camp, they make a huge difference in the fight against this pandemic,” said Minister of Development Cooperation Meryame Kitir.
Ms. Marta Lorenzo, Director of UNRWA Affairs in Jordan, remarked: "We were delighted to have H.E. Ms. Meryame Kitir visit Baqa’a Camp today. The Kingdom of Belgium has always been a strong supporter to the Agency by contributing to the education, health and social services to help empower Palestine refugees and advocate for their wellbeing and dignity."
At the end of her visit to Baqa’a camp, H.E Ms. Meryame Kitir met UNRWA Commissioner-General Mr. Philippe Lazzarini, who thanked her for Belgium’s strong commitment and support to UNRWA operations. The two sides discussed ways to further enhance the cooperation between Belgium and UNRWA, and strategies to ensure effective continued support to provide vital health, education, and relief services to Palestine refugees.
Belgium is amongst the Agency’s most reliable and committed partners, supporting the Agency for decades - including as a member of the UNRWA Advisory Commission since 1953. In 2020, Belgium was the Agency’s 17th largest donor, contributing EUR 11.25 million (including EUR 6.25 million to the UNRWA Program Budget, EUR 2.3 million to the Syria Regional Emergency Appeal and EUR 2.7 million for projects).

Title: Design as a Response to Local Challenges: Design Platform launched in Jordan
Content: 29 September 2021
Jordan, United Nation Development Programme (UNDP), the Crown Prince Foundation (CPF) and Empowering through™ launched today the Design Jordan digital platform at TechWorks.
Design Jordan is a digital platform that features stories and design work of 42 designers across Jordan and 19 articles by experts from different fields of design, sharing insights and tools for designers to enhance their skills, become self-employed and scale their impact. The concept behind the platform came as the pandemic changed the world and changed us. The challenge of producing another coffee-table book in the pandemic led to the journey of reimagining our approach to showcasing the beauty of design in Jordan through a digital platform.
UNDP Resident Representative Sara Ferrer Olivella stated, “Growing global concerns about climate change, economic and social problems related to work circumstances, poverty, equity and equality makes it imperative to adopt an approach of sustainable consumption and production, an area that was highlighted in Agenda 2030 as one of the 17 sustainable development goals. Therefore, sustainable design becomes an important area through which designers can take these social, economic and environmental concerns as a key element in their products' innovation and development strategies”.
Design Jordan platform is a step towards presenting examples of how ‘design’ led by youth has the potential to improve efficiencies, produce quality and marketable opportunities (local and international) and at the same time improve environmental sustainability by providing better and innovative solutions to local challenges .The partnerships supporting this platform are all working towards providing youth with the necessary skills, capacities and opportunities and working with various stakeholders with the purpose of creating employment opportunities for young men and women in Jordan.
Dr. Tamam Mango, CEO of the Crown Prince Foundation said: “The Crown Prince Foundation has been interested in digital fabrication and 3D printing to support innovation. This interest prompted the launch of TechWorks, our digital fabrication lab.” She also added: “Design is the cornerstone of the digital fabrication process. From our daily interactions with youth across Jordan, we noticed that the most prominent challenge faced by aspiring young "makers" is how to transform their ideas into implementable and feasible designs. This is exactly the kind of support that the technical team at TechWorks is always keen on providing.” Tamam explained: “We are very pleased to host the launch of the design platform at TechWorks today.”
The partners of this platform include: Wavato, Jabal Amman Publishers, The Outfit, Amman Design Week, Jordan Fashion Week, Jordan River Designs, Design Institute Amman, Dezain, Silsal, Waragami, Design Battlefield, Kama, H2 Interiors, Dimitris, Kheit, The Italian Embassy in Jordan, Chamber Gyld, Maysalward, Interior ph, Pioneers, SADDA, Mad Hook, The Jordan Ministry of Youth, Studio Be, Design Ideas Studio, Orient Spirit, Amman Arab University, Souq Fann, Forsa, Antwork, Shams El Balad, Musab Accessories, All Jordan Youth Commission.
“We are grateful to our partners and contributors and are thrilled to shed light on stories of our inspirational individuals with the world,” said Empowering through™ co-founders Dina Saoudi, Abdul Majeed Shoman Jr, and Danish Farhan.
Empowering through is a new breed of social enterprise founded by Seven Circles and Xische Ventures with the purpose of empowering ecosystems to enable individuals economically and socially. Since 2017, we have been creating an impact in more than 10 countries with a portion of our proceeds committed to giving back.

Title: German funding helps WFP avert food assistance cuts to refugees in Jordan
Content: 29 September 2021
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) on Wednesday welcomed a timely and generous top-up contribution of €17 million (US$20 million) from the Federal Republic of Germany that will help avert planned cuts in food assistance for 110,000 refugees in October.
The German Ambassador in Jordan Bernhard Kampmann announced the contribution at a joint press conference today, reaffirming his country’s commitment to supporting the Government of Jordan and WFP in addressing the food needs of around half a million refugees in Jordan.
“We are glad that the increase of our funding is coming just in time to avoid the impending cuts in food assistance. In times of growing needs, vulnerable refugee families need continued support,” Ambassador Kampmann said. “We are a strong supporter of WFP worldwide and here in Jordan, where the organization plays a key role in providing for Syrian refugees living in camps and urban areas. We are very grateful for the great work WFP is doing in collaboration with the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the local host communities.”
The funds, provided by Germany’s Federal Foreign Office, will enable WFP to continue supporting vulnerable refugees from Syria and other countries living in camps and communities across the Kingdom to meet their food and nutritional needs until the end of the year.
“This contribution could not have come at a better time as WFP had been faced with the unavoidable and very hard choice of having to implement cuts to its assistance in only a couple days from now,” said Representative and Country Director to WFP in Jordan, Alberto Correia Mendes. “WFP is grateful for the continuous support of the people and Government of Germany to the refugee response in Jordan, especially at a time when refugees have been pushed deeper into poverty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse economic effects.”
Thanks to Germany’s contribution, WFP can continue to meet the immediate food needs of vulnerable refugees, especially female-headed families and families with disabilities.
WFP had already been forced to stop food assistance to 21,000 vulnerable refugees in July due to a lack of funds.
In 2021, Germany is the single largest donor to WFP in Jordan contributing a total of €72.5 million (US$86.8 million) in support of WFP’s refugee response in the country. This includes this most recent top-up of humanitarian funding and a contribution of €5.5 million (US$6.4 million) provided through the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in support WFP’s school feeding, livelihoods, and social protection programmes in 2021.
The contribution is part of Germany’s global humanitarian efforts, providing more than US$2.75 billion dollar in 2021 to alleviate suffering and assist people in need. Germany is the world’s second largest donor state for humanitarian assistance.

Title: UN Secretary-General calls for accelerated action on jobs and social protection to avoid an uneven global recovery and prevent future crises
Content: 27 September 2021
Deeply diverging recoveries will undermine trust and solidarity and make the world more vulnerable to future crises, including climate change.
Investing in job-rich growth, social protection and a just transition to a net-zero emissions future, particularly in low -and middle-income countries, could prevent a further deepening of the inequalities between developed and developing economies that have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, said UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, in a policy brief issued today.
At least US$982 billion in fiscal stimulus measures is needed to respond to the immediate labour market shocks of the crisis and to support a just transition, as well as US$ 1.2 trillion annually for social protection floors in low- and middle-income countries. No advanced economy has achieved economic and social progress without investing in social protection systems and quality public services that provide people with the necessary support to navigate the vicissitudes of their lives.
While the wealth of billionaires increased by over US$ 3.9 trillion between March and December 2020, the impact of the pandemic on the world of work, among other factors, increased the number of extremely poor by between 119 and 224 million people—the first increase in poverty in over 21 years.
The Secretary-General’s brief calls for urgent investments in a job-rich, sustainable and socially inclusive recovery. The public and private sectors should leverage finance to significantly ramp up such investments to get the world back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and to address ever increasing risks from climate change and environmental degradation that could jeopardize  1.2 billion jobs—equivalent to 40 percent of the global labour force.
A human-centred recovery from the pandemic needs employment and social protection policies to work in tandem, not only to improve people’s living standards, but also to help them navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing world of work and the transition towards the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Accelerating job creation
To achieve a job-rich recovery and a just transition to a sustainable and inclusive economy, the Secretary-General is calling for a Global Accelerator for Jobs and Social Protection that would create at least 400 million jobs and extend social protection to 4 billion women, men and children currently without coverage.
To achieve this Goal, the Policy Brief entitled “Investing in Jobs and Social Protection for Poverty Eradication and a Sustainable Recovery” recommends several actions:
High-level Event on Jobs and Social Protection for Poverty Eradication
The UN Secretary-General will present the brief at a virtual high-level meeting at the UN on 28 September 2021, 09.00 -12.00 ET (15.00-18.00 CEST). The meeting is convened jointly with the ILO.
Leaders from countries, along with the heads of major international organizations, multilateral banks and finance institutions, civil society, private sector and academia will discuss pathways
The High-Level Meeting on Jobs and Social Protection for Poverty Eradication will feature the UN Secretary-General delivering opening remarks, followed by Jamaican Prime Minister Mr. Andrew Holness as co-convener of the Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond Initiative (FfDI), and Mr. Guy Ryder, Director-General, International Labour Organization. After, a moderated discussion will take place with Heads of the International Financial Institutions, Heads of States and Government and international organizations.
The Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed will provide closing remarks.
The meeting is being organized under the aegis of the Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond Initiative (FfDI) with the support of ILO.

Title: Policy Brief: Food availability, accessibility and adequacy key to achieve sustainable food systems in Jordan
Content: 23 September 2021
UN Jordan releases “Healthy Diet for all in Jordan” policy brief in in conjunction with the Global Food Summit.
The United Nations on Thursday released a policy brief, recommending Jordan to adopt specific key policies to ensure that its transitioning towards sustainable food systems, delivers healthy diets for all.
According to the policy brief, titled “Healthy Diet for all in Jordan”, Jordan has ratified the UN Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, adopted a National Strategy for School Health 2018-2022 and the National Food Security Strategy 2021-2030, and will be developing a national nutrition strategy soon.
The UN cited results from the Global Nutrition Report for the year 2020, which showed that Jordan suffers from a double burden of micronutrient deficiencies and overweight/obesity, with women presenting the worst rates in both, pointing to a serious gender gap in nutrition.
Eighty four percent of adult Jordanians and Syrians (18-69 years old) consume unhealthy diets (less than the WHO recommended daily intake of fruit or vegetables). Anemia is prevalent among children and women of reproductive age at 34%, and breastfeeding rates are low with 25.4% of infants aged (0-5) months exclusively breastfed
For the food systems to deliver safe, sustainable, healthy and affordable food, the United Nations recommends Jordan to ensure:
To achieve these recommendations, Jordan could consider:
The launch of the policy brief coincides with the United Nations Global Food Summit that takes place on 23 September in New York. The Summit aims at maximising the co-benefits of a food systems approach across the entire 2030 Agenda and meeting the challenges of climate change. It also provides a platform for ambitious new actions, innovative solutions, and plans to transform food systems and leverage these shifts to deliver progress across all of the SDGs.
Ahead of the summit, the Ministry of Agriculture in Jordan in collaboration with the United Nations conducted national consultations with the concerned stakeholders and submitted a report on results of the consultations to the summit.

Title: National stakeholder consultative workshop on value chain upgrading strategies by UNIDO
Content: 05 September 2021
This workshop will pave the way for a forthcoming international event involving international technical and development partners along with the national stakeholders, where high-level discussions will be held about increasing the capacities of relevant national actors to advance Jordanian industry.
As part of the LevelUP – Advancing Jordanian Industries project, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), in collaboration with the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Supplies (MITS) and with the support of the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), has conducted a National Stakeholder Consultative Workshop on 30th & 31st August in regard to Value Chain Upgrading Strategies for three value chains in Jordan, namely: Garment and Fashion, Food Supplements, and Natural Cosmetics.
The workshop was conducted following the completion of comprehensive analysis conducted earlier by UNIDO in cooperation with the MITS to identify the major constraints, growth bottlenecks, and untapped development opportunities, focusing on enhancing the economic inclusion of women and youth for the selected value chains. Based on the findings of the analysis, draft upgrading strategies and related action plans have been formulated.
The consultative workshop served as a platform to facilitate collaboration and foster a stakeholder-based approach to draft action plans necessary to upgrade the selected value chains, bringing together decision-level representatives of key national stakeholders.
The workshop assisted to reach a consensus on the interventions required to develop the target value chains for increased women and youth inclusiveness, including priority policy and institutional recommendations, specific interventions at the enterprise level and the necessary advocacy efforts for implementation in Jordan.
The director of Economic Policy Directorate at the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Supply, Mr. Ahmed Hammad, praised the efforts of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in implementing the project and the support provided by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation. Mr. Hammad added that this workshop promotes stakeholder-based approach to formulate action plans needed to advance the selected value chains.
The representative of the UNIDO in Jordan, Mrs. Sulafa Madanat, said in her opening remarks
“A comprehensive analysis of three value chains was conducted in Jordan to identify the main constraints, growth bottlenecks, and untapped development opportunities, with a particular focus on promoting the economic inclusion of women and youth,”
Mrs. Madanat further mentioned that the workshop is one of the outputs of the project, which aims at creating decent job opportunities for women and youth – including through self-employment, – and supporting the inclusive and sustainable industrial development of the country in line with the Jordan 2025 Economic Development Plan.
This workshop will pave the way for a forthcoming international event involving international technical and development partners along with the national stakeholders, where high-level discussions will be held about increasing the capacities of relevant national actors to advance Jordanian industry.

Title: FAO and WFP supports national efforts in developing the national food security strategy action plan
Content: 05 September 2021
The National Committee for Food Security, supported by the Ministry of Agriculture in cooperation with United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Programme (WFP), successfully concluded a 2-day workshop to discuss and endorse the National Food Security Strategy action plan.
This action plan is based on five main areas covering the availability, access, utilization, stability, in addition to the governance of food security.
The workshop was held under the patronage of H.E. Eng. Khaled Hunaifat, Minister of Agriculture, and attended by a group of high-level partners and stakeholders in Jordan including public and private sectors, civil societies, donors and UN organizations.
This workshop is the next step in the development of Jordan’s national food security strategy and building the action plan in a participative and cooperative approach, involving all concerned institutions and stakeholders.
The National Food Security Strategy was initially approved by the National Committee for Food Security on May 2021, and will enable Jordan to develop and implement regulatory and policy frameworks that will facilitate growth and prosperity while enhancing Jordan’s role as a center for peace and stability in the region.
H.E Engineer Khaled Hunaifat, Minister of Agriculture in Jordan, said that
“This workshop is the culmination of the hard work of the different task forces that have addressed all components of the strategy and the executive plan. These committees have involved all relevant stakeholders and held more than forty meetings during the preparation period of the plan; today’s workshop is the conclusion of this process."
"I would like to thank all organizations that have been involved, as well as the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations who have provided advice and technical and logistical support throughout the preparation of the strategy and the action plan.” He added.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) Representative in Jordan, Nabil Assaf
“FAO is committed to provide the needed support to Jordan through transformation to more efficient inclusive resilient and sustainable agri-food systems for better production, better environment, better nutrition, and a better life, Leaving no one behind”.
He confirmed that availability, access, utilization and stability of food are the four pillars for food security where FAO provides its support to the Government”. He stressed that FAO accompanies the Government of Jordan in embodying the vision of His Majesty the King that the issue of food security receives special attention and priority in Jordan, where His Majesty focused on several topics that call for reflection and in-depth consideration of them and taking appropriate measures”
“At this time of global change, it is essential to ensure access to safe, stable, affordable, and nutritious supply of food for everyone in Jordan at all times and WFP is committed to support the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on the National Food Security Strategy, working with the Royal Court and the Government, particularly the Ministry of Agriculture as well as other partners to reach this goal,”
Said Alberto Correia Mendes, Representative and Country Director for WFP in Jordan. “The strategy to enhance national food systems aligns with both the global sustainable development goal of achieving zero hunger and WFP's core mandate.” Mendes added.
The COVID-19 pandemic came at a time when food systems were already under strain from natural disasters such as floods and prolonged periods of drought, climate change, and other shocks.
It has revealed extreme inequities and inefficiencies in the food system which depends on thousands of food producers and processors, many of whom have very low incomes as well as the problems for the more vulnerable people in Jordan to afford decent food. All aspects of food security are therefore crucial to Jordan given they are essential to human dignity and national security.

Title: Refugee Medics contribute to Jordanian COVID-19 Response
Content: 04 September 2021
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is delighted to announce that six refugee medical specialists, including some trained as surgeons, anesthesiologists and general doctors have started working in hospitals and clinics across Jordan as United Nations Volunteers.
The employment of these health professionals marks a major step forward in creating additional livelihood opportunities for refugees in Jordan and follows months of discussions between the Ministry of Health and UNHCR about how refugees can contribute to stopping the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“This is a great opportunity and at the same time an important responsibility for refugees, who have been eager to directly contribute to the national COVID-19 response” commented UNHCR Representative to Jordan, Dominik Bartsch.
“As doctors, nurses, and a wealth of other professions, there is a huge potential for refugees to give back to the country that has been generously hosting them” he added.
Back in October 2020, UNHCR put out a call to refugees who had previous experience and qualifications of working in medical professions. After receiving over 300 responses, it was clear that many were eager to put their knowledge to use as the pandemic continued to spread. The six medics initially chosen to work are all specialist doctors from Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, who between them have several years of experience.
From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, refugees have been generously included by the Government of Jordan within the national response plan, able to access health care and medical treatment as Jordanian citizens can. Since January, they have been receiving the COVID-19 vaccine alongside their Jordanian hosts.
"As a refugee, I know what it feels like to lose your loved ones, your home, and your country. I am fortunate to have this opportunity to provide aid and to be productive. We feel our value in being active members of our communities" says Dr. Waleed who is working in Basma Hospital in Irbid.
He sends a message to other refugees, "do not give up, improve yourself, hone talents, and be a productive person in the community."
Since the pandemic is still raging across the globe, including here in Jordan, it is expected that even more refugee medics will be asked to join the initial cohort. UNHCR stands ready to support their eventual deployment in close coordination with the Ministry of Health.

Title: UNICEF launches a study to prevent and respond to violence in schools in Jordan
Content: 26 August 2021
In partnership with the Ministry of Education, UNICEF launched the ‘Diagnostic Study of National Efforts to Prevent and Respond to Violence in Schools in Jordan’.  The study provides evidence-based recommendations to protect children from violence and its long-lasting effects.
The diagnostic study comes as part of Safe to Learn, a global initiative to end violence against children in, around and through schools, so children are free to learn, thrive and pursue their dreams. To date, 15 countries have endorsed Safe to Learn's Call to Action, with Jordan being the second country in the region, after Lebanon.
“Today’s launch of the Jordan Safe to Learn Diagnostic Study reflects the high commitment of the Ministry of Education and partners to unlock the multiple wins of ending violence in and around schools,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
“These wins include improving students’ learning outcomes, improved investments in education, and behavioural change towards violence against children.  But most importantly, it will help the Government of Jordan to reap the long-term benefits of education, and secure future economic growth.” she added.
School violence, including bullying, both in person and online can be devastating for children. Its consequences include difficulty to concentrate in class, missing class, avoiding school activities, playing truant or even dropping out-of-school. This has an adverse impact on students’ academic achievement and future education and employment prospects.
Recent global evidence from the Global Partnership to End Violence against Children/ Safe to Learn and The World Bank shows that society pays a heavy price as a result of violence in and around schools, amounting to an estimated $11 trillion in lost lifetime earnings.
The Secretary-General of the Ministry of Education, Dr. Nawaf Al-Ajarmah indicated that Jordan is a pioneer among countries when it comes to preventing violence in schools, by adopting several policies, legislation and procedures to be implemented at all levels and include all parties of the educational process.  Dr. Al-Ajarmah further noted that Jordan is among the (15) countries that have endorsed the Call to Action to Prevent Violence in Schools adopted by the partners of the Safe to Learn Initiative, that was launched at the World Education Forum with systematic and advocacy objectives.
Dr. Al-Ajarmah stressed that under the educational role, the Ministry seeks to implement these objectives and promote positive practices to prevent violence in schools, as it is part of the state system.
He further highlighted the distinguished role of the Ministry in partnership with UNICEF and other strategic partners in implementing the ‘Diagnostic Study of National Efforts to Prevent and Respond to Violence in Schools in Jordan’, as part of the global initiative that Jordan joined in May 2020. This initiative will complement efforts and motivate further work towards preventing violence and promoting a safe environment and positive learning.
The Government of Jordan has taken concrete measures in ending violence against children.  Some of these measures include the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991;  the implementation of a national programme “Ma’An” to end violence in schools launched by the Ministry of Education and UNICEF under the Patronage of Her Majesty Queen Rania Al-Abdullah in 2009.
Those efforts resulted in significant drop of verbal and physical violence. Between 2012 and 2019, the cumulative results of the Ma’An programme showed a drop in verbal violence from 33.4 per cent to 15 per cent, and physical violence from 20.9 per cent to 8 per cent.
Moreover, the results of the 2017-2018 Jordan Population and Family Health Survey (DHS) indicate that between 2012 and last month of the survey, children experiencing psychological aggression at home dropped from 87 per cent to 76 per cent,  and physical discipline from 66 per cent to 59 per cent .
“Violence in and around schools is a global phenomenon, which severely impacts educational outcomes and undermines educational investments. Jordan is one of the first countries in the world to undertake a country diagnostic on the issue. Making schools safe, non-violent and inclusive is possible, it is a smart investment and there are proven interventions to do it. said Dr. Howard Taylor, Executive Director, The Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children.
"We call for all governments, civil society organizations, communities, teachers and children themselves to end the violence that undermines education and make sure every child — especially the most marginalized — is safe to learn, in Jordan and every country of the world.” added Taylor.
The diagnostic study proposes a set of key recommendations to end violence against children. In addition to investing resources, the study calls for adoption, implementation and monitoring of laws and policies that end violence against children; strengthening national prevention and response systems to violence against children in schools; and changing behaviours and shifting mindsets to respect the rights of every child to develop and grow in a safe environment, free from violence.
The diagnostic study was funded by the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office. UNICEF’s work to end violence against children in schools is generously supported by the Governments of the Netherlands, Norway, UK Aid and the United States’ Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.

Title: FAO, NARC to support digitisation process of agricultural services in Jordan
Content: 26 August 2021
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC) in Jordan have signed a Letter of Agreement to build capacity to use the Ma’ Al Muzare’ – NARC mobile application through a training of trainers modality and village-level workshops in at least 6 villages.
The Agreement is in support of the “Digital Innovation of Rural Transformation in the Near East and North Africa and Digital Villages Corporate priority.
The main objective of this agreement, which is funded by FAO Regional Office for Near East and North Africa (RNE), is to support the digitalization process of agricultural services in Jordan by the provision of technical training to NARC’s personnel, where 30 awareness sessions will be conducted at the field level throughout Jordan to raise awareness and train farmers on the proper use of the Ma’ Al Muzare’ – NARC mobile application.
Once the training sessions are concluded, farmers will be properly trained to use the Ma’ Al Muzare’ – NARC mobile application and will understand how to follow the Ma’ Al Muzare’ – NARC application’s themes and advices on good practices.
Through this application, farmers will understand how to use the Ma’ Al Muzare’ – NARC theme on Expert to Farmer Forum, where they can post a question, upload a photo and communicate with other farmers and NARC. This will result in the farmer obtaining tips and innovative techniques from other farmers and expert advice from NARC for difficult issues.
Furthermore, farmers will have access to local weather forecasts, crop calendars sowing date and harvesting date. In addition, the farmer will be provided with advice on good farming practices on irrigation, fertilization to improve products' quality and increase productivity. This will result in a more productive farm where natural resources will be conserved.
A social media awareness campaign will be conducted throughout Jordan in order to raise awareness of the Ma’ Al Muzare’ – NARC mobile application.
In further support of the digitalization of agriculture in Jordan, monitoring and evaluation activities will be carried out in the agreement and insights derived to feed into national and regional digital innovation policy and strategy process.
FAO Representative in Jordan, Eng. Nabil Assaf, stated that-
“the ubiquity, portability and mobility of digital technologies are transforming agriculture and food production. Specifically, in the agriculture and food sector, the spread of mobile technologies, remote-sensing services are already improving smallholders’ access to information, inputs and markets, increasing production and productivity.“
“There is no doubt that digital transformation in agriculture is here to stay. FAO is committed to assisting governments and partners in bridging such multidisciplinary digital divides to ensure that everyone benefits from the emerging digital society.” Added Assaf.
Dr. Nizar Haddad, the Director General of NARC, expressed his felicity signing this agreement as a continuation of the joint cooperation between FAO and NARC to support the technical cooperation in developing digital technology transfer tools using the mobile application “Ma' Al Muzare'”, as he indicated that this agreement will contribute to increase the publicity and expand the base of using this application, which is considered the first smart application in agriculture in Jordan, and pointed out that there are a set of smart solutions that NARC is developing in cooperation with FAO and other international partners.
On June 23, 2021, FAO Jordan and NARC introduced Ma’ Al Muzare’ – NARC mobile application that provides digital agricultural extension and rural advisory knowledge and information to farmers. The application includes themes related to Animal Husbandry, Weather and Crop Calendar, as well as Harvest and Postharvest, AgriMarketplace and finally Expert to Farmer Forum.

Title: The UN in Jordan Commemorates World Humanitarian Day
Content: 22 August 2021

World Humanitarian Day (WHD) was designated by the UN General Assembly in 2008 to coincide with the anniversary of the 2003 brutal bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq.
Every year on 19 August, the world commemorates and recognizes humanitarian aid workers who risk their lives on the front lines in humanitarian service around the world.
In this year's theme the world's attention is drawn to climate change and its immediate human cost on the communities affected by conflict and other violence, and the humanitarians there to help. During his welcoming remarks, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Jordan, Anders Pedersen, reiterated the UN’s commitment to support Jordan not only in the provision of effective and efficient humanitarian operations, but also in strengthening response to the climate crisis.
“The climate emergency is wreaking havoc across the world at a scale that the humanitarian community is being hard pressed to respond to – and so we must take this moment to reflect and understand what the future will look like for humanitarians and their brave efforts. And what our contribution, as institutions and as world citizens, can be.” Mr Pedersen said.
The UNHCR representative Dominik Bartsch expressed at the event that with escalating humanitarian crises, seen as recently as last week, in Afghanistan, Haiti, and close to home in Lebanon. The ability of humanitarian workers to stay and deliver is more relevant than ever, to ensure that those in crisis do not feel abandoned, and to provide hope even in the most difficult of times.
Tanya Chapuisat, the representative for UNICEF in Jordan, has underscored that:
“This year’s World Humanitarian Day is a stark reminder to the immediate consequences of the climate emergency for the world’s most vulnerable people, especially children. To reimagine a better world for every child, we need to work collectively to prioritise and strengthen climate actions in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Jordan has ratified in 1991.”
During the event, Nedaa Shrarah, the Jordanian voice, performed a song in line with the theme of the WHD this year. The song is titled “Racing for the good” and calls on everyone to stand together to protect and safeguard the environment in Jordan.
Each year, WHD brings partners together from across the humanitarian system to advocate for the survival, well-being, and dignity of people affected by crises, and for the safety and security of aid workers. This year, we commemorate humanitarians, highlight the immediate human cost of the climate crisis, and we put pressure on world leaders to take meaningful climate action for the world’s most vulnerable people.

Title: Children in Jordan at risk of the impacts of the climate crisis
Content: 21 August 2021
For the first time, UNICEF ranks countries based on children’s exposure and vulnerability to climate and environmental shocks, with Jordanian children the world’s 94 most vulnerable.
Young people living in Jordan are among those at risk of the impacts of climate change, threatening their health, education, and protection, according to a UNICEF report launched today.
‘The Climate Crisis Is a Child Rights Crisis: Introducing the Children’s Climate Risk Index’ is the first comprehensive analysis of climate risk from a child’s perspective. It ranks countries based on children’s exposure to climate and environmental shocks, such as cyclones and heatwaves, as well as their vulnerability to those shocks, based on their access to essential services.
Launched in collaboration with Fridays for Future on the third anniversary of the youth-led global climate strike movement, the report finds approximately 1 billion children – nearly half the world's 2.2 billion children – live in one of the 33 countries classified as “extremely high-risk”. The findings reflect the number of children impacted today; figures likely to get worse as the impacts of climate change accelerate.
While Sudan and Yemen are among these “extremely high-risk” countries, with a ranking of 15 and 23 consecutively, Jordan ranks at 94, preceded by Japan and followed by Kyrgyzstan. The report found Jordanian children are exposed to water scarcity risk followed by air, soil and water pollution.
“The climate crisis is a child’s rights crisis,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan, “Every child in Jordan is now exposed to at least one climate or environmental shock. These hazards will increase in severity as the impacts of climate change accelerate.”
Globally, an estimated 850 million children – 1 in 3 worldwide – live in areas where at least four of climate and environmental shocks overlap. As many as 330 million children – 1 in 7 worldwide – live in areas affected by at least five major shocks.
The report also reveals a disconnect between where greenhouse gas emissions are generated, and where children are enduring the most significant climate-driven impacts. The 33 extremely high-risk countries collectively emit just 9 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Conversely, the 10 highest emitting countries collectively account for nearly 70 per cent of global emissions. Only one of these countries is ranked as ‘extremely high-risk’ in the index.
Without the urgent action required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, children will continue to suffer the most. Compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes and diseases, among other factors.
UNICEF is supporting the Government of Jordan in its national climate change policy that includes children’s perspectives. UNICEF also integrates greening and climate-friendly initiatives across its programmes.
At the community level, UNICEF strengthens their resilience to climate change, especially that of most vulnerable people. This is carried out by raising their awareness to the risks of climate change, and empowering them, especially young people to influence national policies. These actions can make a significant difference in our ability to safeguard the futures of children from the impacts of climate change.
“Climate change action cannot wait. We need to work collectively to prioritise and strengthen climate actions in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Jordan has ratified in 1991,” said Chapuisat. “The Convention presents us with a greater opportunity to better address the unfair climate change related challenges most vulnerable children in the country are facing.”
UNICEF is calling on governments, businesses, and relevant actors to:

Title: Funding from the Canadian Government averts additional cuts in food assistance to 110,000 refugees in Jordan
Content: 02 August 2021
Shortage of funds has made it difficult for WFP to provide vital monthly food assistance to half a million refugees in Jordan. WFP had already been forced to stop this assistance to 21,000 vulnerable refugees in July due to lack of funds and was concerned that further cuts to another 110,000 refugees are unavoidable in September.
However, the Canadian Government stepped in with emergency funding of USD 3.2 million to maintain this monthly assistance for another month.
“WFP is grateful for the Canadian Government’s continuous support to the refugee crisis in Jordan, supporting us once again to avert food assistance cuts to tens of thousands of refugees. said Alberto Correia Mendes, Representative and Country Director for WFP in Jordan.
"However, WFP’s funding situation remains critical; the organisation urgently needs a further USD 53 million to maintain food assistance to half a million vulnerable refugees during October, November and December 2021”, he added.
More than a quarter of refugees in Jordan are already food insecure and a further 65 percent are on the edge of food insecurity.
“Canada is committed to supporting WFP’s efforts to provide food assistance and other humanitarian needs in Jordan. We are happy to provide assistance at a critical time for WFP”, said H.E Donica Pottie, Ambassador of Canada to Jordan.
Since the beginning of 2021, the Canadian Government contributed USD 12.6 million to support WFP’s response to the Syrian refugee crisis in Jordan.

Title: FAO validates implementation of Land Degradation Neutrality process for sustainable land management in Jordan
Content: 29 July 2021
The validation workshop was attended by a group of stakeholders and government partners, according to an FAO statement.
Despite ample knowledge and a high-level understanding of the land degradation situation, there are currently no national programmes, plans or regulations to promote the introduction and scaling up of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) practices within a framework that would support the achievement of Jordan’s voluntary LDN targets, the statement said.
Local communities lack the capacity to generate or adequately invest funds to move up to higher-value agricultural chains to increase livelihood opportunities.
In addition, there is a lack of real-time data on the condition of land and the state of natural resources, according to the statement.
Moreover, the project will work to establish a contextual basis to introduce the Land Degradation Neutrality framework through a participatory assessment and monitoring systems that will reinforce and give weight to the LDN implementation and negotiation, as well as increase ownership of the issues and restoration processes and techniques.
In addition to stakeholder consultations in the project’s design process, cross-cutting issues, such as gender equality and sustainability, will form part of the project’s early stages.
Agriculture Minister Khaled Hneifat said that the project’s launch is in line with the other efforts to face great challenges.
The minister commended FAO’s role to keep pace with environmental, climatic and production changes. He also commended the FAO’s “continuous cooperation with the ministry, especially in developing the national food security strategy, preparing its action plan, and supporting the launch and facilitation of national dialogues for the Food Systems Summit”.
FAO and the Agriculture Ministry currently cooperate in the fields of forest rehabilitation, grassland development, water harvesting and small farmer support, according to the minister.
The coordination efforts all come “to achieve the objectives of the national strategy for the agricultural sector”, the minister highlighted.
Nabil Assaf, FAO Representative in Jordan said: “The proposed project will follow a landscape approach in line with GEF’s vision to foster sustainable integrated landscapes to achieve LDN”.
Assaf added that work at a landscape level allows stakeholders to address issues in a multifaceted way, integrate sectors and work at different scales – “tackling the underlying causes of land degradation and challenges related to food security, not just the symptoms”.
“In this context, the project will support the formulation of comprehensive land-use planning to rationalise land use in a way that addresses interconnectedness and trade-offs across multiple ecosystems, promotes good governance to align policy directives at the national and sub-national level and promotes innovations in sustainable land management (SLM),” Assaf added.
Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) represents “a paradigm shift” in land management policies and practices. It is “a unique approach” that counterbalances the expected loss of productive land with the recovery of degraded areas.
It places the measures to conserve, sustainably manage and restore land in the context of land use planning. It also has strategic implications on how the country plans and manages its land resources, read the statement.
So far, 120 countries have committed to achieve LDN by 2030. LDN foundational principles are the necessary minimum requirements for successful implementation and attainment of the LDN, concluded the statement.

Title: Impact of COVID-19 on enterprises in Jordan: One year into the pandemic
Content: 25 July 2021
Over one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, enterprises across Jordan continue to face profound challenges.  Micro and small businesses - which make up the majority of private enterprises in the Jordanian economy - are hardest hit, according to a new report by the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Fafo Institute for Labour and Social Research (FAFO).
The assessment is based on data collected from more than 2,000 Jordanian enterprises in February and March 2021, as well as individual interviews and focus group discussions with representatives from various sectors. It also builds on an earlier survey conducted over a year ago in April/May 2020.
The findings and recommendations were presented during a panel discussion held in Amman on Tuesday (July 13) bringing together representatives of the government and social partners, UN partners and other experts. The panel included discussions with His Excellency Ahmad Al Hanandeh, Minister of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship, Hassan Al-Omari, Secretary General of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ahmad Shawabkeh, advisor to the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions and economist Jawad Al-Anani.
The report points out the need to ‘building forward better’ through policy reforms assisting enterprises that ensure sustainability and greater resilience post-COVID-19, while continuing to support businesses through the pandemic. However, most enterprises surveyed reported that they did not benefit from government support. Of those which did, the majority were medium and large enterprises rather than micro and small enterprises. Nearly four out of five micro enterprises were not aware of any support packages. The report also highlights that the majority of businesses were only just coping with very few adapting business processes or introducing digital platforms.
“What we have experienced during the pandemic made it clear that digital transformation is not an option; it is something that needs to done. It is a way to support the economy and create jobs (…) The pandemic helped us get the buy-in from everybody. Everybody realises this is the way moving forward,” said Minister Al Hanandeh.
Most surveyed businesses saw a decline in revenues, with the majority reporting lower demand for their products and services and problems in accessing capital. Many saw their debt increase with the costs of energy and utilities being a major concern. Challenges to pay rent, wages and social security were among the greatest burdens faced by enterprises.
For many enterprises, the future remains uncertain, with one in five indicating they would not be able to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels of operations.
The crisis has exacerbated pre-existing labour market structural challenges, such as those faced by informal daily wage workers, who comprise a large proportion of the workforce in the construction, agriculture, and tourism sector. This highlights the need to address critical root challenges that lay the path for inclusive recovery.
“Even prior to the pandemic, many enterprises faced a challenging business environment, and these challenges were only further exacerbated during this crisis. We must continue to work closely with the government and our partners, including the private sector, to promote programmes and responses which address these structural challenges so that businesses and their workers can emerge stronger from the pandemic,” said ILO’s Country Coordinator for Jordan Frida Khan.
Majida Al-Assaf, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative in Jordan, expressed concern that so few businesses started investing in digital platforms or adjusted their business processes to explore new markets. “This does not bode well for the long-term resilience of enterprises and competitiveness of Jordan”, she said.
Based on the findings of the report as well as the programmatic experiences of the ILO and UNDP, recommendations that address the protection of workers and provision of tailored support are outlined. These include promotion of social protection and sustaining minimum wages to protect workers, and Incentivising enterprises to invest in employee training, upskilling and job creation through business scale-up tax breaks and deferrals.
The report also highlighted the need for tailored support to micro, small and medium enterprises and stronger public-private dialogue to ensure response measures meet the needs of the private sector.

Title: UNICEF and Ministry of Water and Irrigation launch “Clean Water and Sanitation for All” Monitoring Framework
Content: 18 July 2021
Jordan is the second most water scarce country globally, potentially placing thousands of people at risk of not meeting basic water needs.  To ensure water security for all, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Water and Irrigation in developing a new monitoring and reporting framework for “Clean Water and Sanitation for All”.
Jordan is the second most water scarce country globally, potentially placing thousands of people at risk of not meeting basic water needs.  To ensure water security for all, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Water and Irrigation in developing a new monitoring and reporting framework for “Clean Water and Sanitation for All”.
The new Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 “Clean Water and Sanitation for All” monitoring and reporting framework will support the Government of Jordan to manage water security.  It will strengthen the monitoring and reporting capabilities of the Ministry and its partners and will foster cross-sectoral collaboration between Government entities.
“Half of the world’s population could be living in areas facing water scarcity by as early as 2025, and in Jordan, dwindling water supplies and a growing population will halve per capita water use by the end of this century,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
“To address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from it by 2030, UNICEF works closely with the Government of Jordan and partners to increase water-use efficiency across all sectors.” she added.
In Jordan, currently more than 98 per cent of the population has access to an improved water source and more than 94 per cent are connected to a piped network. However, water is often only available once a week in urban areas, and less than once every two weeks in rural areas, with reduced frequency during the summer. More than 88 per cent of existing sanitation systems are safely managed while only a third of schools meet basic sanitation services.
Recent data shows that without any interventions, by 2100 [2] some Jordanian households will not even have access to the minimum of 40 litres of piped water per person per day. Low-income neighbourhoods will be the hardest hit.
This SDG6 framework is critical.  It adopts guidelines for data collection and management by different government bodies that will assist in overcoming the water and sanitation challenges the country is facing.  It also provides guidance and reporting requirements for each of the SDG6 indicators, offering a step-by-step methodology to effectively monitor and report progress towards the SDG6 agenda.
“We appreciate UNICEF’s support in the development of the SDG6 framework,” said Engineer Mohammad Aldwairi, Secretary General Assistant for Strategic Planning Affairs, Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI). “This framework will help us to better monitor the situation and to accelerate the realization of children’s rights to safe and clean drinking water, hygiene and sanitation services.”
SDG6 aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This is done through:

Title: Scaling Up Innovation in Water Management for Climate Security in Northern Jordan project launched
Content: 12 July 2021
UNDP and theSida launched a project which aims at scaling up innovation in water management for climate security in Northern project.
Jordan, Mafarq - the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP)  and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) launched a project which aims at scaling up innovation in water management for climate security in Northern project. The project was launched in Jerash, in the presence of the Governor of Jerash and representatives of government agencies, NGOs, the private sector and donors.
The project will be implemented over two years with the aim of strengthening the management of water resources in the governorates of Jerash and Mafraq with a grant of $450,000 as part of the regional SDG Climate Facility  project: Climate Action for Human Security in the Arab States.
The project adopts an inclusive climate security approach which goes beyond climate adaptation solutions in addressing the impacts of climate change, and in meeting the needs of Syrian refuges, and their host communities. Moreover, it aims develop appropriate mechanisms to strengthen local capacities in creating innovative change to water management.
The project aims to develop entrepreneurial water security projects in the governorates of Jerash and Mafraq. It will capacitate innovative SMEs in the water sector to enhance an enabling local environment in the local market and contribute to the development of innovative solutions to realize water security. It will also contribute to achieving sustainable development through the creation of additional job opportunities for Syrian refugees and host communities in Mafraq and Jerash. The full engagement of women at the community level in the activities of the project will be ensured and can be replicated and scaled up for a longer-term sustainable development.
In his welcoming remarks, HE Governor of Mafraq Mr. Yaser Al-Odwan stressed the importance of finding solutions to the political, economic and social challenges that are facing the Kingdom, mainly those related to climate and water, in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs, through support of innovative ideas that contribute to solving the water crisis the Kingdom, Mafraq governorate in particular, is suffering due to increasing demand by the Syrian refugees and host communities.
Governor Al-Odwan said that cooperation is key to achieve the objectives of the project and the best results in all sectors, the environment and society in particular.
“Sweden is proud to support the implementation of the resilience pilot in a second Governorate in Jordan after its’ inception in Jerash in June. This pilot project shows that many of the Sustainable Development goals can be included in one project. For example, through this resilience grant we aim to tackle climate impact, gender equality, water conservation and sustainable economy. The project also links to a regional platform which includes similar pilots – all to be part of the Swedish funded SDG-Climate Facility with the aim to enhance regional cooperation around climate-oriented solutions. This approach is well needed, and supported by Sweden through our regional MENA-strategy, as many of the challenges of the region are transboundary. For example, oceans and fresh water sources are shared, climate change sees no borders and all countries feel the pressure of the present conflicts.” Her Excellency Alexandra Rydmark, Ambassador of Sweden to Jordan,
UNDP Deputy Resident Representative in Jordan Ms. Majida Al-Assaf said this project is aligned with the national strategies and environment protection and sustainable development plans and priorities and seeks to fulfill the needs of both host communities and refugees.
Ms. Al-Assaf added that UNDP supported several water projects that were aimed to rationalize water consumption in the governorates, including several initiatives that improve access to safe drinking water and support farmers with modern irrigation technology to decrease water consumption.
UNDP Deputy Resident Representative underlined the significant engagement of community in the development process. The project that is implemented by UNDP in collaboration with the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), engages local communities in finding practical and entrepreneurial solutions to improve water supply and promote responsible water resource management in the governorates of Mafraq and Jerash. Additionally, it will focus on the raising the awareness of the community in Mafraq and Jerash on water shortage and the best practices on rationalization of water consumption, she said.
During her remarks, Sujala Pant, Chief Technical Advisor/Project manager, SDG Climate Security Project highlighted that, “climate change issues are not unique to Jordan. We have observed similar patterns in other Arab countries. We need to identify tailored climate-security solutions that respond to the needs of communities in both rural and urban contexts. And we need to do this through a whole-of-society approach, which creates partnerships across government, private sector, civil society organisations, and development partners. The pilot project in Mafraq is an important steppingstone on the way to a larger, more coherent, regional approach to solving climate impacts."
From their end, Sida highlighted that Sweden is proud of the first resilience pilot to Jordan. The pilots under the SDG-Climate Facility are showcasing solutions for vulnerable communities to tackle the climate crisis and when possible bring in private investments for sustainability. It’s inspiring to see that climate smart innovations can also generate improve life quality.

Title: National Food Systems Dialogue calls for collaborative action to transform food systems
Content: 07 July 2021
The national dialogues, come in preparation for the United Nations Food Systems Summit, which is convened by the UN Secretary-General to take place in New York later this year.
The Ministry of Agriculture in cooperation with the United Nations on Wednesday, organized a national food summit dialogue which concluded a series of sub-national consultations, with calls for collaborative action to transform to healthier and more sustainable food systems.
Organized under the theme “Transforming to more efficient and sustainable food systems in light of crises”, the National Food Systems Summit Dialogues, come in preparation for the United Nations Food Systems Summit, which is convened by the UN Secretary-General to take place in New York later this year.
The UN Food Systems Summit was announced by the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres on World Food Day in October, 2019 as a part of the Decade of Action for delivery on Agenda 2030. The aim of the Summit is to deliver progress on all 17 of the SDGs through a food systems approach, leveraging the interconnectedness of food systems to global challenges such as hunger, climate change, poverty and inequality.
Engineer Mohammad Hiari, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture said: “We will seek to enhance cooperation with all countries and authorities to preserve the diverse and balanced food systems for our people, as well as working regionally to control the unsustainable food systems and promote the transition to food systems that fit and respond to the nutritional needs and the economic and social conditions of our people. This necessarily includes raising awareness and providing training, aligning and amending policies and legislations, as well as working on other needed technical interventions”.
“The UN Summit is a unique opportunity as it offers a timely process for helping policy makers and food system actors to understand better the impacts of alternative courses of action, allows for strengthening partnerships, especially with the private sector, which is a powerful engine of innovation and investment for food systems transformation and offers an opportunity to strengthen our capacity for collective action to develop the food systems we want," Acting UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Ziad Sheikh said.
“The United Nations is glad to collaborate with the government of Jordan in conducting these consultations at the national and local levels to identify challenges and solutions and bring voices of Jordanians to the global conversation on food systems in the global summit”, Sheikh added.
The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed extreme inequities and inefficiencies in the food system which depend on thousands of food producers and processors, many of whom are living with very low incomes. The pandemic came at a time when food systems were already under strain from natural disasters such as floods and prolonged periods of drought, climate change, and other shocks.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) Representative in Jordan, Nabil Assaf, confirmed that this event will consolidate the progress made through the Summit's broad process that included diverse public participation, consultations and data-collection activities that began in 2020, paving the way for an ambitious and fruitful Summit in September. He added that the event will bring together young farmers, civil society, researchers, the private sector, policy leaders and ministers of agriculture, environment, health, nutrition and finance. The three-day conference aims to present the latest scientific and evidence-based approaches from around the world and launch a set of new commitments through action coalitions. Mobilizing financing and new partnerships.
“Together with our partners, our goal is to help stakeholders and leaders of transformation initiatives in Jordan understand the various issues affecting food security in the country so they can manage the complex choices that affect the future of food systems and accelerate progress toward the global Sustainable Development Goals. These dialogues are therefore creating pathways for many of the people who work in food systems in Jordan – across the public and private sectors as well as civil society – identify priorities, opportunities and solutions which will benefit the economy, enhance livelihoods and support food access for some the poorest people in the country”, said Alberto Correia Mendes, the World Food Programme’s (WFP) Representative and Country Director in Jordan.
The dialogue organized today in Amman, was the final stage in the national dialogue, that brought together the discussions from the sub-national dialogues held in Balqa, Irbid and Karak governorates, before the international Food Systems Summit.
The dialogues were facilitated by the Jordanian Ministry of Agriculture in close collaboration with the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office, FAO, WFP and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia. The different fora offered stakeholders the chance to discuss and express their views on different aspects of the transition to more efficient and sustainable food systems, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic, and support Jordan’s contribution to the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit.
The sub-national dialogues discussed enhancing food systems resilience, promoting equitable livelihoods and access to safe food for all. Stakeholders from across Jordan including civil society, public and private sectors, NGO’s and UN agencies, traders and manufacturers, consumers and academia were invited to attend the events. The Jordanian population was represented by women, men and youth.

Title: UNICEF cash transfer programme helps the most vulnerable children access education
Content: 01 July 2021
The study found higher school enrolment rates amongst vulnerable Jordanian adolescents compared to vulnerable Syrian adolescents, with boys the furthest behind.
UNICEF’s cash transfer programme has played a key role in helping children access education, suggests a new study released today on maximizing the impact of cash transfers for vulnerable adolescents in Jordan.
The study[1] found higher school enrolment rates amongst vulnerable Jordanian adolescents compared to vulnerable Syrian adolescents, with boys the furthest behind. One in five Syrian adolescent girls surveyed could not read to a second-grade level, despite being in Grade 10. Syrians living in the host community lagged half a grade behind, and those living in informal tented settlements nearly two grade levels behind their Jordanian peers.
The study also identified economic and non-economic barriers to education in Jordan for vulnerable children and adolescents.  In addition to conflict, poverty, and child marriage, these barriers included, but are not limited to, the cost of schooling, labour market ‘pull’ factors and school violence, taking into consideration gender and disability.
“UNICEF invests heavily in interventions aimed at improving children’s access to quality education to improve learning outcomes,’ said Shairose Mawji, Deputy Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “The long-term effects of dropping out-of-school, which  have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, deprives children of skills they need to succeed in life and traps them in a cycle of poverty, adversely impacting the country’s economic growth.”
Basic education in Jordan is free and compulsory for all children.  In addition to UNRWA serving registered Palestinian refugees, Syrian and non-Syrian refugees are integrated into Jordanian schools, including over 200 double-shift schools that accommodate Syrian refugees in the afternoon shift.  Jordanian, Syrian and non-Syrian refugees also have                                                          access to accredited non-formal education, as well as home-schooling, in addition to a variety of informal programmes, including UNICEF’s Makani* programme.
“UNICEF is committed to working with the Government of Jordan and partners to ensure that every girl and boy has equal access to quality education,” said Mawji.  “Thanks to our donors, and through the Hajati** programme, UNICEF has provided cash assistance to 14,000 of the most vulnerable families to enable children to access quality education and grow to their full potential.”
The study concludes with key recommendations to overcome barriers facing children. These recommendations include

Title: Japan Continues to Support Quality Healthcare in Jordan
Content: 01 July 2021
The Government of Japan and UNOPS launched a new  project worth USD 1.9 million funded by the Government of Japan to enhance the operational capacity of the Royal Medical Services (RMS) in response to COVID-19 pandemic, through rehabilitating and equipping three health facilities  in the capital city of Amman and the southern regions in Karak and Tafileh. The project is expected to directly benefit around 730,000 Jordanians and Syrian refugees.
The launch of the project follows the successful completion of the previous partnership between the Government of Japan, UNOPS, and the RMS that rehabilitated and equipped the female surgical, pediatric, and renal dialysis facilities in the King Hussein Medical City in Amman.
The Ambassador of Japan to Jordan, H.E. Mr. Shimazaki Kaoru said: “We acknowledge the great importance of RMS’s role in the health sector in Jordan and appreciate its continuous efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope that this project contributes to improving the urgent operational capacity of RMS in order to mitigate negative impacts of serious disease such as COVID-19 and to provide vulnerable people including Syrian refugees with medical services. I would also like to express my appreciation to UNOPS as a valuable partner for implementing several projects to support Jordan.”
The Director-General of the RMS, Brig. General Abdullah Omeish stated: “RMS appreciates the continued support from the Government of Japan that improves our organizational capabilities. The new project, which is extended also to the Southern region, will further improve safety and quality of the health services provided by RMS. I am very proud of the collaboration and friendship with the Japanese government and UNOPS.”
“Building on our long-standing partnerships with the Government of Japan, UNOPS is proud to support the RMS in implementing the much needed health sector initiatives amidst the current extraordinary global health challenges. I am pleased that, together with our partners, UNOPS is able to contribute to strengthening one of Jordan’s key health facilities for the benefit of all,” said Muhammad Usman Akram, Director of UNOPS Multi-Country Office in Amman.

Title: UN-Habitat organizes discussions on improving two Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan
Content: 30 June 2021
UN-Habitat, in partnership with the Department of Palestinian Affairs (DPA), held two introductory workshops in Souf camp and Al-Shahid (Husn) camp.
The workshops aimed to introduce the project “Enhancing the Safety and Resilience of Palestinian Refugees Through Improving Access to Water and Sanitation Facilities in Public Spaces”, initiate discussion on conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and launch the Public Space Site-Specific Assessments.
The project is funded by the UN-Habitat Global Public Space Programme and follows its participatory Public Space Site-Specific Assessment tool, which provides guidance on achieving quality public spaces at the neighbourhood level.
Workshop participants included members of the camps’ services committees, directors of the DPA office (from Jerash and Irbid governorate) and camp engineers. They discussed challenges during COVID-19, required improvements and maintenance including to the public toilets and the need for awareness campaigns to ensure compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures and community maintenance.
The UN-Habitat team conducted an exploratory walk with the participants around the camps’ public spaces to explore the neighbourhood together.
“Through improving access to these facilities in the face of COVID-19 pandemic, they will be considered as catalysts to strengthen urban resilience as well as the health and safety of those living in the camps,” said Deema Abu Thiab, UN-Habitat’s Programme Coordinator.
“These facilities are vital in ensuring the safety of refugees and workers living in the camps.” she added.
The project aims to improve access to sanitation for refugees in the Palestinian refugee camps to reduce the risk of infection across refugee population and enhance their safety and resilience during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Public Space Site-Specific Assessments will allow UN-Habitat to understand the quality of public spaces and influence, through a participatory process, future projects at the sites. The project is expected to reach nearly 50,000 Palestinian refugees.

Title: UNHCR Jordan opens registration centres on appointment basis using new rapid registration measures
Content: 27 June 2021
Operating on an appointment basis, refugees will receive an SMS message when they are scheduled for a face-to-face registration renewal interview with UNHCR.
Through the implementation of new rapid registration renewal measures, the interview is expected to last no longer than 30 minutes. In comparison to procedures in operation prior to the pandemic, the new appointment-based system also means that refugees do not have arrive before their allotted time or withstand long waiting times.
These changes are designed to ensure social distancing and prevent the further spread of COVID-19. In addition, remote registration renewal interviews will still continue for refugees who are unable to attend UNHCR’s registration centres in person.
At this time, UNHCR Jordan is urging refugees to check that their phone number is up to date within UNHCR’s database as SMS remains the primary method through which UNHCR can contact refugees and ensure they check whether they have been scheduled for a face-to-face or remote renewal interview. Over the last month, UNHCR has been experiencing issues in contacting refugees who have changed their phone number, with a low-delivery rate of communications sent to refugees.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to innovate for the better. We hope that the new appointment registration renewal system will allow refugees to easily update their documentation,” said Igor Ivancic, Assistant Representative for Protection at UNHCR Jordan.
In Jordan, refugees and asylum seekers have to renew their asylum seeker certificate on an annual basis. A registration renewal interview provides an important opportunity for refugees to update data about their families such as if births, marriages and deaths have happened over the past year. Holding a valid asylum seeker certificate with correct and up-to-date information is an important means of refugees to be able to access to UNHCR’s protection and services.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, registration renewal procedures have been happening on a remote basis, with over 171,000 refugees having renewed their UNHCR documentation remotely this year.
Despite this, there remains a significant number of refugees in possession of expired documentation.  Although, the Government of Jordan recently announced that UNHCR issued Asylum Seeker and Refugee Certificates will be considered valid until December 31st, 2021, regardless of the date of expiry, UNHCR is eager to ensure that as many refugees as possible are in possession of in-date documentation.

Title: Together we learn: Supporting inclusive education for refugees in Jordan
Content: 24 June 2021
Jordan is host to around 3 million refugees. The majority (2.3 million) are Palestine refugees registered with UNRWA - alongside some 156,107 other registered persons. This includes 634,922 refugee youth.
In addition, there are over 775,000 persons of concern registered with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) as refugees and asylum seekers in the country, including 667,000 Syrian refugees - nearly half of whom are children under 18 years old.
Dong Yeon Park (Korea) is a UN Volunteer serving with the Education Section at UNICEF Jordan. Dong Yeon provides report writing and publication assistance for monthly donor reports and flagship documents, such as the Jordan Country Report on Out-of-School Children. Such publications map specific communities, illustrate vulnerabilities and underscore the status of children and youth separated from school.
Indeed, 1.6 billion children and youth were out of school worldwide in 2020 and although many nations moved schooling online, remote learning was inaccessible for at least 500 million students. In Jordan, refugees were disproportionately represented among students separated from school and more likely to drop out of school than their Jordanian counterparts. These reports are therefore establishing a knowledge baseline, from which partners identify the most vulnerable, develop retention strategies and implement targeted interventions.
Further, Dong Yeon recently participated in focus group interviews with teachers and principals, as part of a broader feedback and inclusion exercise.
From what we heard from teachers, what matters most are the relationships, parent support, help with homework, proper nutrition and rest. These are the factors teachers looked at to foster student engagement and recovery. --Dong Yeon Park, UN Volunteer Education Assistant with UNICEF, Jordan
Jongmin Weon (Korea) also serves with the Education section at UNICEF Jordan, as a UN Volunteer Data and Knowledge Management Officer. Jongmin performs analysis from the data disseminated by the Ministry of Education, from kindergarten to grade 12. The data is utilized in part, to identify the needs of particular schools and further support a shared vision of and approach to education.
Data analysis and reporting has been particularly significant because of unprecedented challenges posed by COVID-19. We have been steadfast in hard times, delivering information to support students’ needs and the transition from schools to digital learning platforms. When students return to school this fall, we will be there every step of the way.” – Jongmin Weon, UN Volunteer Data and Knowledge Management Officer with UNICEF Jordan
In addition, Jongmin analyzes data from Azraq and Zataari refugee camps, non-formal and second-chance education programmes for youth separated from school, with an eye toward re-enrollment. Later this year, he will begin supporting the Learning Bridges programme, which aims to reach one million students in grades 4-9 through a blended learning platform.
Saki Komahashi (Japan) is another UN Volunteer supporting refugees in Jordan. Saki serves with UNRWA as Youth Outreach and Development Officer and is spearheading the development of an Agency youth strategy.

Saki performs both desk research and field interviews, learning how UNRWA and its partners provide youth with basic services including education, health and social services and adapted learning programmes to the COVID-19 context. In interviews with refugees, she also became concerned about high unemployment and the exclusion of youth in the workforce.
"Youth often work informally and are among the first lay-offs in a crisis. Completing formal education and vocational training are therefore needed to help them participate in the formal labor market." says Saki Komahashi, UN Volunteer Youth Outreach and Development Officer with UNRWA, Jordan.
"However, many refugee students have struggled to continue their studies online during school closures. The costs associated with mobile phones, computers and internet access have impacted their ability to gain digital skills. In some cases, a single mobile phone is shared by an entire household.” – Komahashi adds.
While the pandemic poses formidable challenges, Saki is undeterred. She is determined to develop strategies that increase access to education and training, elevate youth refugees’ voices and support youth participation in various UNRWA programmes as well as those offered by other organizations.
Alongside UN partners, UN Volunteers stand with refugees and host communities in building a more inclusive future, where we can together heal, learn, and shine.

Title: UNIDO launches accelerator program for 50 SMEs, startups
Content: 22 June 2021
A partnership led by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) recently launched a business accelerator for 50 Jordanian startups and SMEs.
The program aims to offer businesses access to resources for scaling up, training opportunities, and a gateway to global markets by giving entrepreneurs the chance to pitch their business plans to “world class venture capitalists and investors”.
The LevelUp Accelerator will bring together public and private partners to accelerate entrepreneurship in Jordan by supporting the development of competitive small and medium-sized enterprises to bolster entrepreneurship and provide employment opportunities, especially for youth and women.
“UNIDO’s work in the MENA region supports entrepreneurs, innovators, SMEs, start-ups, and organizations to build game-changing and successful business models to enter global markets,” Bashir Conde, project manager at the Department of Agribusiness UNIDO, said in the statement. “We promote a community of motivated young women and men who see an inclusive and sustainable digital transition as the starting point to enter the global markets.”
The program will target Jordanian startups and SMEs that focus on natural cosmetics, fashion, and phytopharmaceuticals, and it will facilitate access to funding and markets for businesses that promote sustainability, integrate circular economy principles, and employ a digital-solutions driven, design thinking approaches to create human-centered products, services, and experiences.
The accelerator is part of the larger LevelUp — Advancing Jordanian Industries project aimed at creating decent job opportunities for women and youth.
“In partnership with UNIDO, we've designed a 7 months’ learning and acceleration program to help Jordanian entrepreneurs build world class businesses that will create jobs and contribute to the diversification of the Jordanian economy” said Karim Samra, founder and CEO at Changelabs.
The program is being delivered in partnership with Jordan’s Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Supply and local partners, including Change Labs, Jordan Exports, JEDCO, and Business and Professional Women Amman. The project is funded by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation.
The LevelUp Accelerator will be launched through a call for applications and three open days featuring interventions from development agencies, experts, and influencers from across Jordan. Startups and scale ups in the targeted industries (natural cosmetics, fashion, and phytopharmaceuticals) in Jordan are invited to apply to the program through Level Up and Changelabs’ websites: (http://www.levelupjordan.org and changelabsme.org).

Title: IOM, JAF mark the completion of facilities for Jordanian border guards with the support of the Gov't of Japan
Content: 21 June 2021
With the purpose of “Enhancing the Capacity of Jordanian Border Forces in Humanitarian Border Management (HBM)”, IOM finalized the construction works of three accommodation buildings at the north-eastern borders equipped with solar systems and generators.
The project supported the upgrading of the network and technology solutions at JAF, capacity building sessions on Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures for the border guards, as well as provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to JAF.
One project was closed while a new project launched with the aim of mainstreaming COVID-19 Response into Humanitarian Border Management. Both projects are generously funded by the Government of Japan with the implementation resting with IOM.
The new project represents the continued trend of the Government of Japan providing support to JAF. It will include the construction of an accommodation facility for female border guards at the Border Security Directorate in Zarqa, as well as capacity building activities on public health preparedness and responses to cross border communicable diseases.
“Since 2014, the Embassy of Japan, JAF and IOM have been cooperating through various types of projects but mostly focusing on Humanitarian Border Management. Despite the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are thankful that one project has been completed with success and another just started. We remain grateful for the extraordinary cooperation and partnership with the JAF and Japanese Embassy in Jordan,” said Tajma Kurt, Chief of Mission of IOM Jordan.

Title: On World Refugee Day, Jordan continues to be the second host country of refugees per capita in the world
Content: 20 June 2021
Jordan continues to be the second host country of refugees per capita in the world, according to UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. Currently home to over 750,000 refugees, Jordan has time and again opened its doors to those forced to flee. Today, more than 10 years into the Syria crisis, the vast majority of Jordanians - 94 percent - still say they are sympathetic towards refugees.
This positive attitude towards including refugees in Jordanian society has also extended to the health sector. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, refugees in Jordan have been included in the national response and, more recently, have been able to receive the vaccine free of charge. 40 percent of eligible refugees living in refugee camps in Jordan have now received at least their first dose of the vaccine.
Despite this, the COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on health care, schools and our communities, severely impacting refugees and their Jordanian hosts, and pushing more families into poverty. This means refugees are increasingly resorting to moving to lower-quality shelters, skipping rent, accumulating debt or reducing food expenditure. In addressing these challenges and building back better, UNHCR is committed to supporting both refugee and Jordanian communities.
“Our assistance to refugees must be part of the broader recovery efforts to help all those affected by the economic impact of the crisis.  The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated that we all have a role to play in keeping each other safe." said Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Jordan Representative.
"UNHCR is dedicated to work with the Jordanian Government to ensure that the needs of vulnerable refugees and Jordanians are met,” Bartsch added.
In recognition of the skills refugees have to offer, on World Refugee Day, UNHCR is launching a Nursing and Health Care Lab in partnership with Luminus Technical University College (LTUC), which will benefit both refugee and Jordanian students.
Using the latest medical equipment, machines and amenities for Pediatrics, Maternity, Obstetrics and Gynecology, the lab simulates the environment of a hospital providing vocational training to ensure students’ smooth transition to the labor market.
Additionally, through a collaboration with the UN Chamber Music Society and in a performance led by Jordanian singer, Leen Alfaqih, and accompanied by a refugee choir, UNHCR Jordan is using the power of music to highlight that ‘Together, we can achieve anything. Together we can heal, learn and shine.’

Title: Jordan’s Public Security Directorate Receives Funding from the Elsie Initiative Fund to Increase Uniformed Women’s Participation in UN Peace Operations
Content: 16 June 2021
The Elsie Initiative Fund, a UN Trust Fund, announced today that Jordan’s Public Security Directorate (PSD) will receive funding to support their project to increase uniformed women’s participation in UN peace operations, including in leadership roles.
The PSD’s project will focus on constructing a dedicated women’s training and accommodation facility to enhance the skills of women police officers and increase the pool of trained women eligible to deploy as UN peacekeepers. The facility has also been designed to enable future expansions. Once established, the facility will be very well positioned to become a regional training center of excellence to prepare police women for deployment to UN peace operations.
Currently deploying over 600 uniformed personnel to UN peace operations, Jordan is the the 7th highest contributor of police personnel as of 31 December 2020. The additional training capacity provided by this project will pave the way for Jordan to achieve gender parity in its future police contributions to UN peace operations.
Deploying its first ever mixed-gender FPU this February, the PSD is committed to increasing the percentage of women personnel to 21% from the current 8%, in accordance with the UN Department of Peace Operations (DPO)’s operational requirements. Jordan’s PSD also aim to scale up the proportion of women who deploy as Individual Police Officers to 44% in 2023 from the current 6%.
Fully aligned with Jordan’s gender-responsive security sector reform and the PSD’s Gender Mainstreaming Strategy and Implementation Plan 2021-2024, this project will also contribute to Jordan’s implementation their National Action Plan on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on Women, Peace and Security 2018-2021 – the JONAP.
Jordan is the sixth recipient of the Elsie Initiative Fund. Created by the United Nations and Canada in 2019, the Elsie Initiative Fund seeks to accelerate progress toward achieving the United Nations gender targets in line with Security Council resolutions and the 2018-2028 Uniformed Gender Parity Strategy.
Funded by contributions and pledges from Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom, the Elsie Initiative Fund supports the sustainable deployment and meaningful participation of uniformed women peacekeepers by offering financial assistance and incentives.
The Elsie Initiative Fund recently launched its second programming round and is inviting Member States and UN organizations to apply for funding and submit a letter of interest by 31 Jul 2021.

Content: 16 June 2021
The construction of this network is funded by the Government of Japan as part of the USD 21.6 million grant aid programme to improve quality of and access to water supply services in Jordan.
UNOPS handed over approximately 95km-long renovated water distribution pipelines in Sarieh District in Irbid City to the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI). The construction of the network was funded by the Government of Japan as part of the USD 21.6 million grant aid programme “Urgent Improvement of Water Sector for the Host Communities of Syrian Refugees in Northern Governorates in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Phase 2)” to improve quality of and access to water supply services.
H.E. Mr. Shimazaki Kaoru, Japan’s Ambassador to Jordan, stated:
“Japan has been highly appreciative of Jordan's generous humanitarian support to the Syrian refugees in spite of its own economic and social constraints. Needless to say, the water sector is important in terms of not only supplying drinking water, but also promoting public hygiene during this pandemic."
He continued, "As the water sector is one of Japan’s priorities in the development assistance in Jordan, we have especially supported improvement of the water sector in the northern governorates since 2014, when the previous Phase 1 project started with a USD 22.4 million grant. I am glad that we can see the completion of the second component of the project. I really appreciate the dedication and cooperation for this project made by related authorities including MWI, UNOPS and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and I hope that this project would contribute to further development and prosperity for the government and the people of Jordan.”
Ms. Miyahara Chie, Chief Representative of JICA Jordan Office said: “I would like to express my profound gratitude to all concerned agencies (MWI/Irbid Governorate/Municipalities etc.) and UNOPS as our partner for completing the project. Under this COVID-19 situation, people’s demand for water is increasing, so, I hope rehabilitation of the water distribution in Sarieh area contributes to the improvement of water distribution to its residents and supports efficient use of the limited water resources.”
His Excellency, Eng. Mohammad Al-Najjar, the Minister of MWI, highlighted: “The project will increase efficiency of the networks and improve access to water in Irbid. I appreciate the continuous support from the Government and people of Japan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan especially to the water sector, noting that this support has clearly contributed to alleviating the impact of the influx of Syrian refugees and enhanced the capabilities of the Yarmouk Water Company (YWC).”
The General Manager of YWC, Eng. Muntser Al Momani, added: “The project will improve YWC to find solutions for the water supply to the areas of Hawwara and Al-Sarieh in the city of Irbid, where the old network has been a cause of major imbalances to serve the project area. YWC appreciates our friends in Japan for their support to YWC and Jordan.”
Commending the achievement of the key milestone of the programme, Muhammad Usman Akram, Director, UNOPS Multi-Country Office in Amman, said: “I am proud to witness the steady progress of this critical project that serves around 70,000 people living in the host community. As a result of strong efforts with our partners to move the programme forward, the network was delivered on time during the challenging times of COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown measures. I look forward to the continuous collaboration with our partners in contributing to Jordan’s future together.”
This water sector intervention for the host communities of Syrian refugees will also support Jordan in its efforts towards the realization of Agenda 2030, and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)’s Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

Title: A call for renewed collective commitment to ending worse forms of child labour by 2025
Content: 12 June 2021
A global report by UNICEF and ILO showed that 9 million additional children are at risk of being pushed into child labour by the end of 2022 as a result of the pandemic. A simulation model shows this number could rise to 46 million if they don’t have access to critical social protection coverage.
"2021 has been declared as the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour. In Jordan, we will continue to work closely with our partners to find durable solutions that support children and members of their families, who are in or at risk of child labour, to ensure they are given the chance they deserve to better education, protection and future." said Frida Khan, Country Coordinator, ILO Jordan.
"In recent years, ILO and UNICEF have strengthened coordination at the field-level, particularly in the agriculture sector, where a considerable number of Jordanian and Syrian child labourers are found.” Khan, added.
The report points to a significant global rise in the number of children aged 5 to 17 years in hazardous work, that is likely to harm their health, safety or morals, has risen by 6.5 million to 79 million since 2016.
“The consequences of worse forms of child labour are shocking. It undermines children’s physical, mental and psychosocial well-being, and jeopardizes their lives and their futures,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
“Worldwide, the majority of child labour is found in the agriculture sector (71%). Today, 108 million boys and girls are engaged in child labour in crop production, livestock, forestry, fisheries or aquaculture, often working long hours and facing occupational hazards," said Nabil Assaf, Representative, FAO Jordan.
"It violates the rights of children by endangering the health and education of the young, it also forms an obstacle to sustainable agriculture development and food security. To remedy this, FAO works to address its root causes, such as rural poverty and lack of social protection,” he added.
In Jordan and as the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated the child labour phenomena, UNICEF and Save the Children will jointly implement the “Work: No Child’s Business’ programme. The programme aims to protect every child and youth in Jordan from worse forms of child labour and enjoy their rights to quality education and future decent work.
“UNICEF Jordan remains committed to working with the Government of Jordan and partners to eliminate child labour by embedding area-based interventions in broader social protection, education, justice and labour market policies and programmes.” added Chapuisat.
The 'Work: No Child’s Business' programme addresses the root causes of child labour and its pervasive impact on children, youth, their families and communities. The programme
adopts an area-based approach, targeting children up to the age of 18 years old, getting them out of child labour and integrating them back into school. It also creates a protective environment for children, with increased access to social services.
“Save The Children Jordan believes that every child has the right to thrive and develop to their fullest potential. Through “Work: No Child Business” we address the complexity of a children’s work through a holistic and integrated approach this approach combines our expertise in child protection, economic strengthening social protection and in health and education to create opportunities for children to become healthy educated and empowered citizens.” Said Diala Al Khamra, Chief Executive Officer, Save the Children Jordan.
The support to this 'Work: No Child’s Business' programme is part of the Government of the Netherlands’ commitment to invest in combating child labour. This programme contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 8.7, to end all forms of child labour by end of 2025.

Title: Funding crunch forces WFP to scale back food assistance to Syrian refugees in Jordan
Content: 03 June 2021
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) announced that 21,000 Syrian refugees will no longer receive their monthly food assistance as of July following a prioritization exercise driven by a shortage of funds.
Recent contributions from donors have averted wide-scale cuts that would have affected a larger number of people, but resources still fall well short of meeting the needs of all vulnerable refugees in Jordan. WFP urgently needs US$58 million to continue food assistance until the end of the year for the half million refugees it supports.
“Desperate times call for desperate measures. We have to make some difficult choices to stretch the limited resources we have and ensure that we meet the needs of the most vulnerable refugees. These are families who cannot put food on the table without WFP assistance”, said Alberto Correia Mendes, WFP Representative and Country Director in Jordan.
“These are painful choices. What’s more, if we do not receive further contributions. we may find ourselves having to cut food assistance for another quarter of a million refugees living outside the camps by September.”
The cuts are coming at the worst time for families, when many are struggling to earn money or have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent WFP survey revealed that 68 percent of the refugees have seen their income drop since the beginning of the pandemic.
Food insecurity among refugees in Jordan has doubled in the last year to reach 25 percent. Two in three refugees – 64 percent – are on the edge of food insecurity.
Refugee families consider WFP’s assistance a lifeline. Refugees living in Zaatari and Azraq camps and extremely vulnerable families living in local communities receive US$32 (JOD 23) per person each month, while refugees living outside camps who are classified as vulnerable receive monthly assistance of US$21 (JOD 15) per person.
“We are grateful to our donors for their long-standing support to Syrian refugees in Jordan over the last decade. Many of these refugees are now more vulnerable than ever, reeling from the economic impact of Covid-19, which has pushed hundreds of thousands into an ever more desperate situation and increased their humanitarian needs,” said Mendes. “We count on our donor support more than ever.”
WFP urgently requires funding to continue assistance to vulnerable refugees, to stop families falling into further food insecurity and deeper poverty. WFP is working closely with partners including the Jordanian Government, donors, UN agencies and NGOs to raise the required funds.

Title: JONAP Programme Board reviews achievements in 2020, launches consultations for second National Action Plan On Women, Peace And Security
Content: 30 May 2021
'With the launch of a participatory drafting process for its section National Action Plan, Jordan continues to serve as a role model and a global provider of expertise on Women, Peace and Security’
On behalf of the Chair of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Women’s Empowerment, His Excellency Eng. Musa Al-Maayta, Minister of Parliamentary and Political Affairs, Dr. Salma Nims, the Secretary General of the Jordanian Commission for Women, convened the Programme Board of Jordan’s National Action Plan (JONAP) on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.
From strengthened prevention and protection mechanisms to reaching 11,612 vulnerable women and girls with prevention and protection services on gender-based violence, significant progress has been achieved in the JONAP’s implementation despite the exceptional circumstances faced globally as well as in Jordan as result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The JONAP represents a unique framework that brings together the Government, security and military sectors, civil society organizations and other national institutions, with the aim of promoting coordinated and holistic efforts to integrate women and their perspectives in peace and security. Jordan serves as a global champion in advancing the Women, Peace and Security agenda, whose leadership has been widely acknowledged in 2020 during the commemoration of 20th anniversary since the adoption of UNSCR 1325.
On behalf of the donor consortium supporting the JONAP implementation, which includes the Governments of Canada, Finland, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom, H.E. Tarja Fernandez, Ambassador of Finland to Jordan, affirmed “Jordan’s role in the region as well as the progress it has made in advancing the Women, Peace and Security agenda in Jordan, provide an excellent model for other countries to follow. We can already see how “JONAP” is bearing fruit”.
Dr. Salma Nims, Secretary General of the Jordanian National Commission for Women, presented high-level results achieved in 2020, explaining how the JONAP responds to broader national priorities to empower women, increase prevention, protection, and recovery. Dr. Nims indicated that in alignment with national efforts to recover from the pandemic, it is critical to include women in decision making positions, while also allocating gender-responsive budgets to achieve sustainable and inclusive development.
As such, Dr. Nims launched the road map for the national consultations that will drive the drafting of the JONAP II. The focus will be on the status of all Palestinian and Syrian refugees in Jordan, building on lessons learnt, knowledge, challenges and opportunities that will emerge from the evaluation of the JONAP phase I implementation. It will also set new goals to increase the participation of women in public life and increase support to Jordan’s peace and security efforts.
Participating in the Board meeting, Brigadier General Eng. Bassam Al Faleh, Planning and Organization Director, Jordanian Armed Forces, and Brigadier General Dr. Mutasem Abu Shatal, Director’s Assistant for Administration and Logistical Support, Public Security Directorate, reaffirmed the commitment of security sector agencies to foster an enabling environment for women’s participation through the roll-out of dedicated gender mainstreaming strategies. In terms of offered services, the military and security sectors are also actively engaged in enhancing national protection mechanisms, particularly prevention and protections services for survivors of domestic violence.
Representatives from the civil society, including JONAP Coalition 1325 and Jordanian National NGOs Forum, Ms. Rania Al Hayouk and Ms. Nuha Muhreiz, highlighted the importance of ensuring women’s meaningful participation in strategic decision-making processes related to peace and security, building on the action and expertise of grass-roots movements to localize the principles of the Women, Peace and Security agenda, and provided recommendations for the JONAP II phase.
The meeting concluded with the endorsement of the JONAP Annual Work Plan 2021, that will see an acceleration of stakeholders’ advocacy and capacity building efforts at various levels.
‘The JONAP contributed to strengthening national capacities and systems, forging strategic partnerships, and enhancing women’s meaningful participation. With the launch of a participatory drafting process for its section National Action Plan, Jordan continues to serve as a role model and a global provider of expertise on Women, Peace and Security’ said Mr. Ziad Sheikh, UN Women Jordan.

The ceremony was held under the Patronage of H.E. Eng. Khaled Hunaifat, Minister of Agriculture, and the EU Ambassador to Jordan, H.E. Maria Hadjitheodosiou. With the presence of H.E Eng. Mohammad AlNajjar, Minister of Water and Irrigation, H.E Mr. Nabil Masarweh, the Minister of Environment and H.E. Engineer Nabil ASSAF FAO Representative in Jordan. It was attended by a group of high-level partners and stakeholders.
EU Ambassador H.E. Maria Hadjitheodosiou noted that “This project has demonstrated the importance of combining national development needs with refugees’ needs. We should build on the success of projects like this that can serve as examples of developing exit strategies and opportunities, from pilot projects addressing refugee and local community needs, to comprehensive national projects that can meet the ambitions and expectations of all communities across Jordan.”
“This project aims to promote an economic growth of the local economy of Mafraq Governorate and particularly of Zaatari municipality and Zaatari Syrian Refugee Camp through an innovative intervention that stimulates decent green-jobs creation in an environmentally sustainable manner” underlined the FAO Representative Eng. Nabil Assaf.
From his side, H.E Mr. Nabil Masarweh said, “This project is in line with the national efforts for the transition into green economy, as it addresses an environmental hot issue and converts it from a challenge into an opportunity for more sustainable agriculture and water sectors in an Environment-Water-Agriculture/Food-Waste nexus”.
"The COVID-19 pandemic has constituted a social and economic shock to all countries of the world in general, and to Jordan in particular, as the agricultural sector is facing many challenges and variables, the most important of which are water scarcity, climate change and population growth resulting from successive waves of refugees, high demand  on food and  malnutrition.” Said H.E Eng. Khaled Hunaifat, Minister of Agriculture.
The project supported the creation of green-jobs through the generation of renewable energy and production of compost from waste in a refugee camp environment. It has enhanced the economic growth of the local economy in the Mafraq Governorate through private sector enterprise development, improved livelihoods and promotion of environmental sustainability and green jobs opportunities.
Furthermore, the optimization of residue use from treated wastewater and organic solids allows for the generation of renewable energy and compost and, simultaneously, provides opportunities for at least 60 vulnerable households that can secure a regular income from the biogas, solid waste separation and the compost plants.
In conjunction with the National Energy Research Centre (NERC), which is a local research institution that is part of the Royal Scientific Society (RSS), and which provided technical supervision, the project completed the installation of the pilot-biogas based electricity generation unit in Zaatari Camp. Under this component, 25 young Jordanian engineers received training on this technology.
FAO has also designed a full-scale plant where liquid and wet waste are co-digested to produce biogas. The EU has already committed the funds for the establishment of this facility, which will be built and used to produce electricity to subsidize profoundly needed energy along the waste value chain.
Furthermore, FAO introduced a COVID-19 response activity aiming at increasing the resilience of the project beneficiaries through a group savings and loans mechanism.
Jordan is one of most heavily affected countries by the Syrian crisis, hosting the second highest share of refugees per capita in the world. It is estimated that more than 3 million tons of waste, of which half is organic, are generated annually in Jordan. This has also increased proportionately with the inflow of refugees. Addressing the Syrian refugee crisis requires a comprehensive approach that not only focuses on humanitarian elements, but also the environmental dimensions.

Title: UN Headquarters Observes International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on 27 May
Content: 26 May 2021
Secretary-General to commemorate fallen peacekeepers,  and honour Kenyan peacekeeper as Military Gender Advocate of the Year
UN Headquarters will observe the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on Thursday, 27 May 2021. Secretary-General António Guterres will lay a wreath to honour the more than 4,000 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948 and will preside over a ceremony at which the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal will be awarded posthumously to 129 military, police and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their life serving under the UN flag last year and in the first month of this year.
Among those to be posthumously awarded the Dag Hammarskjold medal are two civilian peacekeepers from Jordan:  Mr. Shaker I.H. Alkhyami and Mr. Ziad Mohd Hussein Abu Sakran who both served in the African Union – United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, (UNAMID).
In a message to mark the Day, the Secretary-General said of the fallen peacekeepers:
“Their service and sacrifices will never be forgotten.”  He further said: “I express my deep gratitude to the 85,000 civilian, police and military personnel currently deployed in some of the world’s most challenging hotspots to protect the vulnerable and help to build peace. Despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, as well as the risk of infection, these men and women have pursued their mission while also supporting local authorities in the fight against COVID-19. I offer sincere condolences to the families of peacekeepers who have fallen victim to this terrible disease.”
Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said: “We salute the dedication and bravery of our peacekeepers, who serve and perform admirably in challenging environments only compounded by the ongoing pandemic” He added: “Our peacekeepers deserve our full support, and we must continue to work together to do all we can to improve their safety and security and give them the tools to succeed.”
During the ceremony, the Secretary-General will also award the ‘2020 Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award’ to Major Steplyne Buyaki Nyaboga a Kenyan military officer who served with the African Union – United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, (UNAMID). Created in 2016, the Award “recognises the dedication and effort of an individual peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.”
The International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers was established by the General Assembly in 2002, to pay tribute to all men and women serving in peacekeeping, and to honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace. The General Assembly designated 29 May as the International Day of UN Peacekeepers in commemoration of the day in 1948 when the UN’s first peacekeeping mission, the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), began operations in Palestine.
Since then, more than 1 million women and men have served in 72 UN peacekeeping operations, directly impacting millions of people, and saving countless lives. Today, UN Peacekeeping deploys more than 89,000 military, police and civilian personnel in 12 operations.
Jordan is the 35th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys more than 600 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, Cyprus, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, South Sudan and Western Sahara.

Title: Palestinian Rights Committee Gravely Concerned by Violence at Al-Aqsa Mosque, Escalation in Gaza, Calling for Efforts to ‘Salvage Prospects’ for Peace
Content: 11 May 2021
Following is a statement by the General Assembly Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, issued today:
The Bureau, on behalf of the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, expresses its deep alarm at the dramatic deterioration of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory that includes the escalation of violence and acts of provocation and incitement, particularly by Israeli extremists in occupied East Jerusalem.
The Committee is gravely concerned at the violence today at Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, where over 200 Palestinian worshippers have been injured by the Israeli forces, who fired rubber-coated bullets, stun grenades and tear gas at unarmed civilians.  The Committee condemns such acts against worshippers and all acts of provocation, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric.
The Committee is further alarmed by Israel’s escalation in the Gaza Strip today, where missile strikes are reported to have killed at least nine Palestinians, among them three children.  There is no justification for the taking of innocent lives.  All indiscriminate attacks against civilians must stop.
The Committee is gravely concerned at the prospects of further destabilization and calls for immediate efforts to de-escalate this dangerous situation with the aim of bringing a halt to the violence, protecting innocent civilians lives and restoring calm.  The Security Council bears particular responsibilities in this regard.  The Council must act immediately to uphold its resolutions on the question of Palestine and fulfil its duties under the United Nations Charter.  It cannot remain paralysed in this situation, which constitutes a threat to international peace and security.
The Committee also expresses its deep concern about the imminent evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods of occupied East Jerusalem.  In Sheikh Jarrah, 169 people, including 46 children, face the immediate threat of eviction from the homes in which they have lived for generations, and being rendered homeless.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has warned that these actions — which constitute flagrant violations of Israel’s obligations as the occupying Power under international law and could lead to a risk of forcible transfer — must cease.
Responsible collective action is urgent for de-escalation and ensuring the necessary accountability for the violations of international law, including humanitarian and human rights law, being perpetrated by Israel for far too long in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.  In this regard, the Committee reiterates its calls for a halt to all illegal Israeli policies and practices, including all settlement activities, home demolitions, evictions and all other acts of collective punishment against the Palestinian civilian population.
The Committee echoes the clear call by the Secretary-General for “Israel to cease demolitions and evictions in line with its obligations under international humanitarian and international human rights law”, as well as his call for the status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem to be upheld and respected.  This must include respect for the historic and legal status quo at Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and respect for the sanctity of this holy site and for the right of Muslims to peacefully worship there free from threats, intimidation and violence.
The Committee calls on the Secretary-General to continue utilizing his good offices and mediation capacities, as well as on all parties with influence, to act with urgency to de-escalate this volatile situation.  The Committee further urges the Security Council and the Middle East Quartet to revitalize the stalled peace process in view of resuming meaningful negotiations towards the achievement of a just peace.
The international community has an abiding responsibility towards the question of Palestine until it is resolved in all aspects, in accordance with international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions, and must act without delay to salvage the prospects for a just solution to the Israeli‑Palestinian conflict and lasting peace and security.

Title: Government of Japan donates over US$2 million to UNICEF Jordan to support post-COVID recovery for children
Content: 09 May 2021
The Government of Japan has donated over US$ 2 million to UNICEF to support recovery efforts for children in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The funding will support UNICEF’s work with the Government of Jordan to aid socio-economic recovery efforts to protect children and youth from the worst impacts of the pandemic – as well as supporting a climate resilient future for the country through the provision of equitable water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services.
“In this difficult time, socio-economic impacts on vulnerable communities are a great concern in Jordan. We sincerely hope that our support through UNICEF will contribute to mitigating such negative impacts and increasing resilience of vulnerable people to respond to various challenges related to COVID-19,” H.E. Ambassador SHIMAZAKI Kaoru said, “We appreciate the important role of UNICEF as a precious partner for implementing activities of our projects especially in the WASH, Social Protection, Child Protection and Youth sectors”.
“We are extremely grateful to the Government of Japan for their continued commitment and support to the most vulnerable children and their families in all governorates of Jordan. Together, we can reimagine a better future for every child so they can grow up healthy, safe and protected,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
The generous contribution from the Government of Japan will enable UNICEF to scale up services for vulnerable communities now and for the future. This includes the provision of enhanced social support and meaningful employment opportunities for young people whose options have significantly decreased due to socioeconomic conditions brought on by the pandemic, with the programme focusing in particular on the empowerment of young women.
It will also support climate-resilience and improve social cohesion for vulnerable children and their families experiencing water scarcity through the establishment of WASH infrastructure and restoration projects in communities and schools, as well as integrated learning and child protection services through UNICEF Makani centres.
The Government of Japan is a long and valued partner of UNICEF in Jordan and has provided over US$ 40 million to UNICEF in Jordan since the beginning of the Syrian crisis to support UNICEF’s work to strengthen national systems and provide lifesaving services for children.

Title: UN-Habitat Jordan launched the Flood Risk Assessment and Hazard Mapping Study for Downtown Amman and the proposed flood pilot project.
Content: 04 May 2021
In collaboration with Greater Amman Municipality (GAM), UN-Habitat Jordan held a workshop last week to launch the flood risk assessment and hazard mapping study and the proposed flood intervention as well as the outcomes of the community consultation sessions and the prioritized pilot project.
In collaboration with Greater Amman Municipality (GAM), UN-Habitat Jordan held a workshop last week to launch the flood risk assessment and hazard mapping study and the proposed flood intervention as well as the outcomes of the community consultation sessions and the prioritized pilot project.
The workshop came as part of the project “Strengthening the Social Stability and Resilience of Vulnerable Jordanian Communities and Syrian Refugees in Amman against Flash Floods” funded by the Government of Japan and implemented in collaboration with Greater Amman Municipality (GAM).
“We are very happy to cooperate continuously with Greater Amman Municipality on various projects for further prosperity of Amman. I hope our assistance can reduce and mitigate flash floods damages and improve the socio-economic resilience in vulnerable communities, and I assure that the Government of Japan will continue to provide its necessary support to enhance social stabilization and sustainable economic development in Jordan,” said the Ambassador of Japan to Jordan, Mr. Shimazaki Kaoru.
The Mayor of Amman, Dr. Yousef Al Shawarbah thanked the Japan government and UN-Habitat for their kind  contribution and support and highlighted that “this project is a starting point towards solving the issue of flash floods and storm water drainage in Amman at larger scale. This project will indirectly benefit around 35,000 people living in Downtown Amman by piloting a flood mitigation measure that can be replicated later at different areas using sustainable storm water drainage systems and green infrastructure. The project will also build the capacities of GAM staff and citizens through workshops and awareness sessions”.
This project is in line with Jordan National Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy (2019), where flash floods were identified as the second priority with maximum hazard of all risks, and with the “Amman Climate Plan 2050” proposed actions to mitigate flood risks. “This project is informed by this urgent need in addition to the urgency of sustaining social stabilization in Amman”, said Mr. Erfan Ali, the Regional Representative for UN-Habitat regional office for Arab states.
During the workshop, UN-Habitat presented the findings of the flood risk assessment and flood hazard mapping study for Downtown Amman, prepared by Dar Al Handasah Consultants (Shair and Partners) (DAR). DAR had performed a hydrology and hydraulic modeling study for Amman area and based on the results of this study were able to identify flood hotspots within the city, and to propose short, medium, and long-term solutions for the flooding problem.
The recommended solution is an integrated set of interventions that can together control and eliminate the risk of flooding in downtown Amman. These proposed interventions include large infrastructure projects such as diverting stormwater runoff coming from parts of west Amman away from downtown area, in addition to medium and small scale sustainable drainage interventions which are ideally spread all around the city for stormwater detention and retention either above or below the ground, and also small scale storm water detention tanks to be implemented at house hold level in Amman which can help with alleviating the flooding issue and with increasing water harvesting and reuse.
“This flood risk assessment considered to have the highest resolution flood risk mapping done for downtown Amman. Within this data driven approach, the team compiled all available data within Amman to achieve best simulation of floods generation and accumulation. It is also indicated the most vulnerable zones within the downtown of Amman with a high accuracy. The assessment paves the way for proper disaster risk reduction programs at GAM and related stakeholders. In addition, it provides a road map for developing a flood resilient city," said Deema Abu Thiab, the national Programme Coordinator for UN-Habitat Jordan.
The team also discussed the proposed pilot flood mitigation intervention that is planned to be implemented in “Jabal Al Zohour” area to reduce the risk of flash floods on downtown Amman. This intervention is based on the concept of sustainable storm water drainage systems, and consists of a bio-retention area above the and an underground stormwater detention concrete tank designed to capture and detain stormwater which allows for water utilization when needed but most importantly provides storm water detention capacity which participates in reducing the flooding risk.
Also, UN-Habitat team shared the outcomes of the community consultation sessions conducted earlier this year and presented the prioritized community-based project utilizing the CityRAP Tool, a tool developed by UN-Habitat to help local governments to progressively build the city’s urban resilience hand in hand with local communities and vulnerable groups.
The regional consultant for UN-Habitat Mr. Ammar Ismail introduced CityRAP and showed how it was tailored specifically to fit the local context and to directly address the flashflood issue that Amman is facing. The results of this participatory process, as it was presented, were two initiatives prioritized by local communities and Syrian refugees namely, water harvesting systems and green pockets.
Building on those two priorities, it was consensually agreed on that the pilot project should have a mix of those two approaches with certain criteria concerning the location, visibility and replicability of the project, building selection, and awareness raising in the area of intervention in order to support replication efforts for similar interventions in the future, aiming at reinforcing the impact of this project in the face of the flashflood hazard.
In addition, UN-Habitat partner, Mercy Corps, introduced the Flood Resilience Measurement for Communities (FRMC) tool which will be used also in the project to measure the resilience of local communities and refugees to flash floods and which will also serve as an evidence-based document for the decision makers at GAM and key stakeholders in Amman.

Title: IOM Completes Canadian Funded Project Designed to Improve Conditions for Jordanian Border Guards at the Jordan-Syria Border.
Content: 04 May 2021
The project was launched in February 2020 within the framework of the humanitarian border management program. It was funded to upgrade border infrastructure and accommodation facilities for the Jordanian Border Guards at 11 locations as well as installing solar power systems at the northern borders with Syria.
Today, The Government of Canada, the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have completed the constructions as part of the project “Support to Enhance the Detection of Threats at the Borders through Improving the Living Conditions of Jordanian Border Guards at the Jordanian Syrian Border”, generously funded by the Government of Canada.
The works were inaugurated by H.E. the Chairman Assistant for Planning, Organization, and Defence Resources Brigadier-General Ibraheem Al Na’emat, together with H.E. the Ambassador of Canada to Jordan Donica Pottie, and IOM Jordan Chief of Mission Tajma Kurt.
“Improving the working and living conditions of the border guards at 11 border sites along the Jordanian-Syrian border line will contribute to better protection, stability and security of the borders and Jordan as whole,” said Kurt, Chief of Mission of IOM Jordan. “We are glad that this project has been successfully completed despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We are grateful for the extraordinary cooperation and partnership with the JAF and Canadian Embassy in Jordan.”
The project was launched in February 2020 within the framework of the humanitarian border management program. It was funded to upgrade border infrastructure and accommodation facilities for the Jordanian Border Guards at 11 locations as well as installing solar power systems at the northern borders with Syria. The facilities will enhance the living conditions of the border guards and consequently, their operational effectiveness to provide protection to Jordanian territories.
“Despite the geographical distance, Canada and Jordan have and share an interest in raising the level of political, social, economic and military relations to meet shared expectations, which are based on mutual interests and values as well as common threats and challenges.” Brigadier-General Ibraheem Al Na’emat, Chairman Assistant for Planning, Organization, and Defence Resources said.
“This project is more than a construction; it is about partnership and vision. The fortification and rehabilitation of eleven border towers enhances Jordan’s safety, stability and security along the Syrian frontier. But it also provides an intangible value that can often be overlooked,” stated Pottie, Ambassador of Canada to Jordan. “In the midst of a desolate and sometimes dangerous environment, these towers provide comfort and shelter to the weary. Soldiers on the frontlines serving and protecting Jordan will have access to simple but essential amenities from home.”
The project has also funded upgrading the network and technology solutions at the Jordanian Armed Forces Headquarters with recent cisco technologies to ensure that all the locations can communicate and share information effectively. Thus, increasing the effectiveness of the Jordanian Armed Forces to deter, monitor and interdict border incursions.
Humanitarian border management among many sectors of assistance, is part of the IOM migration operational framework and an ongoing program in Jordan since 2012, with the aim of responding to the human mobility dimension of humanitarian crises.

Title: Study weighs impact of COVID crisis on vulnerable households
Content: 29 April 2021

Around 85 per cent of Jordanian vulnerable households were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic last year, a local study revealed.
The findings were released in a study titled “Impact on Most Vulnerable Households in Jordan - Overview of Findings from A Rapid Impact Assessment, Round 2, November 2020”, which was conducted by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) office in Jordan and Tkiyet Um Ali, a non-profit organisation providing food support to vulnerable communities in Jordan, via the video conferencing platform Zoom.
The virtual event, which was held at the National Aid Fund (NAF) headquarters in Amman, aimed to explore the report’s finding in terms of understanding the impact of the pandemic on families in Jordan, and ways to respond to its repercussions.
“The study, which was conducted in two parts, revealed that many families are still facing great challenges and are not optimistic about solutions in the near future,” according to consultant Muin Khoury, who prepared the study.
Round 1 was conducted during the lockdown in the last week of April until May 3, while round 2 took place between October 19 and November 9, 2020, Khoury said.
Round 1 used a random sample of low-income Jordanian households based on the Tkiyet Um Ali database (92 per cent), Palestinian refugee households (7 per cent) and Syrian refugees (1 per cent) in one sample framework, Khoury added.
Meanwhile, round 2 included a separate sample of 400 Palestinian refugee households, and 1,200 Jordanian households to make up a total sample of 1,600 households with different demographic characteristics, he added.
“The survey focused on the most vulnerable households based on the Tkiyet Um Ali database, from a sample framework drawn from around 20,000 Tkiyet Um Ali vulnerable household beneficiaries,” Khoury explained.
This report was part of a series of rapid impact assessments initiated in 2020 by UNDP to determine the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown measures on households across Jordan and, in partnership with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and FAFO Institute for Labour and Social Research, on enterprises in Jordan, according to Khoury.
UNDP Resident Representative Sara Ferrer Olivella said that this assessment is part of a series of evaluations carried out by UNDP to understand the great impact of the pandemic on families and businesses in Jordan.
“The assessment indicated that many families still face many challenges that affect their daily lives, especially the vulnerable sector,” Olivella told the gathering.
This, the UNDP official added, works to exacerbate many of the challenges of existing inequality,” Olivella added.
Also speaking during the event was Tkiyet Um Ali Director General Samer Balqar who stressed that the organisation was part of the social protection group that was established by the Ministry of Social Development.
“We worked on many fronts and throughout the Kingdom ever since the pandemic’s outbreak by helping families and daily wage labourers,” Balqar told the gathering.
NAF Director General Omar Mashaqbeh also explained the fund’s role during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We helped around two million people through our various programmes with an estimated half a billion Jordanian dinars,” Mashaqbeh said.
Director of Policies and Studies Department at the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation Hathram Fayez said the ministry worked to ensure the support of all sectors in the country, including the daily wage labourers.
“Our main concern has always been the health safety of our citizens while at the same time opening up the market and other sectors to ensure that labourers can work and earn a living during these difficult times,” Fayez said.

Title: UNICEF and WFP launch partnership to unleash youth innovation in food security
Content: 28 April 2021
Jordan faces unique food security challenges due to low agricultural production, water scarcity, climate change and a growing population that is one of the youngest in the world. While the rate of unemployment is high, 50% of youth in Jordan express an interest in starting their own business.
The programme will target youth between 18 -26 years old with a demonstrated interest in food security to develop a solid foundation in entrepreneurship and innovation through UNICEF social innovation programme. They will continue their journey with the support of WFP’s innovation programme, gaining food security expert knowledge, industry networking, and further resources to expand their projects.
“Jordan hosts a vibrant, inspiring startup and innovation ecosystem that fosters novel solutions for food security. WFP aims to support locally rooted innovations that have the potential to address the systemic food security issues facing the country, and advance work towards Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger,” said Alberto Correia Mendes, WFP Representative and Country Director in Jordan.
The programme will ensure a stable pathway for youth interested in pursuing innovations within the food security sector, starting from the early stages of idea creation to implementation and scaling.
To help spur youth innovation, the programme began today with an online panel discussion on the role of youth in tackling complex problems like food insecurity, and will follow with capacity building, expert mentorship on food security innovation, training on innovation and entrepreneurship using the UPSHIFT methodology, and access to sector networks. Concluding with 5 seed grants for young innovators to further develop their ventures and ensure access to sustainable sources and mentorship support along their journey.
“In Jordan, 100,000 young people look for work every year, to empower vulnerable young people and create sustainable economic opportunities, UNICEF focuses on helping them identify problems in their own communities and create entrepreneurial and innovative solutions to address them. UNICEF and WFP will employ tools of innovation for sustainable development impact.” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
This WFP and UNICEF partnership will help transit youth into entrepreneurs and support them in their journey. This partnership also reflects the agencies’ commitment towards the Sustainable Development Goals and a shared strategic direction to employ innovation for development and support the local innovation ecosystem in Jordan.
UNICEF’s social innovation programme has been generously supported by the Government of the Netherlands. WFP’s innovation programme has been made possible through generous support from Australia and Ireland.

Title: UNICEF and Miyahuna launch the Climate Resilient Water Safety Plan in Madaba
Content: 21 April 2021
Aimed at addressing the existing and potential challenges to water security and at providing a framework for proactive and adaptive planning to ensure sustainable water supply in Madaba governorate.
A new Climate Resilient Water Safety Plan (CRWSP) developed by UNICEF in collaboration with Jordan Water Company, Miyahuna, is aimed at addressing the existing and potential challenges to water security and at providing a framework for proactive and adaptive planning to ensure sustainable water supply in Madaba governorate.
The plan adopted an enhanced version of the World Health Organization’s guidelines and used a risk-based approach to identify the hazards and risks facing Madaba water supply systems. The CRWSP includes a 5-year improvement plan containing climate resilient solutions and a roadmap for implementation of more than 20 projects and supporting programmes to ensure sustained future water supply.
“Miyahuna manages water supply, distribution and sanitation services in the middle Governorates in Jordan since 1999. Our partnership with UNICEF has special importance because it is the first water safety plan of its kind that will be implemented in Jordan linked to the issue of climate resilience Water Safety Plan.” said Eng. Mohammad Al-Ouran, CEO of Miyahuna.
Climate change and rapid population growth has stretched Jordan’s water resources and supply systems beyond their design limits, challenging the Kingdom’s sustainable development ambitions, with water demand increasing by 40 percent in northern governorates, annual renewable water resources of less than 100m3 available per person, significantly below the threshold of 500 m3 per person which defines severe water scarcity and underlying aquifer extractions exceeding recharge capacity.
“Water scarcity affects children’s health, development and future well-being by limiting access to safe water for drinking and for practicing basic hygiene at home, in schools and in health-care facilities,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “UNICEF will continue to work closely with government of Jordan and partners to support capacity building to identify and address the risks to WASH services posed by climate change and water scarcity.”
This scalable Climate Resilient Water Safety Plan will support the Government of Jordan to improve water security by strengthening climate-resilient water and sanitation services in climate-vulnerable communities through rehabilitation and construction of water infrastructure and enhancing dialogue to support community engagement with the most vulnerable people, women and children.
The Climate Resilient Water Safety Plan was generously supported by the United States Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.
The report and findings will be officially launched for potential donors and the wider public at a workshop in June 2021.

The Government of Italy, through the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), and UN Women signed a EUR 1 million agreement to promote the resilience and empowerment of vulnerable women in Jordan during the COVID-19 response and recovery.
The two-year contribution will support the expansion of the ‘Oasis’ model, which provides a holistic package of services and has already proved effective in reaching out to the most vulnerable communities. The agreement was signed at a ceremony attended by the Italian Ambassador, H.E. Fabio Cassese, the Head of AICS Amman, Dr. Michele Morana, and the UN Women Officer in Charge, Ms. Aisha Mukhtar.
Dr. Morana stressed how “the COVID-19 Pandemic has been an unprecedented global health crisis, and women in Jordan have been disproportionately impacted by its implications. We firmly believe”, he added, “that investing in women’s economic empowerment is essential to leading a fast recovery from the impact of COVID 19, and to promoting women and girls as key agents of development and change”.
There are currently 13 Oasis centers managed by the Ministry of Social Development (MOSD) in partnership with UN Women across the country. UN Women also runs four Oasis centers in Jordan’s refugee camps.
Through this strategic partnership, Oasis centers will be able to further support 40,000 vulnerable women and girls, including those living in refugee camps, with access to sustainable livelihood opportunities, protection services, distance learning, social and civic participation. The goal is to develop the knowledge and skills necessary for their resilience in the COVID-19 era and support the long-term recovery of their communities.
“By signing this agreement”, Ambassador Cassese said, “Italy continues in Jordan as well its strong commitment to the promotion of women’s empowerment and gender equality through a “resilience and empowerment” approach, designed to build the short- and medium-term resilience of Syrian refugee and vulnerable Jordanian women, while also promoting the long-term enabling environment for the empowerment and sustainable development of the whole country”.
The Italian Cooperation considers gender equality and women’s empowerment as one of the main cross-cutting issues in all programs and initiatives, together with poverty reduction and environmental preservation. Collaboration with national and local authorities and with multilateral stakeholders is an important pillar of a comprehensive strategy aiming at improving women’s conditions in terms of participation in the socio-economic life of their countries, to contribute in achieving the countries’ full socio-economic progress.
This contribution will also complement and mutually reinforce other areas of cooperation between AICS and UN Women in support of Jordan national priorities on women’s empowerment. This includes a catalytic intervention to strengthen institutional capacity development on gender mainstreaming implemented in partnership with MOSD, as well as a dedicated program to address barriers to women’s retention and entry into the labor force.
“Women’s access to cash transfers and protection services, combined with long-term measures for sustainable livelihoods, is crucial for COVID-19 response and recovery. UN Women welcomes this renewed partnership which will support expansion of Oasis model and contribute towards gender integration efforts of Government of Jordan” said Ms. Aisha Mukhtar, UN Women Jordan Officer in Charge.

Title: Statement: The United Nations in Jordan congratulate the Kingdom on the occasion of the centennial of the establishment of the Jordanian state.
Content: 11 April 2021
The Kingdom has been and will remain a critical partner to us, and it continues to play a vital role in the Middle East and to the peace and security of the region.
The partnership between the United Nations and Jordan is a long-standing and robust one. The Kingdom has been and will remain a critical partner to us, and it continues to play a vital role in the Middle East and to the peace and security of the region.
The Kingdom joined the United Nations in 1955. Today, the UN in Jordan provides quality and innovative humanitarian and development support to the country and its people, through more than 20 UN agencies, funds and programmes.
Historically, Jordan has been very generous and welcomed refugees from neighbouring countries as the result of conflicts and instability in the region. Among others, Jordan hosts Palestine refugees, Iraqis and, over the last decade, it welcomed Syrian refugees as a result of the war in Syria.
Addressing the needs of refugees and migrants has placed growing pressure on Jordan's infrastructure and public services at a time of constrained public resources. It has also made Jordan a key strategic partner to the international community, which continues to provide high level of aid to support both refugees and Jordanian host communities.
Going forward, we will continue to work in support of the Government of Jordan, through government-led processes and systems. We’ll continue our work to address gender-based violence, our advocacy and support to protect workers, to expand social security and social protection, as needed. And importantly, youth, women and the most vulnerable people will continue to be at the centre of our efforts, to build forward better, together.”

Title: Japan increases support for refugee communities across Jordan
Content: 28 March 2021
Amid the devastating socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising vulnerability witnessed across Jordan, the Government of Japan has once again stepped forward to support refugee community centres and provide vocational training opportunities for refugees across the country.
Through a US $4.875 million donation to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, Japan’s support will enable refugees to access important community-based protection services such as counselling, mental health and psychosocial support, as well as recreational and self-development activities. Although community centres currently remain closed due to the pandemic, many activities have simply moved online, providing refugees with an important avenue through which to learn, develop and feel a part of their community while everyone remains at home.
Marking this contribution, the Ambassador of Japan to Jordan, H.E. SHIMAZAKI Kaoru, and UNHCR’s Representative, Dominik Bartsch, gathered today to discuss how the donation will contribute to community empowerment and bring hope for hundreds of thousands of refugees.
“Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, at UNHCR we rely more than ever on our refugee community volunteers as a voice for the challenges their communities are facing,” noted UNHCR Jordan Representative, Dominik Bartsch. “Funding from Japan is consequently most welcome to allow us to respond more effectively to refugees’ concerns and also provide a safe space in these challenging times,” he added.
The Japanese Ambassador SHIMAZAKI Kaoru said “We appreciate the valuable role of UNHCR which is essential for vulnerable people who are severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan. We hope our contribution will effectively support their activities to provide various services beginning from livelihood trainings to the Syrian Refugees”. And Japan renewed its commitment of supports for vulnerable refugees as it has continued since the onset of Syrian crisis. In addition to supporting refugees, UNHCR’s community centres also play an important role in helping the Jordanian host community, facilitating peaceful coexistence and social cohesion between refugees and Jordanians.
“A word can’t describe my gratitude”, said Ahmed Elmi, one of the volunteers in Al-Nuzha community support centre. “Working in the centre changed my life. I became more effective and reliable. Serving as a link between refugee communities and UNHCR before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, I gained self-esteem and developed self-discipline”.
In addition to this contribution, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) also donated 3,000 Non-Medical masks to be used by refugees in Azraq Camp. These masks were tailored by refugee women as part of an empowerment project, launched by JICA with partnership of Tribalogy (Stitches of Hope for Training LLC). As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact refugees and Jordanians across the country, continued support from the international community remains critical.
After 10 years of the crisis in Syria, Japan’s revitalized solidarity with Syrian refugees is much appreciated.  UNHCR Jordan express deep gratitude for the support from the Japanese people and is looking forward to continuing and strengthening collaboration with the Japanese embassy, to provide aid and protection for the most vulnerable refugees in Jordan.

Title: WHO continues supporting Jordan's Ministry of Health response to COVID-19
Content: 28 March 2021
WHO supports the National Immunization Programme in Jordan by providing routine vaccines, tablets to record vaccine administration information, cold chain equipment, training, as well as vehicles for the Ministry of Health’s vaccination teams to help them extend the services to Jordan's most vulnerable populations.
Dr Maria Cristina Profili, WHO Representative to Jordan, said: “We are supporting the Ministry's efforts to improve the infrastructure for vaccines’ delivery and use for the most vulnerable populations. This support will also enable delivery of COVID-19 vaccines with hope to halt the COVID-19 pandemic.”
To support the Jordanian Ministry of Health’s transportation and delivery of routine and COVID-19 vaccines through mobile immunization centres, the World Health Organization (WHO) in Jordan through the European Union (EU)’s regional trust fund in response to the Syrian crisis, the Madad Fund, provided 2 refrigerated vehicles and 15 pickups to the national immunization programme.
Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO country office is also conducting the third round of the "Population-based age stratified Sero-Epidemiological Investigation for COVID-19, which aims to determine the epidemiological exposure and the extent of infection in the Jordan general population after the important upsurge of confirmed cases during the months of November and December 2020. This survey is part of the WHO Unity Studies and is supported by the State of Kuwait.
Ministry of Health and World Health Organization with the support of the State of Kuwait conducted practical training covering all aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination, from distribution up to awareness and communication, targeting around 400 health care workers from various governorates in Jordan
Under the “Jordan Health Programme for Syrian Refugees and Vulnerable Jordanians”, the EU committed €43 million to support the Ministry’s efforts to strengthen Jordan’s primary health care services, out of which around €14 million aims specifically at boosting national COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan.
The EU included a number of fully equipped vehicles to facilitate the distribution of vaccines to target groups saving efforts and time as well as health care personnel, which strengthens the capacity of the Ministry of Health to respond effectively to COVID-19 pandemic. EU Ambassador to Jordan Maria Hadjitheodosiou stated that:
“In these difficult circumstances, solidarity is key to beating COVID-19. The EU has been supporting Jordan since the onset of the pandemic, and today, following the rollout of the vaccines, we continue our support to the Ministry of Health’s efforts to overcome the constraints in vaccine distribution by providing the necessary equipment to ensure they are delivered safely across the country, particularly to the most vulnerable.”
Additionally, 200,000 rapid diagnostic tests for the fast detection of COVID-19 infections and outbreaks at the health facility level were also provided and, along with the Ministry of Health, WHO also provided 300 tablets as part of the European Union fund through EU Regional Trust Fund Health Emergency Project.
The Health Minister Dr Nathir Obeidat acknowledged the partnership with the European Union, through the efforts of WHO in Jordan, to support the health sector, particularly the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: Jordan receives a $25 million grant to enhance climate change adaptation
Content: 21 March 2021
The Green Climate Fund (GCF) approved a $33.2 million project to build climate resilience in Jordan through better water management practices. This is Jordan’s first GCF project and it comes at a crucial time, as climate change and growing water scarcity threaten the country’s food and water security.
The project will benefit 212 416 people (47% of whom are women) in four target areas in the Dead Sea Basin – the Karak, Madaba, Tafilah and Ma’an Governorates – which are particularly vulnerable to climate change and climate-induced water stress.
A $25 million grant from the GCF will support the objectives of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan’s climate change policy (2013–2020) by building the adaptive capacity of communities and institutions, and by increasing the efficiency of water management systems in the country.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) will implement the seven-year project in conjunction with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and a number of relevant Ministries, public and private institutions, NGOs and other stakeholders.
The Government of Jordan will contribute $6.1 million in co-financing to the project, while FAO and UNDP will contribute $2.06 million ($1 million and $1.06 million respectively).
With FAO’s expertise and the Government’s commitment, “this project will increase the country’s capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and ensure the long-term, sustainable development of its agricultural sector,” says HE Dr. Nabil Masarweh, Minister of Environment in Jordan.
A Paradigm Shift for Water Resources
“Urgent action is needed to make water management systems more efficient to prevent further soil degradation, reduce water stress, and increase agricultural productivity in Jordan. The project, which is designed for measures at the national, community and household level, will bring about a paradigm shift in the way scarce water resources are harvested, planned for, and used in agriculture as well as in homes,” says Mr. Nabil Assaf, FAO Representative in Jordan.
“By promoting innovative approaches to sustainable water management and empowering women as agents of change, farming communities and households will become more resilient to climate change,” Assaf added.
Building synergies for greater impact
Multiple actions have been integrated into the project design to ensure maximum impact and long-term, transformational change in the way water is collected and used. The project will focus on promoting innovative solutions, such as harvesting rooftop rainwater, using water-saving domestic devices, and using reclaimed water to improve water security. It will also help build households’ resilience to climate change through extension messages – tailored to men and women – on climate adaptation measures and weather forecasts, and training that empowers rural women as agents of change for climate change adaptation.
Another import action includes mainstreaming gender-sensitive adaptive tools and practices for improved water management in the national policy and educational framework and the administrative, economic, and social frameworks of target areas.
The project will also generate numerous socio-economic co-benefits. More business opportunities will be created for entrepreneurs trained in installing rainwater harvesting structures, and more jobs will be created for young people seeking employment in these enterprises. As agricultural productivity increases through improved farming practices, fertilizer use will decrease – a win-win for people and the environment.
Agents of Change in a Challenging Climate
Women play a key role as agents of change for climate change adaptation. In rural areas of Jordan, women are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change than men are, particularly because they face unequal access to resources, barriers to decision-making processes, and limited mobility. They are also more dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods, but these resources are threatened by climate change. By addressing these challenges, the activities under this project will enhance women’s access to resources, services, and information so they can adapt to climate change and protect their livelihoods.
This project stands to benefit not only Jordan, but also its neighbouring countries in the water scarce region.

Title: WFP requires urgent funds to continue supporting half a million refugees in Jordan
Content: 18 March 2021
WFP requires some $94 million in funds to provide lifesaving monthly food assistance and to stop thousands from slipping further into food insecurity and poverty.
After more than a decade, Syrian refugees in Jordan are now suffering the worst food-security situation since the start of the conflict. A quarter of refugees across Jordan are food insecure and 65% are on the edge of food insecurity.
The socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on donor home economies has limited The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Jordan from reaching its funding target and maintaining the level of assistance it provides for refugees to meet their food needs.
With current indications, WFP will likely have to cut assistance to 194,000 refugees in May. Assistance to those refugees in camps and 201,000 most vulnerable refugees in communities will continue through July. WFP is working to ensure that assistance is directed to the families who need it most, given the funding gaps.
If the required funds are not received by July, WFP will be forced to cut assistance to another 313,000 refugee beneficiaries after July.
The consequences of such cuts would be dire, as 16 percent of refugee families rely fully on WFP’s food assistance, with no other source of income. According to assessments, 59 percent of refugees’ total household income comprises of WFP’s food assistance.
The levels of food insecurity amongst refugee families is already pushing families to resort to negative food-based consumption strategies, such as eating less so their children can eat more, limiting the number of meals they are eating, reducing portion size, borrowing food and relying on less preferred and less expensive food to eat.
Families’ inability to put food on the table has caused them to drop their children out of school, send them to work or even beg to find a source of income and meet their basic needs. This is also  increasing tensions within the household – including gender-based violence.
WFP works closely with partners including the Jordanian Government, UN agencies, NGOs, and donors to raise the required funds and continue to keep refugees on the agenda.

Title: Refugees in Jordan face escalating challenges as Syria conflict marks 10-year anniversary
Content: 15 March 2021
Ten years into the Syria crisis, the UN in Jordan is calling for decisive action to save the future for Syrian refugees.
As the second largest host of refugees per capita in the world, Jordan has been an exemplary host country for Syrian refugees for the last decade, providing safety and security to those who need it the most.
Despite this, humanitarian needs remain. With increased poverty driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increased risk of setting back years of development which had enabled refugees to rebuild their lives and contribute to the Jordanian economy and communities they now call home. As Jordan – and the world – looks towards the socio-economic recovery from the pandemic, the UN calls for the inclusion of refugees within these efforts.
For children and youth, who constitute almost 50 percent of the total refugee population, immediate and long-term measures are needed to reverse the educational and psychological impact of the crisis. Ensuring the equitable continuity of learning during this time is critical, regardless of nationality. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 has been exacerbated for women and girls, including increased risks of domestic violence, food insecurity and economic pressures. Sustained access to livelihood opportunities and protection services remains essential to mitigate against these risks.
Over the last year, the inclusion of refugees in the national Jordanian COVID-19 health response and vaccination program has highlighted that if everyone is included, we can grow stronger together.  The UN commends the Government of Jordan for being one of the first countries in the world to vaccinate refugees, showing a global leadership in hosting refugees
On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the conflict, therefore, the United Nations in Jordan, including UNHCR, UNICEF, UNRWA, UN Women, UNESCO and WFP, are calling on the Jordanian government, public and international community to continue to stand in solidarity with refugees.
Anders Pedersen, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Jordan
“Jordan has been a generous host of Syrian refugees for a decade and with the help of the international community, providing assistance to refugees in camp and host communities alike. As we look forward to continuing providing basic services, we need to find sustainable solutions to not only scale up our collective efforts, but also expand the Jordan Compact. Now is the time.”
Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Representative in Jordan
“While a political solution that will allow the return of refugees to Syria is the ultimate goal, while they remain in Jordan, we must ensure that sufficient opportunities are available for refugees, alongside Jordanians, so that they can be productive members of society.”
Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan
“Ten years on, the children of Syria have grown into the youth of Syria, while the next generation, born as refugees, continue to face uncertainty on the prospect of ever returning home. UNICEF continues to work with the Government of Jordan to help all vulnerable children and youth, regardless of their status or nationality, survive and thrive. Now more than ever, after the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s health, wellbeing and learning, we are grateful to our supporters who continue to work with us to help prevent a lost generation”
Ms. Marta Lorenzo, Director of UNRWA Affairs, Jordan
“For decades, the government and people of Jordan have responded with solidarity to all refugees. The Syria crisis has lasted almost twice as long as the Second World War. Palestine refugees from Syria have become double refugees, first from Palestine and then from Syria. Forced into poverty, they rely on UNRWA’s cash assistance and other services to cover their basic needs. Good neighbors help when times are tough. Solidarity from the international community is more urgent than ever to help all refugees live with dignity.”
Alberto Correia Mendes, WFP Representative and Country Director in Jordan
“Food insecurity among refugees is now the highest since the families started coming from Syria 10 years ago; according to WFP assessments, a quarter of refugees across Jordan are food insecure and 65% are on the edge of food insecurity, a stark increase since the pandemic started. Families are asking their children to eat less, removing them from school, sending them to work or even to beg. We must stay the course, as families are in urgent need of support; WFP’s assistance already comprises 60% of families’ total income.”

Title: UN-Habitat and Switzerland launch new programme on Urban Planning and Infrastructure in cities hosting migrants
Content: 14 March 2021
UN-Habitat is partnering with the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) to improve access to reliable services and socio-economic opportunities for migrants and displaced populations in urban settlements. The three-year programme “Urban Planning and Infrastructure in Migration Contexts” with a budget of USD 3.65 million (CHF 3.25 million), funded by the Swiss Government, was launched at the start of this year. It will support municipalities hosting displaced populations in Myanmar, Jordan, Egypt and Cameroon.
The project will focus activities on developing a common understanding of the issues affecting neighbourhoods, mapping provision and gaps in public infrastructure services in coordination with humanitarian interventions. The design of urban profiles for the selected vulnerable neighbourhoods enables the development of a shared visions and prioritised interventions that improve living conditions to be agreed upon and potentially funded.
In the selected cities, the programme will foster multi-sectoral collaboration between UN-Habitat, national and local governments, humanitarian actors, development banks and local communities including displaced populations. The scope of work will also ensure significant contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals by supporting the selected cities and human settlements to become increasingly inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.
The implementation of the “Urban Planning and Infrastructure in Migration Contexts” programme will go beyond the pure planning stage by supporting municipalities to mainstream migration challenges into spatial urban analytics and urban infrastructure investment planning. The development of financing strategies will support a successful linkage to financing schemes and an uptake into concrete implementation of selected investments and interventions.
Knowledge sharing will also be a cornerstone of this programme throughout its four phases. Spatial data collection and management is a key cross-cutting component and will be delivered through capacity sharing sessions with municipalities as well as city-to-city knowledge exchanges and engagement at major regional and thematic forums.
This partnership with SECO and mobilisation of the programme itself, which will help to bolster the resilience of local authorities to support displaced populations.
“This partnership with SECO affirms much needed support for infrastructure investments that target a whole-of-society approach,” said UN-Habitat’s Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif.
“The project will include the voices of displaced people in neighbourhood planning, which is key to ensure communities in need are targeted while livelihood opportunities and standards of living are improved for all urban dwellers,” Sharif added.

Title: First COVID-19 COVAX vaccine shipment arrives in Jordan
Content: 13 March 2021
A total of €8 million has been made available by the EU to support the Ministry of Health’s purchase of COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX Facility.
On 12 March, Jordan received the first shipment of 144,000 doses of the AstraZeneca/SK Bioscience COVID-19 vaccine from COVAX Facility at Queen Alia International Airport, in Amman.
COVAX is a global facility representing partnership between the World Health Organization (WHO), Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) working on the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. It includes 190 countries with population of more than 7 billion people and ensures fair and equal access to COVID-19 vaccines supplied through UNICEF. The European Union (EU), WHO and UNICEF are supporting the Government of Jordan’s national vaccination campaign
A total of €8 million has been made available by the EU to support the Ministry of Health’s purchase of COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX Facility through its “Jordan Health Programme for Syrian Refugees and Vulnerable Jordanians,” implemented by the WHO and funded by the Madad Fund. A second shipment of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX Facility is expected to arrive in Jordan in April.
“We now see the results of partnership with the COVAX Facility where Jordan participates as a fully self-financing country. This supply is very timely to support our efforts to accelerate the COVID-19 national immunization campaign. We will continue offering the COVID-19 vaccines to the most vulnerable populations” said Nathir Obeidat, Minister of Health.
EU Ambassador to Jordan Maria Hadjitheodosiou said: “the European Union has been leading international efforts to ensure vaccine equity and low- and middle-income countries. Through Team Europe’s €2.2 billion contribution to the COVAX Facility, we aim to ensure that all our partners have access to safe and effective vaccines. We can only add our voice to that of the Jordanian government in encouraging people to register on the Ministry of Health’s platform to receive the vaccine, as they are steadily becoming available.”
Dr Maria Cristina Profili, WHO Representative to Jordan said: “The COVID-19 vaccines are a key tool in bringing COVID-19 pandemic under control. As key COVAX partner, WHO is providing full support to the Ministry of Health in planning, implementation, and monitoring of the national immunization campaign”.
“One year since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, each delivery of vaccines brings hope for recovery and gets us one step closer to a return to normality for millions of children in Jordan. UNICEF is proud to support the Ministry of Health and our partners to be part of this equitable global distribution of vaccines,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.

Title: UNICEF launches youth initiative in Jerash Camp on International Women’s Day
Content: 08 March 2021
A new training and manufacturing centre designed to promote the economic resilience of disadvantaged young women living in Jerash Camp was launched on International Women’s Day by UNICEF.
UNICEF has partnered with local social enterprise Saru for Crafts and Development to provide technical and vocational training in embroidery and crafts to 200 young women aged 17 to 24 years living in the camp to improve their employability – in addition to developing a production line to create 25 employment opportunities for graduates of the programme.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened existing gender inequalities - with women and girls disproportionately affected by the economic fallout," said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
"UNICEF is committed to empowering girls living in the most vulnerable communities in Jordan with employable skills to increase women’s participation in the workforce and promote a sustainable and equitable post-COVID economic recovery,” she added.
“Today, as we celebrate International Women's Day with UNICEF at the inauguration of this Women’s Centre, we confirm our commitment to supporting the most vulnerable women and girls in our beloved Jordan and facilitating their access to employment and training in traditional crafts, especially embroidery,” said Majeda Abu Zaghlan, Founder of Saru for Crafts and Development.
In Jordan, only 15 per cent of women participate in the workforce, compared to 67 per cent of men. Low labour force participation and lack of access to income-generation leads to the financial exclusion of women and their disempowerment.
Since 2018, UNICEF’s Amaluna programme has supported 2,500 youth across Jordan with labour market-driven training, essential work-ready skills and support to access to meaningful employment. The programme has achieved a 70 per cent employment rate and supported the establishment of 95 women- and youth-led social enterprises.

Title: Arab Region to hold its first regional review of the “Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration”
Content: 24 February 2021
Cairo - The first Regional Review of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration (GCM) in the Arab region started today. The two-day conference will be attended by Member States and all relevant stakeholders to reflect on the progress made since the adoption of the GCM – the first inter-governmentally negotiated agreement addressing international migration in all its dimensions - in 2018.
The event was co-organized by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA), and the League of Arab States (LAS), in collaboration with the Regional United Nations Network on Migration in the Arab Region.
In her opening remarks, ESCWA’s Executive Secretary, Dr. Rola Dashti, emphasized that now more than ever, “we need to work together to promote the inclusion of migrants in social policies, fight discrimination, and ensure safe, orderly and regular migration.” She also thanked all migrants from and to the Arab region for their invaluable contributions to the region.
Participating governments from the region will be presenting the key findings from their voluntary GCM review reports highlighting their experiences, the challenges faced, good practices and lessons learned, as well as their next steps at the country level.
“Regional reviews provide an opportunity not only to discuss and evaluate how to strengthen regional cooperation on migration, but to do so within the current context,” said Antònio Vitorino, IOM Director-General and Coordinator of the UN Network on Migration.
In his opening remarks, he also highlighted the adaptability of the GCM on how the collective efforts can enhance the positive development effects of human mobility.
In his remarks, the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, noted that “benefitting from migrants in any society is achieved by reaching an optimum balance point between all economic, social and political considerations; that point varies from one society to another and also develops over time".
The regional conference reviewed all 23 objectives outlined in the GCM, articulated around four thematic roundtables with interactive discussions between all participants. The conference will be concluded by the presentation of the key messages and recommendations that emanated from the two-day discussions.
The regional reviews are called for by the GCM, which recognized that most international migration occurs within regions. The voluntary GCM reviews by Member States and the outcome document will feed into the first International Migration Review Forum held in 2022 as contributions from the regional level.
The UN system, through the regional Network on migration, is committed to supporting all partners in pursuit of the implementation of the GCM, recognizing that this cooperative framework provides an
invaluable tool for ensuring that migration benefits all and that populations, including migrants, can contribute to a collective response to COVID-19.

Title: UNRWA schools open their doors for second semester in Jordan
Content: 08 February 2021
Over 119,000 girls and boys went back to learning in the classes of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Jordan on Sunday for the second semester.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, UNRWA schools are opening their doors to students in line with the health and safety regulations of the Government of Jordan.
In Jordan, this is achieved through a blended approach, where classes are split, with half the children learning at home and the other half in school, in rotation.
As per the regulations issued by the Ministry of Education, school attendance is also optional pending the parents’ approval, meaning that parents can choose to keep their children at home while ensuring the continuation of distance learning.
Due to the rise in cases of COVID-19, the Government of Jordan ordered all schools closed in September 2020 in order to contain the spread of the virus. At that time, UNRWA — in line with host government regulations — moved to distance learning, with students accessing education in different ways, including via the UNRWA TV YouTube channel, and online learning platforms launched by the Jordanian Ministry of Education.
During closure, school counsellors provided psychosocial support for all Palestine refugee students, including for Palestine refugees from Syria to mitigate any stress they are experiencing.
Against the background of the raging pandemic and the worst financial crisis in the agency’s history, UNRWA educational staff spared no effort to ensure uninterrupted access to education for Palestine refugee students, especially vulnerable students who do not have reliable access to Internet, tablets or smart phones.
“I’m very happy to join our students on their first day back to school,” said Director of UNRWA Affairs in Jordan Marta Lorenzo.
“Today, we are celebrating them and our educational staff who have spared no effort to ensure the continuity of learning for all children, in-person or remotely. COVID-19 has created an unprecedented situation, affecting the whole world. However, with the energy we received from our children and teachers, we are able continue to confront the challenges and deliver quality education throughout the crisis,” Lorenzo said.
During the Back-to-Learning ceremony held at the UNRWA Russeifeh Preparatory Girls School in Zarqa, Lorenzo, UNRWA Deputy Director of Education Moritz Bilagher and Head of the Education Department in Jordan Oroba Labadi met with young students and had a discussion about their main responsibilities and plans for the new semester, particularly in light of COVID-19.
Students presented their strategies for raising awareness around the coronavirus and how to stay safe and healthy in school.
“I’m thrilled that we are finally back to school and get to see our friends and teachers,” said Ibtisam Rafaat, a third-grade student at the Russeifeh School.
“I will make sure to keep my facemask on and encourage my colleagues to do the same, so we can all continue our face-to-face learning without going back to closures while preserving our health and safety,” she continued.
“It was not an easy journey,” said the teacher Shadyah Abu Alya, “but we spared no effort to make sure that our students are following their lessons properly,  especially the first graders who are still building their basic skills and knowledge, as they need special care and education”, she said.
UNRWA operates a total of 711 schools in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Gaza, and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, with over 534,000 Palestine refugee students in attendance.

Title: Export consortia agreement signed between five Jordanian food supplements’ factories
Content: 08 February 2021
The project aims to increase the contribution of the Jordanian private sector to job creation and economic inclusion for youth and women by supporting the development of small and medium enterprises.
A consortia agreement between five Jordanian food supplements’ factories was signed on Sunday 8 February 2021.
In light of COVID 19, the food supplement sector is considered one of the new and promising sectors in Jordan, due to the high value-added knowledge that exists locally and its ability to enter the export markets in the region and worldwide - similar to the Jordanian pharmaceutical industries- which is witnessing high growth rates.
The sector can provide job opportunities for a large number of bachelor’s degree holders of both genders in several specializations. In Jordan, the sector started with five companies that were able, in a short time, to put a clear footprint in the local market and spread to neighboring markets.
The agreement was signed under the patronage of the Minister of Industry, Trade and Supply, Ms. Maha Al-Ali, and in the presence of the Head of the Jordan Chamber of Industry, Mr. Fathi Al-Jaghbir, the Secretary-General of the Ministry, H.E. Yousef Al-Shamali, and the Representative of UNIDO in Jordan Ms. Sulafa Madanat.
Establishing export consortia of Jordanian factories in the three targeted sectors, namely Garment and Fashion, Natural Cosmetics, and Food Supplements, will facilitate their access to non-traditional markets and create competitive opportunities for the alliance members to increase and sustain exports.
Professional uniform clothing manufacturers export consortia: Similar agreements were signed between 6 Jordanian factories of professional uniform clothing manufacturers, producing various clothing types, including professional uniforms, school uniforms, and safety shoes, both official and professional (safety boots), seeking to produce an integrated collection of professional uniforms under one brand targeting non-traditional markets in East Africa, in addition to the traditional markets in the Arab region.
Natural Beauty Products export consortia: includes five factories producing Dead Sea products and other natural products from organic nature extracts. This consortium seeks to target non-traditional markets in Africa, other Arab countries, and the United States of America.
UNIDO is currently supporting the development of the consortia’s promotion and marketing plans that are expected to be launched on the target markets in an integrated manner.

Title: UN-Habitat, RSS to implement COVID-19 response project
Content: 31 January 2021
The Royal Scientific Society (RSS) and UN-Habitat on Saturday signed an agreement for a joint research project titled “COVID-19 in the Wastewater Cycle: Survival, Risk and Surveillance in Jordan” initiated by the UN agency’s Global Water Operators’ Partnerships Alliance Programme (GWOPA).
The COVID-19 pandemic has reignited interest in wastewater surveillance, specifically how sewage systems are monitored for the presence of viruses, bacteria and other pathogens.
The concentration of COVID-19 in wastewater samples provides an early alert to address potential cases, and the detection of the virus in sewage has been employed as a complementary method to clinical testing and indicator of virus’ spread in communities.
Poor urban communities and refugee camps are most vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks given the dense and crowded settings, compounded by reduced financial capacity to conduct PCR testing, when needed.
Jordan has the second highest refugee population per capita in the world, although approximately 83 per cent are urban-based, the remainder live in one of the 13 refugee camps in Jordan (i.e. 10 camps for Palestinians and three for Syrians), according to UNRWA and UNHCR (2020).
Considering the limited resources in Jordan for conducting massive COVID-19 tests, immediate wastewater results can provide considerable advance notice of infection dynamics in Jordanian communities, particularly in vulnerable communities and refugee camps.
In that regard, the joint project will be implemented over six months to address the presence and fate of COVID-19 in the wastewater cycle from the source points at King Abdullah University Hospital  in Irbid to the wastewater treatment plant.
The project will propose a sustainable early warning system in Azraq Syrian refugee camp and Jerash Palestinian refugee camp  through tracking and monitoring COVID-19 in wastewater.
The Water and Environment Centre and Bio-Safety and Bio-Security Centre at the RSS will be in charge of implementing this project, which seeks to complement the efforts of RSS in wastewater monitoring and assessment across Jordan.
The RSS is one of the largest applied research institution, consultancy and technical support service provider in Jordan and is a regional leader in the fields of science and technology. The RSS advocates for a customer–centric approach and demonstrates an unwavering commitment to the people of Jordan.
Hosted by UN-Habitat, GWOPA helps water operators help one another to provide quality services to all.
GWOPA is an international network created in 2009 to support water operators through Water Operator’s Partnerships (WOPs). WOPs are peer support exchanges between two or more water operators, carried out on a not-for-profit basis with the objective of strengthening operators’ capacity and performance to provide a better service to more people.
The project in Jordan will provide valuable insights and experiences that support the work of many water operators involved in combatting and monitoring COVID-19 in cities and communities.
The project is expected to benefit between 70,000 and 80,000 people, including the scientific community in Jordan, water and microbiology researchers directly benefitting from this project is estimated at no less than 1,000.
It is expected that 10,000 will benefit indirectly once the research is published. Residents of the Azraq refugee camp — home to 36,874 registered Syrian refugees — and Jerash refugee camp — home to approximately 30,000 registered Palestinian refugees — approximately 200 wastewater treatment plant staff — as well as officials from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Water and Irrigation.

Title: UN supports Jordan’s enabling SDGs financing ecosystem
Content: 30 January 2021
The United Nations and the Government of Jordan have recently launched a Joint Programme to develop strategic investments to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The two-year program will help accelerate progress towards achieving the SDGs through establishing key building blocks for an Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF), a tool for governments and their partners to finance the SDGs at the national level.
Financed by the UN Joint SDG Fund, the “Jordan- Enabling an SDG Financing Ecosystem” Programme, will support the Government of Jordan to strengthen alignment of climate responsive planning, budgeting and financing, increasing alignment of public and private investments with national SDG priorities and enable new investments and partnerships, while promoting a gender-responsive SDG financing framework.
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Nasser Shraideh said the Government will continue working with partners to support long-term investments needed for the sustainable development agenda.
“Accelerating the realization of the 2030 Agenda and its Goals is a priority for the government of Jordan and has been incorporated into the Government Executive Program (2021-2024). Establishing key building blocks for an Integrated National Financing Framework provided with technical support to Jordan has never been more important than today to protect the development gains and respond to the impact of COVID-19 on the different sectors”, Shraideh added.
This year marks six years since the adoption of the SDGs and the second of a Decade of Action towards achieving the SDGs by 2030. Progress has been made in some areas, such as improving maternal and child health, expanding access to electricity and increasing women’s empowerment. Yet, and since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, some of these advances were offset elsewhere by growing food insecurity, deterioration of the natural environment, and persistent and pervasive inequalities.
“If we want to Leave No One Behind we have to fast track SDG gains that also provide a blueprint for recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Anders Pedersen, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Jordan.
“By placing the focus on integrated policy solutions and incentivizing partners to adopt more strategic financing is timely and critical as it will contribute to accelerating progress towards the SDGs and recovering better from the pandemic,” he added.
The “Jordan- Enabling an SDG Financing Ecosystem” Programme will be implemented by UNDP, UNICEF and UN WOMEN, who will work with the largest investment vehicles in Jordan, including the Social Security Investment Fund (SSIF) while also engaging civil society organizations and the youth. The programme, in partnership with the UN Global Compact Network and Social Value International will support businesses in managing and measuring their impact.
The programme will focus on climate change and gender equality, which are cross-cutting issues that require integrated approaches towards SDG goals and targets. It will also provide the foundation for sustained and systemic change towards crisis preparedness and economic resilience, while adhering to the principle of ‘leave no one behind’.
It is also anchored and supports the recently launched UN Socio-Economic Framework to respond and recover from COVID19 and its five accelerators for Recovering Better from COVID-19.

Title: Community consultation workshop in Downtown Amman to discuss flash floods risks
Content: 27 January 2021
UN Habitat in collaboration with the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) and Future Pioneers, has launched a series of community consultation sessions with the local community in Downtown Amman to discuss the flash floods risks and identify the key priorities based on the local community’s knowledge and experience.
Organised under the “Strengthening the Social Stability and Resilience of Vulnerable Jordanian Communities and Syrian Refugees in Amman Against Flash Floods” project, funded by the Government of Japan, the consultation sessions, aim to strengthen government and community resilience and capacities to better manage flash floods through the implementation of flood resilient infrastructure.
Around 40 participants attended the first workshop, including representatives from GAM, the Chamber of Commerce, residents and Syrian refugees, merchants, and local CBOs.
The consultation sessions with the local community are based on the participatory City Resilience Action Planning tool (CityRAP), which was developed through the collaboration between UN-Habitat and DiMSUR and comprises of a series of participatory meetings and workshops.
The first consultation workshop took place over two days and focused on introducing the participants to the concept of urban resilience. UN-Habitat’s technical consultant Ammar Ismael, introduced the CityRAP tool and explained its ‘five pillars of resilience’- urban governance, urban planning and development, resilient infrastructure and basic services, urban economy and society, and urban disaster risk management. Throughout the workshop, the participants shared their perspectives and first-hand experience in facing flash floods in Amman over the past years.
The project seeks to address the urgent needs of the community by providing a comprehensive and integrated response against flash floods through community consultations and awareness raising. During the coming few weeks, several consultation sessions will be organized with different focus groups from the local community to identify the community’s needs and priorities.
A prioritization workshop will be also held to agree on the top priorities and discuss viable solutions for reducing the identified risks and building resilience against flash floods in the targeted area. Accordingly, one of the identified priorities will be translated into a pilot community green infrastructure project that will be implemented as part of this intervention.

Title: UNODC relaunch the Children Immunization App at Za’atari Refugee Camp
Content: 25 January 2021
UNODC collaborated with the research team at JUST and EMPHNET to launch an updated version of the CImA App, incorporating parenting and caregiving under COVID-19 tools. The Children Immunization App (CImA) in its original version, is a mobile phone application designed to support refugees in Za’atari camp, by i) providing access to trustworthy, evidence-based vaccine information; and ii) recording vaccination history for children according to the Jordanian national vaccination guidelines. Now in its updated format, it would cover valuable UNODC parenting information on the best means to care for children during COVID19 including in crowded and refugee settings (LINK to App).
UNODC has been working on enhancing family skills for the prevention of substance use and violence (including against children) as well as supporting mental health in line with the UNODC WHO International Standards on Drug Use Prevention. Such family skills focus on nurturing positive communication and attachment as well as maintaining age-appropriate rules and discipline to ensure youth’s safe and healthy development.
COVID-19 related stress, either directly from the anxiety linked to the virus, from the preventive modalities around it (including school closure, physical distancing, working from home, etc..) or indirectly from its socio-economic impact on families and communities (ongoing and anticipated) carried a significant toll on vulnerabilities of youth and their immediate families.
This includes vulnerabilities linked to different negative coping mechanisms including substance and alcohol use, violence and more. UNODC developed material to support families under such circumstances with specific requisites for caregivers in crowded or refugee settings.
On a parallel track, the need for children vaccination among refugees is crucial as they may be exposed to crowded locations or low vaccinated areas. Thus, spreading awareness about the health benefits of vaccination, using automated reminders, and reducing the risk of losing their vaccination documents became a high priority. Moreover, Smartphone ownership, Android in particular, among refugees is considered high.
The app was first developed by the Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) and the Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET), in collaboration with the Jordanian Ministry of Health (MoH), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and UNICEF. The seed grant was from Grand Challenges Canada, funded by the Government of Canada. The Za’atari camp, which is considered one of the biggest refugee camps in the Middle East with 80,000 residents, was benefiting from the introduction process of the App and will now expand the usage with its UNODC updated version.
Funded by the Government of Japan, the CImA App is currently updated to include: i) health education sheets provided by UNICEF, ii) registration of the children's vaccination schedule, iii) automated reminder for parents for the upcoming vaccination appointment and iv) automated reminder for the parents in case they missed the vaccination appointment of their child and v) and now parenting skills materials developed by UNODC and translated into Arabic for the parents in the camp to support them during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The collaboration aims to benefit families already subscribed to the app while also including 1000 additional households during a period of two months, to bolster the synergistic outcome the beneficiary families would get from the vaccination as well as the parenting and caregiving content, support parents and children regarding vaccine-preventable diseases and COVID-19 related outcomes. The learning outcome of the piloting of this app could potentially be replicated to many other families in refugee or community settings.

Title: First refugee COVID-19 vaccinations commence in Jordan
Content: 14 January 2021
As part of the national COVID-19 vaccination plan which started this week, anyone living on Jordanian soil, including refugees and asylum seekers, is entitled to receive the vaccine free of charge. Over the coming months, Jordan aims to vaccinate 20 percent of its population against the virus and has currently procured three million doses of the vaccine to enable this to happen.
Raia AlKabasi, an Iraqi refugee living in Irbid, will be among the first refugees to receive the vaccine. “We just want life to be back to normal. The vaccine is the right way of doing this,” she said.
Vaccinations of refugees from Zaatari Camp also started on Thursday, with 43 refugees from the camp travelling to the Department of Chest Infection, health clinic in Mafraq to receive it. Jordan’s Ministry of Health is administering the vaccinations.
From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, refugees have been generously included by the Government of Jordan within the national response plan, able to access health care and medical treatment as any Jordanian citizens can.
The inclusion of refugees within the national vaccination campaign, therefore, builds on this premise as well as the years of experience in hosting refugees, ensuring their health and wellbeing after fleeing conflict.
“Jordan has included refugees in its national response plan since the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic,” said Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR’s Representative to Jordan.
“Reducing the spread of COVID-19 now necessitates that the most vulnerable people in our society and around the world can access vaccines, no matter where they come from. It is with great pride that UNHCR is contributing to the efforts of the Government of Jordan to achieve this,” he added.
Refugees living in urban areas – who represent 80 percent of the refugee population in Jordan - will be able to receive the vaccine at their local health clinic. For those living in the two main refugee camps, UNHCR is working closely with the Ministry of Health to administer the vaccination.
Since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed among refugees in Jordan in September 2020, 1,992 refugees living in refugee camps have tested positive for the virus. Despite this, there are currently only 194 active cases representing an 88 percent recovery rate. The proportion of refugees with COVID-19 has also remained low at 1.6 percent compared to 3 percent among the general Jordanian population.
Close cooperation between UNHCR and the Government of Jordan and Ministry of Health as well as the strong adherence ofrefugees to prevention measures, has been key limiting the spread of the virus among these vulnerable populations. Over 200,000 people have enrolled on the national platform vaccine.jo, UNHCR is currently aware of 53 refugees who have already received vaccination appointments.
With the start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, however, the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis on refugees continues to be of primary concern to UNHCR. It is estimated that poverty among refugees has increased by 18 percent since March 2020, with refugees consistently telling UNHCR that they are struggling to meet their basic needs. Two-thirds say they are unable to afford sufficient food and 60 percent have resorted to borrowing money.
In 2021, UNHCR Jordan is appealing for 370 million USD to help refugees, including to cope with the additional challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: Successful policy dialogue concluded for the education sector in Jordan
Content: 12 January 2021
The Ministry of Education successfully concluded a two day policy dialogue with partners and national stakeholders to assess progress of the National Education Strategic Plan (ESP),  including the impact of COVID-19, lessons learned and impact of the plan implementation.
Under the Ministry’s leadership and with technical support of UNESCO and it’s International Institute for Education Planning (IIEP), this mid-term review of the Education Strategic Plan constitutes an important element of evidence-based decision-making building on the review of progress made and the effectiveness of educational performance against defined goals and objectives.
This policy dialogue brought together MoE decision-makers and key education partners and national stakeholders to reach collective agreements and recommendations for adjustements to the plan for the remaining period of implementation until 2025.
Opening the event, His Excellency the Minister of Education, Dr. Wajih Owais, reiterated the importance of key national plans linked to the Education Strategic Plan, such as the Education During Emergency Plan, the Jordan Response Plan for Syrian Refugees and the Human Resources Development Strategy. Through the mid-term review, the Minister noted that adjustements to the ESP will need to focus on mitigating the impact of the pandemic on learning and to re-identify prioritities  for the up-coming period, as well as needed financial and human resources. The Minister also emphasized the critical aspects of the vocational education and technical skills for quality education for young females and males.
UNESCO Representative to Jordan, Ms. Min Jeong Kim, highligthed during the closing cernemony that “the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how important it is to strengthen systems and capacities to be better prepared to respond to immediate needs in a time of crisis while still focusing on longer strategic goals to build back better in terms of access, equity, inclusion and quality of education.”.
System strengthening is the focus of UNESCO technical support and partnership with the Ministry of Education, including strengthening of the MoE’s Education Management Information System (EMIS), evidence based planning and monitoring, including crisis-senstive planning, and support to the ESP Partnership and Coordination Structure. It is provided through the Multi-Partner Trust Fund to system strengthenig  supported by Canada, Switzerland, Italy and Norway.
As a result of this joint policy dialogue, key strategic directions for the remaining implementation of the Education Strategic Plan were outlined as: the universalization of KG2;  the development of financially and technically sustainable public-private partnership models to ensure school infrastructure expansion to accommodate all children in Jordan and especially the most vulnerable learners, children with disabilities and refugees, at KG, basic and secondary education levels, including vocational education; the increased engagement by the community, field directorates and the central administration in the local school development process; the continued efforts in e-tech and remedial education; and the strengthening of EMIS to allow for evidence-based planning and monitoring.
The meeting was concluded by awarding training certificates to all Ministry of Education members of the Technical Working Groups who led on the different steps of the ESP mid-term review, from data collection, data analysis to recommendations and adjustements discussed at the policy dialogue event.

Title: UNHCR welcomes Jordan's decision to extend validity of refugee and asylum seeker certificates
Content: 20 December 2020
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, welcomes the recent decision by the Government of Jordan to consider Asylum Seeker and Refugee Certificates issued by UNHCR to refugees in Jordan, valid until June 30th, 2021, regardless of the date of expiry.
This decision comes into effect amid the COVID-19 pandemic which has limited UNHCR’s ability to renew refugee and asylum seeker certificates. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, every month 50,000 persons of concern approached UNHCR’s registration centers to renew their Asylum Seeker Certificates, which is an annual requirement for refugees in Jordan. In order to limit large gatherings and prevent the spread of the virus, however, in person renewals ceased in March 2020.
Since March 2020, UNHCR has subsequently commenced remote registration renewal for refugees to update their data and has delivered over 70,000 updated refugee and asylum seeker certificates through this process in line with COVID-19 safety precautions. Despite this, by the end of 2020 it was anticipated that 400,000 persons of concern would be in possession of expired documentation.
Refugees in Jordan rely on their refugee and asylum seeker certificates to access national systems and services, including sending their children to school and getting medical treatment. Additionally, it adds an important security element in terms of freedom of movement, since most refugees and asylum seekers use their certificates as their main form of documentation.
The recent announcement by the Government of Jordan, therefore, was highly needed to allow refugees to continue their everyday lives in dignity, secure in the knowledge that they have the correct documentation to remain in Jordan.
“The Government of Jordan has consistently led the way when it comes to including refugees within national systems and this latest development illustrates the exemplary welcoming attitude of Jordanians even in a crisis situation. UNHCR stands ready to continue to support the Government of Jordan in innovating its refugee response, including by expanding fraud-proof and cost-effective virtual registration modalities” said Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Representative in Jordan.
Over 750,000 refugees are registered with UNHCR in Jordan including 90,000 refugees from non-Syrian nationalities. Living in towns and cities across the Kingdom, life has got progressively harder for many during the COVID-19 pandemic.
With increasing levels of poverty, UNHCR has seen more refugees than ever contact its helplines asking for support since the coronavirus crisis began. Approximately 70,000 calls in November alone were from refugees asking about their registration renewals. This latest announcement, therefore, will bring some peace of mind to vulnerable families who are struggling to meet their basic needs.
In advance of this announcement, UNHCR had recently showcased its innovative and COVID-19 sensitive registration process to the Ministry of Interior and continues its cooperation with the Government in the domain of registration and documentation of refugees across the Kingdom.

Title: Report provides data on out-of-school children in Jordan before COVID-19 pandemic
Content: 17 December 2020
A new report released jointly by UNICEF and the Ministry of Education has shown that the numbers of children not attending primary education in Jordan has remained steady despite the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis, with 4.7 per cent of children aged 6 to 11 years out of school.
A total of 112,016 children in Jordan (6.2 per cent) are out of school from grades 1 to 10. Data shows that most children not in education are of non-Jordanian nationality, including over 50,000 Syrian children, and that boys are more likely to drop out than girls.
“The report shows that the huge efforts made by Government and partners in the decade since the beginning of the Syrian conflict to provide children with their right to an education have played a significant role in protecting boys’ and girls’ futures,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “It is critical that these efforts are continued to mitigate any negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s learning.”
“This report also highlights that further efforts are needed to reach children who are still excluded because of gender, geography, nationality and socio-economic status, and provides recommendations for targeted interventions to support their inclusion and learning,” she added.
The research, which uses data from 2017/18 academic year, includes a profile of the children most likely to drop out before Grade 10:
While there is rarely one reason for why children drop out of school, contributing factors include economic stresses in the household, limited access to inclusive education for children with disabilities, violence in schools, child labour, early marriage and low returns from education in the labour market.
Children dropping out of basic education is costly for both the individual and society. The estimated economic loss due to school dropout before Grade 10 is equivalent to 9.6 per cent of GDP in 2017.
The report makes a number of policy recommendations to increase children’s equitable access to quality basic education, including expanding social protection measures to reduce the cost of attending education, targeted support for girls to reduce the risk of early marriage, ramping up inclusive education and increasing support for drop out and catch up programmes.
UNICEF continues to support the Ministry of Education to provide every child in Jordan with quality and inclusive education. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, UNICEF has also supported the launch of the Learning Bridges blended education programme to accelerate and recover learning.

Title: Overwhelming majority of Jordanians continue to empathize with refugees
Content: 16 December 2020
A new study released today by UNHCR – the UN Refugee Agency – reveals that 94 percent of the Jordanian public view refugees in a positive manner, with the majority stating that they are empathetic towards people forced to flee their country and the challenges they continue to face.
Carried out in coordination with NAMA Strategic Intelligence Solutions, a Jordan-based research institute, the study surveyed, through phone interviews, a sample of Jordanians living in the Amman, Mafraq and Karak Governorates, in order to get an updated analysis of Jordanian public perception of refugees.
When asked about the Jordanian Government’s response towards refugees, over 90% of respondents rated it as positive.
“We have said it time and time again, but the Jordanian public and government continue to lead the way in showing kindness and generosity towards refugees, and we now have the data to back that up,” said UNHCR Representative to Jordan, Dominik Bartsch.
Despite the overwhelming empathy towards refugees, at the same time, the survey reveals that 87 percent of Jordanians believe that there are too many refugees in Jordan and 83 percent say that Jordan has done more than it needs to help refugees.
“It is clear that the Syria crisis has increased pressure on national systems. However, the continued inclusion of refugees in education, health services and the job market is part of the response we jointly put in place with the Government of Jordan. Until refugees can safely go back to their country of origin, support from the international community is critical in providing sustainable solutions for protracted conflicts,” added Bartsch.
As part of the survey, 73 percent of Jordanians stated that they would be willing to personally help refugees in the Kingdom, with 40 percent already having donated money to support the most vulnerable.
Finally, over 92% of respondents also indicated that they have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the deterioration of the economy and increased unemployment. While this did not translate in a direct change of opinion towards refugees, it represents nevertheless an important element to consider in future surveys. In this regard, this first wave of the survey will be followed by two additional waves in 2021 to continue to closely monitor the Jordanian public perception of refugees.

Based on the results of the survey and coinciding with its 30th Anniversary in Jordan, UNHCR confirms its continued commitment to help Jordan bear the burden of hosting refugees and work to achieve solutions which allow refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity.

Title: Royal Scientific Society and UNIDO outline progress of ‘TEST III’ project
Content: 14 December 2020
The Royal Scientific Society (RSS) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Sunday organized a meeting highlighting progress made toward the implementation of the second phase of the EU-funded project "Transfer of Environmentally Sound Technology" (TEST III).

The teleconference was attended by representatives of the European Commission’s delegation in Amman and other national stakeholders.

MED TEST III Project is a sub-component of Switch-Med Program.

The second phase of TEST III aims to extend the progress achieved in the MED TEST II project (2015-2018) to demonstrate the effectiveness and economic growth potential of Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production (RECP)/TEST methodology to additional industry sectors, companies and service providers in Jordan.

An agreement was signed between the UNIDO and the RSS in 2019 to implement the MED TEST III project in Jordan.

To drive forward the adoption of RECP in Jordan, the RSS will implement the project in partnership with the Chambers of Industry, and under the strategic and technical guidance of UNIDO and support of the national focal points from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Supply and the Ministry of Environment.

Enhancing productivity by integrating practices and technology that lead to greater efficiency in the use of natural resources, a reduction of waste and energy consumption, opportunities for innovation and value creation, is central to UNIDO’s TEST approach.

As per the activities conducted until now, 7 companies from the chemical sector, 2 companies from the plastic sector and 6 companies from the food and beverage sector signed agreements with the RSS to demonstrate RECP/TEST assessment.

And 10 additional service providers signed agreements with the RSS to participate in the demonstration of RECP/TEST assessment in the food industries to be qualified to offer the TEST methodology services in Jordan.

Two virtual plenary training introducing TEST approach to all companies together were conducted during October and November, 2020.

Moreover, virtual training package on RECP/TEST was provided to 13 university professors from 6 universities in September, 2020 to initiate the cooperation in establishing a national scheme to support RECP integration in academia. Additionally, a virtual awareness-raising workshop on RECP is planned to be conducted for the financial institutions in January 2021.

Finally, it is worth to mention that the project aims at activating the synergy and coordination between stakeholders to setting-up a national support scheme for mobilizing technical assistance to industry in the area of RECP leveraging on national fund and donors, and the introduction of specific national policy instruments for RECP in industry.

Title: UNESCO, Education Ministry, and GIZ launch “Towards Greater Inclusion and Diversity in Education in Jordan” project
Content: 10 December 2020
Under the leadership of the Ministry of Education (MoE) and in partnership with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), UNESCO launched the project “Towards Greater Inclusion and Diversity in Education in Jordan”. The initiative will closely coordinate and collaborate with the Higher Council on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in ensuring improved access to and inclusive quality education for all.
This project seeks to provide technical assistance and specialized expertise to the Ministry of Education in their efforts towards inclusion, in line with the goals and priorities outlined in the National 10-Years Strategy for Inclusive Education 2020-2030 and the Education Strategic Plan 2018-2022.
In 2019, GIZ developed jointly with the MoE a 3-year programme ‘Promoting quality in inclusive education in Jordan-PROMISE’, funded through the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). ‘PROMISE’ aims at improving equal access to and quality of primary and secondary public schools in Jordan. The programme focuses on schoolchildren from KG2 to Grade 10 with particular focus on children living with disabilities. In this framework, UNESCO will support two main components of the PROMISE programme related to system strengthening and capacity development.
Ms. Costanza Farina, UNESCO Representative to Jordan “With the world having just celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 3 December, and with the upcoming 60th anniversary of the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, UNESCO is excited to engage in this new partnership and contribute to inclusive and quality education for all”
This new partnership will assist the MoE in improving access to and quality in education for all children and youth regardless of their gender, abilities, disabilities, backgrounds and circumstances. The first activity of this partnership, which was initiated this week, is an Institutional Capacity Needs Assessment on Inclusive Education in Jordan. This participatory process will be used to collect data and information on how the competencies of institutions can be strengthened to provide better services. The findings will inform the formulation of a capacity development strategy, as well as, to raise awareness on the rights of all children to quality education in more inclusive and diverse educational settings in Jordan.
Ms. Stephanie Petrasch, GIZ Head of Education in Jordan stated ‘The collaboration between UNESCO and GIZ will enhance the support to our partners on the topic of inclusive education. A lot of promises have been made, the foundations are there but still not all children have access to quality education. But together we will create capacities in the Jordan education system to provide the necessary skills and knowledge for inclusive schools.’  This project will contribute to advancing the Education 2030 Framework for Action, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), specifically SDG 4 on ‘ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning for all’; SDG 5 on gender equality; SDG 10 on reducing inequalities within countries; and SDG 16 on peace, justice, and strong institutions. This latter SDG also focuses on reducing discrimination against persons with disabilities, and ensuring that decision-making processes on all levels are responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative of all, including persons with disabilities and their organizations.

Title: UNHCR marks 30 years of protecting refugees in Jordan
Content: 09 December 2020
Thirty years after it first opened an office in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, UNHCR – the UN Refugee Agency – is launching a virtual timeline detailing key moments and historical events which have affected refugee lives in Jordan.
As a result of the First Gulf War, UNHCR began responding to the protection needs of refugees fleeing Iraq in 1990. Prior to that, the refugee presence in the Kingdom had been small, managed by the UNHCR regional bureau operating out of Cairo. The increasing influx of refugees arriving in Jordan, however, required a specialized response, one that was also separate than that of UNRWA which was overseeing the Palestinian refugees. By the end of 1995, almost 20,000 refugees had registered with UNHCR.
Today, Jordan hosts 750,000 refugees – the second largest number of refugees per capita in the world – who mainly fled from wars and unrests in Syria and Iraq but also from less known conflicts in countries such as Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.
“When my predecessors first opened a UNHCR Jordan office in 1990, they would have hardly foreseen the scale of refugee influxes to come,” reflects UNHCR Representative to Jordan, Dominik Bartsch. “But thirty years on, we are still staying and delivering,” he adds.
Since the beginning, UNHCR has worked closely with the Government of Jordan to deliver protection services and urgent humanitarian aid to those fleeing conflict. From beginning of cash as a form of humanitarian assistance in 2006, the introduction of biometric data collection in registering and documenting refugees in 2012 and the opening of the first solar power plant in a refugee camp in the world in 2017, Jordan has continued to innovate and lead the way globally in how it responds to refugees.
In recent years, however, the increasing protracted nature of conflicts and refugee situations has seen a transition from a purely humanitarian to an increasingly development-oriented response, amid renewed appeals to international donors for support, including to revamp strained local services in areas such as education, health and water and sanitation.
“As the UN refugee agency, our aim is to get to a point when we are no longer needed,” states Bartsch. “We want to see a world where solutions have been found and refugees can return home in safety and dignity.”
Despite this, the reality is that at the end of 2020, the needs of refugees in Jordan are greater than ever and the search for solutions remains elusive for many of them. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNHCR and other international organizations have observed refugees scale back into poverty as many have lost their livelihoods and become increasingly dependent on humanitarian organizations to meet their basic needs.
In response, UNHCR is re-emphasizing calls for international community to stand in solidarity with Jordan and its people, as they continue to bear the burden of hosting significant numbers of refugees with limited resources.

Title: UNOPS supports rehabilitation of Al-Amal Social Care Centre for multiple disabilities in Jordan
Content: 08 December 2020
The Ministry of Social Development (MoSD), the European Union (EU) and UNOPS marked the opening of Al-Amal Care Centre for Multiple Disabilities.
The center was rehabilitated under the “Modernization of the Social Protection Physical Environment” project, which is funded by the EU and implemented by UNOPS, in partnership with MoSD. The project aims at stabilizing Jordan’s macro-economic situation and enhancing Jordan’s social and economic development in line with Jordan Vision 2025, in addition to enhancing Jordan's resilience to deal with the impact of the Syrian crisis and regional instability.
The project will contribute to support social sector reforms and the development of an equitable and inclusive society in Jordan through the improvement and modernization of the quality and performance of the social protection system. So far, 42 centres were rehabilitated in the north, center, and south of Jordan and by the year 2022, up to 100 social care centres more will be rehabilitated to ensure the centers’ accessibility, energy and water efficiency.
Ayman Al-Mufleh, the Minister of Social Development said: “The rehabilitation of the Al-Amal Center for Multiple Disabilities is part of the project to promote social integration, which will work on the rehabilitation and maintenance of 100 social care centers affiliated with the Ministry of Social Development to improve safety and protection and facilitate access for people with disabilities. Noting that the total cost of the entire modernization of the rehabilitation and maintenance project for the centers amounts to $ 5 million".
Maria Hadjitheodosiou, Ambassador of European Union to Jordan stated: “The rehabilitation of the Al Amal Centre for Multiple Disabilities, which we are marking today, is another example of the close cooperation and partnership of the European Union with the Ministry of Social Development in the efforts to ensure the full and equal participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of life in Jordan.  It is also a signal of our continuous commitment to ensure human dignity to the most vulnerable groups in society”.
“The education and accommodation services provided by the Al-Amal Care Centre for Multiple Disabilities represent an opportunity for children with disabilities to attain essential skills and enable them to have a better life”, said Bana Kaloti, UNOPS Regional Director for the Middle East.
In 2021, UNOPS will commence the activities for the development of a Monitoring and Evaluation based Management Information System, which will strengthen the Ministry’s capabilities to monitor the services extended to the beneficiaries and enhance the management of the service quality.

Title: Cyberbullying campaign launched to protect young people online
Content: 02 December 2020
The National Council for Family Affairs (NCFA) and UNICEF launched a new campaign “The new epidemic at the time of the pandemic” to curb the effects of cyber bullying on children.

This campaign is the latest in a series of campaigns since 2017 from NCFA and UNICEF to end all forms of violence against children. Cyberbullying has increased 60-80 per cent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the campaign aims to increase awareness among caregivers, parents and children - while also providing preventative tools.

Speaking at the launch, Tanya Chapuisat, Representative said: “Child rights must be at the forefront of digital safety and protection policies, especially at this critical time when children and youth are spending more time than ever online. UNICEF is committed to supporting NCFA to empower children to stay safe and protected online, while also educating parents and communities on digital safety and reporting mechanisms.”

Title: National Council for Family Affairs and UNICEF launch a campaign on Cyber Bullying “the new epidemic at the time of the pandemic”
Content: 02 December 2020
The National Council for Family Affairs and UNICEF launched a campaign titled “the new epidemic at the time of the pandemic” to curb the effects of cyber bullying on children, as the number of children cyber bullied during the pandemic rose to 64% according to a recent study conducted by UNICEF Jordan, making it one of the challenges of our times at the same time being an irreplaceable tool for education and work.  This increase in usage calls for educating caregivers and children, and providing tools for the protection of children.
Dr. Mohammad Miqdadi, Secretary General of the National Council for Family Affairs (NCFA) stated: This campaign comes as the latest in a series of campaigns on violence against children that were jointly launched by the NCFA and UNICEF Jordan since 2017, as well as the National Plan for limiting violence against children that was launched in 2018 and adopted by various ministries and the Public Security Directorate.  Miqdadi also drew attention to a recent study by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission that showed an increase in cyber bullying between 60-80% since the start of the pandemic, where it has become necessary to carry out a campaign to increase awareness as well as educate people on the prevention tools as well as the possible interventions available on cyber bullying on social media platforms, chatting applications and online gaming.
The objective of this national online campaign is to increase the awareness generally on the subject of cyber bullying as well as safety on the internet, as well as providing prevention tools.  It is also intended to create an online conversation amongst caregivers on one side, and teenagers on the other, and encouraging all to take a stand against it as well.  Furthermore, it aims at providing the caregivers with the tools to limit the possibility of cyber bullying and a call for safe internet for children and special attention to those in weaker positions such as women, children and those with disabilities.
Ms. Tanya Chapuisat, country representative for UNICEF Jordan said “child rights must be at the forefront of digital safety and protection policies, especially at this critical time when children and youth are spending more time than ever online. UNICEF is committed to supporting NCFA to empower children to stay safe and protected online, while also educating parents and communities on digital safety and reporting mechanisms.”
This anti cyber bullying campaign comes within a national strategy (2019-2021) for the limitation of violence against children, and this is also a main priority of UNICEF during the pandemic.  It has become vital to shed light on cyber bullying and this specialized online campaign is a result of that; to direct children and caregivers on the types of cyber bullying, its effects and reporting mechanisms.  Furthermore, as the world celebrates World Children’s Day and the 16th day of Activism to end violence against women and girls, there is a responsibility and role for all to make sure that children and women’ rights are at the forefront of digital safety and protection policies.
Al Mamlaka TV supported the campaign by holding a live ‘virtual’ panel discussion about cyber bullying that addressed the different dimensions related to this issue in order to raise awareness and provide solutions in an effort to reduce it in society. The panel featured stakeholders and experts through the participation of His Excellency Ahmad Hanandeh, Minister of Digital Economy & Entrepreneurship and Her Excellency Haifa Al Najjar; senator and the Superintendent of the Ahliyyah School for Girls and the Bishop’s School for Boys.  Major Anas Al-Halahleh, head of the Cyber Crime Unit provided valuable information as well as Advocate Sakher Al Khasawneh, where Ms Rasha Al Jazi shed further light on the issues through her experience as an educational counselor.
This came about as a result of the news channel’s commitment and dedication to advance national campaigns and support them by presenting information to the audience.  The campaign’s introductory film was featured on the program as well as Al Mamlaka’s online presence on social media platforms, making them a strong partner in furthering the outreach of this campaign.
The campaign will continue for 30 days on the social media channels of UNICEF Jordan and NCFA.

Title: The EU joins forces with ILO, UNHCR, and UNICEF to enhance vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees’ access to dignified livelihood opportunities
Content: 01 December 2020
Through the EU Regional Trust Fund in response to the Syrian crisis – the EU Madad Fund –  the European Union (EU) is working in partnership with the ILO, UNHCR, and UNICEF to support access to an inclusive national social protection system and decent job opportunities for both vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees.
With a total investment of €59 million implemented over the course of three years, this joint programme strengthens the self-reliance of vulnerable Jordanians and refugees. Through cash assistance linked to skills-building and productive inclusion initiatives, vulnerable populations in Jordan will be provided with opportunities to transition to more sustainable livelihood prospects.
Cash assistance is considered one of the most important protection options for people facing protracted displacement like the refugees in Jordan, allowing them to meet their needs in a dignified manner, whilst contributing to the Jordanian economy. Of the €59 million EU contribution, €45 million will complement the UNHCR’s ongoing Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF), which identifies the most vulnerable refugees and provides them with multi-purpose cash assistance. It will enable the UNHCR to continue providing this support to around 33,000 refugee families every month, whose needs and challenges have become even more critical during the COVID-19 emergency.
In parallel to the cash assistance support, an additional aid of €14 million to a partnership between ILO and UNICEF will support the implementation of the Jordanian National Social Protection Strategy (2019-2025). The aim is to contribute to the strengthening of a sustainable social protection system – including reinforcing links between social protection and employment – for both Jordanians and refugees. The ILO- UNICEF partnership will also facilitate the transition from cash assistance to dignified livelihoods opportunities through a holistic approach of interventions, which includes skills development and counselling for sustainable employment within decent work principles.
As the EU Ambassador to Jordan, H.E. Maria Hadjitheodosiou, pointed out: “The economic downturn linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the protracted crisis, is significantly impacting Jordan, leaving thousands of families with limited access to livelihoods. The EU is committed to working with partners to support the Government of Jordan in its effort to strengthen its national social protection system and to make it more accessible.”
With social protection being a key priority for both the EU and the UN, this programme aims to build on the strategic partnership with the Ministry of Social Development. This partnership embeds joint commitments to enhance coordination, integrated planning and monitoring of the Government’s efforts in the social protection and employment sectors within the scope of the National Social Protection Strategy. Implementing UN Agencies are coordinating with respective Government partners for setting the programme’s priorities.

The Netherlands marked the Prospects Partnership in Jordan today, together with the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation of Jordan, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank.
In the framework of her virtual visit to Jordan, H.E. Ms. Sigrid Kaag, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, expressed her commitment to this multi-annual partnership during her meeting today with Jordanian Minister for Planning and International Cooperation, H.E. Mr. Nasser Shraideh.
With refugees accounting for more than 10 percent of Jordan’s population, and in a global context of refugee and forced displacement situations being increasingly longer-term, the five partners and the Netherlands pledge to build on each other’s strengths and look for sustainable solutions to forced displacement, in close coordination with the Government of Jordan.
The Partnership in Jordan aims to provide conditions for refugees and host communities to access quality primary education and vocational training; secure and retain decent employment; and benefit from a strengthened protection framework. In line with the Government of Jordan’s efforts to build a more inclusive and productive society, self-reliance and empowerment of vulnerable communities lie at the very heart of the Prospects partnership.
Speaking at the launch of the Propsects partnership in Jordan, H.E. Mr. Nasser Shraideh, said “We hope that the Prospects Partnership initiative effectively contributes and supports Jordan in its response to the impact of the existing and emerging challenges for improving the services provided to refugees and the vulnerable Jordanians in the host communities.
Over the implementation of the Prospects Partnership, we also look forward to learning from the enriched experience of the Netherlands through a close cooperation and engagement with our social partners and the private sector to best respond to these challenges and needs.”
In addition, H.E. Minister Shraideh, on behalf of the Government of Jordan, thanked the Kingdom of the Netherlands for providing this support and for the cooperation of the international organizations in this initiative to achieve the desired goals.
Also speaking at the launch, H.E. Ms. Sigrid Kaag noted “The Prospects partnership is aimed at effective collaboration, sharing data, and leveraging expertise. Through close cooperation with the Jordanian government, Prospects partners are contributing to the development and self-resilience of people and communities.”
The partnership is a five-year initiative with first joint programming initiated in 2018. The Netherlands will be investing 74 million euros in the partnership in Jordan until 2023.
The Netherlands, as the donor to the Partnership, pledges multi-year support to operationalise a development response to forced displacement situations.
The World Bank  commits to invest in education, livelihoods, private sector development, social protection, and service delivery, including by supporting progressive policies for refugees.
The International Finance Corporation commits to bring  private sector solutions to refugees and host communities to the Partnership.
UNICEF will strengthen national and regional capacities to provide education, social protection, youth services and child protection for vulnerable children and youth.
ILO will work to strengthen inclusive socio-economic growth and decent work. It will continue to support the improvement of working conditions for refugees and host community members; support workers to gain skills and certification for better jobs; improve labour market governance, and promote a smooth transition to formal employment.
UNHCR, through the Partnership, will ensure the continued protection of refugees whilst also supporting refugee access to sustainable solutions. In line with this goal, a key aspect of UNHCR’s work within the partnership focuses on supporting continued access to registration and legal documentation for refugees across the country, especially during the COVID-19 emergency through remote modalities.
The other countries benefiting from the Partnership are Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan and Ethiopia. The Netherlands has pledged to invest €500 million in the Partnership up until 2023.

Title: World Children’s Day goes virtual in Jordan during COVID-19
Content: 20 November 2020
World Children’s Day, UNICEF’s annual day of action for children by children, will be celebrated online across Jordan today as the event goes virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Highlights will include a day of fun, live events for children and their parents on social media, including storytelling and drama, and an interactive talk on how to be a youth activist featuring young changemakers in Jordan working on climate action and mental health.
“This year, the COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a child rights crisis. On World Children’s Day, we are inviting all generations to come together to reimagine the kind of world we want to create for children and youth,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “UNICEF will continue to support the Government of Jordan to deliver a sustainable recovery with children at its heart.”
Famous landmarks, including Petra, the Citadel and Jerash, will join other global landmarks in going blue for child rights and a special augmented reality video will premiere online, showcasing Jordan’s rich architectural heritage.
A World Children’s Day Illustration Challenge run by UNICEF has seen children, youth and local artists come together to reimagine a better world for children through incredible works of art showcased on social media, while a local artist will unveil a special mural in Amman celebrating children’s ideas for building back better.
The longer the COVID-19 crisis persists, the deeper its impact on children’s education, health, nutrition and well-being. UNICEF is calling for children and youth to be at the heart of the recovery so that their voices are heard to help create a more equal, just and sustainable world.
UNICEF has released a 6-point action plan to help drive recovery for children including: improving learning; making vaccines available to every child; ending violence against children and protecting mental health; increasing access to safe water and sanitation and addressing climate change; strengthening social protection; and focusing on the most vulnerable for an equitable future.

Title: Qatar Charity supports critical UNICEF WASH response in Jordan
Content: 04 November 2020
Critical support from Qatar Charity to UNICEF has helped to provide safe water and sanitation to over 75,000 Syrian refugees in Za’atari refugee camp since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The support from Qatar Charity has helped UNICEF to provide safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services to refugees in the camp. It has also enabled UNICEF to rapidly scale up its WASH response to respond to COVID-19 and recent heatwaves, ensuring that daily water allowance are increased to help keep refugee families safe and protected.
“Water is an extremely precious resource in Jordan and UNICEF is very grateful to  Qatar Charity for their continued support to UNICEF, which has been critical to providing one of the most efficient and sustainable water and sanitation services in a refugee camp anywhere in the world,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
The generous contribution from Qatar Charity supports the operation of the extensive water and wastewater network in Za’atari refugee camp – including the effective management of three boreholes and eight pumping stations, as well as a wastewater treatment plant.
Awareness raising on proper handwashing, hygiene measures in the household and water conservation are also carried out with refugees in the camp through regular information dissemination and campaigns.
Qatar Charity has contributed a total of US$ 1 million to UNICEF in Jordan in 2020 to provide lifesaving services for children.

Title: UNICEF launches appeal to prevent devastating winter for children
Content: 02 November 2020
With cold weather conditions due imminently, UNICEF has launched a US$ 6 million Winter Children’s Appeal to help prevent a devastating winter for vulnerable families in Jordan whose coping mechanisms have been decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The appeal will target over 64,000 children most in-need, including Syrian refugees, with warm winter clothing and cash assistance to support families through the cold winter months.
“UNICEF’s winter assistance provides much-needed hope during the cold, winter months to children who have already faced enormous challenges to their education and wellbeing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
UNICEF’s Hajati cash assistance - that has consistently supported 30,000 children to continue their learning throughout the COVID-19 pandemic - will target 34,500 children with an emergency winter cash payment to support them and their families during the coldest months, easing the financial burden of increased heating and clothing costs.
To support economic recovery efforts and provide income-generating opportunities for those who have been hardest hit by the secondary impacts of the pandemic, UNICEF’s 30,000 children’s winter clothing kits will be produced in Jordan by youth and women employed by social enterprises.
UNICEF will leverage its network of community-based Makani centres to distribute clothing kits to the most vulnerable children, identified through newly carried out assessments. Each kit contains a thermal set, warm sweater, trousers, jacket, wooly hat, gloves, scarves, socks and winter shoes.
COVID-19 related measures have compounded an already difficult situation for families living in poverty. A recent survey found that twice as many households are existing on an income of less than 100 JD (140 USD) a month compared to before the pandemic. Eight out of 10 families have also adopted negative coping mechanisms, including increasing debt and child labour.
Winters in Jordan are harsh, with frequent snow and freezing sub-zero temperatures. For vulnerable families, the coldest months can lead to a doubling of their budget to cover heating, winter clothes, food and medicine. UNICEF’s winter appeal will help to meet the urgent needs of the most vulnerable children in the country.

Title: EU supports WHO to develop Jordan’s primary health care services under COVID-19
Content: 02 November 2020
Under the “Jordan Health Programme for Syrian Refugees and Vulnerable Jordanians”, the European Union (EU) has committed €43 million to support the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s efforts to strengthen Jordan’s primary healthcare services.
The funds will allow the WHO to support the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and improve primary health care, while expanding access to services to vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees.
This three-year long programme funded by the EU, through its Regional Trust Fund in response to the Syrian crisis, “Madad”, includes, among other actions, support to the immediate needs of the Ministry of Health in response to COVID-19, as identified in the National Preparedness and Response Plan to COVID-19.
This support includes two main components:
— Improving primary health care, vaccine-preventable disease immunisation and surveillance, and COVID-19 preparedness and response. As part of this, more than 230,000 doses of influenza vaccines, worth around €1.2 million, will be distributed by the Ministry of Health in a timely manner, to help reduce the burden on Jordan’s health system.
— Improving the public health system and providing sustainable health financing to strengthen government capacity therein, as well as supporting the effort to review the health approaches within the Ministry of Health, in particular to develop a costed and long-term strategy that “aims to leave no one behind”.
EU Ambassador to Jordan Maria Hadjitheodosiou commended the programme for its timely support to Jordan’s health sector in its effort to fight COVID-19.
“The EU is aware of the enormous pressure of COVID-19 on the health sector in Jordan. As part of our ‘Team Europe’ response we will continue to sustain the provision of health services to vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees,” Hadjitheodosiou said.
“Protecting health by ensuring essential health services and supporting health systems is a critical component of UN Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19,” stated Maria Cristina Profili - WHO Representative to Jordan.
The Health Programme provides routine vaccines, cold chain equipment, cars for the Ministry of Health’s vaccination teams to reach population in remote areas, laboratory equipment and COVID-19 diagnostic kits to expand the Central Public Health Laboratory testing capability, personal protective equipment for health workers and rapid response teams conducting contact tracing, flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines – when available.
Effective coordination between WHO, the Ministry of Health, key health partners, and the donor community has been a key element that ensures success, as well as effective preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and successful support to critical Primary Health Care activities,.

Title: On World Food Day, FAO, WFP call for action to improve production, distribution systems
Content: 18 October 2020


On the 16 October, World Food Day, celebrated in over 150 countries around the world, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Jordan are calling for action to improve food production and distribution systems to reduce waste, avoid alarming surges in the level of global hunger and help people better withstand shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the ‘State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020’ report produced by FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, over 2 billion people do not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. 135 million people across 55 countries and territories experience crisis levels of acute food insecurity and require urgent food, nutrition and livelihoods assistance.
According to the 2019 Global Hunger Index, a tool designed to measure and track hunger at global, regional, and national levels in countries with sufficient data to calculate Global Hunger Index scores, Jordan ranks 43rd out of 107 with a score of 8.8; Jordan has a level of hunger that is low. However, the latest joint WFP and FAO assessment on food security in Jordan implemented in partnership with IFAD and the World Bank showed that 19 percent of refugees in Jordan are now food insecure, compared with 14% in 2018; a concerning increase that highlights the rising vulnerability and the need to help such families improve their food security.
Building food security is in line with the remarks made by His Majesty King Abdullah II Ibn Al Hussein at the plenary session of the 75th United Nations General Assembly in September, where he emphasised the importance of safeguarding the environment and responding to the threats to food security which put vulnerable refugees and Jordanian communities living in poverty at risk.
The need for concerted action to improve agricultural production while enhancing global supply chains and ending food waste is captured in this year’s World Food Day theme: “Grow, Nourish, Sustain. Together. Our Actions are our Future.” It communicates the message that, after a period of decline, world hunger is on the rise again.
FAO and WFP in Jordan have a long-term presence in Jordan, working with the Government to improve agriculture and support rural communities including farmers. Both agencies have further intensified their activities in response to COVID-19 due to the increased vulnerability of impoverished communities dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods.
One of WFP and FAO’s main partners working on food security in Jordan is the National Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition whose president, HRH Princess Basma Bint Talal works closely with both agencies to advocate for achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (2) – Zero Hunger.
This day also marks the 75th anniversary of FAO, unique timing as countries around the world address the widespread effects of the pandemic. FAO was founded on 16 October 1945 and has worked in over 130 countries worldwide to further agricultural knowledge and nutritional wellbeing and help grow, nourish and sustain the gifts of our soils, the livelihoods of our people and the legacy of our planet.
World Food Day is a time to look to the future we need to build together. No one government or organisation can achieve these goals alone. Now more than ever, there is a need for global solidarity to help all people, especially the most vulnerable, confront the crises facing the planet – multiple conflicts, climate change and COVID-19.

Title: WFP resumes school feeding for Jordanian and refugee children
Content: 03 October 2020
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in partnership with the Ministry of Education resumed its school feeding activities to support targeted Jordanian and refugee children currently attending schools across the country.
WFP has been supporting the Ministry of Education with the delivery of the National School Feeding Programme (NSFP) since 2013 and delivers around 41 million school snacks every year to children between the first and sixth grades. The project targets 1,878 schools located in poverty pockets across the country, providing around 420,000 of the most vulnerable Jordanian and refugee children with nutritious snacks during their school day every year. However, due to the pandemic and measures taken to protect children at schools, numbers this semester vary based on school status and children’s attendance.
The programme provides children with two types of snacks; date bars or a healthy meal. The date bars are distributed to 332,000 children in 1,565 schools located across all 12 governorates in Jordan. The nutritious bars account for 50 percent of the snacks distributed each semester by the Ministry of Education under the NSFP; and are fortified with vitamins and minerals addressing typical micronutrient requirements.
On the other hand, the healthy meals are distributed to 87,000 children in more than 300 schools, including all children attending formal schools in the Syrian refugee camps. The meal consists of a fresh savoury pastry, a cucumber and a piece of fruit; either a banana or an apple.
“Our goal is to help children continue their education by providing them with nutritious food during their school day. The snacks support learning by helping children concentrate on their lessons rather than their hunger, foster healthy eating habits, and support impoverished families, especially during these difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Jonathan Campbell, WFP’s Deputy Country Director to Jordan. “In parallel, the healthy kitchens also support the local economy by purchasing the raw ingredients for the meals from small local farmers”, he added.
The meals are made in 17 productive kitchens located in eight governorates across the country. WFP’s partner, the Royal Health and Awareness Society, operates 11 kitchens in communities, while the six kitchens in both Zaatari and Azraq refugee camps are run by World Vision. The kitchens provide job opportunities for around 700 workers from vulnerable communities, especially women and people with disabilities.
WFP and partners are taking all measures against COVID-19 to ensure the safety and health of school children and workers involved in the process of production and distribution of snacks. Kitchens have been sterilised before the production processes began, while protocols have been setup and are being followed by all; adhering to all prevention measures and using personal protective equipment at all times.
WFP counts on the continued and generous support of donors to continue making sure these children have access to nutritious snacks during their school day.

Title: 1 million vulnerable Jordanians, refugees to benefit from WFP activities by 2022
Content: 22 September 2020
One million vulnerable Jordanians and refugees will benefit from the United Nations World Food Programme’s (WFP) activities in Jordan under their three-year strategy endorsed by the government of Jordan as represented by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC).
In line with national priorities and the Jordan Response Plan, WFP will support Jordan in its response to existing and future crises, building resilience through social protection and livelihood support for the most vulnerable while contributing to enhanced food security and promoting innovation. The activities have particular emphasis on empowering women, youth, and people with disabilities.
Commenting on the strategy, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Wissam Rabadi confirmed Jordan’s belief in the importance in maintaining food security.
He highlighted what was said by His Majesty King Abdullah in his address to the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on Jordan’s readiness to operate as a regional hub for food security.
With a budget of almost JD500 million ($700 million) over three years funded by various international donors, this strategy outlines the support WFP will provide to the government of Jordan in realising the goals of its Vision 2025 and achieve Agenda 2030 as well as in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2 (Zero Hunger) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), but also SDG1 (No Poverty), 4 (Quality Education), 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work Opportunities) and 13 (Climate Action).
The strategy covers seven different activities, all working to ensure the food security of one million vulnerable people across the Kingdom, through direct assistance, support to education and building the capacity of vulnerable households to earn their own income.
WFP works with around 30 partners to implement the activities, including government ministries, national and international NGOs as well as the communities themselves.
To facilitate the smooth implementation of the WFP activities and ensure coordination and regular exchange of information with all government partners, a Steering Committee, co-chaired by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation and WFP, attended by line ministries, was established to review the strategy and goals of the WFP operations, as well as their implementation.
The first meeting was held on Wednesday, chaired by Rabadi and WFP’s Deputy Country Director Jonathan Campbell in the presence of Education Minister Tayseer Nueimi, Minister of Environment and Acting Minister of Agriculture Saleh Kharabsheh, Minister of Social Development Basma Ishaqat and ‏Secretary General of Ministry of Labour Farouk Al Hadidi‏.
WFP’s representatives presented updates on the strategic plan, highlighting achievements and major challenges and discussed with the committee future priorities in light of emerging challenges such as COVID-19.
Participants thanked WFP for their work, noting both the contribution to the Jordanian community and the closer linkage with the government under this strategy.
All agreed that in the current circumstances of the pandemic, implementation will be challenging but the activities are relevant and necessary.

Title: Jordanian Scientist wins UNHCR Nansen Middle East and North Africa Award
Content: 21 September 2020
Jordanian scientist and founder of local organization ‘We Love Reading’, Rana Dajani, has been named as this year’s UNHCR Nansen Award Winner for the Middle East and North Africa as a result of her efforts in encouraging both refugee and Jordanian children to read for pleasure.
Started in Jordan in 2006, Dajani began We Love Reading with the goal of establishing a library in every neighborhood in Jordan, starting with her own in the capital Amman. After her storytelling sessions at the local mosque proved successful in encouraging parents to read to their children, a grassroots movement emerged and We Love Reading has since grown into a global organization operating in 56 countries around the world.
In Jordan, under the leadership of Dajani, the organization has trained over 4,000 refugees and Jordanians to become ‘Reading Ambassadors’, individuals in the community who are dedicated to inspire children with an enthusiasm for reading. Working across the Kingdom, as well as in refugee camps, it is this core work and Dajani’s continued passion for supporting children of all nationalities which has led to her being awarded with this year’s Nansen Award for the Middle East and North Africa.
“Regardless of where you come from or what language you speak, learning to read and enjoy the magic of books is an essential part of childhood. But Dajani and We Love Reading have gone far beyond this in also creating hope for generations of refugee and Jordanian children. For this reason, we are proud to award her with the UNHCR’s 2020 MENA Nansen Award,” commented Carolyn Ennis, UNHCR Deputy Representative to Jordan.
UNHCR’s Nansen Award is an annual accolade that celebrates those who have gone to extraordinary lengths to support refugees and asylum seekers, stateless persons, and the internally displaced. These are the everyday heroes going to extraordinary lengths to help forcibly displaced people in great need. It is named in honor of Norwegian explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen, the first High Commissioner for Refugees appointed by the League of Nations in 1921.
Supported by the Embassies of Norway and Switzerland in Jordan, UNHCR is honored to celebrate the achievements and inspirational work of Rana Dajani. It is worth noting that the last two MENA Nansen regional winners, local volunteer Abeer Khreisha in 2019 and the NGO Reclaim Childhood in 2018, were also coming from Jordan, recognizing the extraordinary response put in place to the refugee presence in the Kingdom.
“I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Rana Dajani and We Love Reading for being awarded the Nansen Award 2020 for the Middle East and North Africa. Dr Dajani has demonstrated how small steps can make a real difference in each person’s life and in the community. Reading is a fantastic tool to encourage critical thinking, spread joy and stimulate creativity and entrepreneurship among Jordanian and refugee children,” commented Tone Allers, the Norwegian Ambassador in Jordan.
“I congratulate Rana Dajani on winning this year's Nansen Prize in the MENA region and thank her for her tireless efforts to bring the beauty of reading to children in Jordan,” said Lukas Gasser, the Swiss Ambassador to Jordan.

Title: Ministry of Education and UNICEF launch “Learning Bridges” to help one million children recover learning in Jordan
Content: 20 September 2020
The Ministry of Education launched on 20 September "Learning Bridges" program, an innovative blended learning programme, supported by UNICEF, to help one million students recover and accelerate their learning following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Learning Bridges” is a series of weekly activities based on the core curriculum that will be distributed by schools to all students from Grades 4 to 9 to accelerate children and young people’s learning and support parents, teachers, students and communities to work together to adapt to the new normal of combining learning at home and school.
Minister of Education, Dr Tayseer Al-Nuaimi affirmed that “learning Bridges is an innovative solution that enables students to recover and accelerate their learning whether schools are open, partially closed or closed. It does so by effectively bridging the link between home and school, technology and textbooks, knowledge and applied learning. Together with UNICEF, the Ministry is making this resource available for every teacher, parent and student from Grade 4 to 9 in Jordan.”
He added that "learning bridges" program is complementary to DARSAK II platform, and the weekly learning activities included in the program shall enable students to apply the concepts covered by the platform practically. Such activities are in line with the weekly curriculum. These activities also help to enhance educational concepts in Curriculum and addressing previous learning gaps, indicating that the initiative enables parents and teachers to support their children in compensating for educational losses.
The minister further explained that education is enhanced by employing a comprehensive, cross-curricular approach, whereby students receive a printed activity sheet that connects the key learning outcomes of the four core subjects (Arabic, English, Mathematics and Science) provided for in the curriculum for that week. Every child is going to receive printed materials, links to additional on-line resources from the school that would enhance the learning process.
He also called on teachers, parents, students and schools to employ and invest in these learning materials, so that we build together bridges between schools and homes and between textbooks, technology and knowledge, in order to achieve life-based learning.  Furthermore, the practical aspect of learning is strengthened and the focus shall be on the skill, not the information.
“Children’s learning should never stop, even in the face of a global pandemic like COVID-19,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “UNICEF is proud to support the Ministry of Education to develop this new resource that will help recover and reimagine learning for every child.”

Title: UNICEF donates ventilators to support national COVID-19 response
Content: 17 September 2020
In total, UNICEF has donated close to USD 3 million worth of medical supplies to the Government of Jordan as part of the UN multi-agency support for the National COVID-19 Preparedness & Response Plan 2020.
UNICEF has donated forty ventilators to the Ministry of Health in support of Jordan’s national response to COVID-19.
The Minister of Health, Saad Jaber, during the handover event, stressed the importance of the partnership with UNICEF in supporting the health sector, especially in the face of this global pandemic.
He indicated that these ventilators will contribute to supporting the health sector and treating many patients in intensive care units who are most in need, in addition to enhancing the capacities of hospital staff in combatting the virus.
“The reality is that we will be living with the COVID-19 pandemic for the longer term so it’s critical that we continue to fully equip healthcare services and protect frontline health workers,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan. “UNICEF is committed to supporting the Government of Jordan to continue to strengthen the public health system to respond to this and future pandemics to create a safer world for children.”
Leveraging its global supply chain, UNICEF has provided the forty ICU ventilators, suitable for both paediatric and adult use, to support the national health system deal with any increased caseload of severe COVID-19 cases.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF has scaled up support to the Ministry of Health by providing critical health supplies including PPEs and hand sanitizer for healthcare facilities - procured both locally and globally, based on market availability.
UNICEF is also supporting the COVID-19 national response through risk communication and community engagement campaigns urging people to continue applying preparedness and prevention measures including social distancing, wearing facemasks and practicing proper hygiene, including handwashing.
UNICEF is also supporting the Ministry’s effort to continue essential health services for children that were interrupted during the COVID-19 lockdown, including the vaccination of vulnerable children living in remote and hard-to-reach communities through mobile teams.
In total, UNICEF has donated close to USD 3 million worth of medical supplies to the Government of Jordan as part of the UN multi-agency support for the National COVID-19 Preparedness & Response Plan 2020.
The provision of lifesaving health supplies to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic is generously supported by the Government of Canada.

Title: UN refugee chief concludes Jordan visit with call for solidarity amid COVID crisis
Content: 15 September 2020
“I urge donors to maintain solidarity with Jordan as it deals with the twin threats to health and livelihoods faced by refugees and vulnerable Jordanians alike," Grandi said.
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, continues to ramp up measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among Jordan’s refugee population and is seeking to mobilize additional resources for the country’s overall pandemic response, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said at the conclusion of a two-day visit to the Kingdom on 14-15 September.
The High Commissioner’s visit included meetings with senior government officials, refugees and local Jordanians. His visit came after a recent spike in COVID-19 infections in the country including the first six confirmed cases among Syrians living in the two main refugee camps, Za’atari and Azraq.
“I am grateful to Jordan as a major refugee host country for its continued hospitality and efforts to include refugees in the national health system and coronavirus response plan,” Grandi said.
“I urge donors to maintain solidarity with Jordan as it deals with the twin threats to health and livelihoods faced by refugees and vulnerable Jordanians alike," Grandi added.
Jordan currently hosts around 750,000 registered refugees, including more than 658,000 from the conflict in neighbouring Syria.
UNHCR is working closely with the Government of Jordan to support the humanitarian response to the pandemic and its longer-term economic impact. It has provided protective equipment to hospitals and health clinics, distributed medication to refugees and built quarantine areas in Zaatari and Azraq.
“In addition, we are making sure that whatever resources we mobilize for health care related to the pandemic can be used by everybody – by the refugees and by Jordanians. The virus does not make any distinction and nor should we,” Grandi said.
The affordability of healthcare remains a challenge for many refugees, who often rely on UNHCR to get the treatment they need. In 2020, over US$1 million will be distributed to refugees as part of UNHCR’s cash for health programme and 36,000 refugees referred to hospitals for secondary and tertiary healthcare at a cost of US$5.2 million. Despite this, over 2,000 refugees are currently on UNHCR’s waiting list for medical treatment due to a lack of funds.
The High Commissioner met refugees from Syria and Sudan who were receiving treatment free-of-cost at Luzmila Hospital in the capital Amman, thanks to cooperation between UNHCR and its health care partners.
During his visit, Grandi also met refugee and local Jordanian students benefiting from UNHCR scholarships at Luminus Technical University College in Amman. With only 3 percent of refugees globally able to access higher education, Luminus provides vocational training and diplomas for refugee youth alongside their Jordanian counterparts, then actively matches their skills to employment opportunities upon graduation.
Almost ten years into the Syria conflict, 79 percent of refugees in Jordan live under the poverty line and the coronavirus crisis has only exacerbated this situation. It is estimated that approximately 17 percent of Jordanians and a third of refugees have lost their jobs during the pandemic. As a result, UNHCR is investing in livelihoods programmes to encourage refugees to become self-sufficient and thus contribute to improve the overall economic situation in the Kingdom.
Following his visit to Jordan, Grandi will be continuing onto Syria.

Title: WFP, NAJMAH sign agreement to enhance food security of 7,500 Jordanians, refugees
Content: 09 September 2020
The National Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition (NAJMAH), under the leadership of HRH Princess Basma, and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) on Tuesday signed an agreement to implement a training programme focusing on building the capacity of 1,500 participants.
NAJMAH and the WFP will work together to implement the 10-month project to improve the employability of vulnerable groups by providing participants with access to on-the-job training in vocational areas such as food production, crafts, welding and carpentry and hence improve their employment prospects and thus their food security.
Princess Basma highlighted the importance of the partnership between the WFP and NAJMAH, and building up on the successes achieved through the continuous cooperation between the two sides in fighting hunger, enhancing food security and curbing unemployment.
The princess also commended the expertise that both sides gained in organising cooperation programmes towards the targeted categories and communities.
The on-the-job training will take place at small-and medium-sized enterprises across Jordan to support their recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19.
“The WFP is committed to supporting the government of Jordan’s efforts to adapt and respond to the current socioeconomic challenges and ensure the food security of the most vulnerable families. With NAJMAH, we will invest in young people, equipping them with knowledge and skills to access sustainable employment opportunities to support themselves and their families”, said WFP Deputy Country Director Jonathan Campbell.
The project, which will benefit 7,500 people, aims to enhance the self-reliance of some of the most vulnerable populations in Jordan while also contributing to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
It targets youth between 18 and 40 years of age in Amman, Irbid, Zarqa, Karak and Aqaba, with a special focus on empowering women participants to secure decent employment and income and giving them a full understanding of their rights at work including protection from violence.
NAJMAH and the WFP have implemented a series of training activities in different governorates in Jordan, so far supporting more than 6,000 participants and benefiting around 30,000 beneficiaries through these activities.
All activities performed by NAJMAH and the WFP take the necessary precautions against COVID-19 to ensure the safety of all participants and staff as well as the wider community.

Title: Jordan continues to support refugee education as students head back to school
Content: 03 September 2020
As many refugee students in Jordan complete their first week back at school, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has today released a global report warning about the continued threat of coronavirus to refugee education. Titled ‘Coming Together for Refugee Education, the report urges the international community to take immediate and bold action to prevent the potential catastrophic effects of COVID19 on refugee education.
Jordan, however, is mentioned as one of the countries which continues to lead the way in ensuring refugees can get an education. Included with the national education system, last year 136,000 out of a potential 233,000 school aged Syrian refugee children were enrolled in formal education and over 200 schools continue to operate a two-shift system.
“Collectively, there have been many efforts to ensure there is no lost generation such as through the inclusion of so many refugee children in Jordanian public schools,” commented UNHCR Representative in Jordan, Dominik Bartsch, “With coronavirus, the start of this school year presents additional challenges, but in education there remains hope,” he concluded.
UNHCR Jordan has also recently announced its DAFI Scholarship scheme for refugee students seeking scholarships to begin university this academic year. With applications opening on September 6th and funded by the German Government and Said and Asfari Foundation, the DAFI scholarship in Jordan has already provided over 800 refugee students in access higher education in Jordan since 2007.
The potential of refugee students is huge. This year 1,670 Syrian refugee youth in Jordan passed their Tawjihi, end of high-school exams; 154 of whom achieved grades of 95% or higher. But globally only 3 percent of refugee youth have access to higher education.
In addition to scholarships, in Jordan, partnerships with universities and higher education institutions have been a key mechanism of increasing the ability of refugee students in Jordan to go this university. This year, partnerships with Al Bayt University, Tafila Technical University, The Hashemite University and Al-Ahliyya Amman University, are offering subsidized fees for refugee students rather than them having to pay the high cost of the foreigner rate.
Adapting to the limitations imposed by COVID19 has been especially tough for 85 percent of the world’s refugees who live in developing countries. Mobile phones, tablets, laptops and internet connectivity are not readily available. In Jordan, an estimated 23 percent of Syrian refugees have no internet access at home, while two thirds rely on limited data packages.
“Half of the world’s refugee children were already out of school,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, commenting on the launch of UNHCR’s Global Education Report. “After everything they have endured, we cannot rob them of their futures by denying them an education today. Despite the enormous challenges posed by the pandemic, with greater international support to refugees and their host communities, we can expand innovative ways to protect the critical gains made in refugee education over the past years.”
In Jordan, efforts to support e-learning and innovative education initiatives continue as children return to the classroom through programs such as the Kolibri platform which is aligned with the Jordanian curriculum. UNHCR Jordan continues to work closely with the Ministries of Education and Higher Education, as well as UNICEF, other UN Agencies and local NGO partners to secure the education and futures of refugee children.

Title: UNRWA school children in Jordan go back to learning
Content: 02 September 2020
Over than 115,000 girls and boys went Back to Learning on September 1st, in the schools of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Jordan. Due to the health crisis, created by the COVID-19 pandemic, UNRWA schools are opening their doors to students in line with the health and safety regulations of the Government of Jordan.  Along with health and safety measures, social distancing - in the corridors, playgrounds and classrooms – is being implemented. With the limited resources of UNRWA, this can be only be achieved through a blended education approach, where classes are split, with half the children learning at home and the other half in school, in rotation.
“I am very happy to attend the first day of school with UNRWA students,” said UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. “This is not just any ‘Back to School’! This is Back to Learning, despite a global pandemic and a lot of uncertainty and several months of lockdown. But this a moment of celebration: celebrating the perseverance of our students and of our teaching staff. They have never stopped believing in the power of education and have not left anyone behind, even during lockdowns and closures.”
All schools in Jordan, including the ones that UNRWA runs, closed down early in the spring of 2020, in the middle of a school year, to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  UNRWA, like the host Government, moved to a distance learning approach, with students accessing education in multiple ways, including through TV learning channels, and online platforms launched by the Jordanian Ministry of Education. The main objective was to keep uninterrupted access to education for Palestine refugee students, despite the challenges imposed by the pandemic.
During the back to school ceremony held in the UNRWA al-Nuzha Elementary School for girls in Amman, Mr. Lazzarini met with young students and had a discussion with Abeer Ihab, who is an elected member of the Agency’s Student Parliament.
“We as UNRWA school parliamentarians have a responsibility towards our peers: we must raise awareness constantly about the need to respect health and safety measures at all times, inside the schools and in our communities, to be able to avoid contracting the virus,” said Abeer. To help the school Parliamentarians do just this, UNRWA Human Rights Conflict Resolution and Tolerance (HRCRT) programme produced a video with age-appropriate guidance to help raise awareness amongst students.
The school children that the Commissioner-General joined on September 1st, as they went back to learning are part of over 534,000 girls and boys in 711 UNRWA-run schools in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.

Title: Programme launched to enhance women's participation in the 19th Parliament
Content: 02 September 2020
The Jordanian National Commission for Women (JNCW), in collaboration with UN Women and UNDP, launched the first training programme for members of the National Team of Trainers that will be deployed to support women's participation in the upcoming elections to form Jordan’s 19th Parliament. From 2 September, and in compliance with national preventive measures to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, this initiative includes a series of trainings targeting 15 experts to build their capacity in assisting potential women’s candidates from all Governorates of the Kingdom in running successful electoral campaigns.
During the launch of this training-of-trainers programme, Salma Nims, Secretary General of JNCW, affirmed that this initiative contributes to achieve the first objective of the National Strategy for Women (2020-2025), namely to promote the social, economic and political rights of women and girls in Jordan, through enhanced representation and leadership in decision-making positions, as well as by fostering an enabling environment free of gender-based discrimination.
Nims also welcomed the new members of the National Team of Trainers, which was established in 2010 and that currently encompass 30 members from the academia, civil society, as well as experts and activists from various fields. Their work is not limited to the electoral process, as their expertise will be also leveraged throughout the implementation of Jordan’s National Strategy for Women.
Nims also acknowledged the collaboration and support of UN Women in operationalizing the vision and priorities of the National Strategy for Women towards increasing women’s representation in the public life. The implementation of this programme falls under JNCW’s long-term partnership priorities, as this cadre of distinguished experts and specialists in the field of political participation and women’s empowerment will serve as ambassadors of JNCW’s vision at the governorate level to reach an increase number of women, especially in rural areas.
During the event, Bushra Abu Shahout, Political Participation Specialist at UN Women, provided an overview of the training programme and the expected role of the trainers after deployment in all Governorates of Jordan.  Conducted by two UN Women regional experts who joined remotely, the workshop focused on issues related to the procedures for running, how to formulate the political programme and manage the electoral campaign, as well as how to boost women candidates’ confidence and personal skills throughout the electoral process.
The content of the training programme is based on the recently launched manual by UN Women titled Women’s ‘Electoral Campaigning and COVID-19: A Companion Guide to UN Women’s Political Leadership and Candidate Training Manual’.
JNCW encourages women who wish to apply to the workshops that will take place in each Governorates to register via the link (https://bit.ly/2Dj0tel). JNCW also noted that programme seeks to increase women’s awareness on the role of the House of Representatives and its working mechanisms, to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the legislative process beyond women’s issues.

Title: UNICEF scales up support for water, sanitation and hygiene in schools ahead of reopening
Content: 31 August 2020
UNICEF has scaled up its water, sanitation and hygiene support to the Ministry of Education ahead of school reopening this week with a donation of half a million soap bars, infection prevention and control training, and critical water and sanitation infrastructure projects to help keep students safe and healthy.
The UNICEF Representative was joined by Dr. Sami Al Mahasis, Director of Education Management, Ministry of Education. UNICEF has supported the school with improved water and sanitation facilities, including the installation of drinking water stations and a greywater system for toilets to promote sustainable water use, as well as the provision of soap to create a safe learning environment for all students.
The UNICEF WASH in schools programme - designed to improve water and sanitation facilities in schools across Jordan and promote climate action - was urgently scaled up during the summer months in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quick maintenance projects were carried out in 46 schools to rehabilitate handwashing facilities.
The donation of half a million bars of soap and 14,000 bottles of hand sanitizer is enough to ensure that every public school in the country, including in refugee camps, has adequate supplies to cover the first couple of months as they resume operations. The distribution will be complemented by hygiene awareness initiatives to teach students how to practice proper handwashing.
Ahead of the reopening of schools, UNICEF, in coordination with the Ministry of Education, has provided Infection Prevention Control (IPC) training to education and health focal points in all directorates so that the expertise to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 is present at the school level.
Only one in three schools in Jordan has basic, functional and dignified sanitation services, increasing the risk of disease and adding greater barriers to girls’ education.
UNICEF’s WASH in schools programme, and scaled-up WASH COVID-19 response, is generously funded by Australia, Canada, Irish Aid, Japan and KOICA.

Title: Germany increases support to school maintenance with additional 40.5m euro grant
Content: 31 August 2020
In the framework of Germany’s continuing support to Jordan, Christian Richter, head of Employment and Education Middle East KfW (German Development Bank) and Muhammad Usman Akram, director of UNOPS Operational Hub in Amman, signed a financing agreement on July 29 to expand support for maintenance in schools and generating livelihood opportunities in Jordan.
The grant financing of 40.5 million euros will be made available by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) on behalf of the German government to support labour-intensive school maintenance through a second phase of the programme.
In particular, the project will focus on providing maintenance and cleaning of schools located in communities that host the highest number of refugees, while also striving to improve livelihoods through providing cash for work opportunities for both vulnerable Jordanian citizens as well as the Syrian refugees living in host communities.
The project will be implemented over the course of five years in close collaboration with the Ministry of Education, school authorities, Ministry of Labour, and the Ministry of Social Development, aiming to create 12,000 work opportunities, and maintaining and cleaning 390 schools in Amman, Irbid, Mafraq, Balqa, Ajloun and Zarqa Governorates.
The Ministry of Education highlighted the importance of this project with KfW and UNOPS, given its focus on one of the ministry’s priority areas, which is the provision of students with a safe and adequate learning environment.
Representatives of the Ministry of Education indicated that such initiatives are highly aligned with the ministry’s Education Strategic Plan, which sets a target of maintaining 800 schools annually, and help offset some of the impacts of the Syrian refugee crisis which the Jordanian government has been dealing with over the past few years.
The ministry is appreciative of this strategic support with its “long-standing partner” KfW and is looking forward to this collaboration with UNOPS.
Mark Schwiete, director KfW Amman Office, underlined “the long-lasting and fruitful cooperation” with the government of Jordan in the field of education, stating that: “Education and employment is an important focal area of the German Jordanian financial cooperation. Via KfW the German government (BMZ) has amongst others, financed the construction of 37 schools, provision of informal education as well as financing for teacher salaries up until now. This new project complements our joint activities with the government of Jordan and will contribute to the improvement of learning conditions through the provision of basic maintenance and cleaning to public schools.”
This labour intensive cash for work project is a response to target poverty and unemployment providing short employment opportunities to vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees and ensuring 25 per cent female participation.
Beyond the short-term employment, the project will also enhance access to longer-term employment opportunities through training and hands-on experience. The project also contributes to the national COVID-19 response through sanitisation of schools and provision of hygiene supplies.
Reflecting on the partnership, Akram said: “UNOPS places high importance on initiatives that directly support the government and the people of Jordan. We are pleased to further our cooperation with KFW in support of vulnerable Jordanians and Syrians while contributing to the improvement of the education sector in Jordan.”
KfW finances investments and advisory services on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).
Financial cooperation started in the 1960s with main focus on education and employment generation as well as water and sanitation. The ongoing and envisaged projects in Jordan amount to about 1.3 billion EUR.
UNOPS helps the UN and its partners to provide peace and security, humanitarian and development solutions.
The organisation’s mission is to help people build better lives and countries achieve peace and sustainable development. UNOPS services cover infrastructure, project management, procurement, financial management and human resources. Partners call on UNOPS to supplement their own capacities, improve speed, reduce risks, boost cost-effectiveness and increase quality.

Title: UN Women, Safwa Islamic Bank promote gender-sensitive financial services
Content: 30 August 2020
Safwa Islamic Bank recently hosted a training programme for the bank's employees focusing on gender issues and financial services, as part of the bank’s strategy to support national efforts towards financial inclusivity and highlighting the central role played by women in the financial sector.
The training sessions were implemented by Aya Consulting in partnership with UN Women under the programme “Strengthening the Resilience of Syrian Women and Girls and Host Communities in Iraq, Jordan,” generously supported by the European Union, through the EU Regional Trust Fund in response to the Syria Crisis, the EU MADAD Fund.
“Safwa Islamic Bank has always been aware of the impact gender dynamics have on the evolution of the banking sector and the economic inequalities that can stem from a lack of awareness in this regard,” explains Samer Al-Tamimi, General Manager of Safwa Islamic Bank. “One of our core objectives is to preserve the right of women to equitable and equal access to financial resources, which is why we were eager to host this training programme and to raise the awareness of our employees on the essential connections between gender, inequality and economic inclusivity.”
Al-Tamimi further noted that gender-responsive banking services also make business sense for banks seeking to significantly broaden their customer bases, which in turn translates to a greater return of investments. More importantly, fostering a gender-sensitive internal culture will have a lasting positive impact on employees’ morale, boosting productivity and social cohesion.  The trainings also fall in line with national efforts to ensure that women are given fair access to viable financial services, an objective that has become more relevant in light of the widespread economic challenges emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Through this project, UN Women is directly supporting the Central Bank of Jordan’s Financial Inclusion Strategy, which succeeded in raising the financial inclusion index in the Kingdom from 24% in 2014 to approximately 50% in 2020, and in decreasing the gender gap in financing during the same period from 53% to 29%.
Mohammad Al Hawari, Head of Human Resources at the bank, noted that the training programme comes in continuation of the bank’s efforts to develop the capacities of employees across various fronts, particularly those related to gender equality and women’s access to financial services. He further noted that, “the interactive training course has served to entrench the importance of facilitating women’s access to banking services within the bank’s internal culture. This will enable us to achieve the noble objective of enhancing financial inclusivity in the Kingdom”.
The training, which adopts a participatory approach and the use of relevant examples, focuses on clarifying the concept of gender and its impact on financial services, providing approaches for incorporating gender issues in the design and implementation of banking services to accelerate the realization of sustainable financial inclusivity. This will help empower numerous segments in the community, including women entrepreneurs, who will be better able to overcome financial obstacles and establish viable, revenue-generating projects.
The collaboration between UN Women’s “Strengthening the Resilience of Syrian Women and Girls and Host Communities in Iraq, Jordan” project is regarded as a key step towards achieving the project’s objectives of empowering communities throughout the Kingdom.
Assessments by UN Women and other development partners show that access to gender-sensitive financial services and products helps shielding women from adverse economic shocks and support them in taking control of resources, which is conducive to their advancement on both personal and professional fronts. Access to financial services also enhances women’s ability to save and invest, thereby increasing their business opportunities while simultaneously lowering financial risks.

Title: UNHCR continues to support refugees in Jordan amid the coronavirus pandemic
Content: 27 August 2020
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has distributed emergency cash assistance to approximately 39,000 refugee families in August to help them cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This follows similar distributions earlier in May and aims to relieve some of the burden caused by the loss of livelihoods. 40 percent of refugees in Jordan are estimated to have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus crisis.
Generously funded by the United States and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, the equivalent of $10 million in emergency cash assistance has been distributed to over 43,000 refugee families since the beginning of the pandemic. This is in addition to UNHCR’s monthly cash assistance program which continues to reach 33,000 families every month, providing a regular and reliable source of income to the most vulnerable refugees, the majority of whom use it to pay their rent.
“The impact of the coronavirus crisis is not going away anytime soon, and we must find ways to support an increased number of vulnerable refugees for the foreseeable future,” said Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR Representative in Jordan. “Cash assistance provides immediate relief but long-term strategies to address the economic impact and inclusion within national systems are essential ingredients,” he concluded.
Over the last six months since the start of the coronavirus crisis in Jordan, UNHCR has worked closely with the Government of Jordan to ensure that refugees are part of the national coronavirus response plan. Funding has been provided to the Ministry of Health and refugees have been included within national coronavirus testing. There have been no cases among refugees living in Zaatari and Azraq refugee camps.
Despite this, challenges remain. An increase in child labor, refugees being evicted from their homes due to not being able to pay their rent and those seeking mental health support have been observed since the beginning of the pandemic. UNHCR’s protection teams are working to counsel and provide specialized support to refugees across the Kingdom. Over 4,000 refugee cases were provided with legal assistance last month.
UNHCR Jordan is appealing for $79million for its coronavirus response, 30% of funds have currently been received.

Title: Investing in e-learning remains a priority for UNHCR Jordan
Content: 26 August 2020
Since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, over 1 million users have logged into the Noorspace e-learning platform which allows students and teachers to interact online and is operated alongside Darsak which broadcasts lessons to students on TV and online.
As refugee and Jordanian students prepare to return to school, UNHCR Jordan has been working closely with the Ministry of Education and educational providers across the Kingdom in developing the technology and modalities to facilitate continued e-learning. Building on the organizations experience at its 10 Connected Learning Hubs, the Kolibri platform, which provides Arabic based courses from Maths and English to Science and Coding, has been integrated within Noorspace, an online platform operated by the Ministry of Education and Queen Rania Center for Information Technology (QRC), to create online virtual classrooms.
Since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, over 1 million users have logged into the Noorspace e-learning platform which allows students and teachers to interact online and is operated alongside Darsak which broadcasts lessons to students on TV and online. The integration of Kolibri, therefore, has diversified the learning materials and courses available to students in Jordan. These courses have also been aligned with the Jordanian curriculum by Madrasati, a local Jordanian NGO, so that as children return to classrooms from September, they can take what they have learnt online back into schools.
“The integration of Kolibri with Noorspace is an exciting development, utilizing expertise-built working with refugees to the further benefit of the wider Jordanian population,” commented Zeina Jadaan, UNHCR Jordan Education Officer.
“Even as children prepare to return to school, e-learning still represents a vital educational tool. Platforms such as Kolibri used during the coronavirus crisis can continue to be built upon and utilized in coordination with in-person teaching. We look forward to our continued collaboration with the Ministry of Education in this regard,” she concluded.
“Jordan is joining in global efforts to ensure student’s right to education despite the pandemic. The Ministry of Education, in all of its administrative and academic cadres, is working to develop and prepare the best scenarios to ensure the continuity of education”, commented Tayseer Al No’aimi, the Minister for Education.
In addition to integrating the Kolibri platform within national education systems, over 4,000 refugee and Jordanian students have accessed its virtual classes directly as part of UNHCR supported education programs. Previously used within UNHCR’s community centers, as centers closed due to the coronavirus crisis, the online/offline nature of the Kolibri platform has meant that refugee and Jordanian students alike, have continued to be able to access the platform and its courses remotely from home.
The Kolibri platform, supported by Learning Equality, aims to facilitate people’s right to a quality education, by supporting the creation, adaptation and distribution of open educational resources, and creating supportive tools for innovative pedagogy. It can be accessed online and offline once downloaded. Strengthening the quality of education and availability of resources is a key part of UNHCR’s strategy.

Title: FAO builds the capacity of date palm farmers on integrated management of red palm weevil
Content: 26 August 2020
Jordan’s date palm plantation sector is facing multiple challenges, the most critical of them being the spread red palm weevil (RPW), a dangerous and destructive pest that kills trees or sapping them.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Jordan has launched on Wednesday the first  of a series of training workshops on integrated management of the red palm weevil for date palm farmers in Jordan.
The workshop, held on Wednesday, the 12th of August, in Southern Shouneh, is part of the technical cooperation project between FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) entitled “Support to the assessment and control of red palm weevil in Jordan”, aiming to enhance the contribution of date palm production to the economic growth and improved livelihoods of its producers and traders.
The workshop was implemented with the facilitation of trained employees from the Ministry of Agriculture, and it focused on sharing information on: the integrated management of the Indian red palm weevil, the collaboration between the MoA and the farmers to control the red palm weevil infections, and advanced techniques to detecting and controlling the infestation at farm level. The information exchange was enhanced by the distribution of smart Ferrolure and smart dispensing items to the training staff, to be used during the workshop.
Building on the results of this first encounter, a series of similar workshops will be held in the coming weeks in Nouthern Shouneh, Deir Alla and Azraq.
Jordan’s date palm plantation sector is facing multiple challenges, the most critical of them being the spread red palm weevil (RPW), a dangerous and destructive pest that kills trees or sapping them. Based on the reports from the Ministry of Agriculture, there has been increased incidences of RPW infections across the country, threatening the date palm sector.  As date production is an important contributor to rural food security and livelihood maintenance, this issue warrants immediate attention.
This project falls within FAO’s regional initiatives of building resilience to food security and nutrition (RI-FSN) shocks across the Near East and North Africa.

Title: UNICEF study highlights plight of children and youth in Jordan during COVID-19
Content: 25 August 2020
The study, covering both Jordanian and Syrian families, found that the number of households with a monthly income of less than 100 JD (140 USD) has doubled since before the COVID-19 pandemic.
A new study released by UNICEF has highlighted the socio-economic challenges faced by vulnerable children, young people and their parents in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The study, covering both Jordanian and Syrian families, found that the number of households with a monthly income of less than 100 JD (140 USD) has doubled since before the COVID-19 pandemic, and only 28 per cent of households have adequate finances to sustain themselves for a two-week period.
“The secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been quietly devastating for the most vulnerable families who are enduring tremendous stress as they try to provide a safe, nurturing and healthy environment for their children,” said Tanya Chapuisat, Representative, UNICEF Jordan.
“This study shows that while much-needed assistance is reaching those in need, further efforts are required to both expand this coverage and better target the most disadvantaged children to prevent vulnerable boys and girls from falling through the cracks as a result of this global pandemic,” she added.
The study findings also showed that among the sample size:
The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the digital divide facing children from the poorest households and the need for concerted efforts to support their learning recovery. Children in one quarter of the families surveyed did not access the official national online learning platform during lockdown and only 31 per cent of households have access to a Wi-Fi connection at home.
The results also highlighted the increasing stress on caregivers during lockdown and worrying trends in the prevalence of violence against children in their homes. More than two-thirds of parents reported difficulties in dealing with their children during and after lockdown. Fifty-six per cent of parents reported using psychological violence against their children during lockdown, while over a third of parents used physical violence.
UNICEF is supporting the roll out of the Government of Jordan’s National Social Protection Strategy to help provide a safety net to the vulnerable children and their families across the country. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, UNICEF has also scaled up its cash transfer programme Hajati to support 30,000 children, while outreach efforts continue to help children to learn and stay safe during the pandemic.

Title: UNOPS, Japan renovate 73km water distribution network in Irbid
Content: 23 August 2020

The Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) has received the approximately 73km-long renovated water distribution pipeline networks in Hawwara District in Irbid City from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and UNOPS.
The renovated water pipeline is a part of the grant aid project “Urgent Improvement of Water Sector for the Host Communities of Syrian Refugees in Northern Governorates in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan [Phase 2]” implemented by JICA in partnership with UNOPS, and the completed network will be operated by the Yarmouk Water Company (YWC). The Government of Japan funded 21.6 million US dollars for the entire project.
The project aims to improve quality of and access to water supply services by approximately 70,000 population in the region, including Syrian Refugees making effective use of Jordan’s scarce water resources by renovating and rehabilitating water networks laid in the 1970s.
Currently, the project is undertaking restoration of the main networks in Sarieh District and house connection works that will allow households in Irbid to receive a steady supply of water. The project is scheduled to be completed at the end of 2022.
His Excellency, Eng. Raed Abu Al-Saud, the Minister of MWI, highlighted: “The project will increase efficiency of the networks and improve access to water in Irbid. I appreciate the continuous support from the Government and people of Japan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, especially to the water sector noting that this support has clearly contributed to alleviating the impact of the influx of Syrian refugees and also enhancing the capabilities of YWC.”
Yanagi Hidenao, Japan’s Ambassador to Jordan said: “Japan highly appreciates the generous hospitality of the Government and people of Jordan to receive so many refugees from Syria and continued its contribution to support the host communities in Jordan. As the water sector is one of Japan’s priorities in the development assistance in Jordan, we have especially supported improvement of the water sector in the northern governorates since 2014, when the previous Phase 1 project started with a 22.4 million US dollar grant".
"I am glad that we can see the completion of parts of this project when the demand for water is growing due to the pandemic of COVID-19. I really appreciate the dedication and cooperation for this project made by related authorities including MWI, UNOPS and JICA, and I hope that this project would contribute to further development of the region and the entire country of Jordan," the ambassador added.
Chief Representative of JICA Jordan Office, MIYAHARA Chie, said: “I would like to highly appreciate the hard work given by all concerned agencies (MWI/Irbid Governorate/Municipalities etc.) and UNOPS as well as understandings and cooperation of the people in Irbid (Hawwara/Sarieh) during the difficult time of COVID-19 pandemic. I hope it can be well maintained to continuously serve the people for many years to come".
General Manager of YWC, Muntsr Al Momani, said: “the project will improve YWC to find solutions for the water supply to the areas of Hawwara and Al-Sarieeh in the city of Irbid, where the old network has been a cause of major imbalances to serve the project area. YWC appreciates our friends in Japan for their support to YWC and Jordan.”
“We are very proud to celebrate this key milestone of our first partnership project with JICA in the Middle East region. This initiative ties in with Japan’s support to Jordan’s sustainable economic growth and Jordan’s development agenda, aiming to improve access to safe water by utilizing UNOPS expertise in infrastructure and project implementation. We hope that the remaining activities of the project and our continuous collaboration with all partners including the Government of Japan, JICA and MWI will contribute to Jordan’s dedicated efforts toward sustainable development and improved quality of life for all,” said Muhammad Usman Akram, Director of UNOPS Operational Hub in Amman.

Title: UN in Jordan celebrates World Humanitarian Day
Content: 19 August 2020
The United Nations in Jordan  celebrated World Humanitarian Day, which is part of the global campaign that honours humanitarian workers who have lost their lives or been injured in the course of their work.
Last year, 125 aid workers were killed, 234 were wounded and 124 kidnapped — the worst year on record.
Representatives from the humanitarian community in Jordan honoured the sacrifices of their colleagues in a small ceremony hosted by the United Nations.
This year, under the banner of #RealLifeHeroes, the ceremony included short videos to highlight the everyday efforts made by aid and frontline workers to improve the lives of people in need of assistance.
A panel discussion featured three Jordanian humanitarians who spoke of their work, motivation and challenges presented by the COVID-19 crisis.
In his welcoming remarks, the acting Humanitarian Coordinator in Jordan, Dominik Bartsch, reiterated the UN’s commitment to humanitarian support for Jordan.
“The UN thanks the Government of Jordan for their commitment to refugees and other vulnerable groups in Jordan,” Bartsch said.
He acknowledged the critical role of first responders in humanitarian action, stressing that “we applaud their efforts to continue humanitarian programmes, while addressing the needs created by COVID-19”.
Zola Dowell, head of the Jordan’s Office for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), reiterated the importance of the day and the sacrifices aid workers make to support others.
“This year, we particularly honour the health workers who continued essential care while adapting to the COVID-crisis.  We also appreciate the extraordinary efforts made by educators to make sure children could continue learning despite the pandemic’s impacts,” Dowell said.
World Humanitarian Day (WHD) was designated by the UN General Assembly in 2008 to coincide with the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq.
Every year on August 19, the world commemorates and recognises humanitarian aid workers who risk their lives on the front lines in humanitarian service around the world, according to the statement.

Title: UNOPS, Japan complete first phase of RMS support project
Content: 09 August 2020
The project implemented renovation works and equipped the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of the King Hussein Medical Centre and its warehouse compound.
UNOPS and the Government of Japan announced the completion of the first phase of “Improvement of Health Services through Operational Capacity Support to the Royal Medical Services (RMS) of Jordanian Armed Forces” implemented by UNOPS, in support of RMS.
The Director for UNOPS Operational Hub in Amman, Muhammad Usman Akram and the Ambassador of Japan to Jordan, Yanagi Hidenao, on Thursday held a meeting to mark the successful completion of the project.
The project implemented renovation works and equipped the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of the King Hussein Medical Centre and its warehouse compound. The new facility is functional and is serving patients. It is worth noting that the ambulances and the medical beds that were delivered under this project have contributed to the efforts of RMS and the Government of Jordan to respond to COVID-19 pandemic.
“Japan highly appreciates UNOPS dedication and efforts on implementing the project to enhance the operational capacity of the RMS which plays a critical role in providing health services to the Jordanian population including Syrian refugees. We are pleased to hear that our assistance also contributed to RMS’s nationwide efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19. This year, we renewed our commitment to contribute funding to the subsequent UNOPS project supporting RMS through rehabilitation of the King Hussein Medical Centre including the procurement of medical equipment. We will continue to work closely with UNOPS to improve the quality of and access to health services in Jordan,” said Hidenao.
UNOPS partnership with the Government of Japan in Jordan started in 2014, in support of Jordan's urgent response to the Syrian refugee crisis. Since then, the partnership has delivered critical support to a number of sectors in Jordan, including protection, vocational training, health, countering violence and extremism, and water and sanitation.
“UNOPS long-standing partnership with the Government of Japan in Jordan once again demonstrated its positive impact at a critical time.  The support that we jointly extended to RMS came at the right time to support the readiness of the Jordanian health sector to respond to COVID-19 and its unprecedented challenge. We are confident that the ongoing new initiative with RMS, which is also supported by the people and the Government of Japan, will further benefit the population and the nation amidst this challenging time," said Akram.
He also reaffirmed UNOPS commitment to the partnership with the Government of Japan and their efforts to support Jordan, as they address the various challenges facing the country and the broader region at this time.

Title: A statement issued by the UN in Jordan
Content: 21 July 2020
Arabic below
The UN in Jordan is shocked and saddened at the violent killing of a woman near her home over the weekend, allegedly by her father. Violence against women and children is never acceptable nor impunity for these crimes is justifiable.
Gender-based violence in Jordan has increased - with helplines reporting a marked increase in calls. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced entire communities inside to stay safe, but for some women and girls, has worsened an already dangerous situation.
The UN is supporting the Government of Jordan and civil society to provide safe referrals, services and justice to survivors of gender-based violence, and to scale up public awareness campaigns to eliminate violence in all forms from society.
Until every girl and woman in Jordan is safe from violence, there will be no progress towards realizing the full human and economic development potential that is vital for the country’s recovery.
Following the announcement by the Public Security Directorate earlier today on expanding the action of the Family Protection Department and the enhancement of procedures to protect women and children at risk of gender-based violence, the UN system is committed to strengthen joint efforts to support these entities in this process.

"تعرب الأمم المتحدة في الأردن عن صدمتها وحزنها إزاء جريمة القتل التي ذهبت ضحيتها امرأة، يزعم أنها قتلت على يد والدها، بالقرب من منزلها خلال عطلة نهاية الأسبوع. فالعنف ضد النساء والأطفال غير مقبول على الإطلاق، والافلات من العقاب على هذه الجرائم أمر لا يمكن تبريره.
ارتفعت حالات العنف القائم على النوع الاجتماعي في الأردن - حيث ارتفعت عدد البلاغات المتعلقة بحالات العنف الواردة لخطوط المساعدة الهاتفية. فيما أجبرت جائحة كوفيد-19 مجتمعات بأكملها على البقاء في الداخل سعيا للأمان، إلا أنها في الوقت ذاته ضاعفت خطورة الوضع بالنسبة لبعض النساء والفتيات، ممن هن في وضع خطر الأصل.
تدعم الأمم المتحدة الحكومة الأردنية والمجتمع المدني لتوفير الإحالات الآمنة والخدمات والعدالة للناجيات من العنف القائم على النوع الاجتماعي، وتوسيع نطاق حملات التوعية للقضاء على كافة أشكال العنف في المجتمع.
لن يكون هناك أي تقدم محرز نحو تحقيق الإمكانات الكاملة للتنمية البشرية والاقتصادية التي تعتبر أساسية لتعافي البلاد،
حتى تكون كل فتاة وامرأة في الأردن في مأمن من العنف.
وبعد إعلان مديرية الأمن العام في وقت سابق اليوم عن توسيع نطاق عمل إدارة حماية الأسرة وتعزيز الإجراءات لحماية النساء والأطفال المعرضين لخطر العنف القائم على النوع الاجتماعي، تلتزم منظومة الأمم المتحدة بتعزيز الجهود المشتركة لدعم الجهات المعنية في هذا الأمر".

Title: Building Back Better: Why Volunteering matters for the post-COVID world
Content: 18 July 2020
COVID-19 is testing the resilience of communities at an unprecedented scale. It has exposed vulnerabilities in healthcare capacities, markets and jobs, welfare systems, political agility, the inclusion of disadvantaged groups, community cooperation, and more. The parts that are broken will have to be rebuilt. For this reason, we will come out of this crisis into a new world: a post-COVID world. Together, we must make sure that this new world is an improvement on the last. We must ‘Build Back Better’.
To achieve this, new development patterns must be inclusive, resilient and advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. By weaving a strong social fabric within communities, volunteering is at the key intersection of these qualities. When those with local knowledge and insights take collective ownership of local problems, communities are uniquely mobilized around development efforts.
However, too often there is not sufficient investment in volunteering infrastructure and not sufficient measurement of its impact. It therefore becomes a secondary consideration for those involved in developmental operations.
Indeed, the United Nations recognizes the role of volunteers and seeks to integrate it in the ‘Decade of Action’ to achieve sustainable development goals by 2030. Most recently, the UN framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19 takes note that ‘volunteer groups often play an indispensable leadership role in the response, notably in reaching out to vulnerable people, and in getting to remote places. They can amplify responses.’
For this, perhaps, a global discussion on the future of volunteering could not be more timely. This week, the Global Technical Meeting (GTM 2020) on Re-Imaging Volunteering for the 2030 Agenda convened all stakeholders to discuss practices on integrating volunteering into the SDGs, perspectives on reimagining volunteerism and ways to translate this into practice. Through the GTM2020, the world seeks to take action to advance the role of volunteering above and beyond the current model.
Mandated in 2018 by the UN General Assembly, this week’s GTM2020 aimed both to inform and to transform the conversation on volunteering. Led by the UN Volunteers (UNV) programme and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and alongside more than 400 representatives from governments, UN entities, and civil society, including academia, volunteer groups, and the private sector; the GTM2020 strived to reimagine the concept of volunteering for the 2030 Agenda.
Many voices from the Arab States region joined the global discussion, with a variety of participants from all the above-mentioned sectors.
Evidence from across the Arab States region, already present in the newly launched UNV Knowledge Portal on Volunteerism, demonstrates how volunteer initiatives contribute to skill development and employability, and how the impact of digital transformation is accelerating the growth of volunteerism.
Through discussion of existing evidence, good practices, and lessons learnt around volunteering, the GTM2020 tried to spearhead new models of volunteering and create a sense of urgency among governments and organizations to integrate volunteering into their action on development.
The vision for volunteering in the Decade of Action for the SDGs requires addressing inequalities in volunteering, new models of volunteer collaboration and considering new measures to support informal volunteering. Volunteerism infrastructure must be developed, initiatives must be funded, and results must be measured.
The hope for the Call to Action resulting from this global meeting is to be able to unite the global community around a commitment to position volunteering as a leading development solution. NGOs, CSOs, government ministries, businesses, local groups, or individuals engaged in social development will be encouraged and energised to promote volunteerism both within their own work and across society. However, for this movement to succeed, we must motivate ourselves and mobilize our communities. Those with time and resources must channel the determination to overcome this crisis and create a better world. Volunteering is the catalyst for that transformation.
Together, we can Build Back Better. The recent past must not be prologue.

Title: UN Women Jordan, SSIF launch women’s leadership development programme
Content: 13 July 2020
The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and the Social Security Fund Investment Fund (SSIF) on Saturday began their work under the Women’s Career and Professional Development Programme.
The programme seeks to build the capacity of the SSIF and Social Security Corporation female staff to access senior roles, responsibilities and leadership positions where 17 female employees will participate and continue for five days.
The programme that is executed by UN Women is part of  the UN Women and ILO joint programme “Promoting Productive Employment and Decent Work for Women” supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).
SSIF CEO Kholoud Saqqaf said that this “important partnership” with UN Women reflects the fund’s commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 5 on gender equality and women’s empowerment, and the importance of promoting equal opportunities for women and men in all fields.
The programme will enhance the capacity of female staff in performing their duties, unleashing their full potential and support their career advancement on equal basis of their male colleagues.
It also complements the SSIF’s efforts to empower female employees at various job levels.
In 2018, SSIF launched a Woman Empowerment’s guidelines that set the reference framework for the SSIF’s management to develop plans and programmes in the areas of leadership, economic and social empowerment, in addition to other programmes that create a “stimulating work environment for all”.
“The Social Security Investment Fund plays a critical role in promoting gender smart investments in human resources and financial assets. This capacity building opportunity is an important step to increase the number of new actors who support investments and policies that are sensitive to gender issues, which evidence shows is smart business,” said Ziad Sheikh, UN Women Jordan Representative.
This programme is part of a broader collaboration between UN Women and the SSIF that aims to support the national commitments under Goal 5 by measuring the impact of the related initiatives on women and promoting dialogue on women’s economic empowerment and financing for gender equality.

Title: UN Jordan announces ‘Volunteers75’ group for youth to support organisation activities
Content: 02 July 2020
The United Nations in Jordan announced on Tuesday the formation of the “Volunteers75” group for youth under the UN75 initiative, and held the first online dialogue on “Building Back Better” post-COVID-19.
The group, which consists of 75 young volunteers from across the Kingdom, will support the UN in Jordan in running activities under the UN75 initiative, which was launched this year to mark the organisation’s 75th anniversary, according to a statement from UN Jordan.
This year, the UN is gathering peoples’ views in the spirit of the opening words of its charter, “We the peoples”, through a one-minute survey focusing on the key priorities for international cooperation. It is also holding UN75 dialogues, where organisations can hold virtual events to discuss key global challenges and what is needed from the UN when it turns 100, the statement said.
Addressing the Volunteers75 group, Anders Pedersen, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Jordan, said: “The secretary-general wants to listen to people across the globe, especially young people, about their aspirations for a better world and brighter future, as now is the time to ‘Build Back Better’."
“We want young people to have the opportunity to play the role that they must play in the modern world in which we live, and especially in the world we are trying to build,” stressed Pedersen.
“We have come a long way over the past decades with strides in education, human rights and tackling poverty among others, but there are still many discrepancies in other areas that we need to address, especially now while we are fighting COVID-19, the invisible enemy that requires all of us to work together to mitigate its impacts,” Pedersen said.
Enshrah Ahmed, UNFPA Jordan head of office, said: "We are very honoured to work with and mobilise youth groups from all over Jordan into this initiative. At UNFPA, we are committed to ensuring that young people’s voices are heard, that their rights are respected and that they have a legitimate seat at the table."
"UNFPA passes on to volunteers for UN75 decades of experience through supporting youth participation and engagement as well as sexual and reproductive health and rights of young people. Therefore, it is our obligation to ensure an enabling environment for youth to positively engage in their communities," she noted.
She added: "Jordan keeps bringing to the world and the region examples on youth leadership on global agendas."
This includes the National Youth Peace and Security 2250 Coalition, the recently launched Global Compact for Young People in Humanitarian Action and now the active engagements for youth in Jordan in the UN75 agenda, according to Ahmed.
The UN75 dialogues, together with a “One-minute Survey: UN75.online” that anyone can take, “will generate compelling data” to inform national and international policies and debate, the statement said.
In Jordan, the United Nations will be conducting a series of online dialogues and calls on Jordanians to take the one-minute online survey. The “Volunteers75” group will also help mobilise their peers and communities to join the dialogue through taking the online survey.
Organised by the UN Resident Coordinator Office and UNFPA, the first online dialogue conducted with Volunteers75 tackled the impact of COVID-19 on youth and “building back better” after the pandemic.
Results of the global dialogue will be presented at the official commemoration of the UN’s 75th anniversary in September 2020. In January 2021, the UN75 Office will publish a final report on how best to take the results forward, according to the statement.

Title: UNOPS supports MoSD in strengthening its monitoring and evaluation system
Content: 29 June 2020
In partnership with the European Union (EU) and the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD), UNOPS is establishing a Monitoring and Evaluation - based Management Information System that is linked to MoSD’s field directorates and social care centers. The system will support the strengthening of MoSD’s institutional capacity, as well as monitoring of quality services provision.
The system will be developed as part of the EU support to social protection in Jordan, under the “Modernization of the Social Protection Physical Environment MSPPE” project, implemented by UNOPS.
Under the project, UNOPS has recently concluded the rehabilitation of the MoSD server room, and installation of high-tech IT equipment including servers, firewalls and UPS in order to prepare the data center for the new Management Information System and ensure the Ministry’s readiness to host it despite the ongoing challenges incurred due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: IOM partners with the Swiss embassy and Tamkeen to provide basic necessities for migrant workers impacted by COVID-19
Content: 29 June 2020
On 14 June 2020, the UN Migration Agency (IOM) and the Embassy of Switzerland in Jordan launched a three-month project to facilitate access to basic needs items for the most vulnerable migrant workers in Jordan impacted by COVID-19. To reach this objective, IOM partnered with the Jordanian NGO Tamkeen for Legal Aid and Human Rights (Tamkeen) and together will work with the relevant entities of the Government of Jordan to respond to the urgent needs of migrant workers.
Migrant workers remain one of the most vulnerable groups, whose lives have been heavily impacted by the pandemic, which brought unprecedented measures, including lockdown and intermittent curfews. Consequently, many migrant workers have lost their daily income and access to services and, unable to return to their home countries, were left in dire need of basic supplies. Migrant and mobile populations bear a high risk of infection, as well as being more vulnerable to the broader socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 and as such should be included in recovery plans.
Kuniudu, a Sri Lankan migrant worker in Jordan, said: “life has been very difficult for everyone, we lost our jobs and now we cannot do anything except to stay at home and try to take care of ourselves”. This project will contribute to better protection of migrant workers in Jordan and facilitate their access to essential food and non-food items for up to three months. The intervention aims to target up to 1700 beneficiaries residing in different governorates across the country.
In addition to this engagement, the Embassy of Switzerland supports the Government of Jordan in alleviating the negative impacts of COVID-19 for vulnerable Jordanians and refugees.

Title: The fourth agriculture revolution, rural Jordan going digital
Content: 27 June 2020
OpEd
The agricultural sector of Jordan is at a turning point. The current context, characterized by slow-onset climate change impact and sudden-onset shocks, such as the Covid-19 related lockdown, is calling for a new revolution of the food systems. Jordan famers, despite the environmental challenges they are facing, have still so much to offer by embracing a technological shift. The 4th Agricultural Revolution of the human kind. The era of digitalization connecting the most isolated rural communities to science and market.
Ten thousand years ago, the first Agriculture Revolution took place here, in the Fertile Crescent. It transitioned communities from a nomadic hunter-gatherer way of life to a more settled one, as a result of the domestication of various plant and animal species. The second and the third Revolutions, during the 18th and 20th centuries, drastically increased the food productivity and progressively greening the production systems to preserve our planet for future generations.
Despite these tremendous achievements of Agriculture, which is the primary sector of the economy, the poverty incidence and gap tend to be higher in rural areas, doubling the urban one.  The explanation lies in the rural-urban divide, the formal-informal divide that create a lack of connection to opportunities in the rural areas.
The 4th Agricultural Revolution is the one that brings the promise of connection. With over 80 percent of the Jordanian farmers using smartphones, the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) will change the way agriculture is doing business. The widespread adoption of ICTs reduces information gaps and transaction costs, improves service delivery, creates new jobs, generates new revenue streams, and helps conserve resources. ICTs also transforms the way people and governments work, interact, and communicate. These technologies are effective instruments for empowering rural populations, for increasing choices for rural men and women, especially youth, and for enhancing their abilities to increase incomes and participate in a more effective manner in the development of their communities.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) are embarking smallholder farmers in this new era: the @griculture. Thanks to a Digital Service Portfolio (DSP), farmers will have the opportunity to communicate directly with agronomists, and take informed decisions on their production and marketing investments in a more timely and efficient manner. The DSP is an open platform that will initially support applications on weather, plant and animal diseases and market opportunities. Supporting the exchange of knowledge and innovation, FAO has also launched the e-agriculture community of practice; a platform where people from all over the world can exchange information, ideas and resources for sustainable agriculture and rural development. The platform has over 14,000 members from 170 countries and territories. This will be now open to Jordan producers too.
Digital registration of farmers will also aim at ensuring a starting point for effective outreach and coverage of services and benefits such as social protection, financial services and insurance schemes.
This 4th Revolution is not only a technical one, it is a social transformation as well, which will impact the development and the social inclusion by progressively integrating smallholder farmers in a more formal settings in which they will take their share.
For Jordan farmers, being now part of a connected world, the sky will be the limit!

Title: Half of enterprises in Jordan are positive about recovery from the impact of COVID-19 crisis: Survey
Content: 26 June 2020
While the economy in Jordan is opening-up, only half of surveyed enterprises were confident that they would weather the impact of COVID-19 crisis and resume profitability according to a recent assessment by the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Fafo Institute for Labour and Social Research.
The assessment, based on interviews of 1,190 enterprises across the Kingdom in late April, sheds light on the significant impact of COVID-19 and the lockdown measures on enterprises and employees. All surveyed enterprises faced challenges in terms of cash flow, reduced demand and supply and the disruption of supply chains as a result of measures responding to COVID-19.
Many faced difficulties even prior to the crisis with a quarter of enterprises indicating that they were losing money and almost half reporting that they were only breaking even. Few were prepared for the crisis with only 25 per cent reporting to have had a business continuity plan in place at the time of the survey.
UNDP Resident Representative Sara Ferrer Olivella said: “this assessment is timely and crucial to help decision-makers respond effectively to the huge impact the crisis is having. While the economy has opened-up, many sectors continue to see reduced demand and challenges for the foreseeable future. She stressed that “the economic concern is high, and we believe that understanding the situation on the ground is essential to design our post-crisis response accordingly”.
Patrick Daru, ILO's Country Coordinator for Jordan said: “the assessment shows the difficulties companies we talked to are facing, but it also shows a general lack of awareness of government measures and their general unpreparedness in front of the evolving COVID-19 crisis. Beyond subsidies, much needs to be done to strengthen their capacities and resilience. This current fragility of the private sector can have potentially a disastrous impact on workers and their livelihoods."
According to the survey only 42 per cent of businesses indicated that they could continue paying salaries to all workers for less than one month, another 42 per cent for less than three months under conditions prevailing at the time of the survey.
A majority of businesses said direct financial support was the most essential support needed to cope with the situation at this stage, with 60 per cent of micro-businesses and 43 per cent of enterprises with more than 100 workers indicating the need for direct financial support. Many also indicated the need for wage subsidies.
The impact of the crisis on micro and home-based businesses has been particularly difficult. Many lack cash reserves, financial resources and assets as well as access to finance to respond to the crisis. Government measures currently largely focus on formal SMEs, the report therefore recommends targeted measures for informal, micro and small businesses, to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected.
The report highlights that government measures should focus on helping and incentivizing businesses to ‘build back better’. This should include supporting business preparedness, aligning business models towards more inclusive and sustainable practices, accelerating digital transformation so companies can evolve with the market, remain competitive and resilient to future crises.

Title: Japan donates $3 million to UNICEF Jordan’s COVID-19 children’s appeal
Content: 18 June 2020
The Government of Japan has donated $3 million to UNICEF Jordan’s COVID-19 appeal to support the most vulnerable children and their families in the country.
The funding will bolster UNICEF Jordan’s work to support the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the provision of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health and nutrition and protection services for children and women in Jordan, including Syrian refugees.
“At a time when the extensive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and their families is becoming more apparent, UNICEF is extremely grateful to the Government of Japan for their ongoing commitment that will allow us to scale up our efforts for the most vulnerable children in the country to protect them now and in the future,” said UNICEF Jordan Representative Tanya Chapuisat.
The contribution from the Government of Japan will enable UNICEF to scale up water, sanitation and hygiene services and infection and prevention control (IPC) measures for 200,000 children and their families, while also supporting national efforts to reach and empower millions with critical prevention and protection messages.
The Government of Japan is a long-time partner of UNICEF in Jordan and has provided funding of over $39 million since the beginning of the Syrian crisis to support UNICEF’s work to strengthen national systems and offer lifesaving services for children.
Japan also contributed nearly $870,000 to UNICEF’s regional office for the Middle East and North Africa based in Amman. The contribution will support the regional office in providing technical and operational support to country offices in the region for the procurement of supplies for the COVID-19 response.

Title: WFP introduces cash withdrawal for 70,000 refugees in Mafraq
Content: 08 June 2020
The World Food Programme (WFP) in Jordan introduced this month the cash withdrawal option for 70,00 refugees living in Mafraq governorate, completely shifting WFP’s food assistance for refugees living in host communities to unrestricted cash.
Similar to the 300,000 refugees that WFP is supporting in other governorates, refugees living in Mafraq, some 80 kilometres northeast of Amman, can now redeem their assistance via an e-card at ATMs or from a network of 200 contracted shops located throughout the country, or through both.
This modality allows refugees to decide how to redeem the assistance they receive by buying food or covering other expenses.
“Having the option of either withdrawing cash or using the e-card at the supermarket makes it easier for me to buy the food my family needs,” a Syrian refugee living in Mafraq city said.
According to WFP monitoring reports, unrestricted cash leads to similar or better food security than food-restricted vouchers.
In Irbid, where the unrestricted cash modality is already implemented, the food security of refugees receiving WFP assistance has improved by 20 per cent, showing that families relied less on negative food-coping strategies like skipping meals and borrowing food.
“Unrestricted cash promotes empowerment and dignity by giving the refugees the choice of how to use it: By buying food commodities or covering other expenses, such as rent, health or education. During this critical period, WFP will continue providing a lifeline support to nearly half a million vulnerable refugees in Jordan,” said WFP Country Director and Representative Sarah Gordon-Gibson.
WFP is also implementing a range of activities, such as school feeding and livelihoods and capacity strengthening programmes for vulnerable Jordanians and refugees.

Title: JAPAN and UNOPS provide support to quality health care in Jordan
Content: 07 June 2020
The Government of Japan and UNOPS launched a new project to enhance the operational capacity of the Royal Medical Services (RMS). The $1.3 million contribution is a continuation of the strong support from the Government and people of Japan to improve the access to and quality of health care in Jordan.
The project will restore and equip the RMS female surgical and pediatric wards, as well as the renal dialysis unit. It is anticipated that over 330,000 people will benefit from this project, including the Syrian refugees who access the RMS services.
This initiative complements the previous support provided by the Government of Japan and UNOPS to strengthen Jordan’s health sector. The previous phase which has supported the rehabilitation and procurement works for the obstetrics and gynaecology departments, and the warehouse in the King Hussein Medical Centre (KHMC) including newly constructed indoor waiting areas improved both the access for and the services to the beneficiaries. In addition, the ambulances and medical beds provided to the RMS are contributing to the Kingdom’s fight against COVID-19.
RMS Director Brig. Gen. Dr. Adel Wahadneh said, “Both the previous and upcoming rehabilitation projects will have a significant impact on the quality of medical care provided to patients. We appreciate the continued support of the Government of Japan and UNOPS, which will help sustain and improve RMS capabilities and the services we provide to the population at large, as well as Syrian refugees.”
“Japan highly appreciates the role of RMS in the health sector in Jordan, and in particular, its dedication and ongoing nationwide efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19. We value the RMS’s continued contribution to medical support to vulnerable people including Syrian refugees at the hospitals and in the field. I would also like to give my sincere appreciation to UNOPS as our long-standing implementing partner of several projects in Jordan since the onset of the Syrian Crisis. In January this year, the Government of Japan renewed its commitment to support RMS through rehabilitation of the KHMC as well as procurement of medical equipment for KHMC. We sincerely hope that our assistance will contribute to further enhancement of the operational capacity of the RMS and improvement of the access to health services for the vulnerable population in Jordan, and Jordan will succeed in overcoming the negative impact of COVID-19 as soon as possible,” stated H.E. Mr. Yanagi Hidenao, Japan’s Ambassador to Jordan.
“UNOPS is pleased to continue supporting the Government of Jordan and appreciates the generous contribution from the Government and people of Japan to improve the health sector services, focusing on some of the most vulnerable beneficiaries. This initiative comes at a critical time when the Government of Jordan has already dedicated significant resources to fight the global COVID-19 pandemic. We look forward to building on our strong cooperation with the Government of Jordan and the Government of Japan, and delivering on the positive impacts of this important assistance,” added Muhammad Usman Akram, Director of UNOPS Operational Hub in Amman.

Title: World Environment Day: Jordan joins regional voices to advocate for biodiversity
Content: 06 June 2020
This year, World Environment Day, which is marked annually on June 5, has the theme of biodiversity, a concern that is “both urgent and existential”.
“Recent events — from bushfires to locust infestations and now a global pandemic — demonstrate the interdependence of humans and the webs of life in which they exist. Nature is sending us a message".
Since 1974, the “most renowned” day for environmental action has been celebrated every year on June 5 through engaging governments, businesses, celebrities and citizens to focus their efforts on a pressing environmental issue.
“Above all, World Environment Day offers a global platform for inspiring positive change. It recognises that global change requires a global community. It pushes for individuals to think about the way they consume; for businesses to develop greener models; for farmers and manufacturers to produce more sustainably; for governments to safeguard wild spaces; for educators to inspire students to live in harmony with the Earth; and for youth to become fierce gatekeepers of a green future. It requires all of us".
In light of the limitations presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Regional Office for West Asia took its celebrations to the virtual space this year.
The office conducted a series of live discussions on social media to inform audiences of practical behavioral changes which people could adopt to lead sustainable lifestyles, manage waste in an environmentally friendly manner, transform their relationship with the natural world, adopt nature-based solutions to preserve biodiversity, the relationship between nature and climate change and the relationship between people and nature.
These live discussions hosted different partners from inside and outside of the region including the Acting Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Environment Public Authority of Kuwait and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
The regional office also launched an online challenge which called the people of the region to action by pledging their commitment to standing #ForNature, which received an “overwhelming response from Jordan”.
HRH Princess Basma, Honorary Human Development Ambassador of the UNDP, joined the challenge by posting a video and added her voice to the voices of millions of people to protect the planet.
Minister of Environment and Agriculture Saleh Kharabsheh also joined the challenge by pledging commitment to nature through a video. The challenge further witnessed the participation of several NGOs and environmental initiatives in Jordan that joined forces to amplify the World Environment Day message.
“Biodiversity contributes directly to human well-being and development priorities. It is at the centre of many economic activities, particularly those related to food and other commodities. Globally, nearly half of the human population is directly dependent on natural resources for its livelihood, and many of the most vulnerable people depend directly on biodiversity to fulfil their daily subsistence needs,” said Regional Director and Representative of UNEP for West Asia Sami Dimassi.
“Biodiversity is also critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals [SDGs] outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Biodiversity and ecosystems feature prominently across many of the SDGs and associated targets,” he added.
Dimassi also highlighted the impact of COVID-19 on the environment: “COVID-19 has revealed the vulnerability of global systems to protect the environment, health and economy. There is an increasing recognition of how multiple economic, social and institutional drivers exacerbate environment risks, impacting on human health and increasing the burden on health services.”
“Fundamental to a transformational and green recovery will be early action on a longer-term agenda to address climate change, avoid habitat loss and fragmentation, reverse the loss of biodiversity, reduce pollution and improve waste management and infrastructure,” he said.
In Jordan, UNEP in collaboration with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and national partners, has led the implementation of the Healthy Ecosystems for Rangeland Development project (HERD).
HERD is a four-year initiative funded by the Global Environment Facility bringing international experience and scientific expertise in ecosystem restoration to scale up proven approaches across half a million hectares in Jordan and Egypt. HERD is supporting communities to create inclusive rangeland management plans, while developing institutional capacity to ensure that these plans are integrated into policy and backed by wider legislation, the statement concluded.

Title: Japan continues its support to UNFPA's sexual and reproductive health clinic in Azraq camp
Content: 04 June 2020

The Government of Japan and UNFPA are taking a moment to recognise the importance of the Japan-funded UNFPA project (USD 300,000) within Azraq refugee camp, particularly relevant with the recent agreement with the Government of Japan to continue funding UNFPA’s sexual and reproductive health (SRH) clinic in Village 6. This, however, is just one of the many steps Japan has taken to support Jordan’s resilience in providing for Syrian refugees under the Jordan Response Plan 2019/2020.
In a statement from the Ambassador of Japan to Jordan, H.E. Mr. YANAGI Hidenao, noted “Genuine appreciation for UNFPA’s leading role and dedication to ensuring vulnerable refugees have access to comprehensive integrated SRH and gender-based violence (GBV) service delivery.” Going on, the Ambassador affirmed “In 2019, the government of Japan had supported UNFPA’s activities at the clinics in Village 6 in Azraq Syrian refugee camp, with the project successfully being completed this March. In light of the importance of maintaining life-saving reproductive services and safe spaces for girls and women, the government of Japan renews its commitment to support UNFPA for enhancing the access to critical reproductive services for the protection of women and girls.” The Ambassador concluded of the ongoing relationship with UNFPA’s project in Azraq Camp, “I sincerely hope our assistance reaches all women and girls in need and contributes to ensuring safe deliveries in the camp setting as well as raising awareness about the importance of preventing GBV.”
UNFPA’s new Jordan Representative, Ms Enshrah Ahmed, in turn reiterated the significance of supporting women’s reproductive health (RH) and rights through the work of the clinic and its managing partner, the International Rescue Committee, focusing on the prevention of maternal death and ending GBV. Particularly during the current health pandemic. UNFPA supports three RH clinics in Azraq refugee camp since 2014. Around 8,000 women and girls of childbearing age depend upon the clinics to access services, such as individual and couple’s family planning counseling, antenatal care, postnatal care, management of the immediate consequences of sexual violence, post-abortion care as well as referral services to a network of affiliated hospitals inside and outside the camp.
“Too often, women and girls are seen as ‘peripheral’ to the health of a family,” stated Ms. Ahmed. “The UNFPA Japan-funded clinic in Azraq camp provides safe, quality care to women so that they and their families can experience better health. It sets the standard of empowering women and their right to quality care. Such support is even more vital in the current context of COVID-19, where professional, safe and lifesaving healthcare service provision for refugees is of critical importance. We accordingly welcome with deep appreciation the ongoing support of the Government of Japan for their ongoing support for UNFPA’s project in Azraq Camp.”

Title: UNICEF hands over donation of PPE supplies to assist Jordan’s COVID-19 response
Content: 04 June 2020
UNICEF has donated medical supplies comprising personal protective equipment (PPE) to the Ministry of Health in support of Jordan’s national response to COVID-19.
The handover of supplies took place in Zarqa in the presence of UNICEF Jordan Representative Tanya Chapuisat and Ministry of Health officials.
The protective equipment to keep healthcare workers safe includes 500,000 surgical masks, 10,000 face shields and 10,000 goggles.
In total, UNICEF is donating $2.7 million worth of medical supplies to the Government of Jordan as part of the UN multiagency support for the National COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan 2020.
“UNICEF is extremely grateful to the healthcare professionals who have worked so hard to keep children and their families in Jordan safe and protected. We are proud to contribute these supplies to help ensure that they are protected while they do their job and to support the Ministry of Health in their response efforts,” Chapuisat said.
Since the outbreak, UNICEF has scaled up support to the Ministry of Health to provide critical health supplies including one million surgical caps and boot covers, as well as surgical gowns, face shields and hand sanitiser for healthcare facilities.
The supplies have been locally procured, while further essential supplies to support the national health response have been procured through UNICEF’s global supply chain.
To minimise the risks of the pandemic to children, UNICEF is also supporting the Ministry of Health’s resumption of routine immunisation and newborn screenings to give every child “the best start in life”.
In addition, UNICEF is scaling up its work with the MOH to strengthen the primary healthcare system by supporting a network of community health volunteers to deliver medications to close to 14,000 people in Mafraq, Irbid, Jerash, Ajloun and Zarqa.

Title: PSD and UN WOMEN strengthen their partnership in response to COVID-19
Content: 27 May 2020
Within the framework of joint efforts in the field of social protection and to support survivors of violence, the Public Security Directorate (PSD) and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) strengthened their partnership to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, mitigate its impact and to protect the community from virus transmission.
With the support of the Governments of Canada, Finland, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom under Jordan’s National Action Plan on the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (JONAP), UN Women provided 500 recovery bags to assist women residing in shelters, and to women inmates in the Al-Juwaideh women’s rehabilitation center.
“PSD, through the Family Protection Department (FPD), has taken concreate steps to address the issue of domestic violence. Building on many years of operations in this field, the administration made significant achievements, especially in the investigation and follow-up of all issues related to domestic violence as well as in raising family and social awareness” affirmed Brigadier-General Dr. Mutasim Abu Shattal, PSD Assistant Director for Management and Logistical Support.
The PSD Assistant Director emphasized that PSD is actively enforcing the law, providing services and assistance to those in needs. In order to achieve this, PSD has adopted a participatory strategy, engaging all national institutions and international partners, including UN Women, to work together in improving the social protection system and to provide the best legal, health, social and humanitarian services to survivors of domestic violence.
He also affirmed that, in light of the COVID-19 outbreak and national efforts to prevent the spreading of the pandemic, PSD, in partnership with UN Women, took preventive measures and adopted the highest health standards to protect women. Female officers serving in the PSD Women’s Directorate, Gendarmerie, and the Civil Defence Directorate played a critical role in responding to this pandemic.
With the support of UN Women and international partners, enhanced services were provided to survivors of violence and women hosted in rehabilitation centers. In addition, all female officers were trained to provide professional assistance and support to women in need.
“Through the JONAP pooled fund, we have been able to quickly respond to the needs of the security sector, and to support efforts to mainstream gender in the crisis response. The deployment of women police officers in the first line of response is a good example of this. Their observations and input have been crucial to integrate the perspectives of women in the measures taken, and to promote public services that respond to women’s needs.” stated Tone Allers, Norwegian Ambassador to Jordan on behalf of the donor consortium.
“The impact of Covid-19 across the world is demonstrating how a crisis specifically affects the lives of women while highlighting the leadership roles women are playing to help their countries respond and recover” said Ziad Sheikh, UN Women Jordan Representative. “Here in Jordan, our well established partnership with the Public Security Directorate under the nationally-led and widely supported JONAP is enabling UN Women support national partners in the response”.

Title: Japan grants UN-Habitat $978,709 to strengthen Amman resilience against flash floods
Content: 27 May 2020
The United Nations Human Settlement Programme (UN-Habitat) in Jordan welcomes the generous contribution from the Government of Japan for the purpose of supporting vulnerable Jordanian communities and refugees in Amman against Flash Floods.
Flash floods became a serious problem in Jordan due to rapid unplanned urbanization, insufficient capacity of drainage systems and climate change ramifications. In 2018, flash floods caused losses of lives and damage to private properties and urban infrastructure, particularly in Amman.
According to the flood hazard map for Jordan, June 2019, the districts of Amman are among the most vulnerable to flash floods and epidemics due to high population and concentration of Syrian refugees, which exercise pressure on social services and infrastructure for water and sanitation and drainage.
In order to tackle these urgent risks, UN-Habitat Jordan, in collaboration with the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) started a project to strengthen social stability and resilience of vulnerable Jordanian and Syrian communities in Amman against flash floods.
“The contribution will indirectly benefit more than 35,000 inhabitants in downtown Amman by building and rehabilitating stormwater drainage facilities using environmental-friendly construction technologies”, UN-Habitat National Programme Coordinator Ms. Deema Abu Thiab said in a statement.
Also, this project will build the capacities of GAM staff and residents of Amman through training, awareness raising campaigns to better plan and prepare for future flash floods and vocational training opportunities on appropriate flood resistance construction technologies.
The Japanese Ambassador in Amman Mr. Hidenao Yanagi also stated, “Japan appreciate that Greater Amman Municipality received so many refugees from Syria and Palestine, and we have so far cooperated with GAM for a community development programme such as “Heart of Amman” with UNDP, which will increase socio-economic self-reliance and improve livelihoods as well as revitalize local communities in downtown in Amman. We also value the important role of UNHABITAT and their efforts on addressing issues caused by rapid urbanization and mitigating negative impacts of global climate change. ".
"I have personally experienced three winters in Amman and have learned that heavy rainfall always causes flash flood in downtown Amman and many other places in Jordan, which is one of the growing challenges for Jordanian population. Therefore, we decided to finance this project, which provides a comprehensive and integrated response through capacity building on urban planning management and standards of constructions as well as restoration of necessary infrastructures. I hope that our assistance will reduce and mitigate flash flood damages and improve socio-economic resilience in vulnerable communities, as well as enhance social stabilization and economic development in Jordan" he added.

Title: Households report significant impact on livelihoods as a result of COVID-19: UNDP survey
Content: 21 May 2020
COVID-19 and the lockdown measures have had severe implications on people’s livelihoods across Jordan as two, just released assessments of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) highlight.
The rapid impact assessments were conducted during the lockdown in late April until early May, covering 12,084 citizens from across Jordan complemented by another assessment of 1,648 households focusing on some of the most vulnerable Jordanian households.
While Jordan curbs the spread of COVID-19 and trust in Government response measures is high, the impact of the crisis on households across Jordan has been significant.
UNDP Resident Representative, Sara Ferrer Olivella emphasized that the survey provides important insights for policy makers and development partners as they are developing response measures. "We need to understand who is affected, where and in what way so that assistance can reach those in most vulnerable and furthest behind”.  She added that it is particularly concerning that such a large share of people from across Jordan have been affected so severely by the socio-economic impact of COVID-19. “It shows that not only the most vulnerable have been affected but many others”.
COVID-19: A Magnifying Glass for Inequalities
More than 85 per cent of the most vulnerable households reported to have faced difficulties in meeting even basic needs like food and rent during the first few weeks of the lockdown. Even amongst the general population, almost three quarters reported similar difficulties.
Only around 7 percent of households from across Jordan reported that they were working as before, half indicating that they have lost their livelihoods, amongst the most vulnerable the proportion was even higher with 68 percent.
Incomes were already low prior to the crisis, so few have the financial resources to cope with the loss of income. Amongst the most vulnerable households almost two thirds and amongst other households participating in the survey, 66 per cent reported to have less than one week of financial resources to draw on. This highlights the very low levels of savings of many households and the limited resilience.
Despite government’s efforts to control food prices, about half of all respondents reported that they feel that food prices have risen significantly and many reported challenges in accessing basic health care.
Globally, against the backdrop of the raging COVID-19 pandemic, the world economy in 2020 is projected to shrink by 3.2 percent, racking up some $8.5 trillion in overall losses – wiping out nearly four years of output gains, according to a mid-year economic analysis by the United Nations.
Meanwhile, global human development – which can be measured as a combination of the world’s education, health and living standards – could decline this year for the first time since the concept was introduced in 1990, the UNDP warned this week.
The combined impact of these shocks could signify the largest reversal in human development on record.
In Jordan, as the economy is opening up and a staggered approach to easing lockdown measures, some challenges are becoming less but the majority of respondents expressed concern that the COVID-19 crisis will have a long-term impact on their livelihoods. More than three-quarters of people participating in the survey fear the long-term impact of the crisis on income levels and livelihoods, lasting beyond the lockdown.

Title: United Nations launches global initiative to combat misinformation
Content: 21 May 2020
Today the United Nations is launching ‘Verified’, an initiative to combat the growing scourge of COVID-19 misinformation by increasing the volume and reach of trusted, accurate information.
“We cannot cede our virtual spaces to those who traffic in lies, fear and hate,” said UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, who announced the initiative.
“Misinformation spreads online, in messaging apps and person to person. Its creators use savvy production and distribution methods. To counter it, scientists and institutions like the United Nations need to reach people with accurate information they can trust.”
Verified, led by the UN Department for Global Communications (DGC), will provide information around three themes: science – to save lives; solidarity – to promote local and global cooperation; and solutions – to advocate for support to impacted populations. It will also promote recovery packages that tackle the climate crisis and address the root causes of poverty, inequality and hunger.
The initiative is calling on people around the world to sign up to become “information volunteers” to share trusted
content to keep their families and communities safe and connected. Described as digital first responders, the
volunteers will receive a daily feed of verified content optimized for social sharing with simple, compelling messaging
that either directly counters misinformation or fills an information void.
DGC will partner with UN agencies and UN country teams, influencers, civil society, business and media organizations
to distribute trusted, accurate content and work with social media platforms to root out hate and harmful
assertions about COVID-19.
“In many countries the misinformation surging across digital channels is impeding the public health response
and stirring unrest. There are disturbing efforts to exploit the crisis to advance nativism or to target minority
groups, which could worsen as the strain on societies grows and the economic and social fallout kicks in,”
Melissa Fleming, UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, said.
“The Verified initiative will also work to address this trend with hopeful content that celebrates local acts of humanity, the contributions of refugees and migrants, and makes the case for global cooperation.”
The initiative is a collaboration with Purpose, one of the world’s leading social mobilization organizations. It is
supported by the IKEA Foundation and Luminate.
Patricia Atkinson, the IKEA Foundation’s Chief Programmes Officer, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented
global health crisis. The IKEA Foundation is proud to be supporting Verified -- an initiative aiming to
make sure everyone has access to the trusted science and advice they need to keep their family and loved ones
safe.”
Nishant Lalwani, Managing Director of Luminate, added: “COVID-19 has provided a stark reminder that access to
accurate, trusted information can be the difference between fear and resilience, division and unity, and even life
and death. We are proud to be supporting Verified and its work to tackle the coronavirus ‘infodemic’ by rapidly
spreading reliable, science-based information to protect people and communities around the world.”

Title: UNDP sets up triage unit at Irbid hospital to accommodate surge of patients during crisis
Content: 20 May 2020
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Jordan has set up a triage unit at King Abdullah University Hospital in Jordan’s northern city of Irbid to support the hospital in dealing with the latest increase in patient intake amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The triage unit serves as a screening point and a preventive measure taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus by ensuring that any patients coming in with COVID-19 symptoms are separated from the main departments of the hospital and are transferred to specialized units.
King Abdullah University Hospital has come under increased pressure since the coronavirus crisis began. Located on the intersection between several major cities, the hospital is the largest health facility in the north serving Jordanians and a Syrian refugee population of around 300,000 people.
This unit has become a permanent part of the hospital, which serves a population of one million people in northern Jordan, including Syrian refugees.
With the UNDP’s intervention, King Abdullah University Hospital is now able to handle an additional 500 cases daily, raising the overall capacity of the hospital to 2,000 daily visitors.
Following WHO guidelines, the unit is equipped with medical gear and staffed by trained healthcare professionals who received special training on classifying patients while ensuring their safety. It was set up in cooperation with Jordan Health Aid Society-International.
This the third triage facility to be set up by the UNDP in Jordan. Last month, a large triage tent was erected in front of Al Bashir Hospital, growing the capacity of the hospital’s ER unit by more than 800 patients. Al Bashir Hospital is also dealing with an increase in cases since it became the only major public hospital serving non-COVID-19 cases. Amman’s other major hospital, Prince Hamzah Hospital, has been assigned to exclusively treat COVID-19 cases.
The UNDP has also set up a triage tent at the New Zarqa Governmental Hospital’s ER unit, increasing its capacity by 400-500 unique patients daily.
Minister of Local Administration Walid Masri commended the support provided by the UNDP, especially as it increases the capacity of the health sector in light of the exceptional circumstances that Jordan, like other countries of the world, is facing to confront this pandemic.
“This unit will contribute to strengthening and supporting the capabilities of King Abdullah University Hospital, which is bearing additional burdens as one of the hospitals specialized in dealing with this pandemic".
UNDP Resident Representative Sara Ferrer Olivella said that Jordan's public health sector has been under “intense pressure” in dealing with the testing and treatment of COVID-19 cases.
“This pandemic is an unprecedented health crisis, and it is also a humanitarian and development crisis,” she said, adding: “The UNDP’s support in partnership with AGFUND [Arab Gulf Programme for Development] and national partners in Jordan seeks to strengthen the health systems by preventing the spread of the virus.”
“There are the COVID-19 cases, but there are thousands of other cases that also need care and should not be left behind,” she added.
The UNDP is studying adding triage facilities in other healthcare institutions at public hospitals and border crossings.
Executive Director of AGFUND Nasser Alkahtani recognised the efforts made by the UNDP in addressing the socio-economic impact of the pandemic in Jordan.
“As a response to the COVID-19 crisis, AGFUND and the UNDP’s partnership has been established to support and strengthen the health system in Jordan, which will lead to providing healthcare for both Syrian refugees and host communities,” said Alkahtani.
“Today, through our financial inclusion programmes for Jordanians and Syrian refugees, we all stand together in the fight against this pandemic,” he added.
According to General Manager of King Abdullah University Hospital Mohammad Al Ghazou, this unit is a “critical effort” in ensuring that all patients and employees are safe from possible infection.
“The triage unit helps keep everyone safe by creating more capacity for the ER units and facilitate required physical distancing for potentially contagious patients and allowing our team to have more room to accommodate a large surge of patients,” he said.

Title: Gender-based violence in Jordan increases during COVID-19 pandemic- UNFPA
Content: 15 May 2020
The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the manner in which millions of women, men, girls and boys across the world live. Jordan, a country hosting more than 700 000 refugees in a complex region of the globe, has like most other countries been deeply affected by the impact of COVID-19 on its economy and social system.
During April 2020, the UNFPA Jordan Country Office in coordination with Plan International and the Institute for Family Health (IFH)/Noor Al Hussein Foundation commissioned a rapid assessment of the COVID-19 situation in Jordan. The overall purpose of this rapid assessment was to measure the impact of COVID-19 on gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive health rights among adolescent girls and young women in Jordan, including persons with disabilities (PwD).
The assessment results demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions have led to greater uncertainty, stress, and health and psychological risks for women and girls, many of whom already face challenges of entrenched gender inequality and discrimination.
Gender-based violence—particularly domestic violence— has increased during the pandemic: with 69 percent of all survey respondents and informants advising of increasing prevalence. Not unlike other countries in which UNFPA works, emotional and physical abuse—often perpetrated by an intimate partner or member of the family—have been the most commonly occurring form of abuse.
As Sexual and Reproductive Health services and products are curtailed, women and girls risk losing control over their bodies, equating to a loss of control and agency over their lives and futures. In short, the rights of women, girls, and young people are profoundly threatened by the pandemic, and there is a need for concerted, assertive action on the part of the UN, civil society, the government, and donors to ensure the protection and empowerment of women and girls in Jordan.
UNFPA Jordan will continue to serve local communities through civil society organisations, so as to support all survivors of abuse and violence, diversifying our approaches to adapt to the complexities of the COVID-19 operating environment. UNFPA Jordan in partnership with the Government of Jordan and all of our partners will ensure gender based violence and sexual and reproductive health services are prioritised as a life-saving response during the current quarantine and curfew context within Jordan.
“During these critical times, it is important we continue to shine a light on the issues faced by the most vulnerable members of our society; girls and young women.  They will not only face the direct health threats posed by COVID-19, but will also be particularly affected by the secondary impacts of the outbreak as during the lockdown, they are more at risk of suffering gender based violence, and losing vital access to their sexual and reproductive health rights” Muna Abbas, Country Director, Plan International Jordan
To ensure the safety and well-being of girls and young women, Plan International will continue to place their needs and rights at the center of our efforts as the COVID-19 crisis unfolds. By working with communities, the national government, and partners, Plan International will help guarantee that the rights of a young generation are highlighted, safeguarded, and included in Jordan’s continued response plans.
"The Institute for Family Health IFH will continue to contribute to the national efforts in responding to the consequences of COVID19 especially providing safe access to SRH and SGBV services to the most vulnerable populations from refugees and host communities" Dr. Ibrahim Aqel, Director of the Institute for Family Health IFH.

Title: Ireland makes $1.1m contribution to support UNICEF’s work in Jordan
Content: 13 May 2020
The Government of Ireland has announced a new contribution of $1.1 million to support UNICEF’s work with vulnerable children in Jordan, including Syrian refugees.
The funding will support UNICEF’s health and nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and education programmes for vulnerable children and women in Jordan.
“The generous support from Ireland will help ensure that our lifesaving work for the most vulnerable children in refugee camps and the host community can continue during the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent this from becoming a child rights crisis,” UNICEF Jordan Representative Tanya Chapuisat said.
Announcing the funding, Irish Minister of State for the Diaspora and Development Ciarán Cannon said: “COVID-19 is severely affecting children who were already very vulnerable and bringing many more below the poverty line. The impacts of the virus on children are being made worse by the closure of schools and disruption of family incomes.”
“Ireland is proud to continue to partner with UNICEF in its valuable work in Jordan supporting these children and their caregivers,” he said.
Ireland’s contribution will support the provision of clean water and safe sanitation in refugee camps, where water provision has increased to respond to growing hygiene needs to protect refugees from the coronavirus and boost the climate-resilience of Jordan’s water-scarce communities.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, UNICEF has distributed soap and supported hygiene awareness to over 120,000 refugees and other vulnerable populations.
The partnership is also helping to scale up UNICEF’s work with the Jordanian Ministry of Education to increase the provision of accessible and quality education to children in the Kingdom. This includes the critical window for Early Childhood Development in pre-primary years and non-formal education for those who have dropped out of school because of conflict, protection risks and economic hardship.
Ireland is also supporting UNICEF’s efforts with the Ministry of Health to deliver health and nutrition services to children and mothers in refugee camps and vulnerable communities, which has become “even more critical” since the emergence of COVID-19, the agency said.
Ireland is a “long-standing partner” of UNICEF in Jordan and has supported UNICEF’s work to strengthen national systems and provide essential services to children since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, the statement concluded.

Title: Australia extends an additional contribution to UN Women to support vulnerable women in Jordan
Content: 10 May 2020
The Government of Australia, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, extended an additional timely contribution to the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) in response to COVID-19, and to provide livelihood opportunities to vulnerable Jordanian and Syrian refugee women. Activities will engage more than 500 vulnerable women in UN Women’s Oases centers located in the Za’atari and Azraq refugee camps, as well as in Oases located in community centers managed in partnership with the Ministry of Social Development in the Governorates of Zarqa, East Amman, Karak, Maan, and Tafileh.
The partnership will also focus on creating an enabling environment for women’s empowerment and civic engagement at the community level, by facilitating their access to key protection, education and enabling services, such as childcare facilities and transportation, thus benefitting also 1,800 children annually.
“We are pleased to be able to support and empower more women in Jordan through the expansion of our partnership with UN Women. The flexibility of our funding means it can be directed to those most in need, which is particularly important as Jordan deals with COVID-19” affirmed H.E. Miles Armitage, Australian Ambassador to Jordan.
This flexible financing instrument has been critical for UN Women to respond to the immediate needs of women during the COVID-19 pandemic, including equipping all its Oases centers with additional sanitization materials to protect the community from virus transmission. UN Women also worked closely with the Ministry of Social Development to distribute direct cash assistance to more than 400 vulnerable Jordanian women and Syrian refugees across the Kingdom through its Oasis centers, while ensuring seamless and remote access to cash entitlements by Syrian refugees in camps through its innovative blockchain system in partnership with WFP.
“Jordan has taken important steps to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. Putting women’s empowerment at the centre of its efforts will help ensure the country recovers more effectively” said Mr. Ziad Sheikh, UN Women Jordan Representative.
“UN Women welcomes this renewed partnership with the Government of Australia, which enabled us to rapidly deploy life-sustaining services and information to women in need, especially in rural areas”.
Since 2017, more than 50,000 Syrian refugee and vulnerable Jordanian women benefitted from resilience and empowerment services offered by UN Women through the generous support of the Government of Australia. Within this framework, UN Women also partnered with the World Food Programme (WFP) to increase the number of Syrian women benefiting from the economic opportunities provided through WFP's school feeding programme in the Za’atari and Azraq refugee camps.
As of 2019, UN Women is partnering with WFP and IrisGuard to distribute cash entitlements in refugee camps through a blockchain technology system, which allows women to choose to save their money, receive cash-back, or purchase food and

Title: Japan donates $2.2m to underpin UNICEF Jordan’s health, sanitation, protection services
Content: 10 May 2020
The Government of Japan has announced a new contribution of $2.2 million to support UNICEF Jordan’s work to keep children healthy, learning and protected during the COVID-19 pandemic and to reduce the impact on the most vulnerable families.
The funding will support UNICEF’s health and nutrition, child protection, water and sanitation and social protection interventions for children and women in Jordan, including Syrian refugees.
“UNICEF, working closely with partners including the Government of Japan, is rapidly scaling up and striving to maintain continuity of programmes at this time, while also responding and adapting to the pandemic and its impact on the most vulnerable,” said Tanya Chapuisat, UNICEF Jordan representative.
“We are very grateful for the continued support from the people of Japan, which is helping children in Jordan to survive and thrive,” she added..
Japanese Ambassador to Jordan Hidenao Yanagi said: “Japan always stands by Jordan as a friend even during difficult times. We attach also great importance to the role of UNICEF in providing humanitarian assistance to vulnerable Jordanians and refugees in various sectors such as health, WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene] as well as protection.”
“Given the increasing threat of COVID-19, it is critically important to enhance humanitarian responses, particularly in the health and WASH sectors. I sincerely hope our assistance will be of help to address the unprecedented crisis as well as to mitigate risks of transmission in the refugee camps and host communities,” he commented.
The generous contribution from the Government of Japan will enable UNICEF to scale up water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools across Jordan, as well as support the provision of safe water and sanitation to vulnerable Syrian refugees living in remote areas and refugee camps.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, UNICEF has distributed soap to 120,000 refugees and carried out mass hygiene awareness campaigns.
UNICEF’s partnership with the Government of Japan is also supporting life-saving efforts with the Ministry of Health to deliver health and nutrition services to children in refugee camps and provide routine and catch-up immunisation services to children and mothers across the country.
As communities are disrupted by COVID-19, children already at risk of violence, exploitation and abuse have become even more vulnerable. The support from Japan will also provide much-needed child protection services to prevent violence and strengthen the protection response for women and girls.
The Government of Japan is a “long and valued partner” of UNICEF in Jordan and has provided funding of over $36 million since the beginning of the Syrian crisis to support UNICEF’s work to strengthen national systems and provide lifesaving services for children, according to the statement.

Title: UN supports Jordan’s COVID-19 response
Content: 06 May 2020
Against the backdrop of national efforts to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak, the United Nations Country Team is working with the Government of Jordan to mitigate the impact of the Coronavirus on all people in the country.
Since the onset of the crisis, the UN has intensified its support for refugee and other vulnerable populations, while offering expertise and material assistance to support the national response to the Covid-19 emergency.  The UN is now working with the government to address the immediate, medium and longer-term socio-economic impacts of the crisis.
“The Covid-19 pandemic is a massive and unprecedented health crisis that threatens the development, social and economic gains realized in recent years,” said Anders Pedersen, the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Jordan. “Collective work is needed now more than ever to reduce the impact of the virus.  Only by working together, can we tackle the immediate and longer-term health and socio-economic repercussions of the crisis”.
Health preparedness and response
The UN team, led by the WHO, is supporting Jordan’s National Preparedness and Response Operational Plan to contain and respond to the virus. Support ranges from technical advice to procurement of medical and personal protection equipment (PPE) to gender-responsive and inclusive risk communication materials.
UNICEF and UNHCR has procured emergency health equipment and supplies valued at US$3.7 and $1.2 million, respectively to support the Ministry of Health. In addition, UNHCR has gifted six ambulances to the Ministry.
UNDP is supporting medical waste management in Jordan’s public hospitals to protect patients, medical workers and the public.  This includes support for the Al-Bashir hospital ER triage tent, which allows the hospital to continue to care for some 2,000 non-Covid cases per day.
UNRWA is reducing the risk of spread of the virus in ten Palestinian refugee camps by removing over 300 tons of refuse daily as part of its environmental health program.
The continuity of learning
Following the nation-wide closure of schools, the UN adopted programming to make sure schoolchildren were able to continue their education, including in refugee camps. UNESCO, UNICEF and UNHCR are supporting the Ministry of Education to implement the ‘Education During Emergency Plan’ to provide online and low-tech solutions for vulnerable communities as well as pathways for return to schools.  UNRWA is also implementing remote-learning techniques, targeted at over 118,000 Palestinian refugee students from UNRWA schools and training centers.
Water, sanitation and hygiene
UNICEF and partners have increased the allowance of water per person per day in refugee camps and procured emergency hygiene and cleaning supplies for vulnerable families in camps and host communities. UNICEF has also supplied the Ministry of Water and Irrigation with PPEs for workers at water and wastewater facilities.
Addressing gender-based violence (GBV)
Recognizing that domestic violence surges during crises, the UN is stepping up efforts to combat gender-based violence (GBV) and make sure life-saving assistance remains available.
UN Women is providing tools and guidance on gender-sensitive services to Security Sector Agencies and civil society organizations.  Collaboration with the Jordanian Women’s Union continues, with a focus on securing safe and confidential protection services, access to shelters and essential supplies for GBV survivors.
UNICEF is working with the Family Protection Department to ensure reporting and referral of reported cases of violence continues during curfew and is scaling up preparedness at shelters.  Efforts to combat online child exploitation are also continuing.
UNHCR and its protection partners continue to provide essential protection services to refugees, while UNFPA has prioritized the resumption of sexual and reproductive health services in the Zaatari and Azraq refugee camps and continued support for GBV hotlines.
Food security and Livelihood
WFP is working closely with the government to continue cash assistance to address the basic food needs of half a million refugees across the kingdom.  An assessment led by WFP and FAO is identifying the effect of Covid-19 on Jordan’s food commodities and markets, with results indicating that the government’s proactive measures were critical in maintaining a functioning agricultural sectors and food supply chain.
The UN will continue to support authorities to monitor consumer food prices and ensure the most vulnerable have access to sufficient food supplies. Maintaining and expanding food and cash assistance for refugees and other vulnerable people is a priority.
Through UNDP programs, continuing income generating activities for vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees is also a priority, as is ongoing support to local MSMEs.
Social Protection and Governance
The UN is implementing a range of social protection and cash assistance program to respond to the needs of vulnerable people, as well as generating evidence to better inform planning and programming as part of the COVID-19 response.
UNICEF and WFP, in collaboration with the World Bank, are providing technical and joint programming assistance to the National Aid Fund (NAF) to strengthen and temporarily expand coverage. As part of the expansion, WFP and UNICEF are supporting the enrolment and opening of mobile wallets for both newly registered Takaful recipients and the 200,000 households under emergency cash support, while WFP also provided virtual financial literacy sessions.
UN Women is providing cash assistance for vulnerable Jordanian women and Syrian refugees through its Oasis centers and in refugee camps.  UNICEF has also scaled up its cash transfer progamme ‘Hajati’ to target 30,000 boys and girls with continued learning and safety net for at-risk families.
UNRWA is working to reduce the impact of loss of livelihoods for Palestine refugees in the Jerash camp through a one-time cash assistance.
UNDP has re-oriented, repurposed and introduced digital initiatives in support of the Government’s Covid-19 response.
UNDP is also proceeding with the implementation of the joint program with UN Women to support women’s civic and political participation in light of the forthcoming parliamentary elections in the context of COVID19.
Youth
UNICEF technical and vocational scholarships have supported young people with laptops and internet to continue learning online.  Thousands of young people have signed up for the UNICEF-supported National Engagement Platform, Nahno, to volunteer their services for the online national effort.  The platform is also providing intensive training to support community-level responses.
UN appeals
UNHCR, UNICEF and IOM have launched appeals with $27 million, $22.4 and $4.5 million respectively to continue to be able to support the people and Government of Jordan with urgent priority response interventions.

Title: Australia announces $3m contribution to UNICEF Jordan’s child protection, education endeavours
Content: 05 May 2020
The funding will support UNICEF’s health and nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), child protection and education programmes for vulnerable children and women in Jordan during the COVID-19 response, and help prevent the health crisis from becoming a children’s rights crisis.
The Government of Australia has announced a new contribution of $3 million to support UNICEF’s work to keep children healthy, learning and protected in Jordan..
The funding will support UNICEF’s health and nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), child protection and education programmes for vulnerable children and women in Jordan during the COVID-19 response, and help prevent the health crisis from becoming a children’s rights crisis.
“We are extremely grateful to the Government of Australia for their continuous and flexible support to ensure that UNICEF can support national efforts and keep delivering for children in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic, while also scaling up our long-term response to ensure that gains made for children in recent years are not reversed,” UNICEF Jordan Representative Tanya Chapuisat said.
Miles Armitage, Australia’s ambassador to Jordan, said in the statement:“As the world deals with the global pandemic, it is important that the most vulnerable people in Jordan are protected and supported. UNICEF has been a long-standing and reliable partner for Australia in Jordan and our continuing support ensures the interests of children are not overlooked in the response to the COVID-19 crisis.”
This contribution from Australia will enable UNICEF to support the most vulnerable students, including Syrian refugees, to continue their education through distance learning, as well as assisting their eventual return to school.
It is also supporting the life-saving provision of safe water and sanitation to vulnerable Syrian refugees living in remote areas and refugee camps. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, UNICEF has distributed soap to 120,000 refugees and carried out mass hygiene awareness campaigns.
UNICEF’s partnership with Australia is also supporting life-saving efforts with the Ministry of Health to deliver health and nutrition services to children and mothers in refugee camps and vulnerable communities.
With the risk of violence rising as communities are disrupted by COVID-19, the funding will also help strengthen the protection response for women and girls.
Australia is a valued partner of UNICEF in Jordan and has provided funding of over $24 million since the beginning of the Syrian crisis to support UNICEF’s work to strengthen national systems and provide lifesaving services for children.

Title: UNRWA in Jordan launch comprehensive “Education cannot wait: distance learning programme
Content: 01 May 2020
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) education programme launched a rapid response distance learning plan, the “Education Cannot Wait” initiative for Palestine refugee students in the Agency’s 169 schools across, accommodating the needs of some 118,000 Palestine refugees students. The plan ensures continuity of their scholastic programming, allowing for access to a quality and inclusive education despite the COVID-19 related school closures.
Agency educational staff at every tier of educational provision were involved to ensure student access to various e-learning platforms, as well as resources launched by the Jordanian Ministry of Education. These platforms include: Darsak (1) and Darsak (2) online platforms, as well as lessons broadcast on  television channels across Jordan. The UNRWA education programme provided remote training for to Agency teachers, preparing them for the new mode of teaching.
Since the lockdown on movement on 19 March 2020, two UNRWA technical and vocational education training centres (TVET), namely the Amman Training Centre and the Wadi Seer Training Centre, as well as the Faculty of Educational Sciences and Arts (FESA) immediately transitioned to online educational programming through Moodle, among other direct contact platforms.
“In light of this global emergency, UNRWA is dedicating significant effort to provide the best for our students to ensure the continuity of their education", said Mohammed Adar, Director of UNRWA Affairs in Jordan.
"We believe that education cannot stop and cannot wait. The future of Palestine refugees is our priority,"
"In a great collaboration with telecommunications companies in Jordan, our students in TVET and FESA are now able to access the online materials through free-of-charge internet connection packages. This excellent partnership enables our students continue following their lessons without any additional financial burden," Mr. Adar added.
UNRWA has prioritized a holistic response, including consideration of widespread access to smart phones, tablet and laptops, as well as provision of hygiene materials, remote career guidance sessions and psychological support via a network of school mentors.
“I’m very blissed to be able to keep up with my lessons at home,” said Kinan Ahmed, an UNRWA student at the Jabal el-Hussien School, “It’s a new and exciting experience!” he added.
Since it began operations in 1950, UNRWA has educated over two and a half million refugee children under a programme recognised as a significant educational force in the Middle East. UNRWA now serves more than 533,000 Palestine refugees in 709 Agency schools across the Middle East, providing quality and inclusive education even through times of emergency.

Title: UN Jordan works side-by-side with the Kingdom to respond to COVID-19 crisis
Content: 16 April 2020
AMMAN — In these exceptional circumstances and the current unprecedented health crisis, the UN in Jordan shares the concerns that many people share, said Anders Pedersen, current UN resident and humanitarian coordinator in Jordan, on Tuesday.
He told the Jordan News Agency, Petra, that, as the battle against the emerging coronavirus appears to be “one of the greatest challenges facing humanity” at the present time, cooperation is needed to support the efforts of the Jordanian government in response to the pandemic.
Led by the World Health Organisation (WHO) team in Jordan, the UN country team is working closely with the Jordanian government and relevant authorities to support the national response plan to tackle the outbreak of COVID-19, Pedersen said.
“Our support to the Jordanian government includes — but is not limited to — developing the national preparedness and response plan in line with WHO directives to contain the transmission of the virus,” he noted.
“Our support includes purchasing medical supplies, personal protection tools and diagnostic tests for the emerging coronavirus, in addition to supporting educational and awareness campaigns and providing safe water, sanitation services, medical waste management and remote learning,” the coordinator said.
If the pandemic places any restrictions on human rights practices and fundamental freedoms, the UN in Jordan will support the government to ensure that anti-virus measures are applied without discrimination of any kind and in accordance with relevant international standards, Pedersen added.
He said that in response to the measures announced by the Jordanian government, the UN has put in place plans for business continuity to ensure the implementation of its programmes for various Jordanian and non-Jordanian people, especially for the most vulnerable groups, women and children.
Pedersen also stressed that the UN continues to provide basic and life-saving services, including water and sanitation, health and food services, in addition to protection and remote education for children and youth in refugee camps, through agencies located in the field in cooperation with local authorities.
He highlighted the respect of the UN in Jordan and its deep appreciation for all health workers and emergency response services and all those on the front lines who are “working tirelessly in response to the current situation”, adding: “We ask everyone to support them in these difficult circumstances."
"While we are working to address the crisis, we are also looking beyond its short- and medium- term health dimensions to determine its social and economic impacts, in order to identify the best mechanisms to support Jordan to face the effects of the crisis that will be revealed later," Pedersen said.

Title: UNDP and partners set up ER triage tent for the intake during COVID-19 pandemic
Content: 13 April 2020
The United Nations Development Programme, in partnership with the Jordan Health Aid Society (JHAS) and coordination with the Ministry of Health and Al Basheer Hospital, has erected a triage tent in the entrance of Al Basheer Hospital to assist the hospital in dealing with incoming emergency cases.
Al Basheer Public Hospital has been receiving an increased number of cases as Amman’s other major public health facility, Prince Hamzeh Hospital, has been assigned to exclusively treat COVID-19 cases. The tent would help relieve pressure on Al Basheer by taking 800 patients daily who are not infected with the virus but need other medical care.
UNDP Resident Representative, Sara Ferrer Olivella said Jordan's public health sector has been under intense pressure to deal with testing and treatment of COVID-19 cases.
“This pandemic is an unprecedented health crisis, and it is also a humanitarian and development crisis,” she said, adding “UNDP’s support in partnership with national partners in Jordan seeks to strengthen the health systems, by preventing the spread of the virus.”
“There are the COVID-19 cases, but there are thousands of other cases that also need care and should not be left behind,” she added.
Director of Al-Bashir Hospital, Dr. Mahmoud Zureikat said that the establishment of the tent will enhance the hospital’s ability to deal with the large number of patients that come to the emergency room, and will help in classifying sick cases while preventing the spread of infection of all kinds. He added that the tent is manned by the medical and nursing staff of all specialities.
Zureikat praised the initiative to establish and equip this tent by Jordanian Health Aid Society and with support from the UNDP, emphasizing on the importance of government, civil society and UN partnership in responding to immediate challenges.
The tent, according to President of the Jordan Health Aid Society, Yaroup Ajlouni is “critical in helping us limit the spread of the disease between patients and staff.”
“The main purpose is to decrease overcrowding; so we have set up the triage tent with physical distancing taken into account. We also want to decrease the pressure on the ER Unit at Al Basheer which is receiving 1200-2000 cases that are not Covid19 related” he said.
The tent is now in operation on a 24-hour basis over three shifts with a staff of eight doctors and eight nurses per shift.
Medial crew have been supplied with personal protection gear, long-distance infrared thermometers and other equipment designed to protect both healthcare workers and the patients.
As part of UNDP and partners support, the medical crew received training on the proper use of protective gear.
“Healthcare professionals are working on the frontlines and we need to make sure they are using protection gear properly to ensure their utmost safety,” Al Ajlouni said.

Title: UNRWA in Jordan delivers essential medicines to Palestine refugees in camps
Content: 05 April 2020
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Jordan medical staff, consisting of doctors, pharmacists and nurses have started delivering medicines for refugee populations in need. First round of distribution will take approximately 2 weeks and first round of patients targeted are people with diabetes, hyper tension who rely on insulin, patients with chronic diseases and pregnant women who have diabetes whose medications were due between March 21st and March 31st 2020.
This initiative is one of the precautionary measures to protect life and health of Palestine refugee populations by delivering essential medicines to those in need, especially in light with the current circumstances and the ongoing imposed curfew.
During the past six days, 11,394 patients’ houses received their Non Communicable Disease medicines. Only 60 UNRWA staff members with the support of the local community voluntary groups are making this happen during this challenging time facing the world and UNRWA will carry on the distribution to all other camps.
The Director of UNRWA Affairs in Jordan, Mr. Mohammed Adar said “We deeply thank the Government of Jordan for its continued support to Palestine refugees and UNRWA, and we particularly acknowledge the Director General of the Department of Palestinian Affairs, Eng Rafiq Khirfan, for his invaluable cooperation and assistance provided to the Agency to obtain the necessary permits for our staff to continue our operations. We are making every effort to deliver the medicines to refugee populations in-need in the most speedy manner at all camps”.
UNRWA health Centres however; are still closed due to the imposed curfew. The medicine delivery is being coordinated with the local authorities in each camp and the medicines will be delivered to the patients’ houses. The Local community in the camps have been a great help to our medical staff in the distribution of medications to reach out to those in need more efficiently.
Moreover, UNRWA has been discussing with the government of Jordan about when will be the best time to reopen the Health Centers and re-start providing vital health services at 25 Health Centres while ensuring to control the gathering of people.
UNRWA keeps emphasizing that refugees are strongly requested to stay home and respect social distancing to protect their health, their families’ health as well as their community.
Under the current circumstances, UNRWA health department advises refugee pregnant women who are due to give birth to approach the Ministry of Health hospitals and submit their claim for reimbursement to the Area Health Office or Camp Services Office when the situation is safe.
As for the periodic children vaccines, they are to be rescheduled after the curfew without any harm to the child’s health. The Agency is establishing a hotline at the Health Centre for inquires and emergencies. It will be announced as soon as it is ready.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, UNRWA has offered health awareness sessions for refugees and thorough training for its medical and educational staff in the health centers and at the schools, both inside and outside the camps. Environmental health activities such as cleaning and sanitizing all 10 camps continues extensively since the crisis happened.
Furthermore, our medical officers are equipped with knowledge of the WHO-adopted case definition to classify the cases, should that be the necessity. In case of any suspected cases, patients will be referred to the designated hospitals according to the government regulations for the needed examination and quarantine.

Title: Meeting vital needs: WFP continues food assistance to Kingdom’s refugees
Content: 04 April 2020
The World Food Programme (WFP) in Jordan continues to provide food assistance to close to half a million vulnerable Syrian refugees and refugees of other nationalities.
This assistance is provided through cash-based transfers, and each month the WFP transfers close to JD10 million to refugees.
The WFP transferred its April assistance to refugees in camps and communities across the country early to enable them to meet their food needs during the period of limited movement.
In refugee camps, the WFP’s contracted supermarkets and bread shops continue to serve refugees while ensuring that all protective measures recommended by the Jordanian government are being followed.
“During this critical period, it is very important that the WFP maintains its food assistance programme through cash-based transfers, which represent a lifeline for close to half a million vulnerable refugees in Jordan,” said WFP Country Director and Representative Sarah Gordon-Gibson.
The WFP is working closely with the government, partners and UN agencies to ensure the continuation of services and provision of information to the refugee population.
“We are coordinating with partners to ensure the uninterrupted transfer of cash and supply chain of nutritious food to refugees across the Kingdom during this time,” Gordon-Gibson was quoted in the statement as saying.
The WFP continues to operate its call centre and respond to refugees’ questions and concerns and monitors its activities remotely. The programme is maintaining its presence in the camps to ensure that refugees are able to redeem their assistance, to enhance coordination and to monitor the implementation of protective measures.
Through coordination with the Government of Jordan, the programme is scaling up its assistance to vulnerable Jordanians impacted by COVID-19 through cash assistance and livelihood activities.

Title: UNHCR appeals for $27 Million to help refugees and Jordanians combat Coronavirus
Content: 31 March 2020
Launching today, UNHCR is appealing for $27 million to help prevent the spread of coronavirus in Jordan. As part of a global appeal which calls for $255 million to urgently support preparedness and response measures for refugees and those forcibly displaced, money needed for Jordan will go towards maintaining essential services such as hospitals and clinics, including in refugee camps, procuring medical equipment, providing urgent cash assistance and stepping up life-saving protection interventions such as urgent referrals for domestic violence cases and other forms of gender-based violence.
Thanks to funding already received from the Government of Japan, UNHCR this week contributed $1.2 million to the Ministry of Health to aid the procurement of medical equipment, laboratory tests and personal protective equipment (PPE). A key reminder that the coronavirus outbreak can only be addressed through international solidarity and cooperation.
To date in Jordan there have been no cases of refugees who have contracted the coronavirus but UNHCR continues to observe the negative impact of measures to prevent the spread of the virus on refugee families as well as the local Jordanian host community. With many refugees relying on the informal economy for work, the effects of a reduced number of job opportunities on vulnerable individuals has already been stark.
“Over the last two weeks at UNHCR, colleagues across the organization have received hundreds of enquiries from vulnerable refugee families requesting additional support because of the dire financial situation they are finding themselves in. We hope that funds raised through this appeal will go some way in alleviating the challenges they are facing as well as supporting the Government of Jordan in implementing a comprehensive and inclusive response,” said UNHCR Jordan Representative, Dominik Bartsch.
Under measures brought in by the Government of Jordan to curb the spread of the virus, UNHCR has closed its registration and community centers across the country and suspended in-person interviews and counselling. Despite this, operations to protect refugees in Jordan are ongoing. Essential staff are on the ground in Zaatari and Azraq refugee camps coordinating all camp-based activities including health preparedness measures and elsewhere staff across the operation continue to work on a remote basis, maximizing digital and online channels to support refugees during this difficult time.
In addition, essential services, such as hospitals, clinics and supermarkets, remain open in refugee camps and electricity provision has also been enhanced to over 14 hours a day to support children who are studying via TV and e-learning platforms. Refugees across the Kingdom continue to adhere and practice social distancing and follow health advisories shared by UNHCR and the Ministry of Health.
The appeal which feeds into the global UN call for $2 billion of funding, launched last week, aims at supporting countries in responding to the Corona Virus. For Jordan, which has continued to welcome and host approximately 750,000 refugees from 52 nationalities, the impact of 256 confirmed coronavirus cases has already put an additional strain on infrastructure and services. In order to ensure that all those who call the Kingdom home, including refugees, can continue to access the healthcare and support they need these additional funds are desperately needed.
“At UNHCR we continue to have a productive and very cooperative working relationship with the Government of Jordan and a variety of specialized line ministries. The challenges facing refugees are, on the whole, the same challenges that are facing vulnerable Jordanians and together we can stop the spread of this virus,” concluded UNHCR Jordan Representative, Dominik Bartsch.

Title: Poverty among refugees threatens to increase as Syria conflict marks its ninth anniversary
Content: 09 March 2020
An estimated 79 percent of refugees – or over 500,000 people – live below the poverty line, on less than $3 a day, in Jordan. As the Syria crisis marks its ninth anniversary, UNHCR is concerned that more and more refugees throughout the Kingdom, as well as in the region, may slide into poverty as the economic climate in countries hosting large numbers of refugees continues to be impacted.
Syrian refugees are resilient and resourceful, but today they need our support more than ever.
In Jordan:
Despite this, over the last nine years, many successes have been achieved:

Title: UNESCO and partners launch a project to promote sustainable socio-economic development in Petra
Content: 02 March 2020
The UNESCO Amman office and the Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), hosted a launch event in Petra, commemorating the initiation of a new project. The “Employment opportunities for cultural heritage safeguarding in Jordan” project seeks to promote sustainable socio-economic development through a two-pronged approach, focusing on investing in cultural heritage preservation, while also creating short-term decent job opportunities.
The event took place at the College of Tourism and Archaeology at the Al Hussein Bin Talal University in Petra. Addressing the audience, H.E Eng. Majed Hasanat, Park Commissioner of Petra Development & Tourism Region Authority delivered opening remarks reaffirming the commitment of the Authority to collaborate with partners to achieve the collective objectives, aligned with the strategic outlook adopted for the tourism sector development in Petra. H.E Hasanat emphasized the global significance of the World Heritage Site, recognizing its cultural importance and natural beauty and highlighting the economic development targets set for surrounding local communities.
The project provides short-term employment opportunities to vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees living in host communities located in the vicinity of the Petra World Heritage site and Rihab village. These locations in North and South Jordan are rich in archaeological heritage. On-the-job training will be provided to the CfW beneficiaries, improving their future employability.
Delivering welcoming remarks on behalf of UNESCO, Ms. Cristina Menegazzi, recognized the generous support of GIZ and summarized the impact of the initiative. “By promoting greater community engagement in the rehabilitation and conservation of the heritage sites in Jordan through this initiative, UNESCO aims to encourage local ownership of these sites. As a further benefit, the project aims to ensure that a larger section of the local community benefits from revenue generated by tourism”.
Mr. Aladdin Alhiyasat of Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, spoke on behalf of GIZ, thanking partners and beneficiaries for their strong engagement. The project is part of the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (BMZ) Special Initiative ‘Tackling the root causes of migration, stabilizing host regions, supporting refugees.’ The project will contribute to the employment of refugees and people in need from the host communities, while promoting social cohesion and sustainable development in the region.
UNESCO is implementing this critical project alongside AVSI, a non-profit organization carrying out development and humanitarian projects throughout the world, with experience in Cash for Work project implementation. The German Jordanian University has developed the Site Maintenance and Tourism Development Plan (SMTDP) for the World Heritage site of Petra. This initiative benefits from the strong technical support provided by the Department of Antiquities. In Petra, the project will undertake cleaning of the two upper sides of the Siq’, together with two trails that are targeted for rehabilitation: the Unayshu trail and the back trail from Little Petra to the Monastery.

Title: UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay due in Jordan to strengthen cooperation
Content: 02 March 2020
The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Audrey Azoulay shall undertake her first official visit to Jordan this week. The Director-General’s visit serves to further strengthen robust cooperation between UNESCO and Jordan, focusing on the realms of education, science and culture.
The Director-General is set to meet with a number of Jordanian officials to discuss matters of mutual interest, in seeking to advance and expand the longstanding relationship. Among other activities, she will visit Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East (SESAME), a successful example of international collaboration among a host of scientists from varying backgrounds, making use of advanced technology for the benefit of people and to address contemporary challenges.
In a dedicated visit, the Director-General will engage with students at Luminus Technical University College (LTUC). At LTUC, she will connect with Jordanian and Syrian refugee youth. These students have taken part in the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) program implemented by UNESCO, with generous multi-year funding from the Government of the Republic of Korea. The project supports the Government of Jordan’s efforts to provide youth affected by the Syria Crisis with post-secondary education opportunities, through TVET training programs.
The Director-General will also pay a visit to Mount Nebo, a historically significant location thought to be the place where Moses viewed the Holy Land. She will also visit the Baptism Site “Bethany Beyond the Jordan”, inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2015 as the place where Jesus is said to have been baptized, alongside the remains of Roman and Byzantine churches and chapels. Finally, the Director-General will enjoy an excursion to the Amman Citadel, an important cultural site with a long history dating to many great civilizations, followed by a journey to explore Petra.
The preservation of the World Heritage Site of Petra is a key component of the technical support provided by UNESCO to Jordan's national authorities in charge of the conservation and management of Jordan's extraordinary heritage. The development and endorsement in November 2019 of the Petra Integrated Management Plan represents a major achievement of these joint efforts. The Government of Italy has been a key partner of UNESCO in Petra since 2011, supporting national and local authorities to address a number of consecutive initiatives with the aim of reducing landslide risk and ensuring tourist and site safety in the ‘Siq’, the mythical corridor carved in stone leading to the ancient city.
While in Jordan, it is expected that the Director-General will meet the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Mr. Anders Pedersen.

Title: FAO reviews plans to protect Jordan's forests
Content: 15 January 2020
On the occasion of Arbor Day, the office of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations "FAO" has inspected a forest named after FAO in Jerash and reviewed plans to protect the country’s scarce forests.
The staff toured the forest, which was allocated for FAO in 2014, when Jordan hosted the 21st session of the Near East Forestry and Range Commission (NEFRC). They took note of the state of the forest and reviewed plans to stop urban and agricultural encroachment on the site, planted with conifers, wild almonds, eucalyptus and acorns.
In coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture, Amman FAO office has developed plans to increase the number of trees in the forest and protect it against illegal logging, fire incidents and overgrazing.
The protection of forests and expanding them fall within FAO's second strategic goal “Make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable." Under this objective, FAO supports the government in shifting towards a "green national economy," in a country suffering from dwindling forestation, estimated at 88,000 hectares, less than 1% of its overall area.
In 2015, the organization provided technical support to the Ministry of Agriculture under its Technical Cooperation Project (TCP) with the aim of "supporting and developing Jordanian national forest policies." The support provided for developing a solid forestry policy through the inclusion of local committees as part of the cooperation between the public and private sectors.
In this context, FAO sponsored in 2018 the drawing of a policy paper on national forestry. The paper, prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, was designed to achieving sustainable integrated development through updating pertinent legal, administrative, and financial frameworks.
Forest protection is a pillar of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15: “Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss”.

Title: UN Jordan commemorates the UN Day and reaffirms commitment to support the people and Gov’t of Jordan
Content: 24 October 2019
The United Nations Country Team (UNCT), composed of 20 resident agencies, observed the 74th United Nations Day by reaffirming its commitment to multilateralism and global cooperation to support Jordan achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and respond to the protractedhumanitarian crisis, focused on leaving no one behind.
The commemoration of the Day included holding ten seminars on various development topics which are priority issues in Jordan that the UN is supporting the country to address.  These are in line with  the UN Sustainable Development Framework (UNSDF) which is the five-year strategic plan agreed between the Government and the UN in Jordan, and Jordan Vision 2025.
Speaking at the opening of the UN Day event, Anders Pedersen, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Jordan said: “As the world’s only truly universal global organization, the United Nations is the foremost forum to address global threats. The raison d’etre of the United Nations remains as relevant today as it was 74 years ago.”
“Global cooperation is critical for Jordan. The future of Jordan will impact not only Jordanians but indirectly all peoples in the region. The pursuit of Jordan’s sustainable development needed to maintain peace and stability has never been more important. Global challenges require global solutions and multilateral action,” Pedersen stressed.
Globally and in commemoration of the Day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres announced that next year’s commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations will feature a large and inclusive global conversation on the role of global cooperation in building the future we want. Starting in January 2020, the United Nations will hold dialogues around the world and across borders, sectors and generations. The aim is to is reach the global public; to listen to their hopes and fears; and to learn from their experiences. Global opinion polling and media analysis will be conducted in parallel to provide statistically representative data.
In a film released to launch the UN@75 initiative, the Secretary-General appealed to people everywhere to add their voices to this campaign: “We need your opinions, your strategies, your ideas for us to be able to deliver better for the people of the world that we must serve.”
Through the upcoming dialogues, UN@75 aims to build a global vision for the year 2045, the UN's centenary; to increase understanding of the threats to that future; and to drive collective action to realize that vision.  Information is available at www.un.org/UN75.
