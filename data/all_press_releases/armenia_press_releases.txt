Title: Global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives over the past 50 years

30 April 2024
30 April 2024 | Geneva / New York / Seattle – A major landmark study in be published by The Lancet reveals that global immunization efforts have saved an estimated 154 million lives – or the equivalent of 6 lives every minute of every year – over the past 50 years. The vast majority of lives saved – 101 million – were those of infants.
The study, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), shows that immunization is the single greatest contribution of any health intervention to ensuring babies not only see their first birthdays but continue leading healthy lives into adulthood.
Of the vaccines included in the study, the measles vaccination had the most significant impact on reducing infant mortality, accounting for 60% of the lives saved due to immunization. This vaccine will likely remain the top contributor to preventing deaths in the future.
Over the past 50 years, vaccination against 14 diseases (diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B, hepatitis B, Japanese encephalitis, measles, meningitis A, pertussis, invasive pneumococcal disease, polio, rotavirus, rubella, tetanus, tuberculosis, and yellow fever) has contributed to reducing infant deaths by 40% globally, and by more than 50% in the African Region.
"Vaccines are among the most powerful inventions in history, making once-feared diseases preventable,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Thanks to vaccines, smallpox has been eradicated, polio is on the brink, and with the more recent development of vaccines against diseases like malaria and cervical cancer, we are pushing back the frontiers of disease. With continued research, investment and collaboration, we can save millions more lives today and in the next 50 years.”
The study found that for each life saved through immunization, an average of 66 years of full health were gained – with a total of 10.2 billion full health years gained over the five decades. As the result of vaccination against polio more than 20 million people are able to walk today who would otherwise have been paralysed, and the world is on the verge of eradicating polio, once and for all.
Released ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) to take place in May 2024, the study is the most comprehensive analysis of the programme’s global and regional health impact over the past five decades.
Founded in 1974 by the World Health Assembly, EPI's original goal was to vaccinate all children against diphtheria, measles, pertussis, polio, tetanus, tuberculosis, as well as smallpox, the only human disease ever eradicated. Today, the programme, now referred to as the Essential Programme on Immunization, includes universal recommendations to vaccinate against 13 diseases, and context-specific recommendations for another 17 diseases, extending the reach of immunization beyond children, to adolescent and adults.
The study highlights that fewer than 5% of infants globally had access to routine immunization when EPI was launched. Today, 84% of infants are protected with 3 doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) – the global marker for immunization coverage.
Nearly 94 million of the estimated 154 million lives saved since 1974, were a result of protection by measles vaccines. Yet, there were still 33 million children who missed a measles vaccine dose in 2022: nearly 22 million missed their first dose and an additional 11 million missed their second dose.
Coverage of 95% or greater with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine is needed to protect communities from outbreaks. Currently, the global coverage rate of the first dose of measles vaccine is 83% and the second dose is 74%, contributing to a very high number of outbreaks across the world.
To increase immunization coverage, UNICEF, as one of the largest buyers of vaccines in the world, procures more than 2 billion doses every year on behalf of countries and partners for reaching almost half of the world’s children. It also works to distribute vaccines to the last mile, ensuring that even remote and underserved communities have access to immunization services.
“Thanks to vaccinations, more children now survive and thrive past their fifth birthday than at any other point in history,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “This massive achievement is a credit to the collective efforts of governments, partners, scientists, healthcare workers, civil society, volunteers and parents themselves, all pulling in the same direction of keeping children safe from deadly diseases. We must build on the momentum and ensure that every child, everywhere, has access to life-saving immunizations.”
Since the study only covers the health impact of vaccination against 14 diseases, the number of lives saved due to vaccination is a conservative estimate and not a full account of the life-saving impact of vaccines. Societal, economic or educational impacts to health and wellbeing over the 50 years have also contributed to further reductions in mortality. Today, there are vaccines to protect against more than 30 life-threatening diseases.
Global immunization programmes have shown what is humanly possible when many stakeholders, including heads of state, regional and global health agencies, scientists, charities, aid agencies, businesses, and communities work together.
Today, WHO, UNICEF, Gavi, and BMGF are calling on world leaders to advocate, support and fund vaccines and the immunization programmes that deliver these lifesaving products – reaffirming their commitment to public health, while celebrating one of humanity’s greatest achievements. The next 50 years of EPI will require not only reaching the children missing out on vaccines, but protecting grandparents from influenza, mothers from tetanus, adolescents from HPV and everyone from TB, and many other infectious diseases.

Title: Call from 100+ Pantheon of Global Leaders for Urgent Agreement on Governments to Reach Ambitious & Equitable International Deal to Prepare for and Prevent Future Pandemics
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
20 March 2024
A high-powered intervention by 23 former national Presidents, 22 former Prime Ministers, a former UN General Secretary and 3 Nobel Laureates is being made today to press for  an urgent agreement from international negotiators on a Pandemic Accord, under the Constitution of the World Health Organizaion, to bolster the world’s collective preparedness and response to future pandemics.
Former UN General Secretary Ban-ki Moon, New Zealand’s former Prime Minister Helen Cark, former UK Prime Ministers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, former Malawi President Joyce Banda, former Peru President Franciso Sagasti, and 3 former Presidents of the UN General Assembly are amongst 100+ global leaders, from all continents and fields of politics, economics and health management who today issued a joint open letter urging accelerated progress in current negotiations to reach the world’s first ever multi-lateral agreement on pandemic preparedness and prevention.
“A pandemic accord is critical to safeguard our collective future. Only a strong global pact on pandemics can protect future generations from a repeat of the COVID-19 crisis, which led to millions of deaths and caused widespread social and economic devastation, owing not least to insufficient international collaboration,” the leaders write in their joint letter.
In the throes of the Covid-19 disaster which, officially, claimed 7 million lives and wiped $2 trillion from the world economy, inter-governmental negotiations to reach international agreement on future pandemic non-proliferation were begun in December 2021 between 194 of the world’s 196 nations. Nations set themselves the deadline of May 2024 by which they should reach agreement on what would be the world’s first ever Pandemic Accord.
The ninth round of Pandemic Accord negotiations are underway this week and next. Signatories of today’s open letter hope their combined influence will encourage all 194 nations to maintain the courage of their Covid-years conviction and make their own collective ambition of an international pandemic protocol a reality by the intended May deadline  to enable ratification by the World Health Assembly at its May 2024 Annual General Assembly.
And they urge negotiators “to redouble their efforts” to meet the imminent deadline and not let their efforts be blown off course by malicious misinformation campaigning against the WHO, the international organisation which would be tasked with implementing the new health accord.
Taking a swipe at those who wrongly believe national sovereignty may be undermined by this major international step forward for public health the signatories say “there is no time to waste” and they call on the leaders of the 194 nations taking part in the current negotiations to “redouble their efforts to complete the accord by the May deadline.”
The letter, hosted on the website of The Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown states, “Countries are doing this not because of some dictum from the WHO – like the negotiations, participation in any instrument would be entirely voluntary – but because they need what the accord can and must offer. In fact, a pandemic accord would deliver vast and universally shared benefits, including greater capacity to detect new and dangerous pathogens, access to information about pathogens detected elsewhere in the world, and timely and equitable delivery of tests, treatments, vaccines, and other lifesaving tools.
“As countries enter what should be the final stages of the negotiations, governments must work to refute and debunk false claims about the accord. At the same time, negotiators must ensure that the agreement lives up to its promise to prevent and mitigate pandemic-related risks. This requires, for example, provisions aimed at ensuring that when another pandemic threat does arise, all relevant responses – from reporting the identification of risky pathogens to delivering tools like tests and vaccines on an equitable basis – are implemented quickly and effectively. As the COVID-19 pandemic showed, collaboration between the public and private sectors focused on advancing the public good is also essential.”
“A new pandemic threat will emerge; there is no excuse not to be ready for it. It is thus imperative to build an effective, multisectoral, and multilateral approach to pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. Given the unpredictable nature of public-health risks, a global strategy must embody a spirit of openness and inclusiveness. There is no time to waste, which is why we are calling on all national leaders to redouble their efforts to complete the accord by the May deadline.”
“Beyond protecting countless lives and livelihoods, the timely delivery of a global pandemic accord would send a powerful message: even in our fractured and fragmented world, international cooperation can still deliver global solutions to global problems.”

27 November 2023
With the generous support of the U.S. Government, WFP plans to reach approximately 20,500 people who have fled hostilities and are now living in the Ararat, Kotayk, and Gegharkunik regions. These regions host one of the highest numbers of refugees outside of Yerevan.
“We are grateful to the U.S. Government for the support during this emergency. This donation supports our efforts to ensure the well-being of thousands of refugees residing in Armenia, providing them daily access to food,” says WFP Representative and Country Director in Armenia Nanna Skau.
As part of the crisis response, WFP will provide food parcels to assist 20,000 refugees in covering their food needs over three months, contributing to improved livelihoods. Additionally, WFP will provide three hot meals each day for 500 refugees for three months totalling 135,000 hot meals. WFP will help distribute hot meals through mobile kitchens, school canteens, and arrangements for elderly residents.
“While providing urgent assistance for the upcoming winter, it's important to plan the next phase of support. This involves moving beyond immediate relief to strategies that stabilize lives and promote social cohesion,” added Saku.
In addition to immediate food assistance, WFP, with this contribution, will conduct a Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment to support evidence-based decision-making and its overall response planning. The comprehensive analysis will cover all regions, with a particular focus on areas where refugees have settled.
WFP is supporting the Government of Armenia through a range of initiatives, including emergency food assistance and cash-based transfers, nutritional support, and resilience-building.

Title: Climate change is an urgent threat to pregnant women and children
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
21 November 2023
Pregnant women, babies and children face extreme health risks from climate catastrophes that warrant urgent attention, according to a Call for Action released today by United Nations (UN) agencies ahead of the global Conference of the Parties (COP28) negotiations on climate change in Dubai.
According to the document– Protecting maternal, newborn and child health from the impacts of climate change – the effects of climate events on maternal and child health have been neglected, underreported and underestimated. It highlights that very few countries’ climate change response plans mention maternal or child health, describing this as “a glaring omission and emblematic of the inadequate attention to the needs of women, newborns, and children in the climate change discourse”.
“Climate change poses an existential threat to all of us, but pregnant women, babies and children face some of the gravest consequences of all,” said Bruce Aylward, Assistant Director General for Universal Health Coverage, Life Course at the World Health Organization (WHO). “Children’s futures need to be consciously protected, which means taking climate action now for the sake of their health and survival, while ensuring their unique needs are recognized in the climate response.”
The year 2023 has been marked by a series of devastating climate disasters. Wildfires, floods, heatwaves and droughts are displacing people, killing crops and livestock, and worsening air pollution. An over-heating world is increasing the spread of deadly diseases like cholera, malaria and dengue, with dire consequences for pregnant women and children for whom these infections can be especially severe.
Research shows that harm can begin even in the womb, leading to pregnancy-related complications, preterm birth, low birthweight and stillbirth. For children, consequences can last a lifetime, affecting the development of their bodies and brains as they grow.
“Action on climate change often ignores that children’s bodies and minds are uniquely vulnerable to pollution, deadly diseases and extreme weather,” said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Programmes, Omar Abdi. “We do this at our peril. The climate crisis is jeopardizing every child’s fundamental right to health and well-being. It is our collective responsibility to listen and put children at the centre of urgent climate action, beginning at COP28. This is the moment to finally put children on the climate change agenda.”
The Call to Action highlights seven urgent actions to address these mounting risks. These include sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and action on climate finance, alongside the specific inclusion of the needs of pregnant women, babies and children within climate and disaster-related policies. The agencies also call for more research to better understand the impacts of climate change on maternal and child health.
“To find climate solutions that acknowledge the distinct health needs and vulnerabilities of women and girls we must start by asking the right questions,” said Diene Keita, the Deputy Executive Director for Programmes at UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency. “Global climate solutions must support - not sacrifice - gender equality.”
The Call to Action was released by WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA at an online launch event, alongside an advocacy brief by the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH).
"Climate change is the biggest intergenerational injustice of our times. Safeguarding the health and rights of women, children, and adolescents is non-negotiable in the face of the climate crisis’’, said Rt Hon Helen Clark, PMNCH Board Chair and former Prime Minister of New Zealand. ‘’Every stakeholder, from governments to the private sector and health care professionals, holds a critical role in championing policies and actions that protect the most vulnerable. The urgency to integrate women, children and adolescent health needs into climate responses is not just a moral imperative, but an effective strategy with long term benefits for resilient and healthy societies’’.
During the COP28 meetings, delegates will mark the first ever Day of Health, noting the intractable linkages between the health of people and the planet.

Title: Majority of refugee children in Armenia enrolled in school one month after fleeing their homes

24 October 2023
GENEVA/YEREVAN, Armenia, 24 October 2023 – Two-thirds of refugee children in Armenia are enrolled in national school systems, one month after an escalation of hostilities led to more than 21,000 school-age children fleeing their homes. Efforts must now focus on increasing access for the remaining 1 in 3 children currently not attending school, UNICEF said today.
“Schools are more than places of learning. This is especially true in times of displacement, unrest and uncertainty. Access to education provides refugee children with the structure and support needed to help them overcome their experiences. Schools also provide children with nutrition and mental health services, socialisation and much more to support their health and well-being,” said Christine Weigand, UNICEF Armenia Representative.
“Investment must be made in increasing access to schooling for the 1 in 3 refugee children not enrolled in education and ensuring schools are inclusive for all children.”
Children who arrived in Armenia have not had continuous access to quality education in recent years, making an inclusive school system that provides catch-up classes and tailored support critical.
UNICEF is on the ground working with the Government of Armenia and other partners to help refugee children access the care and support they need. Together with the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport, UNICEF is undertaking an assessment to identify needs and gaps in the current education system. This includes identifying areas that need bolstering and expansion to support effective inclusion of all refugee children.
UNICEF is providing educational kits including schools-in-a-box and early childhood development kits. In addition, UNICEF and its partners are distributing a first batch of 1,000 schoolbags with stationary for children. Procurement of additional 2,000 schoolbags to address the additional emerging needs is ongoing. UNICEF is also gearing up to expand learning spaces in host schools and preschools across the country.
So far UNICEF has provided mental health and psychosocial support, and health and nutrition support for up to 10,000 refugee children and their caregivers. UNICEF and partners have also provided more than 1,000 children and caregivers with child protection case management support, and over 3,000 with psychological first aid.
UNICEF is appealing for US $ 12.6 million to provide critical services including education, health, child protection, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene in the first six months.

Title: World Food Programme responds to humanitarian crisis as thousands of people flee into Armenia

30 September 2023
YEREVAN – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is ramping up its efforts to assist people who have recently arrived at the Armenian border. As of Friday, the Armenian government confirmed that more than 100,000 individuals have sought refuge in Armenia since 23 September.
This number of people arriving at the border has surged dramatically in recent days, leading to extended queues at border crossings. Among them are elderly people and many children. Those arriving at the border are often in a state of exhaustion and need immediate emergency aid, including hot meals and other food assistance.
WFP has constructed facilities at Goris, near the border in the southeastern province of Syunik, to serve hot meals to people entering Armenia. More than 2,000 hot meals were distributed to people crossing the border on Thursday. WFP plans to scale up to provide 21,000 meals in the next two weeks.
WFP is also providing food parcels containing protein-rich food items, grains and cooking oil for 30,000 people. In addition, WFP is ready to provide food cards to support more than 6,000 individuals and, working with partners and donors, to scale up further according to needs.
"We are deeply concerned about the impact on the lives and livelihoods of civilians. As the situation evolves, it is important that affected people receive timely and continued humanitarian support," said Nanna Skau, WFP Representative and Country Director in Armenia.

Title: Children bearing brunt of stalled progress on extreme poverty reduction worldwide – UNICEF, World Bank
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
13 September 2023
An estimated 333 million children globally – or 1 in 6 – live in extreme poverty, according to new UNICEF-World Bank analysis released today.
Global Trends in Child Monetary Poverty According to International Poverty Lines – which for the first time looks at trends in extreme child poverty – finds that while the number of children living on less than US$2.15 a day decreased from 383 million to 333 million (or 13 per cent) between 2013 and 2022, the economic impact of COVID-19 led to three lost years of progress, or 30 million fewer children than projected in the absence of COVID-19-related disruptions.
The analysis – released ahead of High-level Week of the United Nations General Assembly (18 – 22 September), when global leaders will, among other things, meet to discuss the mid-point of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – warns that, at current rates of reduction, the SDG goal of ending extreme child poverty by 2030 will not be met.
“Seven years ago, the world made a promise to end extreme child poverty by 2030. We have made progress, showing that with the right investments and will, there is a way to lift millions of children out of what is often a vicious cycle of poverty,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “But compounding crises, from the impacts of COVID-19, conflict, climate change and economic shocks, have stalled progress, and left millions of children in extreme poverty. We cannot fail these children now. Ending child poverty is a policy choice. Efforts must be redoubled to ensure that all children have access to essential services, including education, nutrition, health care and social protection, while addressing the root causes of extreme poverty.”
According to the report, Sub-Saharan Africa carries the highest burden of children – 40 per cent – living in extreme poverty, and accounts for the largest share increase in the last decade, jumping from 54.8 per cent in 2013 to 71.1 per cent in 2022. Rapid population growth, limited social protection measures, and challenging global trends including COVID-19, conflict, and climate-related disasters, have resulted in the steep increase. Meanwhile, all other regions in the world have seen a steady decline in extreme poverty rates, with the exception of the Middle East and North Africa.

Globally, children comprise more than 50 per cent of the extreme poor, despite making up only a third of the global population. Children are more than twice as likely as adults – 15.8 per cent versus 6.6 per cent – to live in extremely poor households, lacking the food, sanitation, shelter, health care, and education they need to survive and thrive.
The most vulnerable children – such as those living in rural settings and children living in households where the head has little or no education – are significantly more affected by extreme poverty. According to the report, an estimated 1 in 3 children in countries affected by conflict and fragility live in extremely poor households, compared to 1 in 10 in non-fragile states.
To end extreme poverty and offset the pandemic backslide, UNICEF and the World Bank are calling on governments and partners to:
Situation in Armenia
In Armenia, 1,510 children live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than US$2.15 a day and 52,730 children live in moderate poverty, living on US$3.65 a day.

Title: UN Committee on the Rights of the Child calls on states to take action in first guidance on children's rights and the environment
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
28 August 2023
For the first time, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has explicitly affirmed the children’s right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, issuing comprehensive interpretation of Member States’ obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
This Convention, created in 1989 and ratified by 196 states, outlines universal children’s rights such as the right to life, survival and development, and the right to health. A General Comment provides legal guidance on what these rights imply for a specific topic or area of legislation. The now published “General Comment No. 26 on children’s rights and the environment with a special focus on climate change”, explicitly addresses the climate emergency, the collapse of biodiversity and pervasive pollution, outlining countermeasures to protect the lives and life perspectives of children. Philip Jaffé, member of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child states:
“Children worldwide have been leading the fight against climate change; calling on their governments and corporations to take action to protect the planet and their future. With its General Comment No. 26, the Committee on the Rights of the Child not only echoes and amplifies children’s voices, but also clearly defines the rights of children in relation to the environment that States Parties should respect, protect and fulfil… collectively and urgently!”
“This new General Comment marks a vital step forward in the recognition that every child on Earth has the right to live in a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. Governments must now take urgent action to address the global environmental crisis in order to breathe life into these inspiring words,” says David Boyd, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment.
General Comment No. 26 specifies that States are responsible not only for protecting children’s rights from immediate harm, but also for foreseeable violations of their rights in the future due to States’ acts — or failure to act — today. Furthermore, it underlines that States can be held accountable not only for environmental harm occurring within their borders, but also for the harmful impacts of environmental damage and climate change beyond their borders. Particular attention is to be paid to disproportionate harm faced by children in disadvantaged situations.
The 196 States that have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child are urged to take immediate action including organizing the phase out of coal, oil and natural gas and shifting to renewable energy sources, improving air quality and ensuring access to clean water, transforming industrial agriculture and fisheries to produce healthy and sustainable food, and protecting biodiversity.
Terre des Hommes — the Committee’s official partner for the development of General Comment No. 26 — led a process with multi-level stakeholders, significantly involving and engaging children through online consultations to inform the shape and substance of the text. The international child rights organization coordinated a global Advisory Board of experts and a team of 12 child advisors aged 11 – 17 to support the Committee. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), as a member of the Advisory Board, provided further technical expertise and helped collect views from children around the world as part of the consultation process.
One of the child advisors, Āniva, a 17-year-old climate and child rights activist from the Pacific Islands, comments:
“To me, the General Comment means worldwide change that is necessary as we move forward in fighting environmental issues and take global action in protecting our planet for our generation and the generations to come. It gives children a stronger basis in international law to enforce our Rights to a Healthy Environment. Globally, we are seeing more action for people to protect the environment through Human Rights and GC26 forms an important part of this.”
General Comment No. 26 assists in interpreting States’ commitment under the Paris Agreement to respect, promote and consider their child rights obligations when taking action to address climate change. It also makes it clear that child rights impact assessments must be undertaken for all environment-related legislation, policies and projects, regulations, budget or other decisions. States will have to report periodically to the UN Committee on relevant progress they have made in protecting children’s environmental rights.
“Climate financing and policy decisions continue to neglect the needs of children,” said Paloma Escudero, UNICEF Special Adviser on Advocacy for Child Rights and Climate Action. “This must change. The General Comment is an urgent call for countries to prioritize action in every aspect of childhood impacted by climate change, such as a child’s right to education, to safe water and a healthy environment. The climate crisis is a child rights crisis. Every government has an obligation to protect the rights of every child in every corner of the planet, especially those boys and girls living in countries that have contributed least to this problem but are enduring the most dangerous floods, droughts, storms and heat.”
General Comment No. 26 can be accessed here: https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/general-comments-and-recommendations…
Child-friendly versions of General Comment No. 26 will be published on 18 September 2023 as part of the official launch of the General Comment during the Committee’s forthcoming session in Geneva, Switzerland.

Title: A new preschool service opens in the border village of Dovegh with the support of UNICEF and the European Union
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
22 July 2023
In coordination with the RA Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports (MoESCS), and the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure, Tavush regional authorities and other partners, and with the financial support of the European Union, UNICEF opened a new preschool center in Dovegh settlement of Noyemberian consolidated community. Located near the border between Armenian and Azerbaijan, Dovegh is home to 502 residents and 145 children, where 3-5-year-olds have never had a preschool to go to.
“The early years of life are critical for child’s development. When children benefit from early learning, as an immediate result, it boosts their social, emotional, and cognitive skills, boosting their readiness for school and reducing the gap between socially advantaged and disadvantaged children. It also has long-term benefits for the society, enabling children to reach their full developmental potential later as adults and to participate effectively in social, civic and economic life of their communities. The most important skills in life we first learn at preschool,” noted Mrs Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Armenia.
Starting today, 18 young children will benefit from early learning services in Dovegh, and more will enroll by the end of the year. Located on the second floor of the community administrative building, the preschool service has a fully renovated and furnished entrance hall, two playrooms and two separate WASH facilities for children and adults, and a kitchenette. The center has a solar photovoltaic system, a broad range of didactic materials and toys, as well as a first aid kit. Together with Step by Step Benevolent Foundation, UNICEF has also provided three women in the community with pre-service training. The preschool also has a newly built small outdoor playground near the building.
“Early childhood education is a pre-requisite for ensuring that all children can exercise their right to learn and to develop. The roots of learning poverty and why nowadays children struggle in foundational learning skills start in the lack of early learning services to make children ready for school. This is also why we need to invest in early childhood educators, quality standards, training and development, their working conditions and career progression,” said Mrs. Ashkhen Gyurjyan, Step by Step Benevolent Foundation.
Together with partners, in the past three years UNICEF has set up 17 preschool services in Lori, Tavush, Syunik, Shirak and Gegharkunik regions, in line with the alternative model developed previously by Ministry of Education and UNICEF specifically for rural areas. By the end of 2023 works for establishment of 8 more alternative preschool services will be completed ensuring that children in remote rural areas are also given a fair start in education. The model has proven not only cost-effective but also sustainable, as communities commit to covering related salary and operational costs, while the preschool educators continue to receive professional development support from the lead kindergarten of the consolidated community. This model also contributes to Armenia’s objective of increasing the coverage of early learning services across the country.

Title: Teachers and students implement project-based learning on environmental issues in six regions of Armenia
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
30 June 2023
The aim of the initiative, implemented with the support of the Austrian Development Agency and in coordination with the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports, was to equip teachers of 7-11 grades with essential knowledge on project-based learning and on climate change issues to develop solutions to environmental issues faced by communities across Tavush, Syunik, Gegharkunik, Lori, Shirak and Vayots Dzor.
“Becoming more and more aware of the environmental issues and climate change is extremely important. Climate change may still feel like a distant problem, but it is very real and already tangible in many ways. No one is more affected by a changing climate and its implications than children and adolescents, which is why it’s crucial to engage with them to drive climate action. UNICEF commends the important decision of the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport to include green education in the State Education Development Programme until 2030 and to include climate change and green skills as a cross-cutting theme in the state education curriculum,” noted Silvia Mestroni, Deputy Representative of UNICEF in Armenia.
Over the course of five months, a total of 376 teachers from 272 settlements across the six regions actively participated in series of online and offline trainings to gain a thorough understanding of the content and structure of project-based learning methods. Under the guidance of experienced mentors, they successfully applied their acquired knowledge, engaging 2015 students to implement 275 environmental projects.
“At the Ayb Educational Foundation, we continuously plan, localize and implement leading learning approaches of the world with a strong faith in our mission of spreading high-quality education in our country. Ayb has exceptional experience in project-based learning. It was effectively applied at Ayb School since 2015 and was one of the key components of the Ayb Hybrid Learning program. I highly believe that the knowledge investment in teachers will help them in forming new ways of thinking, mastering new methodologies, and leading them to systematic changes. Now, I’m more than sure that the skills and experience gained will help them in September with new educational standards,” stated Sona Koshetsyan, the executive director of the Ayb Educational Foundation.
During the closing ceremony, both teachers and students showcased their completed works, sharing insights on the knowledge they have gained throughout the programme. The projects focused on a wide range of environmental issues, including waste collection and recycling, prevention of deforestation, tree planting, as well as raising awareness on the harmful effects of mining emissions, the consequences of deforestation, and other environmental issues.
“The issue of deforestation is a priority for our village, as this year it has reached to an alarming scale, causing tangible negative impact on the environment. We worked with students to establish a park near our school,” shared Tigran Hovsepyan, teacher from Darbas village, Syunik. In Nahapetavan village, Shirak, teachers also worked with students to plant 100 trees near their school.
“Our objective in Yeghegnadzor was to decrease the level of air pollution, usually caused by burning garbage. We brainstormed several approaches to efficient waste collection and recycling. Collaborating with 15 dedicated students, we completed research, raised awareness of the community, offering practical alternatives. We held a number of information sharing sessions, showcasing alternative ways to utilize waste instead of burning it. We repurposed paper waste to craft garbage cans that are now widely utilized in the school. This project not only prompted us to view things through an environmental lens, but also embrace our responsibility for the world we live in,” shared the group of students from Yeghegnadzor school.

Title: Partners unite for a child-friendly justice approach for child victims and witnesses of violence
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
07 June 2023
YEREVAN – UNICEF and partners announced about the launch of the first child-friendly safe space in Yerevan that will provide multidisciplinary and multi-agency protection for child victims of violence from secondary victimization and child-friendly justice approaches, where children could be interviewed and examined for forensic purposes, comprehensively assessed and receive crisis intervention services from appropriate professionals. Simply said, it was established to serve the best interests of child victims and to ensure due process of law.
This new child-friendly safe space is modeled following and adapting the international Barnahus approach to child friendly justice that unites under one roof law enforcement, criminal justice, child protection services and medical and mental health workers to cooperate and assess together the situation of the child. The Barnahus approach has shown to avoid secondary victimization of victims and increase the effectiveness of the justice process, by creating child-friendly environment for investigative actions, limiting number of interviews carried out by many agencies in different locations, excluding contact between victim and alleged offender at all times, taking measures to protect the privacy, identity and image of child victims and helping them to rebuild.
This new model of work was launched by UNICEF in partnership with the Fund for Armenian Relief Child Protection Center with the financial support of the European Union. It was made possible with strong commitment and leadership from the Investigative Committee, Ministries of Labor and Social Affairs, Justice, and Health, as well as the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Armenia.
The “Safe corner” in Yerevan includes a room that has a child-friendly atmosphere with age-appropriate toys, reading and activities, designed to make children feel comfortable before and during the interviews. In order to spare the child from having to tell his or her story on several occasions and to several individuals, the forensic interview conducted by investigators and certified psychologists can be observed from a different room by justice professionals and videotaped to be possibly used in court. Once in the room, children will soon be able to undergo also medical examination. The multidisciplinary team of specialists, including the psychologist, a social worker and a doctor will provide crisis intervention and also determine the need for short or long term therapeutic and other support services.
In the past years, UNICEF supported amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code for children to be interviewed only with the support of certified forensic interviewer psychologists and development of secondary legislation. In addition, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Justice in the development of training modules and subsequent training and certification of 53 psychologists.
UNICEF works with partners to also establish a Barnahus-like safe space in the premises of Child and Family Support Centre / Crisis Centre in Kapan, Syunik marz, this June, hoping that in due time this approach will become a full integral part of the national justice and child protection systems, making sure that all children who are victims of violence, regardless the form of violence, have equal access to child-friendly justice and are provided with a multi-disciplinary response that helps them rebuild their life.

Title: Malnutrition in mothers soars by 25 per cent in crisis-hit countries, putting women and newborn babies at risk – UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
07 March 2023
The number of pregnant and breastfeeding adolescent girls and women suffering from acute malnutrition has soared from 5.5 million to 6.9 million – or 25 per cent – since 2020 in 12 countries hardest hit by the global food and nutrition crisis, according to a new report released by UNICEF today.
The 12 countries – including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen – represent the epicentre of a global nutrition crisis that has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and ongoing drought, conflict, and instability in some countries.
Undernourished and Overlooked: A Global Nutrition Crisis in Adolescent Girls and Women – issued ahead of International Women’s Day – warns that the ongoing crises, aggravated by ongoing gender inequality, are deepening a nutrition crisis among adolescent girls and women that had already shown little improvement in the last two decades.
According to the report – an unprecedented and comprehensive look at the state of adolescent girls’ and women’s nutrition globally – more than one billion adolescent girls and women suffer from undernutrition (including underweight and short height), deficiencies in essential micronutrients, and anaemia, with devastating consequences for their lives and wellbeing.
Inadequate nutrition during girls’ and women’s lives can lead to weakened immunity, poor cognitive development, and an increased risk of life-threatening complications – including during pregnancy and childbirth – with dangerous and irreversible consequences for their children’s survival, growth, learning, and future earning capacity.
Globally, 51 million children under 2 years suffer stunting, meaning they are too short for their age due to malnutrition. Of those, about half become stunted during pregnancy and the first six months of life, the 500-day period when a child is fully dependent on maternal nutrition, according to a new analysis in the report.
Global crises continue to disproportionately disrupt women’s access to nutritious food. In 2021, there were 126 million more food insecure women than men, compared to 49 million more in 2019, more than doubling the gender gap of food insecurity.
The report calls for governments, development and humanitarian partners and donors, civil society organizations and development actors to transform food, health and social protection systems for adolescent girls and women by:
“When a girl or woman does not get adequate nutrition, gender inequality is perpetuated,” said Russell. “Learning and earning potential is lowered. The risk of life-threatening complications, including during pregnancy and childbirth increases, and the odds of giving birth to undernourished babies rise. We know what it takes to get life-saving nutrition support and services to the women and children who need it most. We just need to mobilize the political will and resources to act. There is no time to waste.”

Title: Number of children without critical social protection increasing globally – ILO and UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
02 March 2023
The number of children without access to social protection is increasing year-on-year, leaving them at risk of poverty, hunger and discrimination, according to a new report released by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF today.
More than a billion reasons: The urgent need to build universal social protection for children warns that an additional 50 million children aged 0-15 missed out on a critical social protection provision – specifically, child benefits (paid in cash or tax credits) – between 2016 and 2020, driving up the total to 1.46 billion children under 15 globally.
“Ultimately, strengthened efforts to ensure adequate investment in universal social protection for children, ideally through universal child benefits to support families at all times, is the ethical and rational choice, and the one that paves the way to sustainable development and social justice,” said Shahra Razavi, Director of the Social Protection Department at the ILO.
According to the report, child and family benefit coverage rates fell or stagnated in every region in the world between 2016 and 2020, leaving no country on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of achieving substantial social protection coverage by 2030.
Failure to provide children with adequate social protection leaves them vulnerable to poverty, disease, missed education, and poor nutrition, and increases their risk of child marriage and child labour.
Globally, children are twice as likely as adults to live in extreme poverty – those struggling to survive on less than US$1.90 (PPP*) a day – approximately 356 million children. A billion children also live in multidimensional poverty – meaning without access to education, health, housing, nutrition, sanitation, or water. Children living in multidimensional poverty increased by 15 per cent during the COVID-19 pandemic, reversing previous progress in reducing child poverty and highlighting the urgent need for social protection.
Moreover, the pandemic highlighted that social protection is a critical response in times of crisis. Nearly every government in the world either rapidly adapted existing schemes or introduced new social protection programmes to support children and families, but most fell short of making permanent reforms to protect against future shocks, according to the report.
“As families face increasing economic hardship, food insecurity, conflict, and climate-related disasters, universal child benefits can be a lifeline,” said Natalia Winder-Rossi, UNICEF Director of Social Policy and Social Protection. “There is an urgent need to strengthen, expand and invest in child-friendly and shock-responsive social protection systems. This is essential to protect children from living in poverty and increase resilience particularly among the poorest households.”
The report emphasizes that all countries, irrespective of their level of development, have a choice: whether to pursue a “high-road” strategy of investment in reinforcing social protection systems, or a “low-road” strategy that misses out on necessary investments and will leave millions of children behind.
To reverse the negative trend, the ILO and UNICEF urge policymakers to take decisive steps to attain universal social protection for all children, including:

Title: War in Ukraine pushes generation of children to the brink, warns UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
21 February 2023
“Children in Ukraine have experienced a year of horror,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Millions of children are going to sleep cold and scared and waking up hoping for an end to this brutal war. Children have been killed and injured, and many have lost parents and siblings, their homes, schools and playgrounds. No child should ever have to bear that kind of suffering.”
An economic crisis, with a vast number of families reporting a significant loss of income, along with an energy crisis triggered by the war have been devastating to the well-being of children and families. A recent UNICEF survey saw 80 per cent of respondents noting a deterioration of their economic situation, while UNICEF analysis suggests the percentage of children living in poverty has almost doubled from 43 per cent to 82 per cent. The situation is especially acute for the 5.9 million people who are currently displaced within Ukraine.
The war is also having a devasting impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children. An estimated 1.5 million children are at risk of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues, with potential long-term effects and implications.
Children and families’ access to basic services have been devastated. More than 1,000 health facilities are reported to have been damaged or destroyed by shelling and airstrikes, with such attacks killing and causing serious injuries to patients – including children – as well as to medical personnel, and restricting access to care. Thousands of children fleeing conflict across the country are missing vital vaccines to protect them from polio, measles, diphtheria and other life-threatening diseases.
Since February 24 2022, UNICEF, thanks to the support of the international community, has provided learning supplies to 770,000 children, engaged 1.4 million children in formal and non-formal education, provided mental health and psychosocial support to 2.9 million children and caregivers, provided gender-based violence response services to 352,000 women and children, provided access to safe water for 4.6 million people, provided healthcare services to 4.9 million people, and provided multi-purpose cash assistance to 1.4 million people inside Ukraine and 47,494 households in neighbouring countries.
“Children need an end to this war and sustained peace to regain their childhoods, return to normalcy and begin to heal and recover,” said Russell. “Until that happens, it is absolutely critical that children’s mental health and psychosocial needs are prioritized. This should include age-appropriate actions to provide nurturing care, build resilience, and especially for older children and adolescents, give them opportunities to voice their concerns.”
Further compounding this issue, the war has disrupted education for more than five million children, denying children sense of structure, safety, normality and hope the classroom provides.  Limited access to schools come after two years of lost learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and more than 8 years of education disruption for children living in eastern Ukraine.
UNICEF continues to call for principled, safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access, an end to attacks on children and the infrastructure they rely on, including schools, hospitals and water and sanitation systems; the avoidance of use of schools in this conflict; and to stop the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, directly responsible for killing and maiming hundreds of children. Above all, UNICEF continues to advocate for an end to hostilities.
In December 2022, UNICEF launched its annual Humanitarian Action for Children Appeal. UNICEF requires US$1.1 billion to address the immediate and longer-term needs of 9.4 million people, including 4 million children, both inside and outside Ukraine  who remain deeply impacted by the war in Ukraine. Funding will enable UNICEF to provide, sustain and expand critical services in health, nutrition, child protection, gender-based violence, water and sanitation, and social protection alongside government relief and recovery efforts. It will ensure timely preparedness for additional internal displacements and refugee movements.

Title: Global food prices decline further in January
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
03 February 2023
Rome – The benchmark index of international food commodity prices declined in January for the tenth consecutive month, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reported Friday.

The FAO Food Price Index averaged 131.2 points in January, 0.8 percent lower than the previous month and 17.9 percent below its peak reached in March 2022. The index tracks monthly changes in the international prices of commonly-traded food commodities. The price indices for vegetable oils, dairy and sugar drove the January decline, while those for cereals and meat remained largely stable.

In January, the FAO Cereal Price Index was essentially unchanged (up a mere 0.1 percent) from December and stood 4.8 percent above its level of one year earlier. International wheat prices declined by 2.5 percent as production in Australia and the Russian Federation outpaced expectations. World maize prices rose marginally due to strong demand for exports from Brazil and concerns over dry conditions in Argentina. International rice prices, however, jumped by 6.2 percent from December, influenced by tighter availabilities, strong local demand in some Asian exporting countries and exchange rate movements.

The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index declined by 2.9 percent in January. World prices of palm and soy oils dropped amid subdued global import demand, while those of sunflowerseed and rapeseed oils declined due to ample export availabilities.

The FAO Dairy Price Index averaged 1.4 percent lower than in December, with prices trending down for butter and milk powders on lighter demand from leading importers and increased supplies from New Zealand. World cheese prices rose slightly, driven by a recovery in food services and retail sales in Western Europe following the New Year holiday, as well as currency movements.

The FAO Meat Price Index moved fractionally in January (edging down just 0.1 percent from December), as ample export availabilities weighed on poultry, pig and bovine meat prices , while ovine export prices rose due to stronger import demand.

The FAO Sugar Price Index dropped by 1.1 percent from December. Strong harvest progress in Thailand and favourable weather conditions in Brazil outweighed the impact on prices due to concerns over lower crop yields in India, higher gasoline prices in Brazil, which support demand for ethanol, as well as the Brazilian real’s appreciation against the United States dollar.

Cereal supply still seen tightening in 2022/23

In its new Cereal Supply and Demand Brief, also released Friday, FAO raised its forecast for world cereal production in 2022; however, global cereal supplies are still forecast to tighten in 2022/23.

Global cereal output in 2022 is now forecast at 2 765 million tonnes, or 1.7 percent below the 2021 outturn. Upward revisions for Australia and the Russian Federation now point to a record global output for wheat in 2022, while total coarse grains production is expected to decline by 3.3 percent from the previous year. The forecast for world rice production was revised downward as lower-than-expected output in China more than offset upward revisions for Bangladesh and several other countries. As a result, global rice output is now predicted to decline by 2.6 percent from its all-time high in 2021. 

Looking ahead to 2023, early indications point to likely area expansions for winter wheat cropping in the northern hemisphere, especially in the United States of America, driven mostly by elevated wheat prices. However, high fertilizer costs may affect application rates with adverse implications for yields.

Low domestic prices could result in a small cutback in wheat plantings in the Russian Federation, the world’s largest exporter, while severe war-induced impacts in Ukraine are estimated to reduce winter wheat area plantings by 40 percent. Record plantings are forecast in India, spurred by high market and support prices, and relatively high plantings are projected in Pakistan as standing water from the 2022 floods is causing less hindrance than initially anticipated.

In the southern hemisphere countries, most of the 2023 coarse grain crops have been sown. Brazil may post record maize plantings, while those in Argentina could decrease due to low soil moisture levels. Weather conditions augur well for maize yield prospects in South Africa.

World cereal utilization in 2022/23 is now forecast to drop by 0.7 percent from the previous year, to amount to 2 779 million tonnes, with the total utilization of maize predicted to decline, while wheat use increases and rice utilization changes little year-on-year.

The forecast for world cereal stocks is pegged at 844 million tonnes at the end of the marketing year, pushing down the world stock-to-use ratio for 2022/2 to 29.5 percent.

In its new brief, FAO predicts international trade in cereals in 2022/23 to decline by 1.7 percent from the previous year’s record level to 474 million tonnes.

Title: WFP welcomes USAID contribution to strengthen social protection systems in Armenia
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
21 December 2022
With a generous contribution of US$750,000 from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) will support the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs to strengthen the shock responsiveness of the social protection system in Armenia.
In recent years, Armenia faced multiple shocks that revealed an acute need to enhance the adaptability and response mechanisms of the social protection system to meet the needs of vulnerable populations during and after crises.
In partnership with USAID, WFP launched the “Integrated Response to Increased Food Prices in Armenia” project that aims to improve and strengthen shock-responsive policies and promote social assistance tools for food-insecure populations over the next 15 months.
“USAID is proud to work with the World Food Programme to support the government of Armenia in its efforts to respond to the needs of citizens, especially vulnerable populations, in the face of unforeseen challenges. We are pleased that at least 3,000 people will directly benefit from this program,” said USAID/Armenia Mission Director John Allelo.
Also, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the WFP will develop and enforce shock-responsive social protection policy protocols, procedures, and resources. WFP will further operationalize food cards as cash-based transfer tools for meeting rapid food needs caused by shocks and crises to three thousand food-insecure persons in three regions.
“We have experienced shock after shock in Armenia, and we aim to support the Armenian Government to have social systems in place that can adapt and provide the right assistance at the right time to people in need. “WFP welcomes USAID’s generous support to facilitate that the government of Armenia have all the necessary social protection tools and mechanisms and help people during and in the aftermath of shocks,” said Nanna Skau, WFP Deputy Director and Officer in Charge.
WFP values the crucial role of improving the shock-responsive social protection system in Armenia, considering that the country is prone to various types of shocks. By enhancing social protection systems WFP can reach more people who are at risk, and therefore a multi-stakeholder approach is required to address the consequences of the shocks and ensure a timely and effective response to hundreds of people across Armenia.

18 November 2022
The Armenian community of Argentina and UNICEF unite again for the benefit of Armenia’s children, this time launching a multi-sector two-year programme targeting early learning, general education, child protection and youth services in Armenia. With the support of the All-Armenia ‘Hayastan’ Fund in Argentina, from 2022 to 2024, works are already underway to refurbish the family and child support center in Vanadzor (Lori marz), establish two youth houses in Verishen (Syunik marz) and Artik (Shirak), provide school furniture and learning materials for 15 classrooms in three schools in Syunik, as well as renovate and refurbish Goris kindergarten #5.
"Thanks to the support of the Argentine community, these important projects are being executed jointly with UNICEF Armenia. Hayastan All Armenian Fund of Argentina is part of a global organization working since 1992 on the implementation projects with social impact in various areas, for the development and assistance of Armenians. We are particularly happy to know we can work jointly with UNICEF to support children in Armenia in the region of Syunik and displaced families that have suffered from Nagorno Karabagh conflict,” noted Mr Alex Kalpakian, President of Hayastan All Armenian Fund in Argentina.
“We are grateful to the Armenian community of Argentina for their generous support. Through this programme, UNICEF will be able to help improve the situation of hundreds of children and adolescents from Lori to Syunik and provide them with necessary services and conditions for their learning and development,” noted Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Armenia.
Under the supervision of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, the child and family support center will provide multidisciplinary services to children in difficult life circumstances, such as rehabilitation, case management, prevention of family separation, mental health and psychosocial services. UNICEF will also provide on-the-job training for the specialists of the center.
“This type of partnerships are truly important for us, as the improvement of conditions in child care institutions leaves a great impact on the quality of services, their regularity and effectiveness. The deinstitutionalisation of child-care institutions and investment in child-care services at marz level is a key priority for the Ministry. This process also greatly contributes to prevention of child abandonment and the need for night-care services,” said Mrs Tatevik Stepanyan, Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Affairs.
Through the newly established youth houses, about 300 adolescents and young people in Artik and Verishen, including those with disabilities, will be able to get non-formal education, acquire 21st century skills, such as problem solving, communication, leadership, IT skills, work on community projects, practice healthy lifestyle. Together with partners, UNICEF will train the future staff of these centers and provide them with necessary materials and equipment.
Schools #2 and #6 in Goris and Verishen school will be provided with new furniture and materials so that new classrooms can be opened and for students to learn in developmentally appropriate environment. Teachers in Syunik schools will also be supported to organize remedial classes for students to catch up on what they had missed academically due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. At Goris kindergarten #5, UNICEF is already in the process of renovation, ensuring safety standards and universal design for enhancing accessibility of the building for children with disabilities. The kindergarten will be provided with new furniture, didactic materials, toys and books, while staff will be trained on preschool education standards, including on safety and resilience, and psychological first aid in emergency situations.

Title: Racism and discrimination against children rife in countries worldwide – UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
18 November 2022
Racism and discrimination against children based on their ethnicity, language, and religion are rife in countries across the world, according to a new UNICEF report published ahead of World Children’s Day.
Rights denied: The impact of discrimination on children shows the extent to which racism and discrimination impact children’s education, health, access to a registered birth, and to a fair and equal justice system, and highlights widespread disparities among minority and ethnic groups.
“Systemic racism and discrimination put children at risk of deprivation and exclusion that can last a lifetime,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “This hurts us all. Protecting the rights of every child – whoever they are, wherever they come from – is the surest way to build a more peaceful, prosperous, and just world for everyone.”
Among the new findings, the report shows that children from marginalized ethnic, language, and religious groups in an analysis of 22 countries lag far behind their peers in reading skills. On average, students aged 7-14 from the most advantaged group are more than twice as likely to have foundational reading skills than those from the least advantaged group.
An analysis of data on the rate of children registered at birth – a prerequisite for access to basic rights – found significant disparities among children of different religious and ethnic groups. For example, in Lao PDR, 59 per cent of children under 5 in the minority Mon-Khmer ethnic group have their births registered, compared to 80 per cent among the Lao-Tai ethnic group.
Discrimination and exclusion deepen intergenerational deprivation and poverty, and result in poorer health, nutrition, and learning outcomes for children, higher likelihood of incarceration, higher rates of pregnancy among adolescent girls, and lower employment rates and earnings in adulthood.
While COVID-19 exposed deep injustices and discrimination across the world, and the impacts of climate change and conflict continue to reveal inequities in many countries, the report highlights how discrimination and exclusion have long persisted for millions of children from ethnic and minority groups, including access to immunization, water and sanitation services, and a fair justice system.
For example, in disciplinary policies in the United States, Black children are almost four times more likely to receive out-of-school suspensions than white children, and more than twice as likely to face school-related arrests, the report notes.
The report also highlights how children and young people are feeling the burden of discrimination in their everyday lives. A new U-Report poll generating more than 407,000 responses found that almost two thirds feel discrimination is common in their environments, while almost half feel discrimination had impacted their lives or that of someone they know in a significant manner.
“On World Children’s Day and every day, every child has the right to be included, to be protected, and to have an equal chance to reach their full potential,” said Russell. “All of us have the power to fight discrimination against children – in our countries, our communities, our schools, our homes, and our own hearts.

Title: UNICEF and Parenting School NGO launch Armenia’s first online positive parenting course
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
10 November 2022
UNICEF and Parenting School NGO launched Armenia’s first free online positive parenting course today, developed in 2022 with the funding of the United States Government and in cooperation with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The course will enroll about 10.000 parents from across Armenia until end of the year.
“Parents and caregivers are the chief architects of the next generation. Like no one else, they shape the experiences that build their children’s brains and set them on a path towards healthy development and adolescence. At the same time, parenting is too big a job for parents and caregivers to do alone. Through this course and other programmes, UNICEF strives to be a trusted partners for parents and caregivers in Armenia and support them in their most precious task of all – raising their children,” said Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Armenia.
“Parenting is one of the best roles you can take on in life. As a parent, you cannot completely disregard a myriad of new worries, stresses and concerns that this role brings, so it’s important to balance your parenting experience via this course and other tools. Today, parents of adolescents are faced with new issues related to technological developments, consumption of fast food, as well as trying to manage diverging views, allowing your child to grow independent, while at the same time continuing to nurture your emotional connection with them,” shared Mrs Tatevik Stepanyan, Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Affairs.
Through this course, partners aim to raise the awareness of parents and caregivers about conscious parenting and its various aspects, while also building their capacity in positive parenting, building trust with children, ensuring a conducive environment for children’s healthy development and wellbeing, while trying to minimize or avoid negative psychological and emotional pressures on children.
“While parents place importance in conscious and positive approaches to parenting on daily basis, they don’t always have access to experienced psychologists and parenting experts that can help guide and support them with additional information and reassurance, as well as practical tips that they can use in their relationships with their children. Our new platform is accessible, easy to use and provides parents with videos and other user-friendly materials, unpacking all positive and negative consequences of each behavior. Our objective with this course is to support parents to enjoy parenthood, feel happy and fulfilled as parents and raise happy children,” shared Anna Velitsyan, Founding Director of Parenting School NGO.
The course was developed by three expert psychologists from Parenting School NGO – Lusine Aghabekyan, Armine Vardanyan, and Tatevik Abrahamyan, and is available online at: aybuben.parenting.am microsite.
Coursework includes six different topics, including effective communication with children, positive disciplining, how to motivate children, how to spend quality time or deal with age-related transitional issues that may arise. Each topic is presented through defined learning objectives and expected outcomes, a number of resources from videos to practical exercises. Once everything is completed, participants will also be provided with a topic-based summary sheet as a material for a quick refresh in the future.
UNICEF will continue providing necessary support to caregivers through evidence-based articles on parenting and much more on www.Babycef.am, established with the support of the Ministry of Health.

Title: 559 million children currently exposed to high heatwave frequency, rising to all 2.02 billion children globally by 2050
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
01 November 2022
LONDON/NEW YORK, 25 October, 2022 – 559 million children are currently exposed to high heatwave frequency*, according to new research from UNICEF. Further, 624 million children are exposed to one of three other high heat measures - high heatwave duration, high heatwave severity or extreme high temperatures.
During a year in which heatwaves in both the southern and northern hemispheres broke records, The Coldest Year Of The Rest Of Their Lives: Protecting Children From The Escalating Impacts Of Heatwaves highlights the already extensive impact of heatwaves on children and reveals that, even at lower levels of global heating, in just three decades, more regular heatwaves are unavoidable for children everywhere.
The report estimates that by 2050, all of the world’s 2.02 billion children are expected to be exposed to high heatwave frequency, regardless of whether the world achieves a ‘low greenhouse gas emission scenario’ with an estimated 1.7 degrees of warming in 2050 or a ‘very high greenhouse gas emission scenario’ with an estimated 2.4 degrees of warming in 2050.
Produced in collaboration with The Data Collaborative for Children and launched in partnership with UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Vanessa Nakate and Africa-based Rise Up Movement, these findings underscore the urgent need to adapt the services children rely on as unavoidable impacts of global heating unfold. It also makes a case for continued mitigation, to prevent the worst impacts of the other high heat measures, including longer and hotter heatwaves and higher extreme temperatures.
“The mercury is rising and so are the impacts on children,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said. “Already, 1 in 3 children live in countries that face extreme high temperatures and almost 1 in 4 children are exposed to high heatwave frequency, and it is only going to get worse. More children will be impacted by longer, hotter and more frequent heatwaves over the next thirty years, threatening their health and wellbeing. How devastating these changes will be depends on the actions we take now. At a minimum, governments must urgently limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius and double adaptation funding by 2025. This is the only way to save children’s lives and futures – and the future of the planet.”
Heatwaves are especially damaging to children, as they are less able to regulate their body temperature compared to adults. The more heatwaves children are exposed to, the greater the chance of health problems including chronic respiratory conditions, asthma, and cardiovascular diseases. Babies and young children are at the greatest risk of heat-related mortality. Heatwaves can also affect children’s environments, their safety, nutrition and access to water, and their education and future livelihood.
The report found high heatwave duration currently impacts 538 million, or 23 per cent of, children globally. This will rise to 1.6 billion children in 2050 at 1.7 degrees warming, and 1.9 billion children at 2.4 degrees warming, emphasising the importance of urgent and dramatic emissions mitigation and adaptation measures to contain global heating and protect lives.
Millions more children will be exposed to high heatwave severity and extreme high temperatures depending on the degree of global heating reached. Children in northern regions, especially Europe, will face the most dramatic increases in high severity heatwaves and, by 2050, nearly half of all children in Africa and Asia will face sustained exposure to extreme high temperatures.
Currently 23 countries fall into the highest category for child exposure to extreme high temperatures. This will rise to 33 countries by 2050 under the low emissions scenario and 36 countries under the very high emissions scenario. Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger, Sudan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, India and Pakistan are among the countries likely to remain in the highest category in both scenarios.

“The climate shocks of 2022 provided a strong wakeup call about the increasing danger hurtling towards us,” said Vanessa Nakate, climate activist and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. “Heatwaves are a clear example. As hot as this year has been in almost every corner of the world, it will likely be the coldest year of the rest of our lives. The dial is being turned up on our planet and yet our world leaders haven’t begun to sweat. The only option is for us to continue to turn up the heat - on them - to correct the course we are on. World leaders must do this at COP27 for children everywhere, but especially the most vulnerable children in the most affected places. Unless they take action, and soon, this report makes it clear that heatwaves will become even harsher than they are already destined to be.”

Title: Universal access to safe drinking water requires increased investment backed by strong government institutions – WHO, UNICEF, World Bank
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
28 October 2022
GENEVA/NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, 28 OCTOBER 2022 - Governments must invest strategically in building safe drinking water systems by not only increasing funding, but also strengthening capacities to plan, coordinate, and regulate service provision, if the world is to achieve universal access to safe drinking water and mitigate the effects of climate change, say WHO, UNICEF, and the World Bank in a report released today.
The State of the World’s Drinking Water report notes that over 2 billion people have gained access to safe drinking water in the past two decades.  This progress, while positive, is fragile and inequitable with one-quarter of the world’s population left behind.  Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts and floods, which exacerbate water insecurity, disrupt supplies and devastate communities.  Meanwhile rapid urbanization is increasing the strain on cities’ capacity to deliver water to the millions of people living in in-formal communities and slums.
“Providing greater access to safe drinking water has saved many lives, most of them children. But climate change is eating into those achievements,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health. “We have to accelerate our efforts to ensure every person has reliable access to safe drinking water something that is a human right, not a luxury.”
The report provides a comprehensive review of the links between water, health, and development, with actionable recommendations for governments and partners, illustrated by examples of how countries are contributing to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of reaching safely managed drinking water for all by 2030.
“Investing in water and sanitation is critical to health, economic growth and the environment. Healthier children become healthier adults who then contribute more to the economy and society”, said Saroj Kumar Jha, Director, Global Director, World Bank Group's Water Global Practice. “This principle is at the core of the World Bank’s Human Capital Project. Governments and private sector must take critical action now to accelerate inclusive and sustainable water supply and sanitation services in both urban and rural areas.”
To provide universal access to safe drinking water by 2030, governments and partners must dramatically increase political commitment to drinking water and quadruple investments.  The report provides comprehensive recommendations to enact sustainable improvements that addresses infrastructure, governance, finance, capacity development, data and information, and innovation, even with limited budgets.
Overarching recommendations include:
“No child should be faced with the choice of drinking dirty water – a leading killer of children – or making dangerous journeys to collect water and missing out on school,” said Aidan Cronin, UNICEF Interim Director of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) and Climate, Environment, Energy, and Disaster Risk Reduction (CEED). “Accessible and reliable safe drinking water is fundamental to ensuring children are healthy, educated, and thriving.”
Armenia:
According to the Education Management Information System in 2021-2022 academic year, over 4000 school-students (1%) and 600 teachers (1.6%) in 70 schools (5%) don’t have access to water (both drinking/portable or for handwashing) and almost 3600 school-students (0.9%) and 500 teachers (1.3%) in at least 50 schools neither have access to sanitation nor water across Armenia.
In September 2022, UNICEF initiated an assessment of the situation of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in the public pre-primary and general educational institutions of Armenia. Based on the desk-review and the generated evidence, together with partners, UNICEF will identify solutions for filling in the existing gaps tailored to different school and pre-school environments, including professional design and costing of WASH facility models and recommendations for upgrading national standards and plans.

Title: Child poverty across eastern Europe and Central Asia soars by 19 per cent, as Ukraine war and rising inflation drive four million children into poverty - UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
17 October 2022
GENEVA/NEW YORK, 17 October 2022 – The war in Ukraine and rising inflation have driven an additional four million children across eastern Europe and Central Asia into poverty, a 19 per cent increase since 2021, according to a new UNICEF study published today.
The impact of the war in Ukraine and subsequent economic downturn on child poverty in eastern Europe and Central Asia – which features data from 22 countries* across the region - shows that children are bearing the heaviest burden of the economic crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. While children make up 25 per cent of the population, they account for nearly 40 per cent of the additional 10.4 million people experiencing poverty this year.
The Russian Federation accounts for nearly three-quarters of the total increase in the number of children living in poverty due to the Ukraine war and a cost-of-living crisis across the region, with an additional 2.8 million children now living in households below the poverty line. Ukraine is home to half a million additional children living in poverty, the second largest share, followed by Romania, with an additional 110,000 children, the study notes.
“Beyond the obvious horrors of war – the killing and maiming of children, mass displacement – the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine are having a devastating impact on children across eastern Europe and Central Asia,” said UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia Afshan Khan. “Children all over the region are being swept up in this war’s terrible wake. If we don’t support these children and families now, the steep rise in child poverty will almost certainly result in lost lives, lost learning, and lost futures.”
The consequences of child poverty stretch far beyond families living in financial distress. The sharp increase could result in an additional 4,500 children dying before their first birthdays, and learning losses could be equivalent to an additional 117,000 children dropping out of school this year alone, the study notes.
The poorer a family is, the greater the proportion of their income committed to necessities such as food and fuel. When the cost of basic goods soars, the money available to meet other needs such as health care and education falls, the study notes. The subsequent cost-of-living crisis means that the poorest children are even less likely to access essential services, and are more at risk of violence, exploitation and abuse.
For many, childhood poverty lasts a lifetime. One in three children born and raised in poverty will live their adult lives in poverty, leading to an intergenerational cycle of hardship and deprivation, the study notes.
The challenges faced by families living in or on the brink of poverty deepen when governments reduce public expenditure, increase consumption taxes or put in place austerity measures in a limiting effort to boost their economies in the short-term, as this diminishes the reach and quality of support services that families depend on.
The study sets out a framework to help reduce the number of children living in poverty and prevent more families from falling into financial distress:
UNICEF is calling for continued and expanded support to strengthen social protection systems in high- and middle-income countries in eastern Europe and Central Asia; and the prioritization of funding for social protection programmes, including cash assistance programmes for vulnerable children and families.

Title: Gavar Municipality, UNICEF and Youth Initiatives Center NGO launch Gavar’s first youth house for adolescents and young people
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
13 October 2022
Gavar municipality, UNICEF and Gyumri Youth Initiative Center NGO announced the official opening of Gavar’s first ever youth house today. The youth house is established based on UNICEF’s concept of safe spaces for children and adolescents and already serves 140 adolescents, including adolescents with disabilities. On an annual basis, the youth house will be able to work with 400 to 500 beneficiaries in total.
The youth house was made possible thanks to effective collaboration with community leaders and partners. The municipality of Gavar selected and allocated the premise of the youth house, as well as allocated 60 percent of the total establishment budget for renovation, installing water piping, landscaping and outside lighting, matching support from UNICEF. Together with the Gyumri Youth Initiative Center NGO, UNICEF renovated and furnished, installed solar panels, as well as supplied the center with utensils, development games, learning and recreation materials for various ages of children and adolescents. In addition, UNICEF and YIC trained new staff members for the center on adolescent development, principles of working with adolescents and young people and provision of child-friendly services.
“Every community needs adolescent-friendly spaces and services for them to have their own space to gather, benefit from informal educational opportunities, try to solve community problems together, learn how to work as a team and how to be active members of their community. At UNICEF, we know that these services help to increase resilience among adolescents. They are also designed to provide psychosocial support and referrals to more specialized services, when necessary,” shared Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Armenia.
“We were excited to join hands with UNICEF for this goal. Young people are the backbone of our community, which is why we have invested in establishing this new service for adolescents and young people in order to create suitable development opportunities and resources for all. It’s an important point of inclusion for the community, as it will also serve the Gavar orphanage. We are sure that starting today, this center will become a favorite place for our young people,” noted Gurgen Martirosyan, Gavar mayor.
“Open youth centers create excellent opportunities for adolescents and young people to develop, make their voices heard, participate in the life of the community, and expand their skills and employability. This contributes not only to their individual development and growth, but also, the development of their community,” said Artur Najaryan, Chairman of the Board of the Gyumri Center for Youth Initiatives NGO.
The youth house will offer individual and group youth work, consulting, educational clubs and workshops, as well as recreational activities, such as excursions, community and networking events. It will have five main directions, focusing on education, professional orientation, employment, entertainment and promotion of healthy lifestyle.
To ensure the sustainability of the youth house, Gavar municipality has also included the operation costs, including staffing and utilities, in its five-year budget plan.
Together with partners, UNICEF has already helped establish youth houses and centers in Dvin, Echmiadzin, Armavir and Mrgashen. By 2024, UNICEF will also establish two new youth houses in Syunik and Shirak regions, with the support of the Armenian community in Argentina.

Title: WHO launches the Emergency Medical Teams 2030 Strategy at Global Meeting to strengthen rapid response amid emergencies worldwide
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
05 October 2022
At a time of mounting health emergencies worldwide, from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and climate-related crises to the protracted war in Ukraine, more than 500 participants from the Emergency Medical Team (EMT) Network across WHO’s six regions are in Yerevan, Armenia, for the 5th EMT Global Meeting this week.
The three-day gathering offers participants from over 110 countries - including EMTs, technical experts and international partners across a range of organizations – an opportunity to reflect on lessons learnt from the response to multiple emergencies, including innovative and lifesaving approaches, and to discuss how to further strengthen the WHO-supported EMT Initiative going forward.
“Armenia is pleased to host this week’s meeting, especially given our experiences tackling multiple emergencies in recent decades, from the horrific 1988 earthquake that claimed up to 25,000 lives to the 2020 War in Nagorno-Karabakh and the recent escalation that targeted the settlements of the Republic of Armenia, causing further loss of life”, noted Anahit Avanesyan, Minister of Health of Armenia. “For us, EMTs are a critical extension of the wider health ecosystem, and we are grateful to WHO and all our health and development partners for sharing their expertise and creating a platform for regional and global collaboration, helping us learn from others, and to share our experiences as well."
EMT 2030 Strategy: a high impact investment in preparedness for emergencies
The 5th EMT Global Meeting is a landmark as it launches the EMT 2030 strategy—the blueprint for the next eight years to continue to develop a network of effective and high-performing national, subnational and regional EMTs in line with the WHO EMT classification and minimum standards.  Participants from the network will contribute to the future development of the EMT Initiative that seeks to prioritize and enhance the capacity of local teams to respond to emergencies and strengthen the network to provide support when needed across diverse contexts.
“As we build a new and stronger architecture for health emergency preparedness and response, a rapidly deployable global health emergency corps will be vital, building on the experience and capacities of Emergency Medical Teams,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, in his opening statement at the meeting. ” The EMT 2030 strategy envisions a world in which every country has the ability to respond rapidly and effectively to national emergencies, leveraging regional and sub-regional capacities to support vulnerable communities and others in need.”
Lessons from COVID-19
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, now in its third year, has created an especially challenging context for emergency response in many countries, increasing the demand for specialized skills on infection prevention and control, and the management of severe respiratory infection cases. In response to this, the EMT network deployed nearly 200 International EMTs to support the response in 67 countries, highlighting the role of specialized care teams that both support a country’s response while building their national capacities.
“The pandemic truly revealed the importance of strengthening in-country health emergency response capacities, including a highly-trained workforce and access to essential technology and equipment,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “But the crisis also shone a brighter light on the benefits of collaboration between EMTs and other operational response arms of WHO, like Rapid Response Mobile Laboratories of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network which extended the capacity of EMTs to diagnose cases faster, leading to quicker treatment and care. Bringing EMTs and mobile laboratories together is also proving highly successful in the context of humanitarian crises, making the health response more effective in areas where health facilities and systems have been compromised, as well as when countries are receiving significant numbers of refugees with multiple emergency health needs.”
About the EMT Initiative: A rapidly growing network
EMTs are groups of health professionals, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, support workers and logisticians, who provide care for patients affected by an emergency.
The EMT Initiative was formed after the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, quickly growing into a significant network of qualified medical teams, trained and prepared to provide immediate support during an emergency. So far, 37 International teams have already been classified by WHO, with nearly 100 more currently undergoing the classification process to meet the highest standards of healthcare assistance in emergencies.
When emergencies strike, the EMT network is mobilized as part of the national response—treating patients, imparting training to and supervision of emergency care providers, strengthening coordination between different pillars of emergency medical response, and adhering to guiding principles and standards to ensure quality of care.

Title: Half of health care facilities globally lack basic hygiene services – WHO, UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
01 September 2022
Geneva, New York – Half of health care facilities worldwide lack basic hygiene services with water and soap or alcohol-based hand rub where patients receive care and at toilets in these facilities, according to the latest Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) report by WHO and UNICEF. Around 3.85 billion people use these facilities, putting them at greater risk of infection, including 688 million people who receive care at facilities with no hygiene services at all.
“Hygiene facilities and practices in health care settings are non-negotiable. Their improvement is essential to pandemic recovery, prevention and preparedness. Hygiene in health care facilities cannot be secured without increasing investments in basic measures, which include safe water, clean toilets, and safely managed health care waste,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health. “I encourage Member States to step up their efforts to implement their 2019 World Health Assembly commitment to strengthen water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in health care facilities, and to monitor these efforts.”
The latest report, “Progress on WASH in health care facilities 2000–2021: special focus on WASH and infection prevention and control”, has for the first time established this global baseline on hygiene services – which assessed access at points of care as well as toilets – as more countries than ever report on critical elements of WASH services in their hospitals and other health centres. For hygiene, data are now available for 40 countries, representing 35% of the world’s population, up from 21 countries in 2020 and 14 in 2019.
The newly established global estimate reveals a clearer and more alarming picture of the state of hygiene in health care facilities. Though 68% of health care facilities had hygiene facilities at points of care, and 65% had handwashing facilities with water and soap at toilets, only 51% had both and therefore met the criteria for basic hygiene services. Furthermore, 1 in 11 (9%) of health care facilities globally have neither.
“If health care providers don’t have access to a hygiene service, patients don’t have a health care facility,” said Kelly Ann Naylor, UNICEF Director of WASH and Climate, Environment, Energy, and Disaster Risk Reduction (CEED). “Hospitals and clinics without safe water and basic hygiene and sanitation services are a potential death trap for pregnant mothers, newborns, and children. Every year, around 670 000 newborns lose their lives to sepsis. This is a travesty – even more so as their deaths are preventable.”
The report notes that contaminated hands and environments play a significant role in pathogen transmission in health care facilities and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Interventions to increase access to handwashing with water and soap and environmental cleaning form the cornerstone of infection prevention and control programmes and are crucial to providing quality care, particularly for safe childbirth.
Coverage of WASH facilities is still uneven across different regions and income groupings:
The report is being launched at World Water Week taking place in Stockholm, Sweden. The annual conference, which runs from 23 August to 1 September, explores new ways to tackle humanity’s greatest challenges: from food security and health to agriculture, technology, biodiversity and climate.

Title: Cities in Europe are unique - a new WHO report shows they can be the healthiest in the world
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
31 August 2022
There are fewer mega cities in the WHO European Region than in other areas of the world - more than 70% of people in our Region are living in smaller cities of less than half a million inhabitants. That gives Europe a unique opportunity to make city life healthier, says a new report prepared by the WHO European Office for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases in collaboration with Gehl design agency.
The report “Urban design for health: inspiration for the use of urban design to promote physical activity and healthy diets in the WHO European Region” will be launched on 31 August 2022 at 10.00 CET during the opening session of the 11th conference of HEPA Europe on health-enhancing physical activity in Nice, France.
Healthy choice should be the easiest choice
Smaller cities can use more urban design tools and health interventions to improve the well-being of their populations. The new report looks at innovative and effective ways to promote physical activity and healthy diets in urban settings.
There is a strong relationship between urban environments and non-communicable diseases, which are a major cause of death and disability around the world.
Providing access to healthy foods and active lifestyles has profound effects on the physical, mental, and social well-being of communities around the world.
Rather than simply educating people about the ‘right’ food choice and benefits of physical activity, cities can implement strategies to make those choices the easiest ones, proposes the WHO report.

Tools for healthier cities
“If we want to make cities a better environment that helps people to live healthier lives, first we need to understand the people’s needs. This will give us insights to integrate healthier habits into everyday lives effectively”, said Dr Kremlin Wickramasinghe, a.i. Head of the WHO European Office for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases.
“Gathering data and building connections with local communities is essential for healthier urban planning”.
The WHO report presents several innovative tools which facilitate this aim in different ways:
- collect data on how people move around in a city
- identify local food infrastructures that can improve food security
- estimate the economic benefits of healthier policies
- tools for engaging various types of stakeholders, including citizens
- analyse data for healthier urban planning

Many cities have already implemented actions related to urban transport and mobility, as well as access to urban nature and green spaces. The new report highlights some of the positive examples.
- Cork, Ireland
This city is introducing more playful elements into its street architecture by developing ten new parklets with entertainment equipment and seating.
- Lisbon, Portugal
The city promotes healthy food behaviours by putting local produce at the heart of its public space project, while teaching children how to grow vegetables and the importance of a healthy diet.
- Cherepovets, the Russian Federation
Providing special pathways to access the water in both summer and winter. By connecting blue and green spaces in the city centre, this intervention aims to promote mental health for city dwellers of all ages and groups.
- Tbilisi, Georgia
The city is transforming its streets to make them pedestrian oriented. The new street design is meant to address the main challenges of Tbilisi: air quality, physical inactivity, and mental health.
The tools and examples in the report highlight the types of actions that policy makers and urban planners can use for inspiration to rethink and improve their cities.

01 August 2022
“As global crises continue to threaten the health and nutrition of millions of babies and children, the vital importance of breastfeeding as the best possible start in life is more critical than ever.
“This World Breastfeeding Week, under its theme Step up for breastfeeding: Educate and Support, UNICEF and WHO are calling on governments to allocate increased resources to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding policies and programmes, especially for the most vulnerable families living in emergency settings.
“During emergencies, including those in Afghanistan, Yemen, Ukraine, the Horn of Africa, and the Sahel, breastfeeding guarantees a safe, nutritious and accessible food source for babies and young children. It offers a powerful line of defense against disease and all forms of child malnutrition, including wasting.
“Breastfeeding also acts as a baby’s first vaccine, protecting them from common childhood illnesses.
“Yet the emotional distress, physical exhaustion, lack of space and privacy, and poor sanitation experienced by mothers in emergency settings mean that many babies are missing out on the benefits of breastfeeding to help them survive.
“Fewer than half of all newborn babies are breastfed in the first hour of life, leaving them more vulnerable to disease and death. And only 44 per cent of infants are exclusively breastfed in the first six months of life, short of the World Health Assembly target of 50 per cent by 2025.
“Protecting, promoting, and supporting breastfeeding is more important than ever, not just for protecting our planet as the ultimate natural, sustainable, first food system, but also for the survival, growth, and development of millions of infants.
“That is why UNICEF and WHO are calling on governments, donors, civil society, and the private sector to step up efforts to:

Yerevan, July 28, 2022 – UNICEF and partners announced the official opening of two new youth houses in Ejmiatsin and Armavir today. The events were attended by UNICEF Representative Christine Weigand, Second Secretary for Economic Cooperation at the Embassy of Japan in Armenia, Rika Onodera, Head of Vagharshapat Community Diana Gasparyan, Head of Armavir Community Davit Khudatyan and President of Council of Gyumri Youth Initiative Center NGO Artur Najaryan. The youth houses were established based on UNICEF’s concept of safe spaces for children and adolescents and will support more than 700 adolescents if both communities.
“The Government of Japan has implemented various projects which contribute to infrastructure development and human resource enhancement for socioeconomic and regional development in Armenia. In particular, we focus on educational field in implementing assistance to Armenia, as we believe that children are priceless treasures and education is a foundation for development of a country. We sincerely hope that the youth houses established with the financial assistance from the Government of Japan will serve as an important educational center for the youth of Ejmiatsin and Armavir communities for a long time,” noted the Embassy of Japan in Armenia.
“Safe spaces are places where adolescents gather, participate in informal educational opportunities, try to solve community problems, learn to work as a team, obtain 21st century skills and more. We know that these activities help to increase resilience and play an important role in providing overall psychosocial support to adolescents. Importantly, these spaces are also designed to provide support with referral to additional, more specialized interventions and services,” said Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Armenia.
The youth houses were made possible thanks to effective collaboration with community leaders and partners. The municipalities of Vagharshapat and Armavir selected and allocated the premises of the youth houses. Together with the Gyumri Youth Initiative Center NGO, UNICEF renovated and furnished, as well as supplied the centers with utensils, development games, learning and recreation materials for various ages of children. In addition, UNICEF and YIC trained new staff members for the centers on adolescent development, principles of working with adolescents and young people and provision of child-friendly services.
To ensure the sustainability of the centers, both communities included the operation costs of the centers, including staffing and utilities, in the five-year budget plan of the communities.
“We were excited to join our hands for this goal, because in our community, as in a number of other communities across Armenia, there was a need to support young people, create suitable educational opportunities for them, but there were no suitable resources. We are sure that starting today, this center will become a favorite place for our young people, and they will obtain new skills here,” noted Armavir community leader Davit Khudatyan.
“Strong and motivated young people are the backbone of our community, society and state, and every community should do everything possible to keep this potential in the community contributing to its development. This model provides a secure environment where we can motivate young people from school age. I believe that this center will become one of the important educational centers of our community forming responsible citizens,” noted Diana Gasparyan in her opening speech.
“Having many years of experience in the field of youth work, we can surely state that open youth centers create excellent opportunities for adolescents and young people to learn, express themselves, organize their free time. This contributes not only to their individual development and growth, but also, the development of their community,” said Artur Najaryan, Chairman of the Board of the Gyumri Center for Youth Initiatives NGO.
By the end of this year, UNICEF and partners will establish another youth house in Gavar town in Gehgarkunik region, with the support of the Government of Japan.

Title: Around 3 in 4 youth lack skills needed for employment, new report says
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
20 July 2022
NEW YORK, 20 July 2022 – Nearly three quarters of young people aged 15 to 24 in 92 countries with available data are off-track to acquire the skills needed for employment, according to a new report published today by the Education Commission and UNICEF ahead of World Youth Skills Day.
Recovering learning: Are children and youth on track in skills development? features analyses on skills development in early childhood, and among children of primary school age and youth. The data highlight low levels of skills among children and young people across all age groups, with young people in low-income countries the least likely to have the skills required to thrive, particularly in future employment opportunities, decent work, and entrepreneurship.
“An inspired, skilled generation of children and young people is critical for prosperity, progression, and the success of societies and economies. Yet, the majority of children and young people across the world have been failed by their education systems, leaving them uneducated, uninspired, and unskilled -- the perfect storm for unproductivity,” said UNICEF Director of Education Robert Jenkins. “Investment in cost-effective, proven solutions to fast-track learning and skills development for today’s generation and future generations is urgently needed to address this crisis.”
With high rates of out-of-school young people and low attainment of secondary-level skills, countries worldwide are facing a skills crisis, with the majority of youth unprepared to take part in today’s workforce, the report notes.
Deep disparities across countries and among those from the poorest communities are increasing inequalities. In at least 1 in 3 low-income countries with available data, more than 85 percent of young people are off-track in the secondary-level, digital, and job-specific skills attainment, the report notes.
"To give young people the best chance to succeed and recover learning losses due to the pandemic, we need to support them holistically. But we can't recover what we don't measure. We need to know where children and youth are in building the range of skills they need and monitor their progress. That's why the Education Commission, UNICEF, and partners have been working to address critical data gaps, including the launch of the World Skills Clock to help track progress on and raise awareness around youth skills attainment around the world so we can target urgent action to prepare this generation to thrive in the future," said Education Commission Executive Director Liesbet Steer.
Data from 77 countries show that less than three-quarters of children aged between 3 and 5 years old are developmentally on track in at least three out of the four domains of literacy-numeracy, physical, social-emotional, and learning. At approximately 10 years old, the majority of children in low- and middle-income countries are unable to read and understand a simple text. These foundational skills are the building blocks for further learning and skills development, the report notes.
Basic literacy and numeracy; transferable skills including life skills and socioemotional skills; digital skills, which allow individuals to use and understand technology; job-specific skills, which support the transition into the workforce; and entrepreneurial skills are essential for children to thrive. These skills are also critical for the development of societies and economies.
UNICEF and the Education Commission are urging governments to reach every child with quality education and break down the barriers that put them at risk of dropping out; assess children’s learning levels and provide tailored catch-up classes to bring them up to speed; prioritize foundational skills to build a strong base for lifelong learning; and support psychosocial health and well-being by providing holistic support. The report outlines the need for more extensive data on the skills gap among children and young people across all age groups.

Title: COVID-19 pandemic fuels largest continued backslide in vaccinations in three decades
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
15 July 2022
GENEVA/NEW YORK,15 July 2022 – The largest sustained decline in childhood vaccinations in approximately 30 years has been recorded in official data published today by WHO and UNICEF.
The percentage of children who received three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) – a marker for immunization coverage within and across countries – fell 5 percentage points between 2019 and 2021 to 81 per cent.
As a result, 25 million children missed out on one or more doses of DTP through routine immunization services in 2021 alone. This is 2 million more than those who missed out in 2020 and 6 million more than in 2019. The decline was due to many factors including an increased number of children living in conflict and fragile settings where immunization access is often challenging, increased misinformation and COVID-19 related issues such as service and supply chain disruptions, resource diversion to response efforts, and containment measures that limited immunization service access and availability.
“This is a red alert for child health. We are witnessing the largest sustained drop in childhood immunization in a generation. The consequences will be measured in lives,” said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director. “While a pandemic hangover was expected last year as a result of COVID-19 disruptions and lockdowns, what we are seeing now is a continued decline. COVID-19 is not an excuse. We need immunization catch-ups for the missing millions or we will inevitably witness more outbreaks, more sick children and greater pressure on already strained health systems.”
18 million of the 25 million children did not receive a single dose of DTP during the year, the vast majority of whom live in low- and middle-income countries, with India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ethiopia and the Philippines recording the highest numbers.
It was hoped that 2021 would be a year of recovery during which strained immunization programmes would rebuild and the cohort of children missed in 2020 would be caught-up. Instead, DTP3 coverage was set back to its lowest level since 2008 which, along with declines in coverage for other basic vaccines, pushed the world off-track to meet global goals, including the immunization indicator for the Sustainable Development Goals.
This historic backsliding in rates of immunization is happening against a backdrop of rapidly rising rates of severe acute malnutrition. A malnourished child already has weakened immunity and missed vaccinations can mean common childhood illnesses quickly become lethal to them. The convergence of a hunger crisis with a growing immunization gap threatens to create the conditions for a child survival crisis.
“Planning and tackling COVID-19 should also go hand-in-hand with vaccinating for killer diseases like measles, pneumonia and diarrhea,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “It’s not a question of either/or, it’s possible to do both”.
Monumental efforts will be required to reach universal levels of coverage and to prevent outbreaks. Inadequate coverage levels have already resulted in avoidable outbreaks of measles and polio in the past 12 months, underscoring the vital role of immunization in keeping children, adolescents, adults, and societies healthy.
First dose measles coverage dropped to 81 per cent in 2021, also the lowest level since 2008. This meant 24.7 million children missed their first measles dose in 2021, 5.3 million more than in 2019. A further 14.7 million did not receive their needed second dose. Similarly, compared to 2019, 6.7 million more children missed the third dose of polio vaccine.
WHO and UNICEF are working with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and other partners to deliver the global Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030), a strategy for all countries and relevant global partners to achieve set goals on preventing diseases through immunization and delivering vaccines to everyone, everywhere, at every age.
The IA2030 partners call on governments and relevant actors to:

Title: Schools ill-equipped to provide healthy and inclusive learning environments for all children – UNICEF, WHO
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
23 June 2022
NEW YORK, GENEVA, 23 June 2022 – Despite a steady decline in the proportion of schools without basic water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, deep inequalities persist between and within countries, UNICEF and WHO said today. Schoolchildren in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and fragile contexts are the most affected, and emerging data shows that few schools have disability-accessible WASH services.
“Far too many children go to schools without safe drinking water, clean toilets, and soap for handwashing—making learning difficult,” said Kelly Ann Naylor, UNICEF Director of Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Climate, Environment, Energy, and Disaster Risk Reduction. “The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of providing healthy and inclusive learning environments. To protect children’s education, the road to recovery must include equipping schools with the most basic services to fight infectious diseases today and in the future.”
“Access to water, sanitation and hygiene is not only essential for effective infection prevention and control, but also a prerequisite for children’s health, development and well-being,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health. “Schools should be settings where children thrive and not be subjected to hardship or infections due to lack of, or poorly maintained, basic infrastructure.”
Schools play a critical role in promoting the formation of healthy habits and behaviours, yet many still lacked basic WASH services in 2021. According to the latest data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP):
###
Situation in Armenia
As of 2022, in Armenia, according to the Education Management Information System (EMIS):
During the 2021-2022 academic year, UNICEF improved the basic water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services in 15 schools in Ararat, Armavir, Kotayk and Syunik marzes, making the schools disability accessible. This year, 5 additional schools will be supported in Goris, Kapan and Sisian communities of Syunik marz.
In addition, together with the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports, UNICEF plans to assess the sanitation and hygiene services of academic institutions, as well as review existing standards to improve basic water, sanitation, and hygiene services in academic institutions and provide a dignified environment both for students and teachers.

Title: Nearly 37 million children displaced worldwide – highest number ever recorded
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
17 June 2022
NEW YORK, 17 June 2022 – Conflict, violence and other crises left a record 36.5 million children displaced from their homes at the end of 2021, UNICEF estimates – the highest number recorded since the Second World War. This figure includes 13.7 million refugee and asylum-seeking children† and nearly 22.8 million children who are internally displaced due to conflict and violence.
These figures do not include children displaced by climate and environmental shocks or disasters, as well as those newly displaced in 2022, including by the war in Ukraine.
The record number of children displaced is a direct result of cascading crises – including acute and protracted conflicts such as in Afghanistan, fragility in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo or Yemen and linked shocks exacerbated by the impacts of climate change. Just like fragility, child displacement is spreading fast. During the previous year, the global number of displaced children increased by 2.2 million.
"We can't ignore the evidence: The number of children being displaced by conflict and crises is rapidly growing – and so is our responsibility to reach them," said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. "I hope this alarming number will move governments to prevent children from being displaced in the first place – and when they are displaced, to ensure their access to education, protection, and other critical services that support their wellbeing and development now and in the future."
Crises like the war in Ukraine – which has caused more than 2 million children to flee the country and displaced 3 million internally since February – come on top of this record high.  Additionally, children and families are also being driven from their homes by extreme weather events, such as by drought in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, and severe flooding in Bangladesh, India and South Africa. There were 7.3 million new displacements of children as consequence of natural disasters in 2021.
 
The global refugee population has more than doubled in the last decade, with children making up almost half of the total. Over a third of displaced children live in Sub-Saharan Africa (3.9 million or 36 per cent), one quarter in Europe and Central Asia (2.6 million or 25 per cent), and 13 per cent (1.4 million) in the Middle East and North Africa.
 
As the number of  displaced and refugee children reaches a record high, access to essential support and services like healthcare, education and protection is falling short. Only half of all refugee children are enrolled in primary school, while less than a quarter of refugee adolescents are in secondary school.
 
Uprooted children – whether refugee, asylum seeker or internally displaced – can face grave risks to their well-being and safety. This is particularly true for the hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied or separated children who are at heightened risk of trafficking, exploitation, violence and abuse. Children account for approximately 28 per cent of trafficking victims globally.

UNICEF urges Member States to adhere to their commitments to the rights of all uprooted children, including commitments established under the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) and the Global Compact for Migration (GCM), and invest further in data and research that reflects the true scale of the issues facing refugee, migrant and displaced children.
UNICEF calls on governments to take six actions to achieve equal rights and opportunities for all refugee, migrant and displaced children:

Title: Over-consumption in the world’s richest countries is destroying children’s environments globally, new report says
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
25 May 2022
FLORENCE/NEW YORK, 24 May 2022 – The majority of wealthy countries are creating unhealthy, dangerous and noxious conditions for children across the world, according to the latest Report Card published today by UNICEF Office of Research - Innocenti.
Innocenti Report Card 17: Places and Spaces compares how 39 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union (EU) fare in providing healthy environments for children. The report features indicators such as exposure to harmful pollutants including toxic air, pesticides, damp and lead; access to light, green spaces and safe roads; and countries’ contributions to the climate crisis, consumption of resources, and the dumping of e-waste.
The report states that if everybody in the world consumed resources at the rate people do in OECD and EU countries, the equivalent of 3.3 earths would be needed to keep up with consumption levels. If everyone were to consume resources at the rate at which people in Canada, Luxembourg and the United States do, at least five earths would be needed.
While Spain, Ireland and Portugal feature at the top of the league table overall, all OECD and EU countries are failing to provide healthy environments for all children across all indicators. Some of the wealthiest countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada and the United States, have a severe and widespread impact on global environments – based on CO2 emissions, e-waste and overall consumptions of resources per capita – and also rank low overall on creating a healthy environment for children within their borders.  In contrast, the least wealthy OECD and EU countries in Latin America and Europe have a much lower impact on the wider world.
“Not only are the majority of rich countries failing to provide healthy environments for children within their borders, they are also contributing to the destruction of children’s environments in other parts of the world,” said Gunilla Olsson, Director of UNICEF Office of Research – Innocenti. “In some cases we are seeing countries providing relatively healthy environments for children at home while being among the top contributors to pollutants that are destroying children’s environments abroad.”
Additional findings include:
UNICEF is calling for the following steps to protect and improve children’s environments:
“We owe it to ourselves and to future generations to create better places and spaces for children to thrive,” said Olsson. “Mounting waste, harmful pollutants and exhausted natural resources are taking a toll on our children’s physical and mental health and threatening our planet’s sustainability. We must pursue policies and practices that safeguard the natural environment upon which children and young people depend the most.”

Title: UNICEF partners with the Public Television of Armenia to produce dedicated series on positive parenting
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
20 May 2022
YEREVAN, 20 May – UNICEF and the Public Television of Armenia launched a unique partnership this week in the framework of the daily Healthy Lifestyle programme to support mothers and fathers to get reliable information from leading experts on positive parenting in Armenian. The programme will feature episodes, entitled ‘UNICEF corner. Positive parenting’, twice a week that have been designed with the help of Parenting School NGO.
The episodes provide practical tips and advice to parents that will improve their parenting skills, relationships with their children and their family, as well as promote a culture of self-care and positive talk about mental health and wellbeing.
“When travelling to the marzes, I often hear from women and especially new mothers that they actively seek information about childcare and parenting but usually come across either outdated information or online sources in other languages. Partnering with the Public TV and Parenting School we aim at providing useful information to caregivers in their own language and firsthand from leading psychologists in Armenia,” said Ms Silvia Mestroni, UNICEF Representative in Armenia, OIC. “The content we developed also pays attention to adolescence as a period of childhood. It’s a unique time in anyone’s life where parenting requires an approach that is adjusted to this phase of development.”
“As a public broadcaster, the First TV channel has an important educational mission to contribute to the healthy development of the society. This time our partnership with UNICEF Armenia focuses on positive parenting, and this is a special initiative for us as it will contribute to a society that has higher awareness of and consciousness about the importance of positive parenting. I am confident that in the future we will have other formats to promote positive parenting skills in Armenia,” noted Mr Tigran Virabyan, General Producer of the Public Television of Armenia.
“It was not an easy task for our experts to choose the most urgent, sensible and comprehensive topics for the series. There is so much to share with parents on conscious and positive parenting, but we chose to focus on more practical hints and on giving parents a toolkit of skills and habits for every positive parent to help them bring palpable changes in their parent-child relationships. We share information and methodology on how to become a skilled and happy parent, as we believe that only happy parents can raise happy children,” said Mrs Anna Velitsyan, founder of Parenting School NGO. “This cooperation with UNICEF gave us an unprecedented opportunity to reach every Armenian parent in every corner of the country, something we as parenting psychologists, could indeed only dream of.”
Follow the episodes on the Public Television at 18:00 or watch them online through UNICEF’s YouTube Channel [https://bit.ly/3MwfgAX].
UNICEF works to ensure wellbeing of families and children through promotion of positive parenting and provision of psychosocial support to parents and children. In 2020-2022 UNICEF has reached over 32,000 parents and children with mental health and psychosocial support.

Title: Almost one billion children and adults with disabilities and older persons in need of assistive technology denied access, according to new report
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
20 May 2022
GENEVA/NEW YORK, 20 May 2022 - A new report published today by WHO and UNICEF reveals that more than 2.5 billion people need one or more assistive products, such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, or apps that support communication and cognition. Yet nearly one billion of them are denied access, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where access can be as low as 3% of the need for these life-changing products.
The Global Report on Assistive Technology presents evidence for the first time on the global need for and access to assistive products and provides a series of recommendations to expand availability and access, raise awareness of the need, and implement inclusion policies to improve the lives of millions of people.
“Assistive technology is a life changer – it opens the door to education for children with impairments, employment and social interaction for adults living with disabilities, and an independent life of dignity for older persons,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Denying people access to these life-changing tools is not only an infringement of human rights, it’s economically shortsighted. We call on all countries to fund and prioritize access to assistive technology and give everyone a chance to live up to their potential.”
“Nearly 240 million children have disabilities. Denying children the right to the products they need to thrive doesn’t only harm individual children, it deprives families and their communities of everything they could contribute if their needs were met,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Without access to assistive technology, children with disabilities will continue to miss out on their education, continue to be at a greater risk of child labor and continue to be subjected to stigma and discrimination, undermining their confidence and wellbeing.”
The report notes that the number of people in need of one or more assistive products is likely to rise to 3.5 billion by 2050, due to populations ageing and the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases rising across the world. The report also highlights the vast gap in access between low- and high-income countries. An analysis of 35 countries reveals that access varies from 3% in poorer nations to 90% in wealthy countries.
Affordability is a major barrier to access, the report notes. Around two thirds of people with assistive products reported out-of-pocket payments for them. Others reported relying on family and friends to financially support their needs.
A survey of 70 countries featured in the report found large gaps in service provision and trained workforce for assistive technology, especially in the domains of cognition, communication and self-care. Previous surveys published by WHO note a lack of awareness and unaffordable prices, lack of services, inadequate product quality, range and quantity, and procurement and supply chain challenges as key barriers.
Assistive products are generally considered a means to participate in community life and in wider society on an equal footing with others; without them, people suffer exclusion, are at risk of isolation, live in poverty, may face hunger, and be forced to depend more on family, community and government support.
The positive impact of assistive products goes beyond improving the health, well-being, participation and inclusion of individual users – families and societies also benefit. For example, enlarging access to quality-assured, safe and affordable assistive products leads to reduced health and welfare costs, such as recurrent hospital admissions or state benefits, and promotes a more productive labor force, indirectly stimulating economic growth.
Access to assistive technology for children with disabilities is often the first step for childhood development, access to education, participation in sports and civic life, and getting ready for employment like their peers. Children with disabilities have additional challenges due to their growth, which requires frequent adjustments or replacements of their assistive products.
The report makes recommendations for concrete action to improve access, including:

Title: UNICEF and WHO warn of ‘perfect storm’ of conditions for measles outbreaks, affecting children
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
29 April 2022
Reported worldwide measles cases increased by 79 per cent in the first two months of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.
NEW YORK/ GENEVA, 29 April 2022 – An increase in measles cases in January and February 2022 is a worrying sign of a heightened risk for the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases and could trigger larger outbreaks, particularly of measles affecting millions of children in 2022, warn WHO and UNICEF.
Pandemic-related disruptions, increasing inequalities in access to vaccines, and the diversion of resources from routine immunization are leaving too many children without protection against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.
The risk for large outbreaks has increased as communities relax social distancing practices and other preventive measures for COVID-19 implemented during the height of the pandemic. In addition, with millions of people being displaced due to conflicts and crises including in Ukraine, Ethiopia, Somalia and Afghanistan, disruptions in routine immunization and COVID-19 vaccination services, lack of clean water and sanitation, and overcrowding increase the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks.
Almost 17,338 measles cases were reported worldwide in January and February 2022, compared to 9,665 during the first two months of 2021. As measles is very contagious, cases tend to show up quickly when vaccination levels decline. The agencies are concerned that outbreaks of measles could also forewarn outbreaks of other diseases that do not spread as rapidly.
Apart from its direct effect on the body, which can be lethal, the measles virus also weakens the immune system and makes a child more vulnerable to other infectious diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea, including for months after the measles infection itself among those who survive.  Most cases occur in settings that have faced social and economic hardships due to COVID-19, conflict, or other crises, and have chronically weak health system infrastructure and insecurity.
“Measles is more than a dangerous and potentially deadly disease. It is also an early indication that there are gaps in our global immunization coverage, gaps vulnerable children cannot afford,” said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director. “It is encouraging that people in many communities are beginning to feel protected enough from COVID-19 to return to more social activities. But doing so in places where children are not receiving routine vaccination creates the perfect storm for the spread of a disease like measles.”
In 2020, 23 million children missed out on basic childhood vaccines through routine health services, the highest number since 2009 and 3.7 million more than in 2019.
As of April 2022, the agencies report 21 large and disruptive measles outbreaks around the world in the last 12 months. Most of the measles cases were reported in Africa and the East Mediterranean region. The figures are likely higher as the pandemic has disrupted surveillance systems globally, with potential underreporting.
Countries with the largest measles outbreaks since the past year include Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia. Insufficient measles vaccine coverage is the major reason for outbreaks, wherever they occur.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted immunization services, health systems have been overwhelmed, and we are now seeing a resurgence of deadly diseases including measles. For many other diseases, the impact of these disruptions to immunization services will be felt for decades to come,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “Now is the moment to get essential immunization back on track and launch catch-up campaigns so that everybody can have access to these life-saving vaccines.”
Coverage at or above 95 per cent with two doses of the safe and effective measles vaccine can protect children against measles. However, COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions have delayed the introduction of the second dose of the measles vaccine in many countries.
As countries work to respond to outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases, and recover lost ground, UNICEF and WHO, along with partners such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the partners of the Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and others are supporting efforts to strengthen immunization systems by:

Global partners pledge $1 for every like, share, or comment on social media posts mentioning ‘UNICEF’ using the hashtag #longlifeforall until May 10.
NEW YORK, 27 April 2022 – UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Liam Neeson is leading UNICEF’s global immunization initiative with a global message thanking the scientists, parents, health workers and others who have been so critical in helping to immunize children over the last two decades.
In a video released ahead of World Immunization Week, Neeson talks about how the efforts of scientists such as Jonas Salk, who developed the first vaccine against polio, and dedicated workers who fill vials at factories or deliver vaccine injections, have made it possible to save two to three million child lives each year.
“Vaccines are a remarkable human success story. Over last the 75 years, billions of children have been vaccinated, thanks to scientists, to health workers, to volunteers. If you’ve ever been vaccinated, or vaccinated your children, then you are part of the arm-to-arm chain that keeps all humanity safe,” said Liam Neeson, UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. “We live our lives free of worry about catching smallpox. Once a terrifying diagnosis, polio is no longer a threat in most of the world. The conversation about vaccines in recent years has lost sight of how much good they have done for each of us. We need to celebrate this. It is perhaps one of the biggest collective achievements in human history.”
Every like, share, or comment on posts mentioning a UNICEF social media account and using the hashtag #longlifeforall from now until May 10 will unlock US $1 to UNICEF, from the United Nations Foundation’s Shot@Life campaign and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  – up to a total of US$10 million – to help ensure all children get the life-saving vaccines they need.
Despite the successes, an alarming 23 million children missed out on vaccinations in 2020. This number can only be reduced through greater commitment to and investment in immunization services.  UNICEF is the world’s leading provider of vaccines to children in over 100 countries. With Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and partners UNICEF supplies vaccines to reach 45 per cent of the world’s children under five.  UNICEF also works with Governments in over 130 countries to strengthen national health and immunization programmes.
“The last two years have taught us that a health care system that leaves some children exposed, is a health care system that leaves all children exposed,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.  “The best way for the world to recover from this pandemic – and to prepare for future health emergencies -- is to invest in stronger health systems, and immunization and essential health services for every child.”
World Immunization Week – celebrated every year in the last week of April – is spearheaded by the World Health Organization and brings together global partners to promote the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against disease. The theme for this year is #LongLifeForAll, with ‘long life’ reflecting the importance of lifespan vaccinations.
“We are in a race against time to restore the immunization services disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerate progress against all vaccine-preventable diseases,” said Gargee Ghosh, President of Global Policy and Advocacy at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “That is why we are thrilled to work with UNICEF and other partners around the world to ensure children – especially those in the world’s poorest countries – have access to the vaccines they need to live a long, healthy life.”
“UNICEF ensures that nearly half of the world’s children under five are ‘protected by love’ with lifesaving vaccines,” said Martha Rebour, Executive Director of Shot@Life, United Nations Foundation. “We are honored to support and promote their work during World Immunization Week and hope that others will join us in our advocacy for these critical global vaccine programs.”

Title: New study shows: Adolescents and adults in Armenia are ready to take action to tackle climate change, but more knowledge is needed
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
22 April 2022
YEREVAN, 22 April 2022 – Marking the Earth Day, UNICEF and the Austrian Development Agency, together with the Ministries of Environment and of Education, Science, Culture and Sports, released the findings of a first-time study of knowledge, attitudes, perception and behavior on climate change and adolescent participation in Armenia’s 52 consolidated communities. Targeting both adolescents and adults, the study measures the baseline situation with regard to understanding of what climate change is and how it impacts their communities, attitudes towards climate change and environmental issues, willingness to take action to address climate change and engage in environmental activism.
“The study clearly indicates how central education is in addressing climate change and environmental issues. Proper climate education can encourage children, adolescents and young people to change their attitudes and behavior and motivate them to take action,” said Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Armenia. “This study adds to the growing evidence that Governments need to invest in climate education and embed climate change learning in the curriculum, combining with opportunities for children to engage in environmental activities and projects.”
The study employed computer-assisted web interviews reaching out to 1,517 school students in 6-12th grades at 483 schools, including 45 students with special education needs, as well as computer-assisted personal interviews to reach out to 710 adults across 52 consolidated communities. Data collection amongst adolescents was ensured in collaboration with the National Center for Education Technologies.
“This study has generated a wealth of insights that should now be used to inform national and local policymaking on environment and on education, as well as form the basis to design awareness raising and behavior change communication to amplify climate action,” noted Nora Alanakyan, Deputy Head of Office of the Austrian Development Agency in Armenia. “Everyone has a role to play in addressing the impact of climate change, and we hope that the findings of this study will lay the foundation for informed decision-making in this regard so that every day becomes an Earth Day.”
Main findings from the 52 consolidated communities include:
Adolescents and young people are powerful agents of change and can make a strong contribution in proposing solutions to climate change and in promoting environmentally sustainable lifestyles and setting an example for their communities. Close to 76% of adolescents and 77% of adults are ready to take action to prevent or lessen the impact of climate change in their communities, including compromising some of their habits.
85.0% of adolescents and 90.2% of adults are also willing to raise awareness among their families and friends that they do not need to burn fields, rubber wheels or plastic items. Additionally, 83.4% of adolescents and 93.0% of adults are willing to raise awareness among their families on the need to save water; while 83.0% of adolescents and 82.3% of adults are willing to volunteer for tree planting and other climate-friendly activities.
UNICEF, with the support of ADA, will continue to support the Ministries of Environment, Territorial Administration and Infrastructure, as well as of Education, Science, Culture and Sports to integrate climate change education in the national curriculum, develop training modules for teachers and support their capacity building, create venues and opportunities for adolescents to be heard and take part in the implementation of community projects.

Title: WHO, Ministry of Health and Partners in Armenia launch “Vaccination is Care – Reaching out to People 65+” Campaign
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
08 April 2022
The ultimate goal of the “Vaccination is Care” Campaign is to feature the importance of the COVID- vaccination of people over 65 and make it available for them in polyclinics, outpatient clinics, and community centers nearer to their residence through mobile vaccination groups.
“Vaccination is Care” Campaign aiming to reach people over 65 residing in Marzes of Armenia was officially launched today, April 8. The event took place at Abovyan medical center in Kotayk Marz, which is the first site to be covered by the Campaign. The campaign is designed and implemented within the European Union/WHO action to support the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination in Eastern Partnership countries, 2021-2024.
The ultimate goal of the “Vaccination is Care” Campaign is to feature the importance of the COVID- vaccination of people over 65 and make it available for them in polyclinics, outpatient clinics, and community centers nearer to their residence through mobile vaccination groups. The COVID-19 vaccination is of vital importance as the pandemic continues to have a major impact. Unvaccinated populations, especially vulnerable groups like older people, remain at much greater risk of hospitalization, severe illness, and death.
The campaign launched on 8 April offers in addition to COVID-19 vaccination other essential health services including screening for Noncommunicable diseases such as anemia and diabetes.
“We have not yet hit our vaccination target for people over the age of 65 and so we believe that this campaign will help move us toward our goal of vaccinating the majority of our most vulnerable citizens. With the collaboration of the EU, WHO, MOH, NCDC, and ARCS, I believe that we will be able to make a bigger impact and be able to make vaccines even more accessible to those in our regions as well as provide other essential services to screen for non-communicable diseases.”, said Deputy Minister Lena Nanushyan.
“This comprehensive Health campaign has special significance; by raising awareness and providing prevention means against severe disease through COVID-19 vaccination and other essential services, it allows better access to care to those most in need, older people, and those with limited mobility. It also brings national stakeholders, international partners, and the community together to demonstrate the strength of joining forces for the benefit of the people in Armenia. I reassure that WHO and its partners stand ready to continue their support to have an effective response to the global emergency and resilient recovery”, said Dr. Jihane Tawilah, WHO Representative in Armenia.
The Vaccination Campaign is implemented jointly with the Ministry of Health and national partners - National Center for Disease Control, Local Self-Government Bodies, Arabkir MC and ICAH; Armenian Hematology Association, Armenian Immunology Association, Armenian Red Cross Society within the European Union-WHO action to support the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination.
WHO is actively involved in the national pandemic response in Armenia, supporting the Ministry of Health with various activities made possible thanks to EU funds: training  healthcare professionals, upgrading public health laboratories, providing personal protective equipment and state-of-the-art biomedical equipment to hospitals, upgrading the cold chain for safe COVID-19 vaccine delivery and the health information system for evidence-based decision making.
The dates of the mobile team visits to Marzes are as follows:
Kotayk Marz – 8, 9, 10 April
Tavush Marz – 16, 17 April
Lori / Syuniq – 23, 24 April
Gegharkunik/ Vayots Dzor - 30 April, 1 May

Title: On World Health Day, the Ministry of Health of Armenia, the United Nations family, and the World Health Organization (WHO) jointly call for a healthy planet for a healthier tomorrow
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
07 April 2022
This year’s theme “Our Planet, Our Health” highlights the interconnectivity between the health of our planet and the health of humans, animals, and plants.

WHO estimates that more than 13 million deaths around the world, including 1.4 million in WHO’s European Region each year, are caused by avoidable environmental factors. This year’s theme “Our Planet, Our Health” highlights the interconnectivity between the health of our planet and the health of humans, animals, and plants.
Air pollution alone kills one person every minute in the WHO European Region. With human impact driving climate change at an unprecedented speed and with a devastating impact on human health, it is often the most vulnerable who are hit the hardest.
Hazardous waste, contaminated water, inadequate sanitation, tobacco, and poor industrial management are only a few other threats to not only the health of humans, but our air, water, and surrounding ecosystems.  Antibiotics and other antimicrobials administered to humans, animals and plants are entering the environment and our drinking water as waste and sewage, creating antibiotic-resistant superbugs and other drug-resistant organisms.
A One Health approach, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, together with sustainable solutions that are available to governments, can help significantly mitigate the worst effects of climate change and threats to our health. Rethinking how cities and other urban areas function in future can contribute to a better air quality, something that should be taken into consideration for the post-pandemic recovery policies.
“The Օne Health approach is more of a priority today than ever before, given the epidemics and various diseases that threaten the planet day by day. In recent years, life has shown that health care systems need to be stronger, more powerful, and resilient to respond to challenges posed by global changes. In addressing these global issues, the Ministry of Health is in line with a partnership policy aimed at ensuring a "Our planet, our health" approach. "This is an opportunity to once again reflect on our doctors and nurses, who fight every day for the health of our population, often at the expense of their own health”, said Anahit Avanesyan, the Minister of Health of the Republic of Armenia.
“As in the past 30 years, the UN in Armenia, together with our partners, remains committed to supporting Armenia in achieving a more stable and healthy environment, raising public awareness of health issues, and providing quality and equitable medical services for the people, especially the most vulnerable. It is our collective responsibility to take urgent action to build inclusive, equitable societies that prioritize both the environment, as well as the health and inclusive and equitable well-being of all citizens", said Lila Pieters Yahia, UN Resident Coordinator in Armenia.
“A healthy environment is the basis for sustainability and development in all countries, Armenia included. This year’s World Health Day theme is a powerful reminder that environment and health issues require an effective response incorporating a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach”, said Dr Jihane Tawilah, WHO Representative in Armenia.
The Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization and the United Nations in Armenia will mark World Health Day with a month-long media and social mobilization campaign that will include both online and offline awareness-raising activities, such as a photography contest, an art exhibition, and social media challenges. The joint campaign calls for all citizens to become part of the solution and join in reimagining our societies, our economies, and our environment - for our planet, our health.

365 Refrigerators and Freezers were delivered to Armenia
YEREVAN, 4 April, 2022 – In an effort to strengthen Armenia’s National Cold Chain Capacity and boost COVID-19 immunization programmes, UNICEF, with USAID-funding, procured 80 refrigerators and 285 freezers. These refrigerators and freezers will be distributed to 250 primary health care facilities across Armenia, enhancing availability of vaccines for all communities. The freezers will ensure vaccines and other medical products are properly stored at temperatures of -15˚C to -25˚C, while the refrigerators can accommodate a storage capacity of 98 liters - approximately 8,000 - 10,000 vials of vaccines.
Emphasizing the importance of cold chain capacity, USAID/Armenia Mission Director, John G. Allelo stated, “Cold chain is the backbone of all vaccination programmes.  Ensuring strong cold chain capacity across the country will enable Armenia to rapidly scale up vaccinations, which will move us one step closer to putting an end to the COVID-19 pandemic.”
“We have had a very fruitful partnership with UNICEF and USAID through all of the difficulties over the past two years with COVID-19, and we look forward to continuing to work together. These refrigerators and freezers are a testament to USAID’s and UNICEF’s dedication to ensuring vaccination for all. With these refrigerators and freezers, we hope to provide access to vaccines even in the most remote areas of Armenia,” said Lena Nanushyan, First Deputy Minister of Health.
With USAID funding, UNICEF has also raised awareness of the public on how to protect themselves from infection, as well as launched training of 4,000 vaccine managers and healthcare workers from primary healthcare facilities in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health, National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and regional health authorities.
“Strengthening Armenia’s cold chain capacity will allow health workers to deliver life-saving vaccines to every last community across the country. UNICEF hopes that this will help scale up COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as contribute to strengthening overall cold chain for routine immunization,” noted Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Armenia. “Working together to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and routine immunization is a critical pathway to ensure children have access to the health, education and protection services they need to help their lives get back to normal again.”
To further support Armenia’s vaccine readiness and deployment, USAID and UNICEF, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health, NCDC, and regional health authorities, will continue implementing awareness raising campaigns to reduce transmission and train an additional 900 vaccine managers and healthcare workers.
Additionally, in support of the Ministry’s efforts to combat COVID-19 through awareness raising and vaccination programmes, UNICEF with USAID funding plans to deliver and install three cold rooms, an additional 210 freezers (including 5 ultracold freezers), and 110 additional refrigerators in the coming months.

Title: Generation Unlimited imaGen Ventures Youth Challenge calling on young changemakers in Armenia to contribute to the SDGs
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
02 March 2022
YEREVAN, 2 March 2022 – The Generation Unlimited Youth Challenge “imaGen Ventures”, launched earlier globally, was launched in Armenia today by UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, UN office in Armenia and AYB Educational Foundation.
The challenge calls on young innovators across Armenia and 35 other countries to design solutions to accelerate the SDGs, for example to improve education, employment, civic engagement or tackle issues in climate change, media literacy or mental health. As of 2021, with presence in over 43 countries, reaching over 15 million young people, and involving over 200 organizations, the Youth Challenge is truly a global initiative meeting young people where they are and working with them in supporting the realization of their full potential.
“Young people are experts in their own lives and experiences. They have the ideas and energy to create a better world for themselves - if only we give them the chance. We recognise that while talent is universal, opportunity is not. We work hard to support young people who have brilliant ideas but lack the resources to turn ideas into reality and we're proud to help these young innovators to develop their own game-changing ideas and make an impact for their communities,“ state the four co-host organizations.
The challenge in Armenia is supported by the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports as well as private sector companies, including Synergy International Systems and Startup Armenia Scientific-Educational Foundation.
A call for applications from young people of 14 to 24 ages is now live and will end on 1 April. Successful applicants will be invited to take part in design workshops in Goris in April. Following these workshops, the most promising ideas will be selected and provided with seed funding and mentorship to support implementation.
In July 2022, the most promising solutions from Armenia will be submitted to a global judging process. These projects will receive further funding, along with a tailored global incubation programme from Generation Unlimited partners to support them to scale.

Title: UNICEF joined Human Rights Defender of Armenia in a field visit to Syunik marz, marking five years of productive cooperation
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
25 February 2022
During the field trip UNICEF and Human Rights Defender of Armenia got acquainted with the work carried out in the field of protection of children's rights.
YEREVAN, 25 February 2022 – On February 17-18 Representative in Armenia Christine Weigand and UNICEF team joined the Human Rights Defender of Armenia, Arman Tatoyan, and HRDO team in a visit to Syunik marz to examine the situation of children and women.
“For the past five years, UNICEF has closely cooperated with the Human Rights Defender’s Office (HRDO) on children’s rights. This has included important achievements such as the establishment of a specialized child rights unit in 2017 and the start of continued monitoring of child rights across the country. HRDO also became a full member of the European Network of Ombudspersons for Children. Together we have developed a number of tools and capacity building interventions that enabled HRDO to work in full capacity in the direction of child rights protection in the country. Over these few years, children also started to directly apply to the HRDO, which is an important achievement in terms of ensuring equitable access to justice for all children. I am happy to join Mr Tatoyan on this mission to examine the situation of children in Syunik,” said Ms Weigand.
Ms Weigand and Mr Tatoyan visited the special school for children with disabilities in Kapan. They had a meeting with the director, examined the services for children, and met with students.
“This school has significantly improved the quality of work with caregivers, which resulted in a reduction in the number of students residing at the school,” noted Ms Weigand. “In the long term, the technical experience that institutions such as this one has accumulated throughout the years is essential to the process of deinstitutionalization in Armenia. We also discussed with the director the need for continuous technical support for mainstream schools in work with children with disabilities. UNICEF already cooperates in this direction with the Republican Psychological- Pedagogical Center.”
During the field trip, Ms Weigand and Mr Tatoyan also visited two centers providing support to vulnerable children and their families, one directly supported by the municipality, and another one supported by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Both centers provide day-care services to children in difficult life circumstances from Syunik and from Nagorno-Karabakh, ranging from mental health and psychological support for children victims of violence, as well as legal and administrative support to families facing extreme poverty or difficult living conditions and specialized services for children with disabilities.
In the center supported by the municipality, some of the needs identified included the need for continuous capacity building for the staff, regular refurbishment of the center and provision of specialized equipment and furniture. UNICEF and HRDO also heard about the challenges related to effectively promoting inclusive education and the related need for additional awareness raising work with parents of children with and without disabilities.
The Child and Family Support Center under the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs is a former boarding institution that was transformed into a community-based day-care center with UNICEF support within the deinstitutionalization reform. In 2021, the center was tasked with functions of a crisis center to provide care for children and families in difficult situations, including from Nagorno-Karabakh. In addition to day-care services, it currently provides shelter to 10 children whom Mr Tatoyan and Ms Weigand met with.
UNICEF and HRDO noted the potential of the center to expand services, including in emergency situations. In 2021, UNICEF supported the refurbishment of three rooms within the centre and will provide additional support in 2022, including capacity building for the staff and further adaptation of the center to the needs of children and their families.
“This joint visit provided an opportunity to assess some of the challenges faced by children and their families in Syunik, who have been affected both by the impact of the pandemic and the conflict,” said Ms Weigand. “Both the pandemic and the conflict have left a negative impact on the mental health of children and caregivers, and the current situation in some of the border areas in Syunik is of concern to all and further exacerbates the wellbeing of children and their access to essential services.”
UNICEF remains committed to support the Government of Armenia in the ongoing reform processes in the fields of child protection and social protection to ensure all children, including the most vulnerable, can access quality services in a timely way. We are looking forward to continue working with all stakeholders, including civil society and diaspora organizations, as well as the private sector to further develop the network of community-based services across Armenia.
UNICEF also looks forward to continuing cooperation with the Human Rights Defender’s Office in Armenia to further develop the child friendly complaint mechanism and raise awareness around and knowledge of child rights in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Title: More than half of parents and pregnant women exposed to aggressive formula milk marketing
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
23 February 2022

GENEVA/NEW YORK, 23 February 2022 – More than half of parents and pregnant women (51 per cent) surveyed for a new WHO/UNICEF report say they have been targeted with marketing from formula milk companies, much of which is in breach of international standards on infant feeding practices.
The report, How marketing of formula milk influences our decisions on infant feeding, draws on interviews with parents, pregnant women and health workers in eight countries. It uncovers systematic and unethical marketing strategies used by the formula milk industry – now worth a staggering US$55 billion – to influence parents’ infant feeding decisions.
The report finds that industry marketing techniques include unregulated and invasive online targeting; sponsored advice networks and helplines; promotions and free gifts; and practices to influence training and recommendations among health workers. The messages that parents and health workers receive are often misleading, scientifically unsubstantiated, and violate the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (the Code) – a landmark public health agreement passed by the World Health Assembly in 1981 to protect mothers from aggressive marketing practices by the baby food industry.
“This report shows very clearly that formula milk marketing remains unacceptably pervasive, misleading and aggressive,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Regulations on exploitative marketing must be urgently adopted and enforced to protect children’s health.”
According to the report – which surveyed 8,500 parents and pregnant women, and 300 health workers in cities across Bangladesh, China, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Viet Nam – exposure to formula milk marketing reaches 84 per cent of all women surveyed in the United Kingdom; 92 per cent of women surveyed in Viet Nam and 97 per cent of women surveyed in China, increasing their likelihood of choosing formula feeding.
“False and misleading messages about formula feeding are a substantial barrier to breastfeeding, which we know is best for babies and mothers,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “We need robust policies, legislation and investments in breastfeeding to ensure that women are protected from unethical marketing practices -- and have access to the information and support they need to raise their families.”
Across all countries included in the survey, women expressed a strong desire to breastfeed exclusively, ranging from 49 per cent of women in Morocco to 98 per cent in Bangladesh. Yet the report details how a sustained flow of misleading marketing messages is reinforcing myths about breastfeeding and breast-milk, and undermining women’s confidence in their ability to breastfeed successfully. These myths include the necessity of formula in the first days after birth, the inadequacy of breast-milk for infant nutrition, that specific infant formula ingredients are proven to improve child development or immunity, the perception that formula keeps infants fuller for longer, and that the quality of breast-milk declines with time.
Breastfeeding within the first hour of birth, followed by exclusive breastfeeding for six months and continued breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond, offers a powerful line of defense against all forms of child malnutrition, including wasting and obesity. Breastfeeding also acts as babies’ first vaccine, protecting them against many common childhood illnesses. It also reduces women’s future risk of diabetes, obesity and some forms of cancer. Yet globally, only 44 per cent of babies less than 6 months old are exclusively breastfed. Global breastfeeding rates have increased very little in the past two decades, while sales of formula milk have more than doubled in roughly the same time.
Alarmingly, the report notes that large numbers of health workers in all countries had been approached by the baby feeding industry to influence their recommendations to new mothers through promotional gifts, free samples, funding for research, paid meetings, events and conferences, and even commissions from sales, directly impacting parents’ feeding choices. More than one third of women surveyed said a health worker had recommended a specific brand of formula to them.
To address these challenges, WHO, UNICEF and partners are calling on governments, health workers, and the baby food industry to end exploitative formula milk marketing and fully implement and abide by the Code requirements. This includes:

Title: The Government of Japan and UNICEF Support Abovyan Community to Reopen the Child Support Center with New Resources and Capacity
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
22 February 2022

YEREVAN, 22 February 2022 – The Ambassador of Japan to Armenia, Mr Fukushima Masanori and UNICEF Representative in Armenia, Christine Weigand visited Abovyan, marking one year of cooperation for the most vulnerable children in Kotayk, Armavir, Ararat, Vayots Dzor and Syunik.
“On behalf of the Government of Japan, it is a great honor and pleasure for me to visit Abovyan city in the framework of the emergency grant aid, which the Government of Japan decided to provide in response to the humanitarian immediate needs in Armenia in February last year. Since provision of the grant aid, several activities have been carried out by UNICEF,” said Mr Fukushima. “We strongly believe that people and children in need in Armenia will overcome all difficulties, and the Government of Japan will remain by Armenia’s side in the path of recovery and further development of the country.”
Mr Fukushima and Ms Weigand visited Abovyan school #8 where UNICEF provided new furniture and materials to open three new classrooms so that additional students, including from Nagorno-Karabakh, can be enrolled. Students who missed classes in the previous academic year due to the pandemic or the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, also received remedial classes in 2021 to close the learning gap. In addition, UNICEF renovated water, hygiene and sanitation facilities at the school to ensure proper access to clean water and sanitation for students and teachers.
Together with Mayor of Abovyan, Mr. Eduard Babayan, Mr Fukushima and Ms Weigand announced the reopening of the community-based child support center in Abovyan that currently provides services to over 200 children and 185 families, including from Nagorno-Karabakh. While the Abovyan municipality covers the maintenance costs and sustainability of the services, UNICEF renovated and refurbished the center, also suppling new materials for more effective work with children in the community. Working hand in hand with the multidisciplinary team of the Center, UNICEF and FAR Children Support Center Foundation provided psychological first aid, mental health and psychosocial support, and gender-based violence case management services to affected children and their families, supporting over 500 families from Nagorno-Karabakh in 2021.
“Emergency situations, be it the conflict or a global pandemic, put the development and wellbeing of children at risk. Through this partnership with the Government of Japan, regional municipalities and the civil society, UNICEF has aimed to ensure continuity of services in five target regions of Armenia for the most vulnerable children,” said Ms Christine Wiegand, UNICEF Representative in Armenia. “Our efforts have been directed to improving or increasing the existing capacities in the community to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable children.”
Mr Fukushima and Ms Weigand also had a meeting with a group of adolescents who in 2021 completed UNICEF’s coursework on 16 basic life-saving skills, supported by community youth workers and a psychologist. From leadership to communication and conflict management, the 16 skills, identified by the coursework, aid transition from adolescence to adulthood, contribute to making productive life choices, understanding of emotional wellbeing and regulation in children. Through this component of the project, implemented in cooperation by Ayb Foundation, UNICEF has reached and trained 500 adolescents in 5 regions of Armenia and supported 110 youth and social workers with capacity building on provision of basic lifesaving skills.
From 2021 to 2022, with the funding of the Government of Japan, UNICEF has worked in Armavir, Kotayk, Ararat, Vayots Dzor and Syunik to provide essential support to children from Nagorno-Karabakh and the host communities. Through the programme, UNICEF has improved the learning environment and WASH facilities at schools, provided psychological first aid and psychosocial services, trained social workers, youth workers and psychologists, support the improvement of conditions in child support centers, as well as provided medical equipment to regional health facilities, enabling child screening, mobile health team visits to remote communities.

Title: Europe and Central Asia reinforces commitment to transform food systems for better nutrition
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
25 January 2022
FAO convenes the Commission every two years to assist with cooperation on agricultural matters and make recommendations for the 50-plus Members of the Europe and Central Asia region. The current session focused on providing healthy and nutritious diets for all, especially the most vulnerable, and on addressing all forms of malnutrition.
Members expressed their will to go beyond the food system as a linear and narrow concept towards a holistic and comprehensive approach that leads to better production, better nutrition, better environment, and a better life by including context-specific synergies and trade-offs. Countries will also monitor and take into account the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security and nutrition and on the livelihoods of those engaged in food production.
With this in mind, to transform the way food is produced, processed, distributed, prepared, and consumed, and to improve nutrition in the region, the Commission recommends strengthened collaboration and cross-sectoral dialogue, the reconciliation of healthy nutrition and sustainability, improved equality and inclusiveness through livelihood and nutrition support to the most vulnerable, and more investments in agrifood systems through better production and value addition.
“Food systems should be diversified for more stability, resilience, and sustainability, and, ultimately, to improve access to diverse and nutritious food,” said Piotr Wlodarczyk, Secretary of the European Commission on Agriculture. “For better production, we should ensure more diversity in the scales of production, crops, marketing channels, financial sources, financial instruments, technologies, value addition, and social processes. The meeting has reconfirmed this approach. The record number of country participants and observers from civil society, non-governmental organizations, and academia also shows its importance.”
The session report encourages Members to create an adequate environment for innovation and to support the development of financial systems in which financial instruments and service providers can proliferate. Backing this, FAO pledged, among other actions, to promote the exchange of knowledge and experience, provide relevant data and analysis, and promote green, nature-based solutions.
The Europe and Central Asia region is highly diverse in terms of development status, natural resources, and structural characteristics; thus, countries face different challenges related to malnutrition and different barriers to the sustainable and inclusive transformation of local food systems and rural areas.
Territorial approaches that recognize environmental, social, and economic differences as determinants of development are important instruments for achieving more inclusive economic, social, and environmental development at the local level while ensuring these are embedded into national, regional, and global processes, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
“Including the principles of territorial approaches in national agendas can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the commitment to leave no one behind,” Wlodarczyk added.
Progress on gender equality
Since 2010, the progress made in mainstreaming gender and social inclusion in FAO's work in the region has been a permanent standing item on the Commission’s agenda. During the current session, FAO presented this work, framed by the Regional Gender Equality Strategy and Action Plan for 2019–2022, and highlighted persistent gender gaps that require further attention and action and limit progress towards achieving the SDGs.
Based on these issues, FAO recommends gender-transformative agricultural policies that address the root causes of inequality and reflect the contributions of rural women to agrifood sector value chains, improve data collection and gender statistics, and further analyse gender gaps in access to agricultural services, inputs, and resources. Additionally, Members and FAO should continue to empower rural women by supporting their participation in decision-making and by creating targeted economic, social, and environmental policies and projects that provide women with diverse and viable income opportunities.

Title: COVID-19 Scale of education loss ‘nearly insurmountable’, warns UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
25 January 2022
“In March, we will mark two years of COVID-19-related disruptions to global education. Quite simply, we are looking at a nearly insurmountable scale of loss to children’s schooling,” said Robert Jenkins, UNICEF Chief of Education. “While the disruptions to learning must end, just reopening schools is not enough. Students need intensive support to recover lost education. Schools must also go beyond places of learning to rebuild children’s mental and physical health, social development and nutrition.”
Children have lost basic numeracy and literacy skills. Globally, disruption to education has meant millions of children have significantly missed out on the academic learning they would have acquired if they had been in the classroom, with younger and more marginalized children facing the greatest loss.
Follow-on consequences of school closures are on the rise. In addition to learning loss, school closures have impacted children’s mental health, reduced their access to a regular source of nutrition, and increased their risk of abuse.

25 January 2022
Mr. Zhora Sargsyan, Head of Labour and Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of the Republic of Armenia, Mr. Kalin Vasilev Anastasov, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Bulgaria in the Republic of Armenia, Ms. Silja Kasmann, Deputy Head of Operations of the EU Delegation to Armenia, as well as the representatives of state authorities, civic society organizations and expert community from participating countries attended the Project launching event.
For Armenia the project aims to support the Government’s efforts in implementation of bilaterally signed agreement on regulation of labour mobility between the Republic of Armenia and Republic of Bulgaria and to contribute to safer and better managed labour mobility from Armenia (as well as from Georgia and Moldova) to Bulgaria. Based on the conducted labour market needs and gaps assessment of Bulgaria, targeted information campaigns on conditions and employment opportunities of Bulgaria, as well as outreach to citizens of Armenia (as well as Georgia and Moldova) are planned to be carried out. The project will empower migrant workers to make informed decisions on the labour migration prospects and manage their expectations on employment opportunities in Bulgaria.
Mr. Kalin Vasilev Anastasov, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Bulgaria in the Republic of Armenia stressed the importance of cooperation between two countries in the area of migration: “I am convinced that the agreement will contribute to the economic and social development of the two countries and will facilitate cultural exchange between our people” – mentioned the Ambassador.
In her speech, Ms. Kasmann, Deputy Head of Operations of the EU Delegation to Armenia, underlined that labour migration should be seen as an opportunity both for the EU member states and Armenia. The idea of the project is to promote circular migration and inform people who work abroad about their rights in order to protect them from criminal networks.
An active discussion between the participants followed and a number of questions, raised by the Armenian authorities and expert community were clarified.
The Project launching event was concluded with the closing remarks of Mr. Radoslav Stamenkov, IOM Bulgaria Head of Office and Ms. Ilona Ter-Minasyan, Head of Office, IOM Armenia.
The project is financed by the National Program of the Republic of Bulgaria supported by Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund 2014-2020, co-funded by the European Union.

Title: UNHCR welcomes support from the People of Japan to conflict-affected families in Armenia

20 January 2022
On 19 January 2022, UNHCR organised a ceremony in Ashtarak, Aragatsotn province, to thank the Embassy of Japan for its support and show the impact of the humanitarian assistance. The ceremony was held at the recently renovated and upgraded Ashtarak Territorial Pedagogical-Psychological Support Centre, serving as a psycho-educational support point and a collective shelter for those displaced by the conflict.
The ceremony was attended by Mr. Masanori Fukushima, H.E. Ambassador of Japan to Armenia and other officials, and was combined with on-site observation of capacity building and community support activities conducted by UNHCR’s partner organization Mission Armenia NGO, conversations with the residents, and the pedagogues and psychologists of the Centre.
“On behalf of the Government of Japan, it is a great honor and pleasure for me to attend today’s closing ceremony. Since last August, I have visited several sites where UNHCR carried out crucial activities, and have seen many important outcomes” said Mr. Fukushima. “We strongly believe that people in need as well as host communities in Armenia will overcome all the challenges. I would also like to emphasize that the Government of Japan will remain together with Armenia, and will continue to support Armenia’s efforts to move forward and achieve longer-term development.”
With the contribution from Japan, UNHCR has been able to provide community support and capacity-building activities for conflict affected families, renovate and provide technical equipment and furniture to 30 educational centres/collective shelters, construct community playgrounds and sports pitches in five provinces, deliver cash assistance to help centre residents meet their basic needs, and help those living in rental apartments with rental subsidies.
In addition, the contribution from Japan supported important protection activities conducted by UNHCR in Armenia, including identification and assessments of needs, provision of legal counselling and psycho-social support, activities promoting self-reliance and livelihoods, as well as resilience projects for women and children, educational and cultural events.
“UNHCR sincerely thanks the people and the government of Japan for their committed support for the displaced families” said Anna-Carin Öst, UNHCR Representative in Armenia during the ceremony. “ The generous contribution of Japan has allowed UNHCR to reach some 32,000 people across the country by delivering timely and crucial support for families and the communities which have warmly welcomed and hosted them.”

Title: Though still low in Europe and Central Asia, hunger rates worsened by pandemic impacts
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
14 December 2021
Undernourishment and severe and moderate food insecurity rates in Europe and Central Asia are, on average, much lower than in the rest of the world.
However, more than 14 million people became moderately or severely food insecure from 2019 to 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Furthermore, with overweight and obesity well above the global prevalence – and on the rise – the region’s 50-plus countries must renew their commitments to ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030, as envisaged by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The latest data and trends are now accessible in the Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition in Europe and Central Asia, produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
In the past two decades, countries in the Europe and Central Asia region have made significant progress in combating undernourishment. Worldwide, the number of people with insufficient food consumption increased from 8.4 percent in 2019 to 9.9 percent in 2020, while in Europe and Central Asia, the regional average remained below 2.5 percent – where it has been for nearly two decades.
However, this figure hides subregional differences: while the number is low in the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and among European countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, small increases have been detected in the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Western Balkans in the past couple of years.
“The pandemic has had a negative effect on food security in the Europe and Central Asia region,” stated FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative Vladimir Rakhmanin in the publication’s foreword. “It is in this light that the report seeks to assess how food security and nutrition indicators in the region, subregion, and countries have changed under the shadow of the pandemic and to monitor the region’s progress towards achieving the SDGs.”
Globally, 2020 was marked by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruptions to markets, trade and food supply chains. In Europe and Central Asia, the number of severely food insecure people grew by 7 million in 2020 to 22 million (or about 2.4 percent of the population), while those experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity (lacking access to safe, nutritious and adequate food) grew by 14 million to 111 million (11.9 percent of the total population). While this is a regional average, the proportions in the Western Balkans, Central Asia and the Caucasus are higher.
“With pandemic policy responses varying greatly according to each country’s level of wealth and political will, national and subregional inequalities in access to food and nutrition are certain to grow,” Rakhmanin said. “This must be dealt with to ensure that the Europe and Central Asia region moves forward in attaining sufficient food and nutrition for all, with a pledge to leave no one behind.”
A closer look at the nutrition indicators
Progress has been made in reducing various forms of malnutrition, including (in most countries of the region) child stunting, child wasting, and low birthweight. However, Europe and Central Asia is in a worse position in terms of exclusive breastfeeding, childhood overweight, and adult obesity. The data and trends are especially alarming for adult obesity in all subregions, and the pandemic might further exacerbate the problem. Despite recent improvements in reducing overweight among children, the region, at 7.1 percent, remains above the world average.
“Even before the pandemic, the situation in the Caucasus and Central Asia was already vulnerable and became even more so in 2020,” said Cheng Fang, an FAO economist and the main author of the report. “The resilience of the whole region depends on the provision of solid effort in these vulnerable subregions. The growing rate of adult obesity, for example, is posing a problem not only in high-income countries, but also in low- and middle-income countries of the region.”
The prevalence of anaemia among women of reproductive age in recent years remained at 17.4 percent, as in 2000, with higher rates in some Caucasus and Central Asian countries at close to or even above the world average of 29.9 percent.
In terms of exclusive breastfeeding, the region – especially the Caucasus subregion and Central Asia – has made significant progress (from 31.1 percent to 41.7 percent from 2012 to 2019), even though the prevalence remains below the global average.
The global data for low birthweight have shown a steady decline since 2000, and the regional trend seems to have followed the same – but slow – pattern, with the regional prevalence (6.9 percent) about half the global level. In the region, neither high-income countries nor lower-income countries have reduced the prevalence of low birthweight substantially.
More details are available in the 2021 regional edition of the FAO flagship report, which, using the latest hunger and malnutrition data, tracks the progress of Europe and Central Asia towards meeting global sustainability targets, with special regard to the Zero Hunger targets of SDG 2.

Title: COVID-19 ‘biggest global crisis for children in our 75-year history’ – UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
10 December 2021
COVID-19 has affected children at an unprecedented scale, making it the worst crisis for children UNICEF has seen in its 75-year history, the United Nations Children’s agency said in a report released today.
The report Preventing a lost decade: Urgent action to reverse the devastating impact of COVID-19 on children and young people highlights the various ways in which COVID-19 is challenging decades of progress on key childhood challenges such as poverty, health, access to education, nutrition, child protection and mental well-being. It warns that, almost two years into the pandemic, the widespread impact of COVID-19 continues to deepen, increasing poverty, entrenching inequality and threatening the rights of children at previously unseen levels.
“Throughout our history, UNICEF has helped to shape healthier and safer environments for children across the globe, with great results for millions,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “These gains are now at risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has been the biggest threat to progress for children in our 75-year history. While the number of children who are hungry, out of school, abused, living in poverty or forced into marriage is going up, the number of children with access to health care, vaccines, sufficient food and essential services is going down. In a year in which we should be looking forward, we are going backward.”
The report says a staggering 100 million additional children are estimated to now be living in multidimensional poverty because of the pandemic, a 10 per cent increase since 2019. This corresponds to approximately 1.8 children every second since mid-March, 2020. Further, the report warns of a long path toward regaining lost ground – even in a best-case scenario, it will take seven to eight years to recover and return to pre-COVID child poverty levels.
Citing further evidence of backsliding, the report says that around 60 million more children are now in monetary poor households compared to prior to the pandemic. In addition, in 2020, over 23 million children missed out on essential vaccines – an increase of nearly 4 million from 2019, and the highest number in 11 years.
Even before the pandemic, around 1 billion children worldwide suffered at least one severe deprivation, without access to education, health, housing, nutrition, sanitation, or water. This number is now rising as the unequal recovery furthers growing divides between wealthy and poor children, with the most marginalized and vulnerable hurt the most. The report notes:
Beyond the pandemic, the report warns of other threats to children that pose extreme threats to their rights. Globally, 426 million children – nearly 1 in 5 – live in conflict zones that are becoming more intense and taking heavier toll on civilians, disproportionately affecting children. Women and girls are at the highest risk of conflict-related sexual violence. Eighty per cent of all humanitarian needs are driven by conflict. Likewise, approximately 1 billion children – nearly half of the world’s children – live in countries that are at an ‘extremely high-risk’ from the impacts of climate change.
To respond, recover and reimagine the future for every child, UNICEF continues to call for:
“In an era of a global pandemic, growing conflicts, and worsening climate change, never has a child-first approach been more critical than today,” said Fore. “We are at a crossroads. As we work with governments, donors and other organizations to begin charting our collective path for the next 75 years, we must keep children first in line for investment and last in line for cuts. The promise of our future is set in the priorities we make in our present.”

Title: Second Regional Migration Governance Conference Gathers Senior Governments Officials and Global Experts to Discuss Issues related to Return and Labour Migration in the Context of Covid-19 pandemic
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
07 December 2021
The conference titled “Second Regional Thematic Conference on Reintegration, Return and Labour Migration in the Context of Covid-19 pandemic” is the second in a series of three regional conferences to be held on topics of regional interest within the migration field. This high level event triggered exchanges on the experiences and lessons learned of governments within the region in responding to the socio-economic impacts and opportunities of return migration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three main thematic areas were investigated: (i) Social and Economic Reintegration into Slowing Economies and Labour Markets; (ii) Leveraging the Return of Skilled Migrants for Economic Development and; (iii) Re-Opening Safe, Regular Labour Migration Channels.
The event took place online and was organized within the framework of the project “Enhancing Migrants’ Rights and Good Governance in Armenia and Georgia (EMERGE)” funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway.
The conference opened with an address by Ilona Ter-Minasyan, Head of Office, IOM Armenia, who outlined the potential of returning migrants to support the better recovery for countries participating in this conference post-COVID-19 pandemic.
“This is part of our efforts to initiate and maintain and energize the migration management-related dialogue amongst the countries in the region…This year we are moving to another set of issues and challenges which are shared across the region and which are particular relevant in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are soon to enter year three of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has completely changed our environment in which we operate and has put additional challenges both to migrants and migration and to entities and the governments who are participating in migration management and facilitating migration management” said IOM Georgia Chief of Mission, Sanja Celebic Lukovac.
The highlight of the event was the keynote speech delivered by Prithwiraj (Raj) Choudhury, the Lumry Family Associate Professor at the Harvard Business School. Mr. Choudhury spoke about the steps of Government to Promote Remote Working Models.
The Professor summarized his presentation by stating: “Work from anywhere and remote work can help regions that have lost talent to brain drain to attract talent. It can happen nationally through digital nomad visa or programmes such as Start-Up Chile, it can happen regionally using incentives such as Tulsa Remote programme.”
The conference report is being finalized and the highlights will be presented at an online event scheduled to take place in January 2022.

Title: Nearly 240 million children with disabilities around the world, UNICEF’s most comprehensive statistical analysis finds
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
03 December 2021
The number of children with disabilities globally is estimated at almost 240 million, according to a new UNICEF report. Children with disabilities are disadvantaged compared to children without disabilities on most measures of child well-being, the report says.
“This new research confirms what we already knew: Children with disabilities face multiple and often compounding challenges in realizing their rights,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “From access to education, to being read to at home; children with disabilities are less likely to be included or heard on almost every measure. All too often, children with disabilities are simply being left behind.”
The report includes internationally comparable data from 42 countries and covers more than 60 indicators of child well-being – from nutrition and health, to access to water and sanitation, protection from violence and exploitation, and education. These indicators are disaggregated by functional difficulty type and severity, child’s sex, economic status, and country. The report makes clear the barriers children with disabilities face to participating fully in their societies and how this often translates to negative health and social outcomes.
Compared with children without disabilities, children with disabilities are:
However, the disability experience varies greatly. The analysis demonstrates that there is a spectrum of risks and outcomes depending on the type of disability, where the child lives, and what services they can access. This highlights the importance of designing targeted solutions to address inequities.
Access to education is one of several subjects examined in the report. Despite widespread agreement on the importance of education, children with disabilities are still falling behind. The report finds children with difficulty communicating and caring for themselves are the most likely to be out of school, regardless of education level. Out-of-school rates are higher among children with multiple disabilities and disparities become even more significant when the severity of the disability is taken into account.
“Inclusive education cannot be considered a luxury. For far too long, children with disabilities have been excluded from society in a way that no child ever should be. My lived experience as a woman with disabilities supports that statement,” says Maria Alexandrova, 20, a UNICEF youth advocate for inclusive education from Bulgaria. “No child, especially the most vulnerable, should have to fight for their basic human rights alone. We need governments, stakeholders and NGOs to ensure children with disabilities have equal, inclusive access to education.”
UNICEF works with partners at global and local levels to help realize the rights of children with disabilities. All children, including those with disabilities, must have a say in the issues that affect their lives, and be provided with the opportunity to realise their potential and claim their rights. UNICEF is calling on governments to:
The analysis seeks to increase the inclusion of the 1 in 10 children and young people with disabilities worldwide by ensuring they are counted, consulted and considered in decision-making.
The new global estimate for the number of children with disabilities is higher than previous estimates, and is based on a more meaningful and inclusive understanding of disabilities, which considers difficulties across several domains of functioning, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression.
“Exclusion is often the consequence of invisibility,” said Fore. “We have not had reliable data on the number of children with disabilities for the longest time. When we fail to count, consider and consult with these children, we are failing to help them reach their vast potential.”

Title: Landmark intergenerational poll shows young people are 50% more likely than older generations to believe the world is becoming a better place – yet impatient for action on mounting crises
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
18 November 2021
Children and young people are nearly 50 per cent more likely than older people to believe that the world is becoming a better place with each generation, according to a new international survey by UNICEF and Gallup released ahead of World Children’s Day.
The survey shows that young people are also more likely to believe childhood itself has improved, with overwhelming majorities believing that healthcare, education, and physical safety are better for today's children than for their parents' generation. Yet, despite their optimism, young people are far from naïve, expressing restlessness for action on climate change, skepticism about information they consume on social media, and struggling with feelings of depression and anxiety. They are far more likely than older people to see themselves as global citizens, and more likely to embrace international cooperation to tackle threats like the COVID-19 pandemic.
“There is no shortage of reasons for pessimism in the world today: Climate change, the pandemic, poverty and inequality, rising distrust, and growing nationalism. But here is a reason for optimism: Children and young people refuse to see the world through the bleak lens of adults,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Compared to older generations, the world’s young people remain hopeful, much more globally minded, and determined to make the world a better place. Today’s young people have concerns for the future but see themselves as part of the solution.”
The poll, The Changing Childhood Project, is the first of its kind to ask multiple generations for their views on the world and what it is like to be a child today. It surveyed more than 21,000 people across two age cohorts (15-24 years old and 40 years old and up) in 21 countries. Nationally representative surveys were undertaken in countries across all regions – Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America – and income levels.
Overall, the data paint a picture of young generations as products of globalization. For example, young people (39 per cent) are on average almost twice as likely as older people (22 per cent) to identify most with being part of the world, versus their own nation or locale. With each additional year of age, people are on average about one per cent less likely to identify as a global citizen.
The survey – conducted during the pandemic – also finds that children and young people are generally more trusting of national governments, scientists and international news media as sources of accurate information. And yet, the poll shows, young people today are aware of problems the world is facing:
The poll also finds young people want faster progress in the fight against discrimination, more cooperation among countries, and for decision-makers to listen to them:
“We cannot know what is on the minds of young people if we do not ask them. UNICEF's survey reinforces the importance of hearing from the next generation and understanding their perspectives,” said Joe Daly, Senior Partner at Gallup. “The children of today are the leaders of tomorrow; it is crucial for older generations to do their part to ensure our children inherit a better world.”
The survey finds some areas of strong alignment between young and older generations – notably around climate, the importance of education, global collaboration and children’s agency. By contrast, optimism, global mindedness and recognition of historical progress reflect some of the deepest divides.
“While this research paints a nuanced view of the generational divide, a clear picture emerges: Children and young people embody the spirit of the 21st century far more readily than their parents,” said Fore. “As UNICEF prepares to mark its 75th anniversary next month, and ahead of World Children’s Day, it is critical we listen to young people directly about their well-being and how their lives are changing.”
World Children’s Day – celebrated every year on 20th November – aims to raise awareness for the millions of children that are denied their right to adequate health care, nutrition, education and protection, and to elevate young people’s voices as critical to any discussions about their future.

Alongside the release of the survey, UNICEF is launching a new interactive platform, www.unicef.org/changing-childhood, containing the full set of data from the survey and the project report.
The Changing Childhood Project is the first survey to ask multiple generations of people across the world for their views on what it’s like to be a child today. For the project, UNICEF partnered with Gallup to survey more than 21,000 adults and children in 21 countries between February and June 2021. All samples are probability-based and nationally representative of two distinct populations in each country: people aged 15-24 and people aged 40 and older. The coverage area is the entire country, including rural areas, and the sampling frame represents the entire civilian, non-institutionalized, population within each age cohort with access to a telephone.
The countries surveyed are: Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cameroon, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Japan, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Spain, United Kingdom, Ukraine, USA and Zimbabwe.

Title: Aurora and UN Armenia to Organize a Christmas Charity Market
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
15 November 2021
The winter season is fast approaching, and the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative and UN Armenia are glad to announce that they will host a Christmas Market to benefit those in need. The event, held in partnership with the Tovmasyan Charity Foundation, will raise funds for Aurora’s programs and the UN projects in Armenia, as well as contribute to the appreciation of charity and promote giving back. All the proceeds will go to support the projects across the globe that help people suffering as a result of wars, atrocity crimes or other major human rights violations.
“The holiday season is a wonderful time of joy and celebration with our friends and family, but I think it’s also a great opportunity to consider giving back to those who have not been so lucky. As you know, Aurora is based on the universal concept of gratitude that everybody can relate to. By expressing this gratitude in action, Aurora showcases an inspirational transition from surviving to thriving and giving back. Attending our Christmas Charity Market gives everyone a chance to do just that – while also having a genuinely good time,” said Nicola Stanisch, Executive Director of the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative.
The event will be held on Sunday, December 12, 2021, from 10 am till 8pm in the Dvin Music Hall (40 Paronyan Street, Yerevan, Armenia). With its jolly atmosphere and a wide range of merchandise, including books, toys, souvenirs, postcards, handmade crafts, jewelry, etc., as well as festive snacks and drinks, the Christmas Market will be a really special experience for the whole family. Admission to the event is free for all, and the gathering will be organized in strict compliance with local COVID-19 restrictions, including respiratory hygiene and social distancing.
“Winter holiday markets are a cherished tradition across many countries and cultures, and they are also a great way to raise funds for those most in need. We are delighted to be organizing this event with the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative as there are still so many communities across the globe and in Armenia that are at risk of being left behind. It is our collective responsibility to continue caring and supporting as long need remains and help build a path towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals for all. I hope that this joint initiative will also become a tradition, and we will be able to support even more people together,” said Shombi Sharp, UN Resident Coordinator in Armenia.
The business community of Armenia, embassies, representatives of foreign countries, and international organizations in Armenia, as well as other partners and organizers are invited to set up tables and sell a selection of national products (e.g. food & beverages, souvenirs, books, Christmas ornaments and decor, etc. sold at a discount price). If you’re interested in being one of the sellers and booking a stall at the Market, please contact us at info@auroraprize.com by November 23, 2021.

Title: UNHCR urges governments to accelerate progress and resolve plight of world’s stateless
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
04 November 2021
“Significant progress has been made over the past few years, but governments must do more to close the legal and policy gaps that continue to leave millions of people stateless or allow children to be born into statelessness,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi.
Statelessness, or the situation of not being recognized as a citizen by any country, affects millions of people around the world. Stateless people cannot often access the most basic of rights, including being able to go to school, work legally, access health services, marry, or register the birth of a child.
Since UNHCR launched its #IBelong campaign in 2014 to raise attention and advocate for an end to global statelessness, more than 400,000 stateless people in 27 countries have acquired nationality, while tens of thousands of people across Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas now have a pathway to citizenship as a result of newly enacted legislative changes.
Over the past seven years, 29 states have acceded to the Statelessness Conventions, signalling strengthened political will to end statelessness.
“We are encouraged by this global momentum to tackle statelessness, which with concerted efforts by States, we can eradicate. But unless progress accelerates, the millions who remain deprived of a nationality will be stuck in a human rights limbo, unable to access the most basic rights,” said Grandi.
Statelessness has many causes which are typically the result of gaps or flaws in nationality laws, and how they are implemented. Discrimination - including on the basis of ethnicity, religion and gender - is a major driver of statelessness.
Because they are not recognized as citizens, stateless people are often deprived of legal rights or basic services. This leaves them politically and economically marginalized and vulnerable to discrimination, exploitation, and abuse. They may also not be able to access COVID-19 testing, treatment or vaccination, and may have little access to support or protection in the face of climate risks.
Governments hold power to enact legal and policy reforms that can help stateless people on their territory acquire citizenship or prevent statelessness from occurring in the first place, sometimes with the stroke of a pen, or a relatively simple legal change. It remains an easily avoidable and solvable issue.
UNHCR’s decade long #IBelong campaign calls on states to end statelessness by 2024.
Worldwide, UNHCR’s statistical reporting counts 4.2 million stateless people in some 94 countries. Given that most countries do not collect any data on statelessness, the actual figure is believed to be substantially higher.
To date, 96 States are party to the 1954 UN Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons, and 77 are party to the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

Title: Armenia Tobacco Control Investment Case
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
01 November 2021
“Tobacco-related illnesses cost the Armenian economy AMD 273.1 billion every year, equivalent to 4.2% of GDP each year. They are also responsible for approximately 5,500 deaths in Armenia annually,” says the new report jointly developed by the RA Ministry of Health, UNDP, the Secretariat of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and WHO, and funded by the Government of the United Kingdom.
On 1 November 2021, the report was officially launched in Armenia with participation of Shombi Sharp, UN Resident Coordinator in Armenia, Anahit Avanesyan, RA Minister of Health, John Gallagher, UK Ambassador to Armenia, Natia Natsvlishvili, UNDP Resident Representative in Armenia, Dr. Adriana Blanco Marquizo, Head of the Secretariat of the WHO FCTC, and Oleg Storozhenko, WHO Special Representative, Country Office in Armenia.
The FCTC Investment Case finds that tobacco use undermines economic growth in Armenia and impedes the country’s efforts to increase efficiency in the health and economic sector.
“Our modelling shows that effective tobacco control in Armenia will not only save thousands of precious lives, but also significantly increase overall economic growth, leading to higher tax revenues that can be invested in better health and education. We therefore congratulate the National Assembly of Armenia for winning the 2021 UN Award for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases following the new 2020 Law on the Reduction and Prevention of the Damage Caused by the Use of Tobacco. And now in the time of pandemic, with tobacco use one of the most devastating underlying factors of COVID-19 mortality, it is more important than ever!” said Shombi Sharp, UN Resident Coordinator in Armenia.
“In Armenia, over a quarter of the population (28 percent) aged 18 to 69 currently use some form of tobacco. Tobacco control is one of the priority areas for the Ministry of Health of Armenia and we highly appreciate the support of the international partners in this field. Armenia Tobacco Control Investment Case analyzed the health and economic costs of tobacco use, as well as the potential benefits of strengthening tobacco control in Armenia. The investment program is a tool for the ministries in there initiatives towards prevention and fighting against adverse effects of tobacco products and tobacco substitutes,” said Anahit Avanesyan, RA Minister of Health.
“The United Kingdom is pleased to support this important project to assist the Government of Armenia in implementing tobacco control measures. The COVID-19 pandemic makes Armenia’s commitment to smoke-free indoor spaces more important than ever. I am confident that the Government of Armenia will make the most of the FCTC 2030 project as part of its active efforts to protect and promote public health and sustainable development for the Armenian people,” said John Gallagher, UK Ambassador to Armenia.
“UNDP is a proud partner in the FCTC 2030 project. As an organization dedicated to sustainable development, we are committed to tobacco control because we recognize its critical role in protecting health and socio-economic well-being. The effects of the tobacco epidemic extend across the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as it exacerbates inequalities, deepens poverty and slows economic growth,” said Natia Natsvlishvili, UNDP Resident Representative in Armenia.
Implementing the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control represents one of the most cost-effective means for improving people’s lives and advancing sustainable development.
“Under the FCTC 2030 project, we are supporting Armenia to implement priority tobacco control activities, including a new national tobacco control strategy, the promotion of effective multisectoral coordination, compliance building for the new tobacco control law, and the introduction of plain packaging for tobacco products. I urge Armenia to consider implementing a policy of higher taxation on all tobacco products,” said Dr. Adriana Blanco Marquizo, Head of the Secretariat of the WHO FCTC.
“FCTC Investment case analysis will generate strong evidence on magnitude of direct and indirect health and economic burden of tobacco in the country, and hopefully will contribute for stronger tobacco control measures that will protect the Armenian population from tobacco-related harm,” said Oleg Storozhenko, WHO Special Representative, Country Office in Armenia.
Tobacco use is associated with more severe COVID-19 disease. Addressing tobacco and COVID-19 together can reduce the health and economic burdens of both.
Investing now in seven proven tobacco control measures that reduce smoking prevalence and exposure to tobacco smoke can significantly reduce the major burden of tobacco in Armenia.
The economic benefits of strengthening tobacco control in Armenia outweigh the costs of implementation (AMD 889.1 billion economic benefits over 15 years, compared to AMD 10.4 billion invested). All seven tobacco control measures modeled have positive returns on investment.
Investing in these seven tobacco control measures over 15 years can avert AMD 246.4 billion in healthcare expenditures, with 13% accruing to the Government, 84% to individual citizens who would have made out-of-pocket payments, and the remaining 3% to private insurance and other sources of healthcare expenditures.
Increasing tobacco taxes in Armenia would reduce the affordability of tobacco products, decrease consumption, reduce the burden of tobacco-related diseases, and increase revenue. Additionally, the total economic benefit resulting from reduced tobacco consumption over the next 15 years is equivalent to 4.1 percent of annual GDP of Armenia.
Annually, more than 5,500 deaths result from tobacco-related illness, accounting for nearly 20% of all deaths in the country. These deaths include about 2,255 deaths from ischemic heart disease, 906 deaths from lung cancer, and more than 500 deaths each from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lower respiratory infections.
More than half (52%) of tobacco-related deaths are premature, meaning they occur among individuals younger than 70. Nearly one-fifth (19%) of tobacco-related deaths are due to exposure to secondhand smoke.
The economic losses from tobacco nearly reached the forecasted economic contraction in Armenia due to COVID-19 (4.5% in 2020[1]) – every year.
Of the total burden (AMD 273.1 billion) due to tobacco, 28% attributes to healthcare expenditures (AMD 75.8 billion), while 72% (AMD 197.3 billion) to lost productivity from people exiting the workforce prematurely due to death or disability and taking smoke breaks at work.
Investing in seven tobacco control measures over 15 years would prevent more than 23,000 deaths and reduce premature mortality (under 70) by one-third of non-communicable diseases.
Fully scaling the seven tobacco control measure would prevent more than 23,200 deaths and avert AMD 889.1 billion in healthcare cost and economic losses by 2034.
For every Armenian dram invested in seven tobacco-control measures, Armenia would receive AMD 38 in averted costs and economic losses by 2024 and AMD 86 by 2034. Increasing cigarette taxes and banning tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship are projected to produce the greatest returns by 2034.

29 October 2021
Heads of phytosanitary services of the CIS member states, representatives of the CIS Executive Committee, the Eurasian Economic Union, the Federal Customs Service and the Plant Quarantine Research Center of the Russian Federation, as well as representatives from FAO took part in the two-day session.
During the recent years, to ensure food security in many countries of the world, including Armenia, agriculture has been in the focus of special attention, and in that regard, phytosanitary control is the most important tool to ensure plant safety and agricultural development. To this end, participants presented phytosanitary policies pursued by their countries, including quarantine-phytosanitary conditions, infected areas, existing harmful organisms, prevalence, and control measures.
Welcoming the guests, Georgy Avetisyan, the head of the Food Safety Inspection Body of Armenia presented the tasks to be implemented related to phytosanitary control in Armenia.
"Phytosanitary is the main guarantee to prevent the entry of quarantine organisms into the country, to detect, isolate and destroy them, and, of course, to get a healthy, rich harvest. Every year in the world, plant pests increase, new species appear. Our country is no exception, so I think that in all areas of food safety, including phytosanitary, we should be guided by scientific principles of risk assessment," said Avetisyan.
Piotr Wlodarczyk, FAO Agriculture Specialist introduced international examples in the field of phytosanitary as well as the plant pests control measures.
During the two-day event, the possibilities of simplifying the import and export procedures of plant products to/from CIS countries, associated problems and their possible solutions, as well as the best experience of cooperation were covered.

Title: At least 200 million schoolchildren live in countries that remain unprepared to deploy remote learning in future emergency school closures – UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
28 October 2021
At least 200 million schoolchildren live in 31 low- and middle-income countries that remain unprepared to deploy remote learning in future emergency school closures, according to a new UNICEF report released today. Among that group of students, 102 million live in 14 countries that have kept their schools fully or partially closed for at least half of the COVID-19 pandemic – locking many schoolchildren out of any kind of education.
The Remote Learning Readiness Index measures countries’ readiness to deliver remote learning in response to disruptions of in-person education, covering almost 90 per cent of students in low- and lower-middle-income countries. The analysis focuses on three domains: the availability of home-based assets and parents’ education levels; deployment of policies and training for teachers; and the education sector’s preparedness for emergencies.
“Even in the midst of an ongoing emergency, we know there will be another one, but we aren’t making enough progress to ensure the next time students are forced out of the classroom, they have better options,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “While disruptive, the past 19 months have given us a glimpse of what is possible during and after the pandemic. Together with partners, we have been hard at work to leverage the power of technology and to provide learning opportunities for children and young people everywhere.”
Benin, Burundi, Cote d’Ivoire, Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi, Niger and Togo are among the countries with the most significant need for improvement within the education sector. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of lack of remote learning readiness was especially felt by students living in countries where schools were fully or partially closed for at least half of the past 19 months, such as Congo and Madagascar.
The report outlines the limitations of remote learning and inequalities of access, warning that the situation is likely far worse than the available data shows. Beyond the countries assessed, anecdotal and qualitative data reveals that learners have faced challenges with remote learning globally, including in higher-middle and high-income countries.
Other key findings from the report include:
Encouragingly, many countries with relatively low gross national income scored above-average on the index, indicating the possibility for international cooperation and exchange of best practices.
There is no replacement for in-person learning, the report says. Yet, resilient schools with robust remote learning systems, especially digital learning, can provide a degree of education during school closures in times of emergencies. Moreover, once schools reopen, these systems can support students to catch up on their lost learning.
Through the Reimagine Education initiative, UNICEF is working with public and private partners to give children and young people equal access to quality digital learning, with the goal of reaching some 3.5 billion with world-class digital learning solutions by 2030. One of the ways UNICEF is working towards these goals is through the Learning Passport, a global learning platform developed in partnership with Microsoft, supporting 1.6 million learners during school closures. In addition, Reimagine Education is also bolstered by Giga – a UNICEF and ITU global initiative to connect every school and its surrounding community to the internet. As of this week, Giga has mapped 1 million schools in 41 countries and connected over 3,000 schools across four continents, benefiting 700,000 learners.

Title: Climate crisis driving hunger warns WFP on World Food Day
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
15 October 2021
“The climate crisis has the potential to overwhelm humanity. The world is not prepared for the unprecedented rise in hunger we will see if we do not invest in programs that help vulnerable communities adapt and build resilience to our changing climate,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “The climate crisis is fuelling a food crisis.”
Vulnerable communities, a vast majority of whom rely on agriculture, fishing, and livestock, who contribute the least to the climate crisis bear the brunt of the impacts with limited means to cushion the blow.
Armenia’s climate is changing in line with global trends and over the recent decades, it lost over USD 1.5 billion due to natural hazards like floods, earthquakes, drought, hail, spring frosts, and mudflows. The intense shocks create enormous challenges to national development and pose negative impacts on the livelihoods of people and the economy.
Recent Climate projections indicate that temperatures across the country may rise by 4.7ºC by 2100, combined with an 8.3% decline in average annual precipitation affecting natural systems, water resources, agriculture and food security, health, infrastructure, etc.
Recognizing the implications of climate change on various sectors and food security, the Government of the Republic of Armenia is taking actions to support climate change adaptation, while increasing emphasis on Climate Change related policies and programs.
“Climate change is not a shock waiting to happen – it’s here and happening now. Climate change affects the food systems including production, processing, and distribution. This leads to a decline in food availability pushing more people into food insecurity. We need to invest in food systems that are resilient to climate change, shocks, and crises,” said Jelena Milesovic, WFP Representative and Country Director in Armenia.
Building on this year’s theme for World Food Day, “Our actions are our future- Better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life,” WFP is calling on world leaders to recognise the close link between hunger and the climate crisis and is urging them to redouble their efforts to address the changing climate as focus shifts to the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26).

Title: In Europe and Central Asia, FAO works for countries to better understand damages and losses from disasters
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
13 October 2021
Her intervention was part of an FAO virtual event to commemorate the 2021 International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction, held on 13 October, by highlighting FAO’s work on disaster risk reduction (DRR) and the international cooperation for disaster risk reduction in agrifood systems.
In Europe and Central Asia, the risk of disasters spreads unevenly and with a severity ranging from very low to high. It is estimated that three percent of potential agriculture production in Central Asia and Eastern and Southern Europe is lost to disasters.
“The main obstacle to understanding the scope of the problem is the lack of a common methodology for assessing and reporting damages and losses that would enable us to monitor, assess, and compare data,” Daniela Mangione added.
To tackle this, FAO has been promoting its widely accepted methodology among the countries of the region since 2019. So far, 17 countries have benefited from trainings, workshops, and other activities, including three countries (Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan) that are in the pilot phase of implementing the damage and loss assessment methodology.
The most important part of the process is for national institutional partners to define and agree upon the clear objectives and design of an action plan for their achievement. No blueprint approach exists on adopting and using the FAO methodology, because the plans have to reflect and be adapted to the reality and expectations of each country.
Mangione mentioned a few recurring challenges and obstacles observed in the region, such as the absence of relevant national legislation. In some countries methodologies already exist, but are not harmonized nor sector-specific, neither were they developed to generate data (at different administrative levels down to individual farmers).
“Therefore, proper legislative and policy framework, well-maintained databases, funds, the involvement of all relevant public actors, and, most of all, a strong governmental commitment are needed to successfully adopt and scale up the damages and losses assessment methodology in Europe and Central Asia,” Mangione concluded.

6 October, Yerevan, Armenia – Today members of the UN country team in Armenia, headed by the UN Resident Coordinator in Armenia, Shombi Sharp, met with the RA Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ararat Mirzoyan, and his team. Deputy Minister Vahe Gevorgyan and other representatives of the Ministry also participated in the meeting.
The introductory meeting provided an opportunity to present UN agencies’ programmes in Armenia to Minister Mirzoyan while highlighting the strategic partnership ahead outlined by the new five-year UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2021-2025 (UNSDCF) and anticipated $ 230 million in development spending. The extensive results of joint efforts to address the humanitarian and socio-economic impact of overlapping challenges caused by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and COVID-19 were also recognized.
Mr. Sharp thanked Minister Mirzoyan for the continuous cooperation and highlighted the importance of achieving the eight UNSDCF outcomes together for the prosperous future of Armenia. He welcomed the Government’s decision to soon launch the SDG Council as a milestone towards UNSDCF implementation and underlined the importance as well of the Armenian Government’s role in global UN structures.
“We believe that together with Government, the international community, civil society and other partners, we can make major contributions to helping Armenia not only recover from crisis, but also build back better through the new Cooperation Framework. It is all about full achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030 in line with the national development priorities,” said Mr. Sharp.
The FM highly valued the UN in Armenia’s cooperation during these challenging times. He expressed appreciation especially for the assistance provided in response to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, support to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the efforts aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the country. Minister Mirzoyan stressed the importance to further strengthen the partnership focusing on development programmes in line with the country’s national development priorities.
The meeting reaffirmed the deep commitment towards working together to support Armenia and the people in Armenia through jointly addressing current challenges and leaving no one behind.

Title: Young children’s diets show no improvement in last decade, ‘could get much worse’ under COVID-19
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
23 September 2021
Children under the age of 2 are not getting the food or nutrients they need to thrive and grow well, leading to irreversible developmental harm, according to a new report released by UNICEF today.
Fed to Fail? The crisis of children’s diets in early life – released ahead of the UN Food Systems Summit this week – warns that rising poverty, inequality, conflict, climate-related disasters, and health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are contributing to an ongoing nutrition crisis among the world’s youngest that has shown little sign of improvement in the last ten years.
“The report’s findings are clear: When the stakes are highest, millions of young children are being fed to fail,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Poor nutritional intake in the first two years of life can irreversibly harm children’s rapidly growing bodies and brains, impacting their schooling, job prospects and futures. While we have known this for years, there has been little progress on providing the right kind of nutritious and safe foods for the young. In fact, the ongoing COVID-19 disruptions could make the situation much worse.”
In an analysis of 91 countries, the report finds that only half of children aged 6-23 months are being fed the minimum recommended number of meals a day, while just a third consume the minimum number of food groups they need to thrive. Further analysis of 50 countries with available trend data reveals these poor feeding patterns have persisted throughout the last decade.
As COVID-19 continues to disrupt essential services and drives more families into poverty, the report finds that the pandemic is affecting how families feed their children. For example, a survey conducted among urban households in Jakarta found that half of families have been forced to reduce nutritious food purchases. As a result, the percentage of children consuming the minimum recommended number of food groups fell by a third in 2020, compared to 2018.
Children carry the scars of poor diets and feeding practices for life. An insufficient intake of nutrients found in vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish and meat needed to support growth at an early age puts children at risk of poor brain development, weak learning, low immunity, increased infections and, potentially, death.
Children under the age of two are most vulnerable to all forms of malnutrition – stunting, wasting, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight and obesity – as a result of poor diets, due to their greater need for essential nutrients per kilogram of body weight than at any other time in life.
Globally, UNICEF estimates that more than half of children under the age of 5 with wasting – around 23 million children – are younger than 2 years of age, while the prevalence of stunting increases rapidly between 6 months and two years, as children’s diets fail to keep pace with their growing nutritional needs.
According to the report, children aged 6-23 months living in rural areas or from poorer households are significantly more likely to be fed poor diets compared to their urban or wealthier peers. In 2020, for example, the proportion of children fed the minimum number of recommended food groups was twice as high in urban areas (39 per cent) than in rural areas (23 per cent).
To deliver nutritious, safe, and affordable diets to every child, the report calls for governments, donors, civil society organizations and development actors to work hand-in-hand to transform food, health and social protection systems by leading key actions, including:

22 September 2021
WFP and SIFI piloted an innovative approach to promote a nutritional and economically sustainable school feeding programme by expanding community’s financial participation in school feeding activities in Armenia.
In Arpi Community, WFP and SIFI are investing in local businesses to ensure their profitability and contribute to the sustainability of the School Feeding Programme.
“One of the most essential components in upbringing and health of our children is balanced nutrition. I am happy to witness the development of the School Feeding Programme in Armenia, and the results of the project which has been implemented by the UN World Food Programme, with financial contribution by the Russian Federation and expertise of Russian colleagues”, – Ruslan Kandaurov, General Consul of the Russian Federation in Gyumri.
Within the scope of the project, greenhouses were established in two schools and solar panels were installed in five schools allowing them to save and gain an additional source of income to support school feeding. Moreover, the investments targets four milk processing plants and poultry farms with new equipment to mechanise their production processes and provides solar panels to reduce the energy costs of the businesses.
“It is essential to set up a mechanism where the project assets themselves continue to generate income which over the next 25 years can be invested in the needs of the community. Moreover, WFP is commited to implement projects that do not have negative environmental impacts”, said Nanna Skau, WFP Deputy Country Director.
Within the project, the “Arpi Community Development and Investment” Fund has been formally established to ensure total community ownership of the programme. WFP together with SIFI, provide guidance and technical support to the foundation that will be later responsible for maintaining the sustainability of the school feeding programme in the community.

Title: UNICEF and Ambassador of the Kingdom of Belgium discuss COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in Armenia

15 September 2021
UNICEF hosted the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Belgium in the Russian Federation, H.E. Mr. Marc Michielsen today who met with Ms. Silvia Mestroni, Acting UNICEF Representative in Armenia, followed by a visit to a local polyclinic in Yerevan where the Ambassador observed the COVID-19 vaccination process.
Earlier on 5 September, UNICEF delivered the first 187,200 doses of the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine to Armenia from a pledge of 4 million doses to be donated to COVAX by The Belgian Development Cooperation. This donation by Belgium means that more people will be able to access vaccines now, at a time when variants are a major threat to global health.
“I am very glad that the first doses donated by Belgium have arrived in Armenia. International cooperation is the only way to beat this pandemic. Belgium considers COVAX the best mechanism to ensure international solidarity on vaccines. It is our preferred route for vaccine sharing with third countries. Before the end of this year Belgium will share 4 million doses via COVAX, because no one is safe, until everyone is safe.  Belgium plays a crucial role in the production and distribution of hundreds of millions of Covid-19 vaccines thanks to our leading role in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. This ecosystem of large and small, local and international companies proved to be very agile during the Covid-19 crisis and makes us a true vaccine powerhouse,” said Mr. Marc Michielsen, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Belgium in the Russian Federation.
Armenia launched the national COVID-19 vaccination process in April 2021, after UNICEF delivered the first ever doses (24,000) of COVID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca) through COVAX to Armenia at the close of the World Immunization Week on 28 March. Since then, UNICEF has delivered the second shipment of 50,400 COVID-19 vaccine doses, 70,400 doses in total, to Armenia through COVAX. To date, 303,325 doses have already been administered in Armenia free of charge to local and foreign citizens.
“As a key COVAX partner, UNICEF is leading the procurement and delivery of vaccines and immunisation supplies to 92 countries, including Armenia, building on our experience as the world’s largest single buyer of vaccines in the world,” noted Ms Silvia Mestroni, Acting UNICEF Representative in Armenia. “We need to work together to end the pandemic. In this race against time, it is critical that as many safe and effective vaccines as possible are available to as many people as possible as quickly as possible.”
Ensuring equitable and fair access to safe and affordable COVID-19 vaccines for all low- and middle-income countries, priority groups, and vulnerable populations in 2021 is the priority goal for UNICEF. In Armenia, UNICEF works with the Ministry of Health to strengthen the cold chain, train health workers in the quality provision and continuation of health services for children and caregivers, build trust in vaccines and address misinformation and other barriers.

Title: The 1961 Statelessness Convention: 60 years of promoting and protecting the right to a nationality
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
31 August 2021
“New global challenges, such as COVID-19 and the effects of climate change, on top of persistent ones like rising forced displacement, showcase just how critical the right to a nationality is. Everyone needs to be counted and be visible in the eyes of their country and government, and included into responses,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
“Having a nationality – and the protection of a government that nationality affords – can make a life-saving difference, even more so in times of crisis, whether it’s vaccination, evacuation or providing a social safety net that is needed,” Grandi added.
Stateless people can fall between the cracks in conflict and displacement situations because they lack the protection of any government, they don’t have proof of their legal identity, or both. They also risk being excluded from accessing COVID-19 vaccinations as countries implement plans to tackle the pandemic. Similarly, stateless communities are unlikely to be included in socio-economic relief packages intended to lessen the pandemic’s impact on people’s livelihoods. Moreover, as climate change worsens, stateless people risk being excluded from government efforts to mitigate the effects of extreme weather events.
More broadly, being stateless can mean having no access to education, medical care or legal employment. Statelessness can hinder freedom of movement, the ability to buy property, vote, open a bank account or even to get married. Globally, 4.2 million people are known to be stateless. However, the true number of persons not recognized as citizens by any country is likely to be much higher, given gaps in data collection.
The 1961 Convention is the key international treaty designed to prevent and reduce statelessness. If applied by all States, it would help to ensure that no child is born without a nationality – ultimately supporting the eradication of statelessness over time.
As of the end of August 2021, 77 States have joined the 1961 Convention, with accessions accelerating in the last decade. Since 2010, 40 States have formalized their commitment to reduce statelessness by becoming parties, most recently Iceland and Togo.
In the same period, more than 800,000 stateless people are known to have had their nationality confirmed and statelessness resolved.
“In this anniversary year, UNHCR is urging all States that have not already done so to join the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, to incorporate the safeguards of the Convention into their nationality laws, and to guarantee every person’s right to a nationality,” Grandi said.
Accession to the 1961 Convention is one of the 10 actions of the Global Action Plan to End Statelessness. The Plan provides a framework for States to achieve the goals of the #IBelong Campaign, which was launched by UNHCR and partners in 2014 to end statelessness within 10 years.

Title: First day of school 'indefinitely postponed' for 140 million first-time students around the world – UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
24 August 2021
At least eight million of these young learners have been waiting for over a year.
NEW YORK, 24 August 2021 – A child's first day of school—a landmark moment for the youngest students and their parents around the world—has been delayed due to COVID-19 for an estimated 140 million young minds, UNICEF said in a new analysis released as summer break comes to end in many parts of the world.
For an estimated eight million of these students, the wait for their first day of in-person learning has been over a year and counting, as they live in places where schools have been closed throughout the pandemic.
"The first day of school is a landmark moment in a child's life—setting them off on a life-changing path of personal learning and growth. Most of us can remember countless minor details—what clothes we wore, our teacher's name, who we sat next to. But for millions of children, that important day has been indefinitely postponed," said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. "As classes resume in many parts of the world, millions of first graders have been waiting to see the inside of a classroom for over a year. Millions more may not see one at all this school term. For the most vulnerable, their risk of never stepping into a classroom in their lifetime is skyrocketing."
The first grade sets up the building blocks for all future learning, with introductions to reading, writing, and math. It's also a period when in-person learning helps children gain independence, adapt to new routines, and develop meaningful relationships with teachers and students. In-person learning also enables teachers to identify and address learning delays, mental health issues, and abuse that could negatively affect children’s well-being.
In 2020, schools globally were fully closed for an average of 79 teaching days. However, for 168 million students, after the pandemic began, schools were shuttered for nearly the entire year. Even now, many children are facing an unprecedented second year of disruption to their education. The associated consequences of school closures – learning loss, mental distress, missed vaccinations, and heightened risk of drop out, child labour, and child marriage – will be felt by many children, especially the youngest learners in critical development stages.
While countries worldwide are taking some actions to provide remote learning, at least 29 per cent of primary students are not being reached. In addition to lack of assets for remote learning, the youngest children may not be able to participate due to a lack of support using the technology, a poor learning environment, pressure to do household chores, or being forced to work.
Studies have shown that positive school experiences during this transition period are a predictor of children’s future social, emotional and educational outcomes. At the same time, children who fall behind in learning during the early years often stay behind for the remaining time they spend in school, and the gap widens over the years. The number of years of education a child receives also directly affects their future earnings.
Unless mitigation measures are implemented, the World Bank estimates a loss of $10 trillion in earnings over time for this entire generation of students. Existing evidence shows the cost of addressing learning gaps are lower and more effective when they are tackled earlier, and that investments in education support economic recovery, growth and prosperity.
UNICEF urges governments to reopen schools for in-person learning as soon as possible, and to provide a comprehensive recovery response for students. Together with the World Bank and UNESCO, UNICEF is calling for governments to focus on three key priorities for recovery in schools:
"Your first day of school is a day of hope and possibility—a day for getting off to a good start. But not all children are getting off to a good start. Some children are not even starting at all," said Fore." We must reopen schools for in-person learning as soon as possible, and we must immediately address the gaps in learning this pandemic has already created. Unless we do, some children may never catch up."
In the following weeks, UNICEF will continue to mobilize its partners and the public to prevent this education crisis from becoming an education catastrophe. Online and offline campaigns will rally world leaders, teachers, and parents around a common cause: reopen schools for in-person learning as soon as possible. The future of the world’s most vulnerable children is at stake.

Title: One billion children at ‘extremely high risk’ of the impacts of the climate crisis – UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
20 August 2021
‘The Climate Crisis Is a Child Rights Crisis: Introducing the Children’s Climate Risk Index’ is the first comprehensive analysis of climate risk from a child’s perspective. It ranks countries based on children’s exposure to climate and environmental shocks, such as cyclones and heatwaves, as well as their vulnerability to those shocks, based on their access to essential services.
Launched in collaboration with Fridays for Future on the third anniversary of the youth-led global climate strike movement, the report finds approximately 1 billion children – nearly half the world's 2.2 billion children – live in one of the 33 countries classified as “extremely high-risk”. These children face a deadly combination of exposure to multiple climate and environmental shocks with a high vulnerability due to inadequate essential services, such as water and sanitation, healthcare and education. The findings reflect the number of children impacted today – figures likely to get worse as the impacts of climate change accelerate.
“For the first time, we have a complete picture of where and how children are vulnerable to climate change, and that picture is almost unimaginably dire. Climate and environmental shocks are undermining the complete spectrum of children’s rights, from access to clean air, food and safe water; to education, housing, freedom from exploitation, and even their right to survive. Virtually no child’s life will be unaffected,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “For three years, children have raised their voices around the world to demand action. UNICEF supports their calls for change with an unarguable message – the climate crisis is a child’s rights crisis.”
The Children’s Climate Risk Index (CCRI) reveals:
While nearly every child around the world is at risk from at least one of these climate and environmental hazards, the data reveal the worst affected countries face multiple and often overlapping shocks that threaten to erode development progress and deepen child deprivations.
An estimated 850 million children – 1 in 3 worldwide – live in areas where at least four of these climate and environmental shocks overlap. As many as 330 million children – 1 in 7 worldwide – live in areas affected by at least five major shocks.
The report also reveals a disconnect between where greenhouse gas emissions are generated, and where children are enduring the most significant climate-driven impacts. The 33 ‘extremely high-risk’ countries collectively emit just 9 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Conversely, the 10 highest emitting countries collectively account for nearly 70 per cent of global emissions. Only one of these countries is ranked as ‘extremely high-risk’ in the index.
“Climate change is deeply inequitable. While no child is responsible for rising global temperatures, they will pay the highest costs. The children from countries least responsible will suffer most of all,” said Fore. “But there is still time to act. Improving children’s access to essential services, such as water and sanitation, health, and education, can significantly increase their ability to survive these climate hazards. UNICEF urges governments and businesses to listen to children and prioritise actions that protect them from impacts, while accelerating work to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
Without the urgent action required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, children will continue to suffer the most. Compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes and diseases, among other factors.
"Movements of young climate activists will continue to rise, continue to grow and continue to fight for what is right because we have no other choice," said Farzana Faruk Jhumu (Bangladesh), Eric Njuguna (Kenya), Adriana Calderón (Mexico) and Greta Thunberg (Sweden) from Fridays for Future, who authored the report's foreword and are joining in support of the launch. "We must acknowledge where we stand, treat climate change like the crisis it is, and act with the urgency required to ensure today’s children inherit a liveable planet."

Title: 1 in 3 countries are not taking action to help students catch up on their learning post-COVID-19 school closures
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
19 July 2021
Paris/New York/Washington D.C., 17 July 2021 – Around one in three countries where schools are or have been closed are not yet implementing remedial programmes post-COVID-19 school closures, according to a UNESCO, UNICEF, World Bank and OECD global "Survey on National Education Responses to COVID-19 School Closures". At the same time, only one-third of countries are taking steps to measure learning losses in primary and lower secondary levels – mostly among high-income countries.
"Measuring learning loss is a critical first step towards mitigating its consequences. It is vital that countries invest in assessing the magnitude of such losses to implement the appropriate remedial measures," said Silvia Montoya, Director, UNESCO Institute for Statistics.
Fewer than a third of low- and middle-income countries reported that all students had returned to in-person schooling, heightening their risk of learning loss and drop-out. However, the majority of countries reported using at least one form of outreach to encourage students' return to school, including community engagement, school-based tracking, modification to water, sanitation and hygiene services, financial incentives and review of access policies.
"Remedial instruction is vital to help those children who have missed out on school to get back on track and reduce long-term learning losses. This requires an urgent effort to measure students' learning levels today and collect good quality data to inform classroom practices, as envisioned under the UNICEF, UNESCO, and World Bank's Learning Data Compact," stressed Jaime Saavedra, Global Director for Education, World Bank.
The survey documents how countries are monitoring and mitigating learning losses, addressing the challenge of reopening schools and deploying distance learning strategies. In total, 142 countries responded to the survey that covers the period from February to May 2021 and spans pre-primary, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary.
"Remote learning has been a lifeline for many children around the world during school closures. But for the most vulnerable, even this was out of reach. It is urgent that we get every child back into the classroom now. But we cannot stop there; reopening better means implementing remedial programmes to help students get back on track, and ensuring that we prioritize girls and vulnerable children in all our efforts," said UNICEF Global Chief of Education Robert Jenkins.
Key findings from the survey include:
The survey also sheds light on the deployment and effectiveness of distance learning and related support more than one year into the pandemic. Results show that:
In 2020, schools worldwide were fully closed across all four education levels for 79 teaching days on average, representing roughly 40 per cent of total instructional days averaged across OECD and G20 countries. The figures ranged from 53 days in high-income countries to 115 days in lower-middle-income countries.
Demand for funds is rising, in competition with other sectors, while governments' revenues are falling. Nevertheless, 49 per cent of countries increased their education budget in 2020 relative to 2019, while 43 per cent maintained their budget constant. Funding is set to increase in 2021, as more than 60 per cent of countries plan to increase their education budget compared to 2020.
These findings reinforce the importance of reopening schools, remedial learning and more effective remote learning systems that can better withstand future crises and reach all students. Moreover, it shows that the measurement of learning losses due to COVID-19 related to school closures is a critical effort for most countries and development partners, highlighted by the recent partnership of UNESCO, UNICEF and the World Bank around the Learning Data Compact.

Title: COVID-19 pandemic leads to major backsliding on childhood vaccinations, new WHO, UNICEF data shows
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
16 July 2021
GENEVA/NEW YORK, 15th July 2021 - 23 million children missed out on basic vaccines through routine immunization services in 2020 – 3.7 million more than in 2019 - according to official data published today by WHO and UNICEF. This latest set of comprehensive worldwide childhood immunization figures, the first official figures to reflect global service disruptions due to COVID-19, show a majority of countries last year experienced drops in childhood vaccination rates.
Concerningly, most of these – up to 17 million children – likely did not receive a single vaccine during the year, widening already immense inequities in vaccine access. Most of these children live in communities affected by conflict, in under-served remote places, or in informal or slum settings where they face multiple deprivations including limited access to basic health and key social services.
“Even as countries clamour to get their hands on COVID-19 vaccines, we have gone backwards on other vaccinations, leaving children at risk from devastating but preventable diseases like measles, polio or meningitis,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
Disruptions in immunization services were widespread in 2020, with the WHO Southeast Asian and Eastern Mediterranean Regions most affected.  As access to health services and immunization outreach were curtailed, the number of children not receiving even their very first vaccinations increased in all regions. As compared with 2019, 3.5 million more children missed their first dose of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine (DTP-1) while 3 million more children missed their first measles dose.
“This evidence should be a clear warning – the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions cost us valuable ground we cannot afford to lose – and the consequences will be paid in the lives and wellbeing of the most vulnerable,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “Even before the pandemic, there were worrying signs that we were beginning to lose ground in the fight to immunize children against preventable child illness, including with the widespread measles outbreaks two years ago. The pandemic has made a bad situation worse.”
Countries with the greatest increase in children not receiving a first dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis combined vaccine (DTP-1) include India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Philippines, Mexico, Mozambique, Angola, United Republic of Tanzania, Argentina, Venezuela, and Mali. The data shows that middle-income countries now account for an increasing share of unprotected children – that is, children missing out on at least some vaccine doses.
Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, global childhood vaccination rates against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles and polio had stalled for several years at around 86%. This rate is well below the 95% recommended by WHO to protect against measles –often the first disease to resurge when children are not reached with vaccines - and insufficient to stop other vaccine-preventable diseases.
With many resources and personnel diverted to support the COVID-19 response, there have been significant disruptions to immunization service provision in many parts of the world. In some countries, clinics have been closed or hours reduced, while people may have been reluctant to seek healthcare because of fear of transmission or have experienced challenges reaching services due to lockdown measures and transportation disruptions.
As countries work to recover lost ground due to COVID-19 related disruptions, UNICEF, WHO and partners like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance are supporting efforts to strengthen immunization systems by:
The agencies are working with countries and partners to deliver the ambitious targets of the global Immunization Agenda 2030, which aims to achieve 90% coverage for essential childhood vaccines; halve the number of entirely unvaccinated, or ‘zero dose’ children, and increase the uptake of newer lifesaving vaccines such as rotavirus or pneumococcus in low and middle-income countries.
Globally, the vaccination rate for three doses of diphtheria-tetanus and pertussis (DTP-3) vaccine fell from around 86% in 2019 to 83% in 2020, meaning 22.7 million children missed out, and for measles first dose, from 86 to 84%, meaning 22.3 million children missed out.
Vaccination rates for measles second dose were at 71% (from 70% in 2019).  To control measles, 95% uptake of two vaccine doses is required; countries that cannot reach that level rely on periodic nationwide vaccination campaigns to fill the gap.

Title: UNICEF signs supply agreement for Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
15 July 2021
NEW YORK/COPENHAGEN, 12 July 2021 - UNICEF and Sinopharm have signed a long-term agreement for the supply of the BBIBP-CorV inactivated virus vaccine against COVID-19 on behalf of the COVAX Facility.
Through the agreement, UNICEF will have access to up to 120 million doses of the vaccine by the end of 2021 to supply participating countries and territories in the COVAX Facility’s Advance Market Commitment (AMC), as well as self-financing participants.
This is the 7th supply agreement UNICEF has signed for COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of COVAX. Previous agreements have been announced with the Serum Institute of India, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Human Vaccine, Moderna and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.
The Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine received a WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) in May. On 12 July, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance announced that it had signed an Advance Purchase Agreement with Sinopharm on behalf of the COVAX Facility for the purchase of up to 60 million doses to be made available from July through October 2021. The agreement also includes an option to purchase a further 60 million doses in Q4 2021 and 50 million more doses in the first half of 2022, if necessary. This totals a potential 170 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine available to COVAX participants.
Deliveries could start as early as August providing countries are ready to receive them. The COVAX Allocation Framework will determine the dose allocations to COVAX participants taking into consideration access, country readiness, vaccine supply through COVAX to date, operating and supply aspects, and other parameters.
The goal of the COVAX Facility is to help address the acute phase of the global pandemic by the end of 2021 by providing rapid, fair and equitable access to safe and effective vaccines for all participating countries and territories regardless of income level.
The COVAX Facility, co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, together with UNICEF, aims to provide access to quality-assured COVID-19 vaccines, enabling the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.

Title: UN report: Pandemic year marked by spike in world hunger
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
12 July 2021
12 July 2021, Rome - There was a dramatic worsening of world hunger in 2020, the United Nations said today - much of it likely related to the fallout of COVID-19. While the pandemic's impact has yet to be fully mapped*, a multi-agency report estimates that around a tenth of the global population - up to 811 million people - were undernourished last year. The number suggests it will take a tremendous effort for the world to honour its pledge to end hunger by 2030.
This year's edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World is the first global assessment of its kind in the pandemic era. The report is jointly published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Previous editions had already put the world on notice that the food security of millions - many children among them - was at stake. "Unfortunately, the pandemic continues to expose weaknesses in our food systems, which threaten the lives and livelihoods of people around the world," the heads of the five UN agencies** write in this year's Foreword.
They go on to warn of a "critical juncture," even as they pin fresh hopes on increased diplomatic momentum.
"This year offers a unique opportunity for advancing food security and nutrition through transforming food systems with the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit, the Nutrition for Growth Summit and the COP26 on climate change." "The outcome of these events," the five add, "will go on to shape the second half of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition" - a global policy commitment yet to hit its stride.
Already in the mid-2010s, hunger had started creeping upwards, dashing hopes of irreversible decline. Disturbingly, in 2020 hunger shot up in both absolute and proportional terms, outpacing population growth: some 9.9 percent of all people are estimated to have been undernourished last year, up from 8.4 percent in 2019.
More than half of all undernourished people (418 million) live in Asia; more than a third (282 million) in Africa; and a smaller proportion (60 million) in Latin America and the Caribbean. But the sharpest rise in hunger was in Africa, where the estimated prevalence of undernourishment - at 21 percent of the population - is more than double that of any other region.
On other measurements too, the year 2020 was sombre. Overall, more than 2.3 billion people (or 30 percent of the global population) lacked year-round access to adequate food: this indicator - known as the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity - leapt in one year as much in as the preceding five combined. Gender inequality deepened: for every 10 food-insecure men, there were 11 food-insecure women in 2020 (up from 10.6 in 2019).
Malnutrition persisted in all its forms, with children paying a high price: in 2020, over 149 million under-fives are estimated to have been stunted, or too short for their age; more than 45 million - wasted, or too thin for their height; and nearly 39 million - overweight.*** A full three-billion adults and children remained locked out of healthy diets, largely due to excessive costs. Nearly a third of women of reproductive age suffer from anaemia. Globally, despite progress in some areas - more infants, for example, are being fed exclusively on breast milk - the world is not on track to achieve targets for any nutrition indicators by 2030.
In many parts of the world, the pandemic has triggered brutal recessions and jeopardized access to food. Yet even before the pandemic, hunger was spreading; progress on malnutrition lagged. This was all the more so in nations affected by conflict, climate extremes or other economic downturns, or battling high inequality - all of which the report identifies as major drivers of food insecurity, which in turn interact.****
On current trends, The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World estimates that Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger by 2030) will be missed by a margin of nearly 660 million people. Of these 660 million, some 30 million may be linked to the pandemic's lasting effects.
As outlined in last year's report, transforming food systems is essential to achieve food security, improve nutrition and put healthy diets within reach of all. This year's edition goes further to outline six "transformation pathways". These, the authors say, rely on a "coherent set of policy and investment portfolios" to counteract the hunger and malnutrition drivers.
Depending on the particular driver (or combination of drivers) confronting each country, the report urges policymakers to:
The report also calls for an "enabling environment of governance mechanisms and institutions" to make transformation possible. It enjoins policymakers to consult widely; to empower women and youth; and to expand the availability of data and new technologies. Above all, the authors urge, the world must act now - or watch the drivers of hunger and malnutrition recur with growing intensity in coming years, long after the shock of the pandemic has passed.
* To reflect the added uncertainty induced by the pandemic, this year's edition for the first time presents a range (720 million to 811 million) rather than a single headline number. For regional breakdowns, the number of 768 million - the mid-range estimate - is used. Whether the lower, middle or upper value of the range is considered, the annual increase over 2019's mid-range number of 650 million is substantial. At the higher end, this increase is a massive 161 million. (The entire historical series is revised annually in line with new data.)
** For FAO - Qu Dongyu, Director-General; for IFAD - Gilbert F. Houngbo, President; for UNICEF - Henrietta H. Fore, Executive Director; for WFP - David Beasley, Executive Director; for WHO - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General.
*** Social distancing rules made nutrition data exceptionally hard to collect in 2020. Some numbers - especially for wasting in under-fives - may be higher than these estimates.
**** The more drivers a country has, the worse the undernourishment and malnutrition, the greater the food insecurity, and the more prohibitive the cost of healthy diets to its citizens.

Title: Billions of people will lack access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene in 2030 unless progress quadruples – warn WHO, UNICEF

05 July 2021
GENEVA/NEW YORK, 1 July 2021 – Billions of people around the world will be unable to access safely managed household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services in 2030 unless the rate of progress quadruples, according to a new report from WHO and UNICEF.
The Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) report –  Progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 2000 - 2020 – presents estimates on household access to safely managed drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services over the past five years, and assesses progress toward achieving the sixth sustainable development goal (SDG) to ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030’. For the first time, the report also presents emerging national data on menstrual health.
In 2020, around 1 in 4 people lacked safely managed drinking water in their homes and nearly half the world’s population lacked safely managed sanitation. COVID-19 has highlighted the urgent need to ensure everyone can access good hand hygiene. At the onset of the pandemic, 3 in 10 people worldwide could not wash their hands with soap and water within their homes.
“Handwashing is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, yet millions of people across the world lack access to a reliable, safe supply of water,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Investment in water, sanitation and hygiene must be a global priority if we are to end this pandemic and build more resilient health systems.”
The report notes some progress towards achieving universal access to basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services. Between 2016 and 2020, the global population with safely managed drinking water at home increased from 70 per cent to 74 per cent; safely managed sanitation services grew from 47 per cent to 54 per cent; and handwashing facilities with soap and water increased from 67 per cent to 71 per cent.
The report makes clear that, if current trends persist, billions of children and families will be left without critical, life-saving WASH services, stating that by 2030:
The report also notes vast inequalities with vulnerable children and families suffering the most. To achieve universal access to safely managed drinking water by 2030, the current rate of progress in the Least Developed Countries would need to increase ten-fold. In fragile contexts, where people were twice as likely to lack safe drinking water, it would need to accelerate by a factor of 23.
“Even before the pandemic, millions of children and families were suffering without clean water, safe sanitation, and a place to wash their hands,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Despite our impressive progress to date to scale-up these lifesaving services, the alarming and growing needs continue to outstrip our ability to respond. The time has come to dramatically accelerate our efforts to provide every child and family with the most basic needs for their health and well-being, including fighting off infectious diseases like COVID-19.”
Other key findings from the report include:

24 June 2021
UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, welcomes the recent contribution from the Government of the United States of America (USA) to provide essential humanitarian assistance to refugees and asylum-seekers in Armenia.
With the continued support from of the U.S. Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM), UNHCR has been able to deliver vital emergency assistance to persons in a refugee-like situation affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, as well as to refugees and asylum-seekers residing in Armenia whose livelihoods have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. funding towards UNHCR’s programme will also contribute to providing and achieving solutions for the most vulnerable refugee families and children, including in protection, education, and strengthened community empowerment.
“We are pleased to work with UNHCR Armenia as it executes its critical mission of supporting those in need. The challenges of the past year remind us anew of the great importance of UNHCR’s work,” said U.S. Ambassador to Armenia Lynne M. Tracy. “The United States is proud to partner with the UNHCR and our Armenian counterparts to help improve the lives of those negatively affected by the intensive fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh and the turbulence of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The United States’ support in the form of flexible funding is critical to UNHCR as it enables the organization to determine how best to protect and assist those who are in the greatest need or at the greatest risk quickly and effectively.
“UNHCR would like to thank the people and the Government of the United States for their enduring commitment and support for vulnerable and displaced populations in Armenia” said Anna-Carin Ost, UNHCR Representative in Yerevan. “This contribution is crucial as with it we are able to help refugees and people living in a refugee-like situation in Armenia, including those displaced from Nagorno-Karabakh. With US support, UNHCR has been able to respond to the needs of vulnerable displaced people, providing winter clothes to families amid freezing winter conditions, hygiene kits, bedding sets, and household items; and repairing collective shelters.”
UNHCR is grateful for the generous and long-standing support of the United States, which allows UNHCR to continue to provide protection, legal support, and pursue durable solutions for refugees, stateless persons, and those living in a refugee-like situation throughout the country.

Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
24 June 2021
The UN Global Network on Migration was launched in May 2018 as a collaborative community of UN entities working together to provide effective and coordinated system-wide support to Member States in the implementation, monitoring, and review of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration (GCM).
During the launching event the participants had a chance to obtain a greater understanding of the support mechanisms the Network will bring to the UN system in terms of migration, and to present the Network as a mechanism to assist the Government of Armenia in implementation of commitments, undertaken within the GCM and engaging other stakeholders.
The event was launched with the opening remarks by Mr. Shombi Sharp, UN Resident Coordinator in Armenia Co-Chair of UNMN in Armenia, Ms. Irina Davtyan, Deputy Head of Migration Service of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure of the Republic of Armenia, Mr. Amr Taha, Co-chair of the Regional UNMN, Senior Regional Liaison and Policy Officer, IOM RO Vienna and Ms. Amy Muedin, Migration Network Policy Officer from UN Global Network on Migration.
During his speech Mr. Sharp emphasized the importance of the Network's 360-degree approach, that will incorporate Government, academia, NGOs, and civil society, as well as emphasized the role of the IOM Armenia as the country’s Network coordinator.
“The Network is expanding to 15+ networks around the globe, which is a significant achievement as the Network prepares to host the forthcoming International Migration Review Forum in May 2022,” - says Mr. Amr Taha.
The country Network's actions will be guided by the UN Charter, international law, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
“It is highly important to have such a wide discussion to determine what the Network's global vision is as well as to understand various modalities of the Network. I'm looking forward to the Network's activities being rolled out, and I'm excited to work with all of the members both locally and internationally,” - says Ms. Ilona Ter-Minasyan, the Head of Office of the IOM Mission in Armenia and the Co-Chair of the Network in Armenia.
The event was wrapped up by the panel discussion with the participation of the UN Network members from UNDP, UNIDO, WFP, UNHCR, UNFPA, FAO, RCO, ILO, UNAIDS, UNICEF and UNHCR. As a final remark, all the representatives from the agencies emphasized the significance of optimizing resources in order to achieve the goal of the UN Network on Migration in Armenia.

Title: UNHCR: World leaders must act to reverse the trend of soaring displacement
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
18 June 2021
Despite the pandemic, the number of people fleeing wars, violence, persecution and human rights violations in 2020 rose to nearly 82.4 million people, according to UNHCR’s latest annual Global Trends report released today in Geneva. This is a further four per cent increase on top of the already record-high 79.5 million at the end of 2019.
The report shows that by the end of 2020 there were 20.7 million refugees under UNHCR mandate, 5.7 million Palestine refugees and 3.9 million Venezuelans displaced abroad. Another 48 million people were internally displaced (IDPs) within their own countries. A further 4.1 million were asylum-seekers. These numbers indicate that despite the pandemic and calls for a global ceasefire, conflict continued to chase people from their homes.
“Behind each number is a person forced from their home and a story of displacement, dispossession and suffering. They merit our attention and support not just with humanitarian aid, but in finding solutions to their plight.”
“While the 1951 Refugee Convention and the Global Compact on Refugees provide the legal framework and tools to respond to displacement, we need much greater political will to address conflicts and persecution that force people to flee in the first place,” said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi.
Girls and boys under the age of 18 account for 42 per cent of all forcibly displaced people. They are particularly vulnerable, especially when crises continue for years. New UNHCR estimates show that almost one million children were born as refugees between 2018 and 2020. Many of them may remain refugees for years to come.
“The tragedy of so many children being born into exile should be reason enough to make far greater efforts to prevent and end conflict and violence,” said Grandi.
The report also notes that at the peak of the pandemic in 2020, over 160 countries had closed their borders, with 99 States making no exception for people seeking protection. Yet with improved measures - such as medical screenings at borders, health certification or temporary quarantine upon arrival, simplified registration procedures and remote interviewing, more and more countries found ways to ensure access to asylum while trying to stem the spread of the pandemic.
While people continued to flee across borders, millions more were displaced within their own countries. Driven mostly by crises in Ethiopia, Sudan, Sahel countries, Mozambique, Yemen, Afghanistan and Colombia the number of internally displaced people rose by more than 2.3 million.
Over the course of 2020, some 3.2 million IDPs and just 251,000 refugees returned to their homes –a 40 and 21 per cent drop, respectively, compared to 2019. Another 33,800 refugees were naturalized by their countries of asylum. Refugee resettlement registered a drastic plunge - just 34,400 refugees were resettled last year, the lowest level in 20 years – a consequence of reduced number of resettlement places and Covid-19.
“Solutions require global leaders and those with influence to put aside their differences, end an egoistic approach to politics, and instead focus on preventing and solving conflict and ensuring respect for human rights,” said Grandi.

Title: More trees in Armenia to help counter climate change
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
15 June 2021
Armenia, which is highly vulnerable to climate change, has signed up to increase its forest cover and carbon removal from forests by reducing fuelwood demand and by introducing sustainable and climate-adaptive forest management techniques.
This is envisaged through a forestry project of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the first large-scale FAO project in Europe and Central Asia to be supported by the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The project aims to increase forest cover by 2.5 percent, reduce the fuelwood demand of rural communities by at least 30 percent, enable sustainable and climate-adaptive forest management, and ensure technology transfer to rural communities, the private sector and institutions as part of a forest-energy nexus approach. The eight-year project, with a total budget of USD 18.7 million, will rely on significant co-financing and technical expertise from the Government of Armenia, the Austrian Development Agency, the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italy, the World Wildlife Fund Armenia, and FAO.
The agreement was signed today by Romanos Petrosyan, Armenia’s acting Minister of Environment, and Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative in Armenia.
“The Green Climate Fund project ‘Forest resilience of Armenia, enhancing adaptation and rural green growth via mitigation’ will significantly contribute to the implementation of the strategy aimed at strengthening forests’ enormous capacity to mitigate against climate change, primarily through reducing forest degradation, planting new forests, and managing existing ones,” said Petrosyan.
According to the World Bank, Armenia ranks as the fourth most vulnerable country in Eastern Europe and Central Asia in terms of climate-change risks. Current climate trends and projections for the country indicate future elevated average temperatures, precipitation and river-flow decreases, and snow cover reduction. The population depends heavily on fuelwood, which puts forests that are  sensitive to climate change under further stress.
“The project is an important milestone in realising the country’s National Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as in addressing poverty and shifting to sustainable energy consumption,” said Jehle.
Two regions – Lori in the north, and Syunik in the south – are to be targeted under the project. They were selected based on forest type, population density, local poverty levels, and exposure to climate change, in addition to the potential impact on important forest ecosystems. Around 377 000 people will benefit directly from diversified livelihoods and increased participation in forest governance and management (12 percent of the total population).
The Green Climate Fund investment is expected to prevent about 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from entering the atmosphere over 20 years through the forest-energy nexus approach.
“The Government of Armenia considers issues of environmental protection and, in particular, sustainable forest management, among national and state priorities, because if managed sustainably, forests play an indispensable role in climate-change mitigation and biodiversity protection,” added Petrosyan.
The project goals will be realised by FAO jointly with the Environmental Project Implementation Unit under Armenia’s Ministry of Environment.

Title: FAO works towards disaster risk reduction in Armenia
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
11 June 2021
This analysis is part of a series of country baseline studies on disaster risk reduction system in the agriculture sector, conducted by the FAO. The study series includes a total of 16 countries in Caucasus, Central Asia, Balkans and Eastern Europe.
Recommendations on improving Armenia’s disaster risk management regulatory and institutional frameworks, enhancing and modernizing early warning systems and agrometeorological services to better support hazards monitoring, early warning, were discussed during the meeting. The critical role of data collection for evidence building and informed policy decisions were also emphasized along with improved coordination at central and decentralized level for disasters risk reduction, preparedness and response.
The Armenian Government along with enhancing its emergency response potential has acknowledged disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change as national priorities for a resilient future. Consequently, the integration of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into sector development planning became a key strategic approach for the Government that, however, requires continues improvement of its relevant legal and institutional frameworks.
The Armenia baseline study reviews the current status of disaster risk reduction, and early warning systems in the agriculture sector and agro-meteorology services, including related legislation, policies, capacities and services, and assesses the gaps and needs to improve and strengthen these areas.
“Agriculture is particularly vulnerable to natural hazards and to the effects of climate change, and absorbs a high portion of the overall impact of disasters. Agriculture, however, also significantly contributes to climate change with greenhouse gas emissions generated from livestock, crop production and other land uses,” said Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative in Armenia. “It is therefore essential to promote the adoption of good agriculture practices that respect the environment, reduce the depletion of natural resources and loss of biodiversity and lead to sustainable and resilient production systems. FAO is committed to support Armenia in this effort.”
Armenia is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world as it is exposed to all types of natural hazards, including severe earthquakes, frequent landslides, hailstorms, droughts and floods that put people at risk and can cause considerable damage that may undermine its development. Due to the country’s dry climate, frequent occurrence of disasters as well as environmental issues, including deforestation and desertification caused by human activities, Armenia is more sensitive to the adverse impacts of climate change.
According to projections of local and international experts, the inevitable raise in a number of hydro-meteorological hazards will increase the risk for soil erosion and loss of soil fertility, reduction of crop yields, water scarcity and lack of irrigation, damage of crops and livestock, increase of pests and infectious diseases.
The FAO study presents critical issues requiring improvement in the areas of concern highlighting their multisectoral nature and a need for addressing the disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation challenges in agriculture through systematized and well-planned actions. The study will serve as a basis for further dialogue between the Armenia Government and FAO and other interested parties to identify and realize priority solutions for ensuring informed agricultural development in Armenia.
The study was conducted under the FAO Regional Initiative aimed at supporting sustainable natural resource management and preserving biodiversity in a changing climate’ and will contribute to a region-wide synthesis report on Europe and Central Asia.

Prior to the signing ceremony, Mher Grigoryan made a welcoming speech, noting that all the areas and directions mentioned in the document play a key role for Armenia. Particularly, in his speech, the Acting Deputy Prime Minister noted "Thanks to the document to be signed today, I think we will focus more our joint efforts to implement the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030."
Signed by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mher Grigoryan and the UN Resident Coordinator, Shombi Sharp, the Cooperation Framework is the key strategic document that will frame the work of all UN agencies working in Armenia in the upcoming five years.
Nationally owned and anchored in national development priorities, this compact determines the collective offer of 20 resident and non-resident UN entities to the country, expressing a total financial commitment of USD 230 million for the benefit of the people of Armenia.
During the signing ceremony, Mr. Sharp stated:
“This Cooperation Framework represents a major new milestone for the already deep partnership between the Republic of Armenia and the United Nations. We believe this joint effort together with our partners will make an important contribution to helping the country move forward with resilience through these difficult times of dual crisis from pandemic and conflict, towards a brighter future, peace and prosperity for all in Armenia. This compact articulates an ambitious, collective vision of the entire UN Development System in Armenia, all UN Agencies striving together to improve people’s well-being and capabilities; foster economic “green” transformation; strengthen responsive and effective governance systems and enhance gender equality, while leaving no one behind.”
The Cooperation Framework is a result of a 14-month long consultation process with the Government of Armenia, other national partners, including civil society organizations, international finance institutions, development partners, private sector, academia, and international NGOs. It also integrates the aspirations of the people living in Armenia widely surveyed through the UN75 Global Survey. The Cooperation Framework reflects, as well, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and conflict in and around Nagorno-Karabakh and response measures.
The Cooperation Framework builds on successful collaboration between the Government and the UN as part of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the 2016 – 2020 cycle which saw greater access to sustainable economic opportunities; improved systems of democratic governance; progress in reducing gender inequality; strengthened migration, border, and asylum management systems; improved access to basic education and social protection services; more accessible quality health services and improved environmental sustainability.

The cash transfers support the most vulnerable people and boost the local economy at the same time. By enabling people to purchase food from local markets, cash will help to strengthen and promote the local markets, also making direct positive impacts on the local economy.
The donation will complement the national efforts undertaken by the Government of Armenia through its national social programme to support food insecure people who have been affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
A recent WFP Food Security Assessment shows the food security levels of people have been negatively affected by the conflict. This cash assistance will help many people across the country to avoid negative coping mechanisms such as, eating less or borrowing money to buy food. The displaced populations will be able to cover their immediate food needs and have access to a nutritious diet.
“Globally, USAID is the biggest donor to WFP and supports food security all over the world. It is an honour for us to expand our partnership in Armenia within this humanitarian assistance,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Armenia Jelena Milesovic. “We highly appreciate this generous  contribution from USAID, which will help us reach more people and enable them to buy their basic food needs from local markets.”
WFP has developed a designated feedback mechanism for people benefiting from its assistance in Armenia, allowing them to communicate directly, effectively and safely with WFP. By calling the helpline at 096 120 400, or emailing armenia.BFM@wfp.org, people can send feedback, requests or complaints related to the cash assistance. This allows WFP to adapt and adjust its response as necessary, determine increased needs and gaps, and resolve concerns.

The Protocol commits the two organisations to establish long-term initiatives to support refugees and forcibly displaced people by harnessing the transformative power of football to assist and uphold their rights and strengthen their integration in their host communities.
The partnership will also encourage close cooperation on the ground between UEFA’s member associations and UNHCR offices across Europe.
“No matter where in the world I travel for UNHCR, refugee camps, settlements, towns and cities, I see how football has the extraordinary ability to unite people around a common passion. Through our partnership with UEFA, we hope to use the power of football to connect displaced people and the communities that host them,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.
“Sport provides an opportunity for refugee children and youth to be included – it also has the transformative power to rebuild lives and inspire positive values,” he added.
For UEFA President, Aleksander Čeferin, the Cooperation Protocol “is an impactful way to further strengthen football as a powerful tool to foster sustainable, social inclusion of refugees and enhance social cohesion. The partnership with UNHCR builds on UEFA’s already extensive work in this area, including through initiatives and programmes of the UEFA Foundation for Children. Most importantly, our joint activities will have a real impact on the daily lives of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons.”
UEFA Football and Social Responsibility Director, Michele Uva, added that “the institutional partnership with UNHCR underlines UEFA’s commitment to the newly-added Responsibility pillar of the UEFA Strategy and its specific policies of Refugees Support and Inclusion, which reflect our responsibility to ensure European football’s support to these important topics for civil society.”
The agreement was signed by UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, and UEFA’s Football and Social Responsibility Director, Michele Uva, on Wednesday at UNHCR’s headquarters in Geneva.

This assistance will complement existing national efforts undertaken by the Government of Armenia and its partners to support people affected by the conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Janez Lenarčič, European Commissioner for Crisis Management, said: “The EU’s emergency aid is delivered in line with the humanitarian principles and helps civilians affected by the hostilities and their host population. Many displaced people find themselves in a difficult situation, which is further exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Through cash assistance, our partner WFP helps the most vulnerable pay for the things they need most urgently, including food.”
WFP’s recent Food Security Assessment concluded that many people across the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
“We highly appreciate this generous and timely contribution that will help us alleviate the suffering of conflict-affected people and help them put food on the table and secure other basic needs,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Armenia Jelena Milesovic. “The European Union is a key partner to WFP in Armenia and across the world.”
WFP has developed a designated feedback mechanism for people benefiting from its assistance in Armenia, allowing them to communicate directly, effectively and safely with WFP.

18 May 2021
WFP’s support to food insecure people is provided thanks to the financial support of the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Government of France, and Government of Flanders.  WFP will provide monthly cash transfers from April to June to the displaced population who has already registered on the Government platform and is in Armenia.
The cash assistance will help displaced people buy a wide range of diverse food items to balance their diet. The assistance is in line with existing national efforts undertaken by the Government of Armenia and its partners to support people whose food security has been negatively affected by the conflict.
“We are grateful for the generous contribution from our partners, which helps displaced people in Armenia meet their basic food needs and not go to bed on an empty stomach,” said Jelena Milesovic, WFP Representative and Country Director in Armenia . “Humanitarian assistance is needed so that families can avoid adopting negative coping mechanisms, such as eating less, or borrowing money to buy food. This is extremely welcome support that will help many families to make ends meet during these difficult times.”
A feedback mechanism for the people and communities benefiting from WFP assistance in Armenia has been set up to support direct communication with WFP. Beneficiaries can call the phone number: 096 120 400, and write to the e-mail address: armenia.BFM@wfp.org to provide feedback, make requests, or complaints related to the cash assistance. This will allow WFP to address and resolve concerns and queries.

17 May 2021
YEREVAN, 17 May 2021 - The Ministry of Health of Armenia welcomed the arrival of a critical second batch of COVID-19 vaccine doses this morning through the COVAX Facility (CEPI, GAVI, UNICEF, WHO), with logistical support from UNICEF. The 50,400 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine against COVID-19 will help to speed up the national vaccination programme in Armenia as well as provide second doses for those who have already received a first course of AstraZeneca.
“To support vaccine deployment in Armenia, UNICEF leveraged its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world to procure and deliver COVID-19 vaccine doses on behalf of COVAX Facility,” said Mr Yuri Oksamitniy, UNICEF Representative in Armenia. “In addition, UNICEF works with the Ministry of Health to ensure that the country is ready to receive the vaccines by providing training for health workers to dispense them and through fostering trust in vaccines. UNICEF and the Ministry will also work together to ensure that appropriate cold-chain equipment is in place throughout Armenia.”
“One of WHO’s highest priorities as a co-leader of COVAX, is to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of these COVID-19 vaccines. Within the joint initiative with the EU, we are committed to support the country with revision, development and adaptation of the vaccination guidelines for primary health care specialists. Through our technical assistance training and supervision, regional hubs are planned to be established with the goal to initiate educational sessions for all relevant staff in support of the National Immunization Programme in Armenia,” stated Egor Zaitsev, WHO Representative in Armenia.
“The Team Europe is committed to ensuring that everyone in Armenia who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere across the country. Under COVAX, the Team Europe is once again supporting the Government of Armenia vaccination roll-out goals in close partnership with WHO and UNICEF. Vaccines work, vaccines save lives,” noted Andrea Wiktorin, the Ambassador of the European Union to Armenia.
“With the world still struggling to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing supply of vaccines has brought us much needed hope for saving lives and getting back to a more normal life. Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, along with other measures, promises to help keep people healthy, economies open and end the pandemic. Thanks to international solidarity via the COVAX Facility, vaccines are now reaching all countries in need. We are pleased that Armenia is among those that have already received a second batch and that the Ministry of Health is now providing everyone in the country with free and easy access,” said the UN RC in Armenia, Shombi Sharp.
Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary in Armenia and available for persons above the age of 18.
***
COVAX is co-led by the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), the Gavi Alliance, UNICEF and WHO. It aims to provide at least 2 billion doses of vaccines that have received the WHO Emergency Use Authorization (EUL) by the end of 2021. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries. COVAX is supported by contributions from a range of government and international development partners, including the United states, Germany, United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others.

Title: The FAO-led 2020 food security and nutrition report for Europe and Central Asia elaborates on the costs of a healthy diet
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
12 May 2021
12 May 2021, Budapest, Hungary – Although severe hunger has not been a major issue in Europe and Central Asia in the past 20 years, the region is in part facing an increase of moderate food insecurity – understood as irregular access to nutritious and sufficient food –, while also dealing with the widespread rapid growth of obesity, challenging its ability to achieve food security and improved nutrition, as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2.
Lowering the costs of healthy diets can be crucial to achieving better nutrition and sustainability.
According to the Europe and Central Asia Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious threats to food security and nutrition, especially for low-income and vulnerable populations in the region.
The annual report, produced jointly by FAO, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme (WFP), World Health Organization (WHO), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), provides a comprehensive analysis of the topic, including all forms of malnutrition, current dietary patterns, and the costs of diets for individuals, society, and the planet.
Of particular concern in Europe and Central Asia overall is the rapidly worsening situation in some countries of Central Asia, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Caucasus, which is keeping the region as a whole from achieving the 2030 targets of the SDGs on the prevalence of severe and moderate food insecurity.
“The past 12 months have shown that our health and the functioning of our agrifood systems are fundamental – and that more effort is needed,” said Vladimir Rakhmanin, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative. “We all – including decision makers, the development community, civil society, academia, the private sector and individuals – have to do our part to achieve the Zero Hunger goal, food security and improved nutrition, leave no one behind and promote sustainable agriculture.”
“Reducing hunger and malnutrition calls for a life-cycle approach, with special attention paid to children, adolescent girls, mothers and other vulnerable groups,” said John Aylieff, WFP Regional Director, Asia and the Pacific. “Zero Hunger is not just about having a belly full. It requires us to work across sectors – from agriculture and social protection to education and health – to ensure a healthy, balanced diet that’s also affordable and accessible for all.”
“Depending on their production and location, farmers in the region have been particularly hit by the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular in countries with economies in transition,” stressed Olga Algayerova, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and UNECE. “I call on governments to deploy adequate financial support to farmers. I also invite them to make full use of the UN trade facilitation and border-crossing procedures to keep borders open to facilitate the flow of goods, in particular essential products such as fresh food.”
Countries are making headway in the eradication of child stunting and wasting and low birth weight, but an opposite tendency is recorded for anaemia and exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life. In all countries of the region, gaps exist in the policy framework for the prevention of obesity and iron deficiency anaemia.
“UNICEF acknowledges the important breakthroughs countries have achieved concerning child stunting, wasting and low birth weight. However, without a redoubling of effort, the region will not meet 2025 and 2030 commitments on childhood obesity, anaemia and exclusive breastfeeding,” said Afshan Khan, UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia and Special Coordinator for the Refugee and Migrant Response in Europe. “Affordable, healthy diets are the basis of food security and nutrition outcomes, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the vulnerability of children’s nutrition. We have evidence to share with policymakers and food suppliers to take action to improve diets and mobilize health, education and social systems to scale up nutrition results for children.”
The prevalence of overweight and obesity is a major problem, even among children, with alarmingly high rates in most countries of the region. According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of overweight among children aged 6–9 is the highest in Mediterranean countries.
“People living with obesity have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes,” said Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “COVID-19 has also highlighted how fragile food systems can be – and how important it is to ensure that all people, no matter where and how they live, have access to safe, healthy and sustainable food. For the WHO European region, this is vital, given the alarming situation with obesity – a chronic complex disease in itself and a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases in the region.”
Additionally, the region is strongly affected by challenges imposed by the overconsumption of foods high in salt, fat and sugar and the underconsumption of fruits and vegetables. This calls for structural changes in food production and consumption within current food systems. WHO data show that unhealthy diets account for an estimated 86 percent of deaths and 77 percent of the disease burden in the region.
When developing national food security and nutrition strategies, FAO recommends that countries consider the environmental and climate impacts of the reference diet – which is currently not included – and increase education on that.
“The impacts of climate and environmental changes increasingly challenge current governance efforts,” said Milan Dacić, WMO Chief for Europe. “Policies are needed that support sustainable land management, reduce air pollution, ensure the supply of food for vulnerable populations, reduce crop loss and limit greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture. World Meteorological Organization activities on long-term monitoring; sharing of data, information and knowledge; and improved context-specific forecasts and analysis are vital support to alleviation of the impacts of climate and environmental changes.”
Fang also pointed at the disadvantageous composition of food available in the markets of Europe and Central Asia. As revealed in the regional overview, the availability of animal-based foods is above the world average, while the consumption of vegetables, pulses and fish is below the world average. Increased attention to a nutrition-sensitive agriculture facilitating healthy diets would be required. The European Green Deal and From Farm to Fork initiatives are policy frameworks that could facilitate change.
“The main conclusion is that despite good progress in diversifying and moving food availability in the right direction, there is a need to reorient food production and trade systems to enable healthy diets,” said Cheng Fang, an FAO economist and the main author of the report. “This may require additional efforts in consumer education and incentives to increase the consumption of fruits and fish, among other foods, to achieve sustainable and healthy nutrition strategies in these countries.”
Healthy diets are generally expensive, as they cost five times more, on average, than diets that cover only the basic energy needs through a starchy staple, according to the FAO report and based on the analysis of food cost/affordability data from 14 selected countries in Europe and Central Asia.
Cost drivers include trade, public expenditures and investment policies throughout agrifood supply chains. To counter their impacts, FAO and the World Food Programme advocate for nutrition-sensitive investments, targeted interventions and social protection policies and programmes to increase the affordability of healthy diets in a sustainable manner. To this end, the experience of Armenia with nutrition-sensitive social protection measures is presented in the report.
“The benefits of a nutritious diet affect not only individuals, but also the society as a whole,” said Fang, “and the costs of a nutritious diet are also borne by the entire society.”
Overall, the total costs associated with healthy diets are much lower than the costs of current consumption patterns. Were the population to shift to healthy diets, it is projected that direct and indirect health costs would be reduced up to 97 percent and the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by 41–74 percent, according to data from projects in the examined countries. These benefits could potentially increase over time with innovation and the adoption of new technologies involving climate-smart agriculture.
“The momentum created by the pandemic offers us a chance to rethink our agrifood systems, among other issues, and to set off a transformation for better food and nutrition at less cost to the environment. The UN Food Systems Summit convened this fall by the UN Secretary-General, gives us all an excellent opportunity to address this important issue,” said Rakhmanin.

Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
10 May 2021
On the 7th of May, “Building Armenia’s national transparency framework under Paris Agreement” UNDP-GEF project was officially launched. The project is funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and implemented by the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Armenia in cooperation with UNDP in Armenia. The event hosted around 70 participants, including government officials, representatives from state bodies, UNDP in Armenia and other UN agencies, technical specialists and practitioners from Ministry of Environment and stakeholder ministries, as well as leading local and international experts of the field.
The project will provide support for building institutional and technical capacities to meet the enhanced transparency requirements of Article 13 of the Paris Agreement, under which Armenia is committed to regularly provide information on the progress made in implementing its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), as well as on adaptation related actions and support received.
Welcoming the participants of the event, Mihaela Stojkoska, UNDP Resident Representative a.i. in Armenia, stated, “Climate change is an urgent and extremely serious issue that poses a global threat to human development and touches every aspect of our lives. UNDP remains faithful in its promise of supporting Armenia for implementing its ambitious climate agenda through enhancement of NDC implementation and establishing transparency framework for monitoring and reporting on its progress. This project allows Armenia to make information on mitigation and adaptation actions more comprehensive and accessible and to track the progress of its NDCs more efficiently.”
“The Ministry of Environment highly prioritizes the delivery of transparency requirements under Paris Agreement. In this regard, we express our gratitude to UNDP Armenia in taking the responsibility of implementing this project that will empower national institutions through building necessary capacities for meeting transparency and accountability requirements under Paris Agreement, as well as will ensure long term transparency in Armenia’s national commitments under international agreements,” mentioned Ruzanna Grigoryan, the Head of International Cooperation Department in her speech on behalf of the Deputy Minister of Environment, Anna Mazmanyan.
Subsequently, presentation dedicated to the reporting requirements under the Paris Agreement’s enhanced transparency framework, was delivered by Susan Legro, UNDP International Consultant of “Building Armenia’s national transparency framework under Paris Agreement” project, as well as details on GEF monitoring and evaluation requirements were provided in the presentation made by Esther Baricz, Regional Technical Adviser.
The project structure, its main objectives and components, as well as the risks and mitigation measures were presented by Diana Harutyunyan, UNDP Climate Change Programme Coordinator. She also briefed on the details on project’s 1st year plan, engagement of stakeholder state authorities and project coordination mechanisms.
The expected results of the project also include shifting from ad hoc reporting to a continuous process of monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) through capacity strengthening approach for capturing transparency activities of the country, data management for effective transparency reporting on GHG sources and sinks, as well as for transparency framework of actions and support.

Title: FAO and Armenia discuss solutions to combat land degradation
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
29 April 2021
29 April 2021, Yerevan, Armenia – At a virtual consultation today, Anna Mazmanyan, Deputy Minister of Environment, Arman Khojoyan, Deputy Minister of Economy, and Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative for Armenia joined key experts to discuss sustainable land management and restoration of degraded landscape in Armenia.
To provide a comprehensive solution to land degradation in Armenia, FAO and the Ministry of Environment developed a joint project proposal, with potential funding from the Global Environmental Fund (GEF), that was presented and reviewed during the event. Key experts from both, the Ministry and FAO updated on the status of the project preparation, planned project sites, co-financing modalities to seek feedback also from different partners and ensure their full participation in the intervention.
“The project will be a key milestone in achieving land degradation neutrality and an important contribution to increase sustainable land management and realizing the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative in Armenia.
Land degradation and desertification in Armenia are driven by both natural and anthropogenic (man-made) factors. Nature itself contributes to degrade lands through droughts and sandstorms, lack of precipitation caused by unequal distribution of seasonal and regional rainfall, naturally occurring salinization, as well as floods and landslides during the rainy periods. Human induced causes of degradation include inefficient agricultural practices (lack of crop rotation, inefficient use of irrigation techniques, overgrazing of pastures, and violation of ploughing rules), illegal logging, overuse of groundwater resources (artesian wells), and soil contamination, as well as mining, urban development and road construction.
In addition to the on-going land degradation processes, climate change is increasing the risks for the agriculture sector in the country, exacerbating land degradation processes unless action is taken.
The proposed project will follow a landscape approach in line with GEF’s vision to foster sustainable integrated landscapes to achieve land degradation neutrality.  Working at the landscape level allows problems to be addressed in a multifaceted way, integrating sectors, involving several stakeholders and working at different scales – tackling the underlying causes of land degradation and challenges related to food security and not just the symptoms.
After the workshop, the inputs and suggestions from the participants will be incorporated into the project design and the project will be submitted to the Global Environment Facility for final approval. The project implementation will be coordinated by the Ministry of Environment.

Title: Joint SDG Fund in collaboration with UN to support transformative change in Armenia
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
27 April 2021
The Joint SDG Fund under the overall leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator Office in Armenia has launched “Making Finance Work for Transformative Change in Armenia: Unlocking Finance for Armenia 2030” new joint project. The objective of the project is to support the Government of Armenia to create clear links between policies, planning and budgeting processes (horizontal workstream); and deploy innovative and evidence-driven mechanisms to leverage partnerships and multiple sources of finance towards three priority areas in Armenia - climate change, food security and human capital (vertical workstream).
Throughout the past two years, a new generation of sectoral and cross-sectoral strategies have been developed and refined for over 20 focus areas, guided by the three interconnected elements of sustainable development: economic growth, social cohesion, and environmental protection. Linking them together is a new comprehensive and long-term national development plan, called the Armenia Transformation Strategy 2050, which aims to serve as the primary policymaking framework for the foreseeable future.
The project “Making Finance Work for Transformative Change in Armenia: Unlocking Finance for Armenia 2030” is led by UNDP and implemented jointly with UNICEF and WFP, in partnership with the Offices of the Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy and the National SDG Council, as well as, international financial institutions and the national civil society.
In his opening remarks Shombi Sharp, the UN Resident Coordinator, mentioned: “As Armenia intensifies its recovery from the dual crises of pandemic and conflict, it is even more crucial now than ever before to ensure effective policy implementation for a sustainable and resilient recovery and national development.”
To assist the government in achieving the goals, the project will operationalize the Armenian Transformation Strategy and sectoral strategies through an SDG integrated financial framework and strengthen the financing architecture for effective policy implementation.
The project will address local needs and gaps in particular to support generating resources for equal distribution of funds for vulnerable groups. In line with the project vision, investments in these sectors will promote sustainable development across all dimensions of the 2030 Agenda.

Title: Government approves Armenia’s updated 2021-2030 Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, supported by the EU4Climate project
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
22 April 2021
On the 22nd of April the Government of the Republic of Armenia approved Armenia’s updated 2021-2030 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under Paris Agreement. For the development of the document, the Ministry of Environment received support in the frames of EU4Climate project that is funded by the European Union and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme.
Back to 2019, countries declared the need to enhance joint ambitions under PA at the 25th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP25) in Madrid.
“The EU has supported Armenia to deliver ambitious actions in the framework of the EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement and the regional project EU4Climate. Today we have collectively contributed to the urgent need for enhanced global green growth ambition”,- was stated by EU Ambassador, Andrea Wiktorin.
The updated document sets the ambition of the Government of Armenia towards reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40% compared with base year 1990 by 2030.
The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) submitted to the Secretariat of UNFCCC by the Government of Armenia in 2015, became county’s first NDC for the period of 2015-2050, after the ratification of Paris Agreement in 2017.
With the updated 2021-2030 NDC, Armenia aligns its NDC implementation periods with most of countries, including the EU's member states, adopting a ten-year NDC implementation timeframe of 2021-2030.
Setting the priority areas for low-carbon development and adaptation actions against climate change negative impacts, the updated NDC is based on green economy, compatible with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are reflected in socio-economic development framework of the Republic of Armenia.
A key component of the document is the enhanced transparency and accountability framework for tracking the progress on implementation of country’s commitments under the Paris Agreement.

Title: Alphonso Davies becomes the first footballer to take UNHCR’s Goodwill Ambassador title
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
26 March 2021
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, today announced the appointment of Alphonso Davies, FC Bayern Munich’s left-back and player for Canada Men’s National Football Team, as its newest Global Goodwill Ambassador.
Accepting his new role as UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Davies said: “I am proud to join the UN Refugee Agency, as a Goodwill Ambassador. My own experiences make me want to speak up for refugees, to share their stories and to help make a difference.”
Welcoming Davies on UNHCR’s Goodwill Ambassador team, Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said: “Alphonso Davies personifies the power of sport and we are truly honored to have him joining us. Sport has the incredible power to bring hope, to heal and to help shape the future for those forced to flee. In our work with refugees we see daily what uplifting difference sports can make in their lives. “His personal story, his talent and triumph as a professional footballer and his commitment to help refugees is impressive. I am looking forward to working with him.”
Born in a refugee camp in Ghana, to Liberian parents who fled the civil war in their home country, Davies knows first-hand what it means to be a refugee:
“Whilst the refugee camp provided a safe place for my family when they fled war, I often wonder where I would have been if I had stayed there and not benefited from the opportunities I got thanks to resettlement. I don’t think I would have made it to where I am today.”
Davies and his family were resettled to Canada when he was five. At 15, Davies began playing professional football and only a year later he had his national team debut, making him the youngest player ever on Canada’s Men’s National Team. Now at 20, Alphonso is keen to support the work of UNHCR and harness the power of sport to help those forced to flee to build a better future:
“I want people to know about the importance of helping refugees, wherever they are, in camps or cities, in neighboring countries or countries of resettlement such as Canada. Refugees need our support to survive, but also access to education and sports, so they can fulfil their potential and truly thrive.”
Alphonso Davies started supporting UNHCR in 2020, including through a livestream tournament for refugees. In February 2021, Davies helped launch a Canadian Government campaign, called Together for Learning, to promote access to quality education for refugees around the world.
Davies is widely considered as one of the best left-backs in the world due to the combination of his explosive pace and vision. In 2020, he was named Bundesliga Rookie of the Season and was part of the FC Bayern Munich team winning six prestigious titles.

Title: Disasters take heavy toll on agri-food systems as new threats emerge
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
19 March 2021
18 March 2021, Rome - Agriculture absorbs the bulk of the financial losses and damages wrought by disasters which have grown in frequency, intensity, and complexity, says FAO in a new report released today.
At no other point in history have agri-food systems confronted with such an array of new and unprecedented threats, including megafires, extreme weather, unusually large desert locust swarms, and emerging biological threats like the COVID-19 pandemic. These hazards not only take lives but also devastate agricultural livelihoods and inflict cascading negative economic consequences at the household, community, national and regional levels that can endure for generations, the report says.
According to the report, annual occurrence of disasters is now more than three times that of the 1970s and 1980s. Relative to agriculture, industry, commerce and tourism taken as a whole, on its own agriculture absorbs the disproportionate share of 63 percent of impact from disasters, with the least developed countries (LDCs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bearing the major brunt of these scourges.
Thus, between 2008 and 2018, the impacts of natural disasters cost the agricultural sectors of developing country economies over $108 billion in damaged or lost crop and livestock production. Such damage can be particularly detrimental to livelihoods of smallholder and subsistence farmers, pastoralists, and fishers.
Over the analyzed period, Asia was the most hard-hit region, with overall economic losses adding up to a staggering $49 billion, followed by Africa at $30 billion, and Latin America and Caribbean at $29 billion.
“The upheaval set in motion by COVID-19 may push even more families and communities into deeper distress,” said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu in the foreword to the report. “Disaster impact is pervasive and requires immediate efforts to better assess and understand its dynamics, so that it may be reduced and managed in integrated and innovative ways. The urgency and importance of doing so have never been greater”.
The report identifies drought as the single greatest culprit of agricultural production loss, followed by floods, storms, pests and diseases, and wildfires. Over 34 percent of crop and livestock production loss in LDCs and LMICs is traced to drought, costing the sector $37 billion overall. Drought impacts agriculture almost exclusively. The sector sustains 82 percent of all drought impact, compared to 18 percent in all other sectors.
Crop and livestock pests, diseases and infestations have also become an important stressor for the sector. Such biological disasters caused nine percent of all crop and livestock production loss in the period from 2008 to 2018. The potential threat of disasters of this category was rendered evident in 2020 when huge swarms of desert locusts ravaged across the Greater Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and Southwest Asia destroying crops and jeopardising food security.
Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic is placing an additional burden on agri-food systems exacerbating existing, systemic risks with cascading effects on lives, livelihoods, and economies worldwide.
Disasters extend beyond the economic realm having deleterious consequences for food security and nutrition. For the first time ever, this edition of the FAO report converts economic losses into caloric and nutrition equivalents.
For example, it estimates that crop and livestock production loss in LDCs and LMICs between 2008 and 2018 were equivalent to a loss of 6.9 trillion kilocalories per year. This equals the annual calorie intake of seven million adults.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, disaster impacts during that same time frame convert to a loss of 975 calories per capita per day, accounting for 40 percent of recommended daily allowance, followed by Africa (559 calories) and Asia (283 calories).
Investing in resilience and disaster risk reduction, especially data gathering and analysis for evidence-informed action, is of paramount importance to ensure agriculture’s crucial role in achieving sustainable future, FAO’s report argues.
Holistic responses and cross-sectoral collaboration are key in the disaster response. Countries must adopt a multi-hazard and multi- sectoral systemic risk management approach to anticipate, prevent, prepare for and respond to disaster risk in agriculture. Strategies need to integrate not only natural hazards but also anthropogenic and biological threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and must be based on an understanding of the systemic nature and interdependencies of risks.
Innovations such as remote sensing, geospatial information gathering, drones and disaster robotics, and machine learning are powerful new assessment and data gathering tools that have much to offer in the quest to reduce disaster risks in agriculture.
In addition to efficient governance, it is crucial to promote public-private partnerships to address the urgent need for investment in reducing agriculture’s susceptibility to disasters and climate change.

About the report
FAO’s recurring report, The Impact of Disasters and Crises on Agriculture and Food Security report, presents the most recent trends in agricultural production loss attributed to disasters across all agricultural sectors. The 2021 edition covers 457 disasters in 109 countries across all regions and income categories, including for the first time upper-middle- and high-income countries (UMICs and HICs).
Of the 109 countries to register disaster-related agriculture loss, 94 are in the LDC and LMIC categories, where 389 disasters hampered agricultural production.

17 February 2021
17 February 2021, Yerevan, Armenia – Today, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the RA Ministry of Economy endorsed the project document during the virtual signing ceremony, thus announcing the official launch of the emergency assistance project to support vulnerable groups affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in Armenia. At all stages of the project implementation, FAO will closely cooperate with the RA Ministry of Economy and the RA Food Safety Inspection Body, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, local self-government bodies aiming to provide rapid response in support to Government's interventions.
With a total budget of 350,000 USD, support packages will be provided to beneficiary families that include feed for animals, agricultural tools and equipment, fertilizers, vegetable seeds, and materials needed to build or renovate henhouses.
"This project is one of the important components of our continuous cooperation between the Ministry and FAO, and we must work together to ensure that the support provided to farmers is not only transparent and targeted but is also in due time. The Ministry is ready to support the rapid implementation of this project," said Arman Khojoyan, Deputy Minister of Economy of Armenia.
The project also includes a component of capacity development of beneficiaries, farmers, government staff and NGOs to raise public awareness, deepen practical knowledge, better emergency response, which will allow them to reorient themselves more quickly and recover from the crisis.
Specially defined criteria will be used to select the project beneficiaries, focusing mainly on women, children and the elderly, and families hosting the displaced persons.
"The project is part of the UN Response plan to the conflict, and it will be targeting the vulnerable people affected by the conflict with the immediate needs, particularly also related to their livestock, but more support is needed for the upcoming agricultural season" said Raimund Jehle, FAO representative in Armenia.

Title: COVAX announces new agreement, plans for first deliveries
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
28 January 2021
Geneva/Oslo 22 January 2021 – COVAX, the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of income level, today announced the signing of an advance purchase agreement with Pfizer for up to 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate, which has already received WHO Emergency Use Listing. Rollout will commence with the successful negotiation and execution of supply agreements.
In further support of its mission to expedite early availability of vaccines to lower-income countries and help bring a rapid end to the acute stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, COVAX also confirmed today that it will exercise an option – via an existing agreement with Serum Institute of India (SII) – to receive its first 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford University-developed vaccine manufactured by SII.
Of these first 100 million doses, the majority are earmarked for delivery in the first quarter of the year, pending WHO Emergency Use Listing. The WHO review process, which is currently underway, follows approval for restricted use in emergency situations by the Drugs Controller General of India earlier this month, and is a critical aspect of ensuring that any vaccine procured through COVAX is fully quality assured. According to the latest WHO update, a decision on this vaccine candidate is anticipated in the middle of February at the earliest.
COVAX also anticipates that, via an existing agreement with AstraZeneca, at least 50 million further doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine will be available for delivery to COVAX participants in Q1 2021, pending regulatory approval by the WHO of the COVAX-specific manufacturing network for these doses. A decision on this candidate is anticipated by WHO in the second half of February at the earliest.
“These purchase agreements open the door for these lifesaving vaccines to become available to people in the most vulnerable countries,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “But at the same time we are securing vaccines we must also ensure that countries are ready to receive them, deploy them, and build trust in them.”
Building on the work of the past months supporting country readiness efforts, a “Country Readiness Portal” will be launched by WHO this month, which will allow AMC participants to submit final national deployment and vaccination plans (NDVPs). This is a vital step before allocations can be made, to ensure that delivered doses are able to be effectively deployed and to identify where, if necessary, further support is needed.
“This is not just significant for COVAX, it is a major step forward for equitable access to vaccines, and an essential part of the global effort to beat this pandemic. We will only be safe anywhere if we are safe everywhere,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which leads COVAX procurement and delivery.
The COVAX Facility intends to provide all 190 participating economies with an indicative allocation of doses in one week’s time. This indicative allocation will provide interim guidance to participants – offering a minimum planning scenario to enable preparations for the final allocation of the number of doses each participant will receive.
COVAX now has agreements in place to access just over two billion doses of several promising vaccine candidates. Based on this, COVAX anticipates being able to provide participating economies doses of safe and effective vaccines – enough to protect health care and other frontline workers as well as some high-risk individuals – beginning in Q1 2021. The aim is to protect at least 20% of each participating population by the end of the year – unless a participant has requested a lower percentage of doses. At least 1.3 billion of these doses will be made available to the 92 economies eligible for the Gavi COVAX AMC by the end of 2021.
To meet its goal of securing two billion safe and effective vaccines in 2021, COVAX has built a diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates which mitigates the risk of a product failing in the development process, and ensures availability of products suitable for various contexts and settings. This work will continue at pace to enable further supply of vaccines suitable for use across a wide range of populations and settings in 2021 and beyond.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of UN (FAO) has launched an emergency assistance project to help the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict affected vulnerable groups in Armenia. The project will be implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Economy of Armenia, and the Food Safety Inspection Body aiming to provide very rapid response to cover critical gaps in support to Government’s interventions, through provision of agricultural inputs such as feed for animals, equipment and materials for building temporary shelter for displaced farming livestock.
“The project will be important to allow rapid response, but more support is needed for the upcoming agricultural season.” said Raimund Jehle, FAO representative in Armenia.
Following the conflict related to Nagorno-Karabakh it is estimated that 12 000 to 55 000 cows and between 60 000 and 90 000 small ruminants have been moved to Armenia by displaced families.

21 December 2020
21 December, Yerevan, Armenia – Today the UN Resident Coordinator in Armenia, Shombi Sharp met with the newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ara Ayvazyan. Deputy Minister Artak Apitonyan, other representatives of the Ministry and the Heads of UNHCR, UNDP, UNICEF and IOM also participated in the meeting.
The introductory meeting provided an opportunity to discuss with Minister Ayvazyan ongoing and future priorities of cooperation between the UN and Government, ranging from addressing the humanitarian and socio-economic impacts of overlapping challenges caused by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and COVID-19, to plans for the launch of a new five-year UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2021-2025 from next month.
In particular, Mr. Sharp presented UN Armenia efforts to support people from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone who were displaced to Armenia.
“From the early days of the renewed fighting, UN Armenia quickly put in place a structure of working groups under the Resident Coordinator’s Office, with support from UNHCR, to coordinate humanitarian efforts of UN agencies and partners for those forced to flee their homes and arriving in Armenia. In close partnership with Government and municipalities, the UN has provided support across a range of critical needs for those displaced and host communities, including shelter and non-food items, protection, food security and nutrition, health, early recovery, child protection, education, cash support,” said Mr. Sharp.
Since mid-October, the UN Country Team Agencies and partners have responded to the crisis with the distribution of tens of thousands of non-food items, such as bedding, towels, hygiene supplies, medical kits, school supplies and household items, in addition to hundreds of metric tons of food assistance and even energy needs, to thousands of displaced people and the communities they are hosted in. Mr. Sharp added that a new UN and partners’ multi-sector Response Plan addressing updated humanitarian, early recovery and host community needs will be launched in early January.
The UN Armenia Country Team also shared details on the ongoing UN Armenia COVID-19 Response and Recovery plan, launched in September with an overall target budget of USD 33 million including partner support. The Heads of UN Agencies informed the Minister on results achieved, as well as planned initiatives to support vulnerable people and communities in Armenia’s fight against COVID-19.
The sides also discussed the new UN Armenia new Cooperation Framework (CF) for 2021-2025, which sets out priority areas guiding UN support in Armenia for the next five years. Based on both Government priorities and widely surveyed citizen aspirations, the CF will focus on achieving Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals in the Armenian context.
On behalf of all UN Country Team Agencies, Mr. Sharp reaffirmed UN Armenia’s commitment to support the Armenian Government and people in building back better with resilience through the double crises, along a new path to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

Title: COVID-19: UNICEF warns of continued damage to learning and well-being as number of children affected by school closures soars again
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
15 December 2020
NEW YORK, 14 December 2020 – The number of schoolchildren affected by COVID-19-related school closures soared by 38 per cent in November, placing significant strain on the learning progress and well-being of an additional 90 million students globally.
According to data collected by UNESCO, classrooms for nearly 1 in 5 schoolchildren globally – or 320 million – are closed as of 1 December, an increase of nearly 90 million from 232 million on 1 November. In contrast, the month of October saw the number of schoolchildren affected by school closures decrease nearly three-fold.
“In spite of everything we have learned about COVID-19, the role of schools in community transmission, and the steps we can take to keep children safe at school, we are moving in the wrong direction—and doing so very quickly,” said Robert Jenkins, UNICEF Global Chief of Education. “Evidence shows that schools are not the main drivers of this pandemic. Yet, we are seeing an alarming trend whereby governments are once again closing down schools as a first recourse rather than a last resort. In some cases, this is being done nationwide, rather than community by community, and children are continuing to suffer the devastating impacts on their learning, mental and physical well-being and safety.”
When schools close, children risk losing their learning, support system, food and safety, with the most marginalized children – who are the most likely to drop out altogether – paying the heaviest price. And, as millions of children remain out of their classrooms for more than nine months, and many more are re-living the upheaval, UNICEF fears that too many schools are closing unnecessarily, and not enough emphasis has been placed on taking the necessary steps to make schools safe from COVID-19.
A recent global study using data from 191 countries showed no association between school status and COVID-19 infection rates in the community. With little evidence that schools contribute to higher rates of transmission, UNICEF urges governments to prioritize reopening schools and take all actions possible to make them as safe as possible.
School re-opening plans must include expanding access to education, including remote learning, especially for marginalized groups. Education systems must also be adapted and built to withstand future crises.
UNICEF’s Framework for Reopening Schools, issued jointly with UNESCO, UNHCR, WFP and the World Bank, offers practical advice for national and local authorities. The guidelines focus on policy reform; financing requirements; safe operations; compensatory learning; wellness and protection and reaching the most marginalized children.
“What we have learned about schooling during the time of COVID is clear: the benefits of keeping schools open far outweigh the costs of closing them, and nationwide closures of schools should be avoided at all costs,” said Jenkins.

Title: UNICEF calls for averting a lost generation as COVID-19 threatens to cause irreversible harm to children’s education, nutrition and well-being
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
20 November 2020
NEW YORK, 19 November 2020 – UNICEF warned in a new report today of significant and growing consequences for children as the COVID-19 pandemic lurches toward a second year.
Released ahead of World Children’s Day, Averting a Lost COVID Generation is the first UNICEF report to comprehensively outline the dire and growing consequences for children as the pandemic drags on. It shows that while symptoms among infected children remain mild, infections are rising and the longer-term impact on the education, nutrition and well-being of an entire generation of children and young people can be life-altering.
“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a persistent myth that children are barely affected by the disease. Nothing could be further from the truth,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “While children can get sick and can spread the disease, this is just the tip of the pandemic iceberg. Disruptions to key services and soaring poverty rates pose the biggest threat to children. The longer the crisis persists, the deeper its impact on children’s education, health, nutrition and well-being.”
The report finds that, as of 3 November, in 87 countries with age-disaggregated data, children and adolescents under 20 years of age accounted for 1 in 9 of COVID-19 infections, or 11 per cent of the 25.7 million infections reported by these countries.
While children can transmit the virus to each other and to older age groups, there is strong evidence that, with basic safety measures in place, the net benefits of keeping schools open outweigh the costs of closing them, the report notes. Schools are not a main driver of community transmission, and children are more likely to get the virus outside of school settings.
COVID-related disruptions to critical health and social services for children pose the most serious threat to children, the report says. Using new data from UNICEF surveys across 140 countries, it notes that:
More alarming data from the report include:
To respond to this crisis, UNICEF is calling on governments and partners to:

Title: UNHCR Armenia Emergency Humanitarian Assistance for persons displaced from Syria seeking protection in Armenia
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
13 October 2020
UNHCR Armenia has provided humanitarian assistance to the vulnerable families displaced from Syria to Armenia to help them meet their basic needs and mitigate the social and economic challenges caused by COVID-19 pandemic.
The humanitarian support was made possible in the frame of the “UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Multi-Partner Trust Fund” project aimed at supporting the Government’s efforts in ensuring the mainstreaming and inclusion of the displaced Syrian families in the national preparedness and response plans.
In the spirit of the United Nations and humanitarian values, and to complement the Government’s efforts in addressing the economic impact of the pandemic on the population, UNHCR elaborated an emergency support component targeting extremely vulnerable displaced families. Individuals ineligible for the ongoing state assistance schemes and, hence, unable to relieve the negative consequences of the pandemic on their livelihoods were among the beneficiaries.
During August-September 2020, one-time cash assistance was delivered by UNHCR’s partner - Mission Armenia NGO - in close cooperation with state authorities, UN agencies and partner NGOs. By eliminating duplications and applying complementarity, the Project ensured no one was marginalised and left behind. The beneficiary households were selected based on the following vulnerability criteria: single elderly, women or children at risk, persons with disabilities and specific needs, single parents or caregivers and those living in remote communities with limited access to livelihood and decent education, social services and community support, or state social protection schemes.
In view of the months-long COVID-19 emergency affecting displaced populations in Armenia, UNHCR has initiated two large-scale assistance projects as such, with the first project targeting 507 vulnerable refugees, asylum-seekers and other displaced populations accomplished last spring. The assistance projects went in parallel with distribution of food and clothing, masks and hygiene items, awareness-raising and counselling, care to the bed-ridden and elderly and outreach to the vulnerable families, and other emergency support.

Title: UNHCR launches new portal with verified higher education opportunities for refugees
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
12 October 2020
Developed in response to needs expressed by refugee students, the UNHCR Opportunities site intends to provide a global database of reliable, up-to-date information on refugee-eligible, scholarship programs both in their current countries of asylum and abroad.
“There has always been a need to centralize information on opportunities available to refugees, especially education opportunities. For most of us refugees, education is the means we use to keep hope and move forward,” said Arash Bordbar, a refugee in Australia. “Having a platform where we can see different opportunities and match them with our own expertise and aspirations can change the way we can and will contribute to the societies we live in”.
Only three per cent of refugees have access to higher education globally and many refugees may also not be aware of tertiary education programs available to them in their host countries or abroad. This digital platform aims to fill that gap.
As part of its education strategy, UNHCR and partners are also working to ensure that 15 per cent of young refugee women and men can access the benefits of higher education by the year 2030.
“Higher education opportunities are very limited for refugees, but they are life-changing. They can help equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to live productive, fulfilling and independent lives. We hope more universities and academic institutions will come forward and offer scholarships for refugees,” said UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, Gillian Triggs.
The Opportunities platform also aims to support the Global Compact on Refugees’ objectives in expanding third country solutions for refugees - alleviating some of the pressures on developing regions which are hosting 85 per cent of the world’s refugees.
“Opportunities to study abroad also complement humanitarian admissions and resettlement programs by facilitating safe and legal entry of refugees to other countries. Study routes not only support their empowerment but also help with finding them long-term solutions,” said Triggs.
Currently, the portal already covers some 20 programs offered by various education providers in over 60 countries, with UNHCR encouraging more universities to join the platform. Every service provider and program is verified independently by UNHCR prior to posting.
The portal will launch in two separate phases. The first phase launched this week focuses on higher education opportunities in line with UNHCR’s Education Strategy and the Three-Year Strategy on Resettlement and Complementary Pathways developed by UNHCR and partners.
The second phase will launch next year and will feature third-country labor mobility opportunities for skilled refugees.

Within the framework of the School Feeding programme, the UN WFP, together with the Social and Industrial Foodservice Institute and other partners, is carrying out assessments of the schools’ infrastructures in Lori and Kotayk regions. This aims to assess the conditions of school kitchens, canteens, food warehouses and provide necessary recommendations for their improvement in accordance with all food safety norms.
The studies aim to reveal the needs of schools for organising the provision of hot meals  and the scale of the needed renovation. Along with the renovations, the kitchens will be supported with having access to drinking water and hot water. The renovation will be followed by the provision of the necessary kitchen equipment, which will enable the children to be provided with safe and quality food.
Around 120 schools in Lori and 90 schools in Kotayk regions will be included in the renovation programme, receiving also high-quality kitchen equipment. As a result of the project, the conditions for providing food in schools and overall school capacities will be significantly improved to organize complete and safe food provision, Successful implementation of the programs will be followed by the transfer of the School Feeding programme to the state funding. The initiative is carried out with the participation of provincial administrations and the "National Sustainable School Feeding Foundation" of the Government of the Republic of Armenia.
Currently, around 12,392 primary school children in Lori and 15,755 children in Kotayk regions are enrolled in the School Feeding programme implemented by the WFP.

NEW YORK, 30 September 2020 - UNESCO, UNICEF and WHO have today issued considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19.
The updated advice for policymakers and educators on running schools as safe as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic, looks at risk-based approaches for school operations, based on the level and intensity of transmission rates at lower schooling levels; age-appropriate considerations for measures such as physical distancing and masks in schools; and other measures to mitigate against COVID-19 in schools.
At the forefront of all considerations and decisions should be the continuity of education for children for their overall well-being, health and safety.
Specific recommended measures in this updated advice include staggering the times for school opening, closing, mealtimes and breaks; handwashing facilities; cleaning of surfaces and shared objects; and establishing mechanisms to share information with parents, students and teachers.

Title: Conflict, climate crisis and COVID-19 pose great threats to the health of women and children
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
28 September 2020
New York City, 26 September 2020 – Fragile gains made to advance women and children’s health are threatened by conflict, the climate crisis and COVID-19, according to a new report.
Protect the Progress: Rise, Refocus, Recover, 2020 highlights that since the Every Woman Every Child movement was launched 10 years ago, spearheaded by the United Nations Secretary-General, there has been remarkable progress in improving the health of the world’s women, children and adolescents. For example, under-five deaths reached an all-time recorded low in 2019, and more than 1 billion children were vaccinated over the past decade. Coverage of immunization, skilled birth attendant and access to safe drinking water reached over 80 per cent. Maternal deaths declined by 35 per cent since 2000, with the most significant declines occurring from 2010. An estimated 25 million child marriages were also prevented over the past decade.
However, conflict, climate instability and the COVID-19 pandemic are putting the health and well-being of all children and adolescents at risk. The COVID-19 crisis, in particular, is exacerbating existing inequities, with reported disruptions in essential health interventions disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable women and children. At the height of pandemic lockdowns, schools were closed in 192 countries, affecting 1.6 billion students. Domestic violence and abuse of girls and women increased. Poverty and hunger are also on the rise.
“Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, a child under the age of five died every six seconds somewhere around the world,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “Millions of children living in conflict zones and fragile settings face even greater hardship with the onset of the pandemic. We need to work collectively to meet immediate needs caused by the pandemic while also strengthening health systems. Only then can we protect and save lives.”
In 2019, 5.2 million children under the age of 5 and 1 million adolescents died of preventable causes. Every 13 seconds a newborn baby died. Every hour 33 women did not survive childbirth; and 33,000 girls a day were forced into marriages, usually to much older men.
The report calls upon the global community to fight COVID-19 while honoring and respecting commitments that can improve the lives of women and children, and not widen the gap between promise and reality.

Title: UNDP and partners assess the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on community life in Armenia
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
17 September 2020
COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting the social and economic dimensions of community life at the core. While the impact of the pandemic varies across regions and communities, systemic issues and chain reactions to these issues will impact lives and livelihoods in Armenia for years to come, says the COVID-19 Socio-Economic Impact Assessment (SEIA) Report, produced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Armenia, in close collaboration with the Government of Armenia, in partnership with UNFPA, UN Women, UNAIDS, the Asian Development Bank, and the generous technical support and inputs from other UN agencies and International financial institutions. UNDP is the technical lead for UN’s socio-economic response to COVID-19 in Armenia, under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator.
Launched in May 2020, the nationwide assessment targets communities, with special focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and self-employed farmers operating in the communities; livelihoods/sources of income and the well-being of community members; systems of delivery and demand for basic services in communities, and provides thirty-seven recommendations that will help the Government of Armenia, in partnership with the international community, to respond to COVID-19 more effectively, in line with the principle of “Leaving No One Behind.” The recommendations are presented across four of the UN’s five pillars of policy interventions: (i) health protection, (ii) social protection, (iii) support the economy and (v) community resilience.
“Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on the Armenian society, economy and vulnerable groups is fundamental to tailor the Government of Armenia, UNDP and its partners response to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind. Building on lessons learned and the results of the SEIA, UNDP will continue supporting the Government of Armenia to look beyond recovery, towards 2030, in four main areas: governance, social protection, green economy, and digital disruption,” said Dmitry Mariyasin, UNDP Resident Representative in Armenia.
COVID-19 has impacted the health status of people nationwide. 40 percent of respondents reported that their psychological, mental and/or emotional health had been affected after the spread of coronavirus. This finding was particularly noticeable for Ararat, Armavir and Aragatsotn regions. Not easy access to health facilities and social assistance services in the communities, lost jobs and incomes as a result of lockdown were affecting factors to the health status of people. The need for effective work of social workers was perceived as never before taking into account the large share of people who experienced physiological and emotional issues.
On average, more than 10 percent of respondents of the household survey mentioned they had lost a job during the pandemic. This figure is relatively higher in Armavir, Lori and Vayots Dzor. Whilst the loss in job opportunities in urban areas is strongly correlated with the negative economic impact on SMEs, workers in rural areas are more impacted by the lack of opportunity to seek employment abroad, i.e. outgoing labour migration.
The pandemic considerably hit the SME sector, which makes the largest share of employment in the economy. More than 82 percent of the respondents indicated that they were negatively impacted by the crisis. Business activities of almost 65 percent of the surveyed businesses were temporarily shut down during the lockdown, and more than 50 percent of the SMEs engaged in tourism, manufacturing and trade sectors, reported that they were strongly hit by the crisis.
Agriculture has been relatively less affected. Around 40 percent of the respondent agricultural businesses remained non-affected or were positively impacted by the crisis. This can be explained by the seasonal nature of the Armenian agricultural sector.
According to survey results, most adversely affected businesses have been largely targeted by state support programmes. While one-time assistance grants to some extent mitigate the immediate impact of the crisis, they do not solve the persisting liquidity issues, mid-term and long-term challenges of SMEs.
Taking into account a potential second wave of the spread of the coronavirus, and the likelihood of other pandemics in the future, the SEIA argues the country should focus on building resilience and robustness of its systems, not least in relation to health, social and economic dimensions of community life.
Promotion of public-private partnerships in the regions, largely focusing on tourism and industry development secondary cities, softening tax regulations for SMEs can help mitigate the impact of COVID-19.  The SEIA also recommends developing effective communication and information sharing measures to support the beneficiaries to access the information, by creating user-friendly and relevant resources.
In total, about 7,200 people in the 10 regions of Armenia and in Yerevan took part in the SEIA process. Respondents represented 3,000 households, 1,537 SMEs and 515 farmers, 2,150 representatives from local authorities and service providers, 150 persons through focused group discussions, and over 2,000 people through the online survey on essential services throughout the 10 regions of Armenia.

Title: COVID-19 could reverse decades of progress toward eliminating preventable child deaths, agencies warn
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
17 September 2020
The number of global under-five deaths dropped to its lowest point on record in 2019 – down to 5.2 million from 12.5 million in 1990, according to new mortality estimates released by UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the World Bank Group.
Since then, however, surveys by UNICEF and WHO reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to health services that threaten to undo decades of hard-won progress.
“The global community has come too far towards eliminating preventable child deaths to allow the COVID-19 pandemic to stop us in our tracks,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “When children are denied access to health services because the system is overrun, and when women are afraid to give birth at the hospital for fear of infection, they, too, may become casualties of COVID-19. Without urgent investments to re-start disrupted health systems and services, millions of children under five, especially newborns, could die.”
Over the past 30 years, health services to prevent or treat causes of child death such as preterm, low birthweight, complications during birth, neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria, as well as vaccination, have played a large role in saving millions of lives.
Now countries worldwide are experiencing disruptions in child and maternal health services, such as health checkups, vaccinations and prenatal and post-natal care, due to resource constraints and a general uneasiness with using health services due to a fear of getting COVID-19.
A UNICEF survey conducted over the summer across 77 countries found that almost 68 per cent of countries reported at least some disruption in health checks for children and immunization services. In addition, 63 per cent of countries reported disruptions in antenatal checkups and 59 per cent in post-natal care.
A recent WHO survey based on responses from 105 countries revealed that 52 per cent of countries reported disruptions in health services for sick children and 51 per cent in services for management of malnutrition.
Health interventions such as these are critical for stopping preventable newborn and child deaths. For example, women who receive care by professional midwives trained according  to internationals standards are 16 per cent less likely to lose their baby and 24 per cent less likely to experience pre-term birth, according to WHO.
Based on the responses from countries that participated in the UNICEF and WHO surveys, the most commonly cited reasons for health service disruptions included parents avoiding health centers for fear of infection; transport restrictions; suspension or closure of services and facilities; fewer healthcare workers due to diversions or fear of infection due to shortages in personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves; and greater financial difficulties.
Even before COVID-19, newborns were at highest risk of death. In 2019, a newborn baby died every 13 seconds. Moreover, 47 per cent of all under-five deaths occurred in the neonatal period, up from 40 per cent in 1990. With severe disruptions in essential health services, newborn babies could be at much higher risk of dying. For example, in Cameroon, where 1 out of every 38 newborns died in 2019, the UNICEF survey reported an estimated 75 per cent disruptions in services for essential newborn care, antenatal check-ups, obstetric care and post-natal care.
In May, initial modelling by Johns Hopkins University showed that almost 6,000 additional children could die per day due to disruptions due to COVID-19.
These reports and surveys highlight the need for urgent action to restore and improve childbirth services and antenatal and postnatal care for mothers and babies, including having skilled health workers to care for them at birth. Working with parents to assuage their fears and reassure them is also important.

Title: Increased support vital to help children affected by Beirut explosions back to school, one month after devastating explosions – UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
16 September 2020
Urgent action and increased support are vital to ensure that all children affected by the Beirut Explosions can access education when the new school year starts later this month, UNICEF said today, one month after two massive explosions tore through the city. At least 163 public and private schools were damaged by the explosions – impacting over 70,000 students and 7,600 teachers. In addition, 20 TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) schools were damaged, impacting approximately 7,300 students.
Ensuring children have access to education is a key priority for UNICEF. Education not only provides children with opportunities for the future, it can also provide children and their parents with a sense of normalcy, return a feeling of hope for the future and provide a safe space for children who are experiencing trauma. An estimated 600,000 children live within a 20-kilometre radius of the blast and could be suffering negative short-term and long-term psychological impacts.
To coincide with the launch of a short report -“Everything around me is in ruins”-highlighting the impact of the explosions on children and families in Beirut and UNICEF’s response to date, UNICEF called on the international community to urgently scale up support for education for children and families in Beirut.
“When disasters hit, education can provide a vital lifeline to children whose lives have been turned upside down, providing a safe-space when in school and a sense of normalcy amidst the chaos,” said UNICEF Lebanon Representative Yukie Mokuo. “Therefore, we are incredibly concerned by the substantial damage sustained by schools in the hardest-hit neighbourhoods and the impact this could have for children. School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic adds a further challenge but it is essential that we find urgent solutions to get children back to learning – also remotely- as soon as possible.”
Based on initial assessments of schools within a 20-kilometre radius of the blast by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education thus far, approximately 80 per cent of schools have sustained light to moderate damage and 20 per cent have sustained heavy damage.  Resources are being rapidly mobilized to begin rehabilitation and get light to moderately damaged schools back in operation as soon as October together with UNESCO and other partners.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all schools plan to implement a blended approach involving both remote and face-to-face learning. However, these plans are further complicated by the impact of the blasts. As many homes were destroyed and families were forced to relocate, limited access to learning materials and connectivity need to be urgently addressed ahead of the imminent start of the 2020/21 school year. The most vulnerable children did not have learning materials and connectivity to start with and are at further risk of prolonged delay to access learning and even possibly drop out of school. Families who lost homes and livelihoods are also facing financial obstacles to enroll and support the education of their children.
UNICEF is working with its partners in areas affected by the explosions to support rehabilitation of damaged schools and replacement of furniture and equipment, promote school safety guidelines, train teachers in psychosocial support, and coordinate on the distribution of education supplies and early childhood development kits to teachers and caregivers. UNICEF is also looking for innovative solutions for remote learning with increased connectivity and access to electronic devices.
UNICEF’s response to meet other urgent needs of affected children has included so far:

Title: UNICEF to lead procurement and supply of COVID-19 vaccines in world’s largest and fastest ever operation of its kind
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
09 September 2020
NEW YORK/COPENHAGEN, 9 September 2020 – UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply COVID-19 vaccines in what could possibly be the world’s largest and fastest ever procurement and supply of vaccines, as part of the global vaccine plan of the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX Facility) led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
With several vaccine candidates showing promise, UNICEF, in collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund, will lead efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of the COVAX Facility for 92 low- and lower middle-income countries whose vaccine purchases will be supported by the mechanism through the Gavi COVAX AMC. In addition, UNICEF will also serve as procurement coordinator to support procurement by 80 higher-income economies, which have expressed their intent to participate in the COVAX Facility and would finance the vaccines from their own public finance budgets.
UNICEF will undertake these efforts in close collaboration with WHO, Gavi, CEPI, PAHO, World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other partners. The COVAX Facility is open to all countries to ensure that no country is left without access to a future COVID-19 vaccine.
“This is an all-hands on deck partnership between governments, manufacturers and multilateral partners to continue the high-stakes fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “In our collective pursuit of a vaccine, UNICEF is leveraging its unique strengths in vaccine supply to make sure that all countries have safe, fast and equitable access to the initial doses when they are available.”
UNICEF is the largest single vaccine buyer in the world, procuring more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunization and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. It is the main procurement partner of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which over the last 20 years has reached more than 760 million children with life-saving vaccines, preventing more than 13 million deaths. UNICEF will use its market shaping and procurement expertise to coordinate the procurement and supply of COVID-19 vaccines for the COVAX Facility.
In response to an expression of interest that UNICEF issued in June on behalf of the COVAX Facility, 28 manufacturers with production facilities in 10 countries shared their annual production plans for COVID-19 vaccines through 2023. According to the timelines the manufacturers indicated, the span from development to production could be one of the fastest scientific and manufacturing leaps in history.
A UNICEF market assessment, developed by compiling information submitted by vaccine manufacturers along with publicly available data, revealed that manufacturers are willing to collectively produce unprecedented quantities of vaccines over the coming 1-2 years. However, manufacturers signaled that investments to support such large-scale production of doses would be highly dependent on, among other things, whether clinical trials are successful, advance purchase agreements are put in place, funding is confirmed, and regulatory and registration pathways are streamlined.
Currently under development by WHO, the COVAX allocation framework will guide how and where UNICEF, PAHO and other procurers working on behalf of participating countries supply COVID-19 vaccines that are secured by the Facility. Initial dose allocations are expected to be scaled to enable countries to vaccinate health and social workers, followed by subsequent tranches of vaccine doses that would enable participating countries to vaccinate populations at higher risk of critical COVID-19 disease.
UNICEF, Gavi, WHO, and PAHO have started critical preparatory work for country vaccine readiness in collaboration with partners and national governments including:

Title: UNHCR Report: Coronavirus a dire threat to refugee education – half of the world’s refugee children out of school
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
03 September 2020
While children in every country have struggled with the impact of COVID-19 on their education, the report finds that refugee children have been particularly disadvantaged. Before the pandemic, a refugee child was twice as likely to be out of school as a non-refugee child. This is set to worsen – many may not have opportunities to resume their studies due to school closures, difficulties affording fees, uniforms or books, lack of access to technologies or because they are being required to work to support their families.
“Half of the world’s refugee children were already out of school,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. “After everything they have endured, we cannot rob them of their futures by denying them an education today. Despite the enormous challenges posed by the pandemic, with greater international support to refugees and their host communities, we can expand innovative ways to protect the critical gains made in refugee education over the past years.”
Without greater support, steady, hard-won increases in school, university, and technical and vocational education enrolment could be reversed – in some cases permanently - potentially jeopardizing efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4 of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all.
In a powerful Final Word to the report, the Vodafone Foundation and UNHCR Ambassador for the Instant Network Schools Programme, Mohamed Salah, said:
“Ensuring quality education today means less poverty and suffering tomorrow. Unless everyone plays their part, generations of children – millions of them in some of the world’s poorest regions – will face a bleak future. But if we work as a team, as one, we can give them the chance they deserve to have a dignified future. Let’s not miss this opportunity.”
The 2019 data in the report is based on reporting from twelve countries hosting more than half of the world’s refugee children. While there is 77% gross enrolment in primary school, only 31% of youth are enrolled in secondary school. At the level of higher education, only 3% of refugee youth are enrolled.
Far behind global averages, these statistics nevertheless do represent progress. Enrolment in secondary education rose with tens of thousands of refugee children newly attending school; a 2% increase in 2019 alone. However, the COVID-19 pandemic now threatens to undo this and other crucial advances. For refugee girls, the threat is particularly grave.
Refugee girls already have less access to education than boys and are half as likely to be enrolled in school by the time they reach secondary level. Based on UNHCR data, the Malala Fund has estimated that as a result of COVID-19, half of all refugee girls in secondary school will not return when classrooms reopen this month. For countries where refugee girls’ gross secondary enrolment was already less than 10%, all girls are at risk of dropping out for good, a chilling prediction that would have an impact for generations to come.
“I am especially concerned with the impact on refugee girls. Not only is education a human right, but the protection and economic benefits to refugee girls, their families, and their communities of education are clear. The international community simply cannot afford to fail to provide them with the opportunities that come through education,” said Grandi.
Adapting to the limitations imposed by COVID-19 has been especially tough for the 85% of the world’s refugees who live in developing or least developed countries. Mobile phones, tablets, laptops, connectivity, even radio sets are often not readily available to displaced communities.
UNHCR, governments, and partners are working tirelessly to bridge critical gaps and ensure the continuity of refugee education during the pandemic through connected learning, television and radio, and by supporting teachers and caregivers to engage with students while observing health guidelines.
The report shows how families, communities and governments are working to provide education to refugee children. It shows positive examples of governments that have written into law the right of refugee children to attend state schools, with stories from Ecuador and Iran. Examples of digital innovation are highlighted by the Minister of Education in Egypt, and by a family in Jordan benefiting from the transition to online learning. With over half the world’s refugees living in urban settings, the importance of cities welcoming refugees is emphasized, with the Mayor of Coventry, UK, sharing how the city manages and why it makes sense.
The report calls on governments, the private sector, civil society and other key stakeholders to join forces to find solutions which strengthen national education systems and link with pathways towards certified education, and to secure and safeguard education financing. Without such action, the report warns, we risk a lost generation of refugee children deprived of their education.
The risks to refugee education do not stop with COVID-19. Attacks on schools are a grim and growing reality. The report focuses on Africa’s Sahel region where violence has forced the closure of more than 2,500 schools affecting the education of 350,000 students.
‘Coming Together for Refugee Education’ is the fifth annual education report from UNHCR. The first, ‘Missing Out’, was released in 2016 in advance of the UN General Assembly’s Summit for Refugees and Migrants in September 2016. It called for donors to provide multi-year and predictable funding for refugee education. The second, ‘Left Behind’, was released in 2017 called for education to be considered fundamental to the response to refugee emergencies. The third, ‘Turn the Tide’, was released in 2018 and highlighted that four million refugee children did not attend school. The fourth ‘Stepping Up: Refugee Education in Crisis’ highlighted a huge drop off between secondary and tertiary education.
This year’s report includes a preface by Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees and a Final Word by footballer Mohamed Salah, who this year became the first Ambassador for Instant Network Schools, set up in 2013 by the Vodafone Foundation and UNHCR to connect refugee and host-country students to a quality digital education.

Title: Severe water shortages compound desperate situation for children and families in Beirut
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
28 August 2020
300,000 people in Beirut continue to face a lack of access to critical safe water and sanitation services, UNICEF warned today, more than three weeks after the huge explosion tore through Lebanon’s capital.
While public water infrastructure thankfully sustained only minor damage and remains mostly functional, the explosions compounded an already precarious situation in terms of access to safe water and sanitation in the greater Beirut area, with a significant number of water tanks and plumbing systems in buildings near the blast damaged. An estimated 130 buildings in the affected area have been completely disconnected from the main water network and the water systems of more than 500 occupied buildings have been damaged.
“As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, it is more critical than ever to ensure that children and families whose lives were turned upside down by the explosion have access to safe water and sanitation,” said UNICEF Lebanon Representative Yukie Mokuo. “When communities don’t have access to this critical necessity, the risk of water-borne diseases, as well as COVID-19, can skyrocket,” she added.
With many families now lacking a working connection to water mains, the lack of safe drinking water and sanitation is of increasing concern. Additionally, many households in affected neighborhoods typically purchase water—either bottled or trucked - and face challenges accessing water services, especially with rising summer temperatures, with prices also likely to rise.
The situation is particularly critical for the estimated 300,000 people – including around 100,000 children, whose homes were damaged or destroyed in the blast.
In the immediate aftermath of the explosion, UNICEF began working with partners and the water authorities to assess the damage to critical water infrastructure and begin addressing critical needs. UNICEF and partners supported the Beirut Mount Lebanon BML Water Establishment in assessing damage to public water networks and providing support on repairs and reoperation where necessary.
UNICEF and partners have re-connected over 100 buildings to the public water system and installed 570 water tanks in damaged households out of an estimated need of 3,300 tanks to be replaced; UNICEF also provided water to first respondents, and has distributed more than 4,340 hygiene kits and 620 baby kits to affected families, and ensured water trucking to 20 households and three hubs of the Lebanese Red Cross. This is especially critical in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as a key prevention method is regular handwashing with soap and safe water.
“One of our immediate priorities was ensuring that children and families affected, as well as critical frontline responders, had access to safe water,” said Yukie Mokuo. “Working with the relevant authorities and our partners we’ve been able to reach more than 6,650 children and their families, but there is so much more to do, and time is of the essence.”
UNICEF is also working to provide training and resources to equip thousands more young people across Lebanon with the skills they need to be part of the effort to rebuild their country, including training on repairs and maintenance on critical water and sanitation infrastructure.

Title: COVID-19: At least a third of the world’s schoolchildren unable to access remote learning during school closures, new UNICEF report says
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
27 August 2020
At least a third of the world’s schoolchildren – 463 million children globally – were unable to access remote learning when COVID-19 shuttered their schools, according to a new UNICEF report released today as countries across the world grapple with their ‘back-to-school’ plans.
“For at least 463 million children whose schools closed due to COVID-19, there was no such a thing as remote learning,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “The sheer number of children whose education was completely disrupted for months on end is a global education emergency. The repercussions could be felt in economies and societies for decades to come.”
At the height of nationwide and local lockdowns, nearly 1.5 billion schoolchildren were affected by school closures. The Remote Learning Reachability report outlines the limitations of remote learning and exposes deep inequalities in access.
The report uses a globally representative analysis on the availability of home-based technology and tools needed for remote learning among pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary and upper-secondary schoolchildren, with data from 100 countries. Data include access to television, radio and internet, and the availability of curriculum delivered across these platforms during school closures.
Although the numbers in the report present a concerning picture on the lack of remote learning during school closures, UNICEF warns the situation is likely far worse. Even when children have the technology and tools at home, they may not be able to learn remotely through those platforms due to competing factors in the home including pressure to do chores, being forced to work, a poor environment for learning and lack of support in using the online or broadcast curriculum.
The report highlights significant inequality across regions. Schoolchildren in sub-Saharan Africa are the most affected, with half of all students cannot be reached with remote learning.

The report also notes varying rates of access across age groups, with the youngest students most likely to miss out on remote learning during their most critical years of learning and development:
UNICEF urges governments to prioritize the safe re-opening of schools when they begin easing lockdown restrictions. When reopening is not possible, UNICEF urges governments to incorporate compensatory learning for lost instructional time into school continuity and reopening plans. School opening policies and practices must include expanding access to education, including remote learning, especially for marginalized groups. Education systems must also be adapted and built to withstand future crises.
UNICEF’s Framework for Reopening Schools, issued jointly with UNESCO, UNHCR, WFP and the World Bank, offers practical advice for national and local authorities. The guidelines focus on policy reform; financing requirements; safe operations; compensatory learning; wellness and protection and reaching the most marginalized children.

Title: UNICEF delivers critical supplies to support children and families affected by Beirut explosions
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
25 August 2020
UNICEF was able to respond immediately following the explosion, distributing pre-positioned supplies that were in stock in the immediate aftermath. At the same time, UNICEF worked to procure additional humanitarian supplies locally, wherever possible, including personal protective equipment (PPE), infection prevention and control (IPC) kits and other hygiene items, as well as supplies to support psycho-social assistance to children affected. To compliment the locally procured supplies, additional supplies were sent from UNICEF’s global supply hub in Copenhagen to Beirut, with further shipments planned in the coming days and weeks.
“Before the dust had begun to settle, UNICEF teams were working to ensure that urgently needed humanitarian supplies could reach children and families affected as soon as possible,” said UNICEF Lebanon Representative Yukie Mokuo. “Children have had their lives turned upside-down. Making sure that families have their basic needs met will allow them to start rebuilding their lives and look to the future,” she added.
As the number of COVID-19 cases in the country continues to surge, UNICEF was also able to deliver more than US$3.5 million worth of critical PPE and IPC kits - especially critical as 10 containers of PPE were destroyed in the explosions.
The humanitarian supplies were delivered with the assistance of the European Union’s European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) and the Government of Belgium and through a donation from the Sanofi Foundation.
UNICEF requires more than US$46.7 million to respond to the immediate needs of children and families over the next three months. The response focuses on keeping children safe; rehabilitating basic essential services; and equipping adolescents and young people with skills they need to be part of the effort to rebuild their country – all while limiting the spread of COVID-19.

Title: Marley family releases reimagined One Love single worldwide in support of UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
24 August 2020
Members of the Marley family, including Stephen, Cedella, and Skip Marley, have launched a reimagined version of the late Bob Marley’s iconic anthem One Love to support UNICEF’s work for children affected by COVID-19.
The song, released today by Tuff Gong International and Amplified Music Ltd and available on all major streaming platforms, was recorded by the Marley family in response to a call by UNICEF to help reimagine a fairer, more just world for children whose lives have been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to honor the late Bob Marley. The song and music video also come during the year-long celebration of Bob Marley’s 75th birthday, and feature artists and musicians from Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Jamaica, Mali, New Zealand, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria, the United Kingdom and the United States, including:
Stephen Marley;  Cedella Marley; Skip Marley; Ghetto Youths Foundation; Kim Nain; Manifesto JA;Teeks; 249Too Dope; Amrit Kaur; Mermans Mosengo; Jason Tamba; Natty;Dawtas of Aya; Raja Kumari; Patoranking; Babsy; Damascus Voice.
“One Love was written as a call for global solidarity at a time when the world was very divided, much as it is now. And yet, only by uniting with one love and one heart can we defeat this virus, protect our children, and make the world a more just and equal place,” said Cedella Marley. “All over the world, children and families are suffering. Whether they are living in refugee camps, slums or favelas, or they lack access to healthcare or school, or are being treated unfairly because of their race, religion, ethnicity or gender, our dream with this song is to reimagine a world where all children are treated equally – just as my father intended.”
“Being on this record with so many incredible musicians from around the world is a true blessing,” said Skip Marley.
True to the message of global unity in the song, the video is a compilation of footage from all around the world including children from Ghetto Youths Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by Stephen, Damian and Julian Marley; The Dharavi Dream Project in India; artists from Manifesto Ja in Jamaica and Road To Freedom and featuring appearances by the artists, as well as Indian actor and UNICEF celebrity advocate, Kareena Kapoor Khan and British actress Lena Headey.
COVID-19 has upended the lives of children around the world and exposed rampant inequalities both within and among countries. UNICEF estimates that an additional 6,000 children could die every day from preventable causes over the next six months – almost all of them (over 90 per cent) in low or lower-middle income countries – as the pandemic continues to weaken health systems and disrupt services. Children are also extremely vulnerable to the indirect impacts of COVID-19, such as school closures, food shortages, limited access to basic healthcare, and disruptions to medical supply chains.
In response, UNICEF has launched Reimagine — an urgent appeal to governments, the public, donors and the private sector to support UNICEF’s efforts to respond, recover and reimagine a world currently besieged by COVID-19.
“One Love is one of the world’s most iconic solidarity anthems. But it is also a song about children, and their hopes and dreams for a better, more united and equal world,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Today, in the midst of a global pandemic, responding to Bob Marley’s call to ‘hear the children crying one love’ is more important and relevant than ever. Only together can we defeat COVID-19 and reimagine a more equal, less discriminatory world for children.”
All proceeds from the song and related activities will directly support Reimagine and help UNICEF respond to the immediate needs by providing soap, masks, gloves, hygiene kits, protective equipment and life-saving information for children and families; support near term recovery efforts, including by supporting education, protection and healthcare systems; and further UNICEF’s work to reimagine a fairer, more just world for children.
To coincide with the release of the song, members of the public are invited to engage in UNICEF’s One Love campaign through activations on social media channels, which include support from jewellery brand Pandora and short-form mobile video platform TikTok.
UNICEF is partnering with TikTok to launch the #OneLoveOneHeart challenge, encouraging TikTok users to post videos using the One Love chorus; revealing who or what they hold dear – i.e their One Love – nominating five friends or family members to do the same and donating to One Love for UNICEF.
Continuing Pandora’s support for One Love, the UNICEF global partner has launched an augmented reality #OneLoveOneHeart filter on Instagram. Every use of the filter will unlock US $1, up to the total of US $ 1 million that Pandora has committed to One Love for UNICEF.
The first video performance of One Love by the Marley family will air during a One Love Livestream Show on UNICEF’s TikTok account on 18 July 2020 at 8:00pm EST. TikTok users will be able to donate to UNICEF throughout the livestream, with Pandora matching donations.

Title: Together Against Coronavirus. USAID and UNICEF continue support to Armenia to reduce infection rate
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
24 August 2020
This one-year project will support Armenia to reduce the rate of transmission across the country, equip the healthcare system with vital equipment and supplies; as well as equip healthcare workers with necessary knowledge about the pandemic and support families with reliable information on how to mitigate the risks and prevent the spread of the virus.
“COVID-19 pandemic posed a serious challenge to all health systems in the world. While healthcare workers continue to work tirelessly on the frontline, we all need to unite to flatten the curve and ensure the continuity of all health services,” said Deborah Grieser, USAID Armenia Mission Director.
Through this project, UNICEF has already procured and provided 10,000 COVID-19 test kits and 24 oxygen-concentrators and 2,000 nasal prongs to the Ministry of Health. The latter are required for oxygen therapy for patients with COVID-19, which the Ministry will distribute upon need among healthcare facilities (hospitals and polyclinics) that service patients infected with coronavirus.
Within the framework of this project, UNICEF also intends to distribute 500 dispensers, suitable for liquid soap and alcohol-based hand rub to healthcare facilities - including maternity wards - in five marzes: Lori, Shirak, Tavush, Aragatsotn, and Gegharkunik, followed by other marzes later on.
“Without urgent action, this health crisis risks becoming a child-rights crisis. Disruptions to society have had a heavy toll on children – their well-being, safety, and risked their future. Only through effective coordination can we keep Armenian girls and boys healthy, as well as ensure that they continue learning and grow up in a loving environment,” noted Liv Elin Indreiten, Acting UNICEF Representative.
With the funding of USAID, UNICEF will also procure five digital mobile X-Ray systems – critical for management of COVID-19 cases. These items will also be provided to the Ministry to distribute to hospitals in need.
UNICEF Armenia, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and a national team of experts, has already developed clinical modules and guidelines on breastfeeding, infant and young child nutrition, home visiting practices, hand and respiratory hygiene and safe immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic. These modules are consolidated into one training package for health providers, approved by the Ministry as national standards. Training will be delivered nationally, covering almost 3000 family physicians, pediatricians, and nurses in all marzes, including Yerevan.
Besides these vital forms of support to the healthcare system, USAID and UNICEF intend to ensure that families are provided with reliable information about how to mitigate the risks of infection, how to maintain precautionary behavior during the pandemic and how to withstand the myriad of issues arising from the lockdown. UNICEF websites (www.unicef.am/կորոնավիրուս and www.babycef.am) will complement official sources of information with the latest advice and tips from healthcare professionals, tailored for parents and children.
Based on the UNICEF, USAID and Ministry of Health recommendations, we will deliver answers to common questions and concerns that parents have in relation to COVID-19, from breastfeeding, newborn and child-care and nutrition to play, hand and respiratory hygiene and vaccinations.

Title: A third of the world’s children poisoned by lead, new groundbreaking analysis says
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
24 August 2020
Lead poisoning is affecting children on a massive and previously unknown scale, according to a new report launched today by UNICEF and Pure Earth.
The report, the first of its kind, says that around 1 in 3 children – up to 800 million globally – have blood lead levels at or above 5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL), the level at which the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have stated requires intervention. Nearly half of these children live in South Asia.
“With few early symptoms, lead silently wreaks havoc on children’s health and development, with possibly fatal consequences,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “Knowing how widespread lead pollution is – and understanding the destruction it causes to individual lives and communities – must inspire urgent action to protect children once and for all.”
The report, The Toxic Truth: Children’s exposure to lead pollution undermines a generation of potential, is an analysis of childhood lead exposure undertaken by the Institute of Health Metrics Evaluation (IHME) and verified with a study approved for publication in Environmental Health Perspectives.
It notes that lead is a potent neurotoxin which causes irreparable harm to children’s brains. It is particularly destructive to babies and children under the age of five as it damages their brains before they have had the opportunity to fully develop, causing them lifelong neurological, cognitive and physical impairment.
Childhood lead exposure has also been linked to mental health and behavioural problems, and to an increase of crime and violence. Older children suffer severe consequences including increased risk of kidney damage and cardiovascular diseases in later life, the report says.
Childhood lead exposure is estimated to cost lower- and middle-income countries almost USD $1 trillion due to lost economic potential of these children over their lifetime.
The report notes that informal and substandard recycling of lead-acid batteries is a leading contributor to lead poisoning in children living in low and middle-income countries, which have experienced a three-fold increase in the number of vehicles since 2000. The increase in vehicle ownership, combined with the lack of vehicle battery recycling regulation and infrastructure, has resulted in up to 50 per cent of lead-acid batteries being unsafely recycled in the informal economy.
Workers in dangerous and often illegal recycling operations break open battery cases, spill acid and lead dust in the soil, and smelt the recovered lead in crude, open-air furnaces that emit toxic fumes poisoning the surrounding community. Often, the workers and the exposed community are not aware that lead is potent neurotoxin.
Other sources of childhood lead exposure include lead in water from the use of leaded pipes; lead from active industry, such as mining and battery recycling; lead-based paint and pigments; leaded gasoline, which has declined considerably in recent decades, but was a major historical source; lead solder in food cans; and lead in spices, cosmetics, ayurvedic medicines, toys and other consumer products. Parents whose occupations involve working with lead often bring contaminated dust home on their clothes, hair, hands and shoes, thus inadvertently exposing their children to the toxic element.
“The good news is that lead can be recycled safely without exposing workers, their children, and surrounding neighborhoods. Lead-contaminated sites can be remediated and restored,” said Richard Fuller, President of Pure Earth. “People can be educated about the dangers of lead and empowered to protect themselves and their children.  The return on the investment is enormous: improved health, increased productivity, higher IQs, less violence, and brighter futures for millions of children across the planet.”
The report notes that governments in affected countries can address lead pollution through:
Monitoring and reporting systems including building capacity for blood lead level testing.
Prevention and control measures including preventing children’s exposure to high-risk sites and products that contain lead, such as certain ceramics, paints, toys and spices.
Management, treatment and remediation including strengthening health systems so that they are equipped to detect, monitor and treat lead exposure among children; and providing children with enhanced educational interventions and cognitive behavioural therapy to better manage the negative effects of lead exposure.
Public awareness and behaviour change including creating continual public education campaigns about the dangers and sources of lead exposure with direct appeals to parents, schools, community leaders and healthcare workers.
Legislation and policy including developing, implementing and enforcing environmental, health and safety standards for manufacturing and recycling of lead acid batteries and e-waste, and enforcing environmental and air-quality regulations for smelting operations.
Global and regional action including creating global standard units of measure to verify the results of pollution intervention on public health, the environment and local economies; building an international registry of anonymized results of blood lead level studies; and creating international standards and norms around recycling and transportation of used lead acid batteries.

Title: Beirut explosions: UNICEF urgently appeals for US$46.7 million to support 100,000 children over the next three months
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
20 August 2020
UNICEF is urgently appealing for US$46.7 million to respond to the needs of children and families severely affected by the Beirut explosions on 4 August. The death toll from the explosion has increased to at least 171, including three children. A further 6,000 people, including around 1,000 children, were injured. UNICEF estimates that nearly 100,000 children had their homes damaged or destroyed. Many households are in poor living conditions with no proper access to water and sanitation.
“The Beirut explosions have created additional trauma for the children of Lebanon who also have to cope with the impact of a steep economic crisis and a raging pandemic,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henriette Fore. “UNICEF and partners have been on the ground from day one, salvaging vaccine stockpiles, distributing water, and helping clean up debris. We count on our donors to help us support the children and families who are affected by this tragedy and who will need all the support they can get to rebuild their lives.”
The Beirut explosions come on top of an already collapsed economy and a surge in COVID-19 cases (7,711 total cases as of August 13).
As highlighted by UNICEF Lebanon Deputy Representative, Violet Speek-Warnery, during an online press briefing with international media based in Geneva, UNICEF is working on the ground with partners to meet the urgent needs. The revised funding appeal is focused on three pillars:
Keeping children safe:
Mental health and psychosocial support to help children and their families recover from trauma. This comes in the form of psychosocial kits for children and parents; to setting up child-friendly spaces in affected areas; to the provision of more specialized, intensive support, including hotlines and provision of referral tents.
Services to protect children from gender-based violence and the provision of hygiene supplies such as sanitary pads.
One-off emergency cash grant to make sure that the most economically vulnerable families can meet their children’s basic needs.
Facilitating the distribution and logistics of 10,000 tetanus vaccines administered to injured people as a precautionary measure.
Rehabilitating the basic essential services:
Many homes still don’t have access to safe, sufficient water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene. The response includes repairing damaged water and sanitation facilities and systems.
The appeal covers support for the rehabilitation of 16 damaged primary health care centers that serve 160,000 people and equipping them with critically needed supplies, including much-needed personal protective equipment for health and frontline workers who are simultaneously responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Supplies continue to arrive, including a shipment with over 3.5 million surgical masks, 2.6 million pairs of gloves and other equipment including face shields, coveralls, thermometers, goggles and headcovers.
Relocating at least 80 percent of acute and chronic medications and all of vaccines stored in the central warehouse damaged by the blast.
And, crucially for children, rehabilitating damaged schools and making sure that children whose homes have been damaged can keep learning – whether in classrooms, or via COVID-enforced distance learning.
Finally, UNICEF is supporting young volunteers who are helping affected families with debris cleaning, cooking and food and water distribution, reaching 3,500 people so far. These young volunteers are part of ongoing programmes supported by UNICEF to strengthen their skills for income generation. The revised appeal will strengthen training and resources to equip thousands more adolescents and young people with the skills they need – whether it is carpentry or plumbing or construction – to be part of the effort to rebuild their country.

Title: 2 in 5 schools around the world lacked basic handwashing facilities prior to COVID-19 pandemic — UNICEF, WHO
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
20 August 2020
“Global school closures since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have presented an unprecedented challenge to children’s education and wellbeing,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “We must prioritize children’s learning. This means making sure that schools are safe to reopen – including with access to hand hygiene, clean drinking water and safe sanitation.”
According to the report, around 818 million children lack basic handwashing facilities at their schools, which puts them at increased risk of COVID-19 and other transmittable diseases. More than one third of these children (295 million) are from sub-Saharan Africa. In the least developed countries, 7 out of 10 schools lack basic handwashing facilities and half of schools lack basic sanitation and water services.
The report stresses that governments seeking to control the spread of COVID-19 must balance the need for implementation of public health measures versus the associated social and economic impacts of lockdown measures. Evidence of the negative impacts of prolonged school closures on children’s safety, wellbeing and learning are well-documented, the report says.
“Access to water, sanitation and hygiene services is essential for effective infection prevention and control in all settings, including schools," said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "It must be a major focus of government strategies for the safe reopening and operation of schools during the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic.”
Other key findings from the report include:
The report identifies several resources necessary for COVID-19 prevention and control in schools, including 10 immediate actions and safety checklists. It builds on guidelines on the safe reopening of schools issued by UNESCO, UNICEF, WFP and the World Bank with practical advice for national and local authorities on how to prepare for safe school reopening and keep children safe when they return to school.

To support the reopening of schools and preschools in Armenia, UNICEF:
In September, with the funding of the European Union, UNICEF will provide hygiene kits to around 370 preschools and kindergartens in Lori, Shirak, Tavush, Syunik and Gegharkunik marzes.

Title: FAO and Green Climate Fund partner for climate change adaptation and green growth in Armenia
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
19 August 2020
Climate change threatens over 15 percent of Armenia’s higher plant species with extinction. Semi-desert and desert areas are projected to expand by 30 percent, accelerating desertification. More frequent summer droughts and water stress will reduce the growth rate of trees and increase susceptibility to pests and diseases; at the same time, the frequency and intensity of wildfires may increase, leading to an estimated 14 000 to 17 000 ha of forest loss by 2030.
The eight-year Green Climate Fund project, with a total budget of USD 18.7 million, will be implemented by FAO and the Environmental Project Implementation Unit in close cooperation with the Ministry of Environment of Armenia. The effort will be further supported financially by the Government of Armenia, the Austrian Development Agency, the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, and WWF Armenia.
“Restarting from nature and its ecosystems will allow the country to set an example for carbon reduction programmes and climate adaptive silviculture,” said FAO Representative, Raimund Jehle.
The two target regions – Lori marz in the north and Syunik in the south – were selected based on the forest type, population density, local poverty levels, and exposure to climate change, in addition to its impact on important forest ecosystems.
Through investments in agroforestry and capacity development, the project will increase national forest cover and carbon removal from forests by reducing fuelwood demand, supporting reforestation and afforestation, and introducing sustainable and climate adaptive forest management.
Armenian forests are expected to suffer significant growth losses as climate change makes trees more vulnerable to attack by insect pests. Severe and repeated pest infestations will lead to increased tree mortality, which also contributes to the accumulation of drying dead organic matter in forests, increasing the risk of wildfires.
A key element of the project is the involvement of the private sector for a wider impact, and to ensure long-term sustainability by introducing energy-efficient heating stoves for rural areas.
“By financing the development of low-cost, energy-efficient stoves in the country, the project will increase awareness of the affordable heating stove options available to people living in rural areas, which can lead to savings for private households, as well as public benefits, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions,” said FAO’s Jacopo Monzini, leader of the GCF project formulation team.
Involving multiple stakeholders is a key focus of the project. During the formulation, a diverse group of experts from ministries, non-governmental organizations, research institutes, and international organizations were consulted to maximize the ownership at national level.

Title: Armenia works towards improving its legal framework to reverse forest degradation
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
13 August 2020
The development of the document was supported by an FAO project, upon request of the Government of Armenia, that aims to increase national forest cover to over 20.1 percent by 2050 and, at the same time, improve the condition of existing forests through the establishment of an enabling policy framework.
“The new National Forest Programme will be the cornerstone of Armenia’s efforts to reverse forest degradation and meet the international commitments of the country on increasing forest cover,” said Norbert Winkler-Ráthonyi, FAO forestry officer.
In the past decades, a number of policy documents have been developed with support from international organizations that concern forests and forest management aimed at reversing the trend of forest degradation and overexploitation of forests in Armenia. These documents include the national forest policy and strategy (2004), the national forest programme (2005); and several by-laws and related documents.
To continue the work towards this goal, the Ministry of Environment requested technical assistance from FAO to address the urgent need for a renewed national forest policy and strategy, as well as for a revision of the National Forest Programme.
The project contributes to develop activities for sustainable forest management in Armenia in line with government priorities, as well as FAO’s regional and global objectives, and with the Sustainable Development Goals. The main partner is the Government of the Republic of Armenia, specifically the Ministry of Environment and public bodies in charge of forestry and related disciplines, and also non-governmental organizations involved in environmental protection and natural resource management.

Title: Pandemic’s impact on agrifood production and markets in Eurasia is as diverse as the region itself
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
03 August 2020
3 August 2020, Budapest, Hungary – Prospects for cereal production in Europe and Central Asia are generally positive, but a reduction is expected in regional wheat production, according to a regional FAO policy brief on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some food prices in the countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus peaked during the first six months of 2020, but prolonged logistics, trade and market disruptions continue to challenge agrifood value chains, according to the report.
The Europe and Central Asia: Regional food market situation and policy bulletin overviews market supply and demand in the region and looks at the responses to the COVID-19 pandemic of agrifood markets, value chains and policies. The information was gathered through ongoing surveys and monitoring in the region.
Overall cereal production in 2020 is expected to be close to the five-year average, but wheat – an important staple for export and consumption – is expected to be down in the new crop season due to unfavourable weather and hampered access to inputs (such as seeds and fertilizers) in some countries, particularly in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. In the same countries, plus Georgia, the retail prices of most key basic foods saw large increases in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2019, implying a significant increase in the cost of a healthy diet.
“In some countries, mainly in Central Asia and the Caucasus, households spend almost half of their budgets on food, which is true especially for vulnerable groups, such as pensioners in Tajikistan,” said Fang Cheng, FAO commodity and trade economist. “For them, the price increases in staple foods as a result of COVID-19 can have significantly negative impacts on food security and nutrition.”
All actors in the agrifood value chain – not just consumers – are affected by the situation.
Some farmers have reported spending less money on food, and some have reported selling productive assets to cope with financial shocks. According to FAO’s latest surveys, conducted in June, the COVID-19 pandemic has had negative impacts on transportation, storage, sales, financial situations, input availability and labour markets. Despite the easing of lockdown measures, agrifood transport still has not fully recovered, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. These countries also flagged severe storage bottlenecks during the harvesting season.
Disruptions in sales have occurred, among other reasons, due to lower demand and stricter food safety controls, mostly for fruits, vegetables, potatoes and live animals. A larger share of livestock farmers reported financial difficulties than did crop farmers and their traders/processors, with the survey showing hampered access to feed, medicines and veterinary products.
“In the spring, after the global COVID-19 pandemic started, export restrictions were introduced in large exporting and net importing countries alike,” Fang said. “Most of these policies have been lifted, fortunately, as trade is crucial in keeping food markets stable and food and agricultural systems alive.”
North Macedonia and Uzbekistan, in addition to other countries, have established “green corridors,” a mechanism for customs clearance, to support regional agrifood trade. Digital solutions, such as the Digital Agriculture Marketplace Platform in Turkey, have been adopted in agricultural marketing. Many countries – including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Republic of Moldova, Turkey and Uzbekistan – have created financial initiatives and programmes to help overcome the financial challenges of the crisis. Decision-makers also have developed social support packages to provide food access to vulnerable populations in Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kyrgyzstan, Montenegro, and Tajikistan.

Title: UN WFP and House of Hope Foundation will provide food assistance to vulnerable families living in Armenian provinces during these difficult times due to COVID-19
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
31 July 2020
Due to the unpredictable conditions dictated by the coronavirus, WFP, in partnership with the House of Hope Foundation, initiated required food assistance, mostly to the vulnerable families in border communities of Armenia.
Now, when the Foundation’s beneficiaries are facing economic hardship  due to the coronavirus situation, providing them food assistance has become a priority. WFP has promptly reacted to the Foundation's call to support vulnerable families by providing them with necessary assistance and delivered 867 liters of oil, thus supplementing the food packages to be distributed to the beneficiaries (3 liters of oil for each child). The Foundation’s goal is to promote the improvement of the social and educational situation of RA citizens, the development of their professional abilities, the skills of acting in emergency situations, and the development of a culture of resilience in the country.
The Foundation and WFP will deliver food packages to Berd, Ijevan, Koti, Voskevan, Berkaber, Nerqin Karmiraghbyur, Artsvaberd, Navur and Parvaqar communities of Tavush province, as well as to Gyumri in Shirak, Talin in Aragatsotn and Armavir in Armavir provinces, total of 289 children and their families. Such assistance, provided in conjunction with WFP and the charitable Foundation, aims to alleviate the current crisis as much as possible, to promote the well-being of the most vulnerable families.
Throughout the crisis, in Armenia and around the world, WFP continues supporting the food security of individuals with the mobilization of additional resources, relying on its expertise in logistics and supply chain, as well as identifying new partners and encouraging them to 'come together' in joining forces amidst the pandemic.

Title: UNECE/FAO studies contribute to sustainable management of precious forests of the Caucasus and Central Asia
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
24 July 2020
To support evidence-based management of these forests, UNECE and FAO have published bilingual (English/Russian) studies on Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, providing a detailed overview of forest resources and the forest sector in each of the countries, as well as policies and institutions in place for addressing challenges for sustainable forest management.
“As such, they offer a practical resource for policy-makers in the region to plan and implement policies that will help local communities enjoy the full range of benefits provided by their surrounding forests, while ensuring that, at the same, such benefits will also be available to future generations,” said Ekrem Yazici, FAO Forestry Officer.
Presently, forests cover in total only around 4 and 13 percent of the territory in the eight countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus, except for Georgia, where this number is closer to 40 percent. Forests have succumbed over recent decades to pressures exerted by the region’s characteristic harsh climate – exacerbated by climate change – overgrazing, and excessive forest cutting undertaken to provide fuelwood for local communities.
“Forests of the Caucasus and Central Asia are so diverse and important, and they deserve more attention from, and recognition by, national and international communities. We hope that these publications will help mobilise support and resources for their proper protection, sustainable management, and restoration”, said Roman Michalak, Economic Affairs Officer, who coordinated the preparation of these studies.
But natural and anthropogenic difficulties are not the only things that make sustainable management of forests in this region particularly challenging. Up until very recently, little information about the state of forests in Central Asia and the Caucasus was available internationally. In addition, the information available so far was scattered through various publications and sources, with none of them focused on the region’s specificities and challenges.
In an attempt to change this, and in close collaboration with national experts, UNECE and FAO launched the first-ever comprehensive overview of the State of Forests of the Caucasus and Central Asia back in 2019. This overview was followed and complemented by “Guidelines for the Development of a Criteria and Indicator Set for Sustainable Forest Management in the Caucasus and Central Asia,” as part of the project for strengthening the national capacity of countries in the region to develop national criteria and indicators, as well as accountability systems for sustainable forest management.

24 July 2020
According to the latest reports, the death-toll could be as high as 100 with 4,000 wounded and over 300,000 people displaced. UNICEF is concerned that children are among the casualties and we are aware that those who survived are traumatized and in shock.
“Our hearts are with children and families who have been impacted, especially those who lost their loved ones. We wish a speedy recovery to the injured.
“UNICEF’s team in Beirut has not been spared. One of our colleagues lost his spouse, seven of our staff were mildly injured and dozens of colleagues' homes were damaged. Most of our staff- as with most people in Lebanon- are in a state of shock.
“UNICEF is co-ordinating very closely with authorities and partners on the ground to respond to the needs of those affected, including health workers and other front-line workers. We have provided drinking water to the staff at the Beirut port and are supporting the Ministry of Public Health to take out what is left of stored medicines and vaccines in a warehouse at the port. Child protection partners are providing psycho-social support to affected children across the city. Over the coming days, we will increase our efforts to reach families in need with assistance.
“Yesterday’s catastrophe in Beirut adds to what has already been a terrible crisis for the people of Lebanon, compounded by an economic collapse and a surge in COVID-19 cases. The pandemic meant that hospitals are already overwhelmed, and front-line workers are exhausted.
“UNICEF confirms its commitment towards the people of Lebanon, the authorities and all partners on the ground. We are on the ground and will do everything possible to provide much-needed assistance today and in the long run.

Title: 40 million children miss out on early education in critical pre-school year due to COVID-19
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
23 July 2020
Produced by UNICEF’s Office of Research – Innocenti, the research brief looks at the state of childcare and early childhood education globally and includes an analysis of the impact of widespread COVID-19 closures of these vital family services.
“Education disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are preventing children from getting their education off to the best possible start,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Childcare and early childhood education build a foundation upon which every aspect of children’s development relies. The pandemic is putting that foundation under serious threat.”
Childcare in a global crisis: The impact of COVID-19 on work and family life notes that lockdowns have left many parents struggling to balance childcare and paid employment, with a disproportionate burden placed on women who, on average, spend more than three times longer on care and housework than men.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, unaffordable, poor-quality or inaccessible childcare and early childhood education facilities forced many parents to leave young children in unsafe and unstimulating environments at a critical point in their development, with more than 35 million children under the age of five globally sometimes left without adult supervision.
Out of 166 countries, less than half provide tuition-free pre-primary programmes of at least one year, dropping to just 15 per cent among low-income countries.
Many young children who remain at home do not get the play and early learning support they need for healthy development. In 54 low- and middle-income countries with recent data, around 40 per cent of children aged between 3 and 5 years old were not receiving social-emotional and cognitive stimulation from any adult in their household.
Lack of childcare and early education options also leaves many parents, particularly mothers working in the informal sector, with no choice but to bring their young children to work. More than 9 in 10 women in Africa and nearly 7 in 10 in Asia and the Pacific work in the informal sector and have limited to no access to any form of social protection. Many parents become trapped in this unreliable, poorly paid employment, contributing to intergenerational cycles of poverty, the report says.
Access to affordable, quality childcare and early childhood education are critical for the development of families and socially cohesive societies. UNICEF advocates for accessible, affordable and quality childcare from birth to children’s entry into the first grade of school.
The guidance outlines family-friendly policies including:
“The COVID-19 pandemic is making a global childcare crisis even worse,” Fore said. “Families need support from their governments and their employers to weather this storm and safeguard their children’s learning and development.”

Title: As more go hungry and malnutrition persists, achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 in doubt, UN report warns
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
14 July 2020
More people are going hungry, an annual study by the United Nations has found. Tens of millions have joined the ranks of the chronically undernourished over the past five years, and countries around the world continue to struggle with multiple forms of malnutrition.
The latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, published today, estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019 – up by 10 million from 2018, and by nearly 60 million in five years. High costs and low affordability also mean billions cannot eat healthily or nutritiously. The hungry are most numerous in Asia, but expanding fastest in Africa. Across the planet, the report forecasts, the COVID-19 pandemic could tip over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020.
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World is the most authoritative global study tracking progress towards ending hunger and malnutrition. It is produced jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agriculture (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Asia remains home to the greatest number of undernourished (381 million). Africa is second (250 million), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million). The global prevalence of undernourishment – or overall percentage of hungry people – has changed little at 8.9 percent, but the absolute numbers have been rising since 2014. This means that over the last five years, hunger has grown in step with the global population.
As progress in fighting hunger stalls, the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems – understood as all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution and consumption of food. While it is too soon to assess the full impact of the lockdowns and other containment measures, the report estimates that at a minimum, another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, may go hungry in 2020 as a result of the economic recession triggered by COVID-19.
Overcoming hunger and malnutrition in all its forms (including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity) is about more than securing enough food to survive: what people eat – and especially what children eat – must also be nutritious.  Yet a key obstacle is the high cost of nutritious foods and the low affordability of healthy diets for vast numbers of families.
The report presents evidence that a healthy diet costs far more than US$ 1.90/day, the international poverty threshold. It puts the price of even the least expensive healthy diet at five times the price of filling stomachs with starch only. Nutrient-rich dairy, fruits, vegetables and protein-rich foods (plant and animal-sourced) are the most expensive food groups globally.
According to the report, in 2019, between a quarter and a third of children under five (191 million) were stunted or wasted – too short or too thin. Another 38 million under-fives were overweight. Among adults, meanwhile, obesity has become a global pandemic in its own right.
The report argues that once sustainability considerations are factored in, a global switch to healthy diets would help check the backslide into hunger while delivering enormous savings. It calculates that such a shift would allow the health costs associated with unhealthy diets, estimated to reach US$ 1.3 trillion a year in 2030, to be almost entirely offset; while the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, estimated at US$ 1.7 trillion, could be cut by up to three-quarters.
The report urges a transformation of food systems to reduce the cost of nutritious foods and increase the affordability of healthy diets. While the specific solutions will differ from country to country, and even within them, the overall answers lie with interventions along the entire food supply chain, in the food environment, and in the political economy that shapes trade, public expenditure and investment policies.
The study calls on governments to mainstream nutrition in their approaches to agriculture; work to cut cost-escalating factors in the production, storage, transport, distribution and marketing of food – including by reducing inefficiencies and food loss and waste; support local small-scale producers to grow and sell more nutritious foods, and secure their access to markets; prioritize children’s nutrition as the category in greatest need; foster behaviour change through education and communication; and embed nutrition in national social protection systems and investment strategies.

Title: Marley family to ‘reimagine’ Bob Marley’s One Love in support of UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
10 July 2020
Members of the Marley family will reimagine the late Bob Marley’s iconic anthem One Love to support UNICEF’s work to reimagine a fairer, more just world for children whose lives have been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Tuff Gong International and Amplified Music will release a new version of the seminal song on 17 July. All proceeds from the song and related activities will directly support Reimagine, UNICEF’s global campaign to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from becoming a lasting crisis for children and to ensure the post-pandemic world is more fair and equal for every child.
Starting today, jewelry brand and UNICEF global partner Pandora will match every dollar donated by the public to One Love, up to the value of US$1 million.
“Over forty years ago, my father wrote One Love about unity, peace and universal love during a time when there was much trouble in the world. Even in a time when we aren’t able to get together, his message remains true today, we can get through this global crisis if we come together through one love and one heart,” said Cedella Marley.
Originally recorded in 1977 by Bob Marley and the Wailers, One Love/People Get Ready is an iconic song for millions across the globe with its everlasting message to come together as one. The reimagined version of the song will be a true global anthem for 2020 featuring members of the Marley family, established musicians from all corners of the globe, artists from conflict zones around the world, and children living in vulnerable communities.
“One Love speaks directly to one key truth about this pandemic: Our best hope to defeat COVID-19 and to reimagine a more equal, less discriminatory world for children is through global solidarity and co-operation,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “We are delighted that the Marley family along with Pandora have lent their generous support, creativity and love to help the most vulnerable children.”
COVID-19 has upended the lives of children around the world and exposed rampant inequalities both within and among countries. UNICEF estimates that an additional 6,000 children could die every day from preventable causes over the next six months – almost all of them (over 90 per cent) in low or lower-middle income countries – as the pandemic continues to weaken health systems and disrupt services. Children are also extremely vulnerable to the indirect impacts of COVID-19, such as school closures, food shortages, limited access to basic healthcare, and disruptions to medical supply chains.
In response, UNICEF has launched Reimagine — an urgent appeal to governments, the public, donors and the private sector to support UNICEF’s efforts to respond, recover and reimagine a world currently besieged by COVID-19.
The money raised from One Love for Reimagine will help UNICEF respond to the immediate needs by providing soap, masks, gloves, hygiene kits, protective equipment and life-saving information for children and families; support near term recovery efforts, including by supporting education, protection and healthcare systems; and further UNICEF work to reimagine a fairer, more just world for children.
To support the song launch, social networking service TikTok will be hosting a special event and public challenge for fans around the time the song is launched. Additional details will be provided at a later date.

Title: Not just numbers: Syrian families identify their needs and concerns as war enters tenth year
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
02 July 2020
The war on children in Syria has been one of the most brutal in recent history. Nearly 6 million Syrian children were born since the crisis began. They know nothing but war and displacement. On average, a child in Syria has been killed every 10 hours due to violence, and more than 2.5 million children have been uprooted and forced to flee to neighbouring countries in search of safety.
Syrians, however, are not just numbers. They have voices and opinions and these voices should not go unnoticed nor unheard.
UNICEF adopted results from a recently conducted Gallup International/ORB International opinion survey. The face-to-face survey asked Syrian people in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon about the greatest challenges and concerns they and their children face nearly a decade since the war began.
Covering 3,500 Syrians, the survey aims to give voice to Syrian families highlighting the impact of war and conflict and help shaping how to best respond to the needs that families identified moving forward.
“In this survey, Syrians tell us how the war has affected their lives firsthand and the lives of their children and simply how they survived one of the most brutal wars in recent history.” said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Regional Director for UNICEF in the Middle East and North Africa. “It is obvious that the wounds run deep and that the impact on the mental health of Syrians is tremendous. We also know from this survey that education for children and poverty are among the top concerns and key challenges” he added.
While there are 2.8 million Syrian children out of school, nearly 5 million children inside Syria and in neighbouring countries continue to have access to learning against all odds. This is largely thanks to the efforts of teachers, education personnel, partners on the ground and with the generous support from UNICEF’s donors.
“As donors meet for another pledging conference for Syria in Brussels, we would like to thank all our donors for the unprecedented generosity. It played a huge role to help Syrian children continue their education. We ask donors to maintain their generosity towards the children of Syria and neighbouring countries so that children are able to catch up on lost years of education or continue their education. Now with COVID-19 partially disrupting informal education at some UNICEF-supported centres and child friendly spaces, large scale funding is more critical. This is fundamental for their future and the future of Syria” concluded Chaiban.
To continue providing Syrian children with critical assistance, UNICEF currently needs US$682 million for programmes inside Syria and in neighbouring countries.

Title: World Food Programme to assist largest number of hungry people ever, as coronavirus devastates poor nations
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
01 July 2020
“The frontline in the battle against the coronavirus is shifting from the rich world to the poor world,” said David Beasley, WFP’s Executive Director.
“Until the day we have a medical vaccine, food is the best vaccine against chaos. Without it, we could see increased social unrest and protests, a rise in migration, deepening conflict and widespread under-nutrition among populations that were previously immune from hunger.”
To tackle the rising tide of hunger, WFP is undertaking the biggest humanitarian response in its history, ramping up the number of people it assists to up to 138 million from a record 97 million in 2019. But sustained funding is urgently required to respond to the immediate consequences of the pandemic on the most vulnerable, and support governments and partners as they curb the spread of the disease and deal with the fallout from the pandemic. WFP is appealing for a US$ 4.9 billion over the next six months for its life-saving work in 83 countries.
Earlier WFP projections on the number of people who would be pushed into food insecurity by COVID-19 have now been refined with real-time monitoring and assessments. WFP’s new estimates show that the number of hungry in the countries where it operates could increase to 270 million before the year’s end - an 82 percent increase from before the pandemic took hold.
The crisis unfolds at a time when the number of severely food insecure people in the world had already risen nearly 70 percent over the past four years, compounding the effects of climate change, conflict and socio-economic shocks in regions of the world that had previously escaped severe levels of food insecurity.
“This unprecedented crisis requires an unprecedented response. If we do not respond rapidly and effectively to this viral threat, the outcome will be measured in an unconscionable loss of life, and efforts to roll back the tide of hunger will be undone,” noted Beasley.
The new face of hunger requires specialised responses, with a big increase in the use of cash-based transfers, and a heavy focus on urban settings. Over half of WFP’s new response plan will be delivered in cash and vouchers - allowing urban communities to meet their food needs in local markets – while providing a stimulus to economies.
As well as delivering life-saving assistance on the front-lines of hunger, WFP is uniquely positioned to help governments assist and empower vulnerable communities through support to social protection systems, access to basic school-based and nutrition services, and support to food systems.

Title: Despite disruptions, UNICEF delivers critical life-saving supplies to over 100 countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
30 June 2020
With the COVID-19 pandemic upending the lives of millions of children around the world, UNICEF is delivering life-saving supplies despite unprecedented transport and logistical constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“From supply shortages to transport constraints, COVID-19 has brought enormous challenges to our supply operations,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “However, with support from our partners, we were able to meet some of the most pressing needs and keep children and communities safe.”
So far this year, UNICEF has shipped key personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies to over 100 countries to support their response to the pandemic, including 7.5 million surgical masks, 2.8 million N95 respirators, nearly 10 million gloves, over 830,000 gowns, and nearly 600,000 face shields. UNICEF also shipped over 550,000 diagnostic tests, with an additional 912,000 planned to be delivered through August and is sending over 16,000 oxygen concentrators to 90 low- and middle-income countries.
Limited availability of commercial flights has also taken a heavy toll on shipments of supplies for regular programmes. From March – May in a typical year, UNICEF would have made more than 700 vaccine shipments to countries. During the same period in 2020, just over half that amount – 391 shipments – took place.
UNICEF’s COVID-19 response builds on a strong year for its supply operations in 2019, when UNICEF’s procurement of supplies and services reached a record level of US$3.826 billion, representing a nearly 10 per cent increase from 2018 levels. Over one-third of the total procurement was for vaccines at US$1.656 billion, accounting for 2.43 billion doses for nearly 100 countries to reach 45 per cent of the world’s children under five years of age.
UNICEF also exceeded its savings target for 2019 by over 35 per cent, achieving US$363.3 million in savings across a range of products by leveraging strategic procurement approaches.
“Our collaboration with national governments, partners and the private sector is vital to our efforts to reach children with the supplies they need,” said Etleva Kadilli, Director of the UNICEF supply and procurement headquarters. “Through our global reach and innovative approaches, we leverage our purchasing power and achieve significant savings for governments and donors. As we work together to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, this approach becomes even more important to maximize each dollar spent so that regular programmes can be maintained, as countries also scale up COVID-19 response efforts.”

Title: Confronting the silent and endemic crisis of harmful practices
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
30 June 2020
30 June 2020 - Every year, millions of girls around the world are subjected to practices that harm them physically and emotionally, with the full knowledge and consent of their families, friends and communities, according to the State of World Population 2020, released today by UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency.
At least 19 harmful practices, ranging from breast ironing to virginity testing, are considered human rights violations, according to the UNFPA report, which focuses on the three most prevalent ones: female genital mutilation, child marriage, and extreme bias against daughters in favour of sons.
“Harmful practices against girls cause profound and lasting trauma, robbing them of their right to reach their full potential,” says UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem.
This year, an estimated 4.1 million girls will be subjected to female genital mutilation. Today, 33,000 girls under age 18 will be forced into marriages, usually to much older men. Also, an extreme preference for sons over daughters in some countries has fueled gender-biased sex selection or extreme neglect that leads to their death as children, resulting in 140 million “missing females.”
In the Eastern Europe and Central Asia, child marriage is generally illegal and on the decline overall, but is still practiced widely in parts of the region (up to 15% of women were married before they turned 18 in some countries; and in some communities one in two women was married as a child).
Son preference also remains common in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region, resulting in heavily imbalanced sex-at-birth ratios in parts of the South Caucasus and South-East Europe, as many more boys are born there than girls.
Countries that have ratified international treaties such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child have a duty to end the harm. Many have responded with laws, but laws alone are not enough.
Decades of experience and research show that bottom-up, grassroots approaches are better at bringing change, the UNFPA report states.
“These harmful practices have one root cause in common: the widespread and persistent under-valuing of girls and women,” says Alanna Armitage, UNFPA Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. “But we are seeing that social norms are shifting in the right direction, and there is a real chance that working together – governments, civil society, influencers and role models – we can make practices harming girls a thing of the past.”
Programmes to change discriminatory social norms are effective in eliminating harmful practices, but they must not focus narrowly on just these practices. Rather, they should address the broader issues at play, including the subordinate position of women and girls, their human rights, and how to elevate their status and access to opportunities, the report says.
Globally, ending child marriage and female genital mutilation worldwide is possible within 10 years by scaling up efforts to keep girls in school longer and teach them life skills and to engage men and boys in social change. Investments totaling $3.4 billion a year through 2030 would end these two harmful practices and end the suffering of an estimated 84 million girls, the report shows.
While progress has been made in ending some harmful practices worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to reverse gains. A recent analysis revealed that if services and programmes remain shuttered for six months, an additional 13 million girls may be forced into marriage and 2 million more girls may be subjected to female genital mutilation between now and 2030.
The pandemic may increase the risk of forced early marriage as a strategy to reduce the economic burdens in the family. And lockdowns, school closures and movement restrictions are disrupting adolescent girls’ routines and their support systems.
“The pandemic puts more girls at risk and threatens to undermine the progress we’ve made,” Armitage says. “We must redouble our efforts to ensure that girls everywhere are fully able to enjoy their rights, make choices about their lives and their bodies.”

Title: UNICEF Publishes Recommendations for the Online Gaming Industry on Assessing Impact on Children
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
23 June 2020
UNICEF has published a set of recommendations for the online gaming industry, designed to guide and support online gaming companies through a process of incorporating child rights considerations throughout their business activities.
"The COVID 19 epidemic has shown an explosion in online gaming (among all age groups), demonstrating that gaming is a central element in 21st century leisure and entertainment," said Wivina Belmonte, Principal Advisor Partnerships, UNICEF Division of Private Fundraising and Partnerships. "As the creators of digital environments that draw time and attention of children around the world, online gaming companies have the responsibility to shape their platforms in ways that respect and support children’s rights. I hope these recommendations can help companies understand the impacts and take action to improve their performance."
The Recommendations for the Online Gaming Industry on Assessing Impact on Children – compiled with extensive inputs from the industry – highlight some of the key child rights considerations for online gaming companies of all kinds, from game developers, publishers, distributors, platforms, esports companies and streaming services. They build on a UNICEF Discussion Paper on Online Gaming and Child Rights published in 2019 and extensive engagement with the online gaming community.
"We are pleased to have engaged with UNICEF on these recommendations, including by participating in a deep dive together with industry partners. This support is part of our responsibility to protect minors, but also empower them to benefit from digitalization and gaming responsibly and securely,” says MTG’s President and CEO Jørgen Madsen Lindemann.
The recommendations highlight issues around healthy game time, ensuring inclusion and representation, avoiding toxic environments, considerations around age-limits and verification, combatting grooming and sexual abuse, and managing commercial influence.
"Children and young people increasingly use games and gaming platforms to meet and engage beyond play, it is therefore paramount to establish a common language and understanding of the challenges and opportunities that comes with it," said Dieter Carstensen, Head of Digital Child Safety at the LEGO Group. "This comprehensive, hands-on toolkit will enable the whole games value chain to better understand and identify ways to integrate children’s rights more effectively."
"We welcome the UNICEF guidance document helping industry associations, formal and non-formal educational institutions and game developer studios and publisher to mainstream child right considerations," said Jari-Pekka Kaleva, COO of the European Games Developer Federation.
These recommendations aim to guide the online gaming industry on embedding child rights within internal processes with a goal of providing the best possible experience for all children looking to enjoy gaming online. "We are very happy to continue this journey with the online gaming industry through issuing these recommendations, which we hope will help companies to better protect and support the children that play games and set the stage for further collective efforts," said Andrew Mawson, Chief of Child Rights and Business, UNICEF Division of Private Fundraising and Partnerships.

Title: Countries failing to prevent violence against children, agencies warn
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
22 June 2020
Half of the world’s children, or approximately 1 billion children each year are affected by physical, sexual or psychological violence, suffering injuries, disabilities and death, because countries have failed to follow established strategies to protect them.
This is according to a new report published today by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, UNESCO, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on Violence against Children, and the End Violence Partnership.
“There is never any excuse for violence against children," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “We have evidence-based tools to prevent it, which we urge all countries to implement. Protecting the health and well-being of children is central to protecting our collective health and well-being, now and for the future.”
The report – Global Status Report on Preventing Violence Against Children 2020 – is the first of its kind, charting progress in 155 countries against the “INSPIRE” framework, a set of seven strategies for preventing and responding to violence against children. The report signals a clear need in all countries to scale up efforts to implement them. While nearly all countries (88%) have key laws in place to protect children against violence, less than half of countries (47%) said these were being strongly enforced.
The report includes the first ever global homicide estimates specifically for children under 18 years of age – previous estimates were based on data that included 18 to 19-year olds. It finds that, in 2017, around 40,000 children were victims of homicide.
“Violence against children has always been pervasive, and now things could be getting much worse,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Lockdowns, school closures and movement restrictions have left far too many children stuck with their abusers, without the safe space that school would normally offer. It is urgent to scale up efforts to protect children during these times and beyond, including by designating social service workers as essential and strengthening child helplines.”
Progress is generally uneven
Of the INSPIRE strategies, only access to schools through enrollment showed the most progress with 54% of countries reporting that a sufficient number of children in need were being reached in this way. Between 32% to 37% of countries considered that victims of violence could access support services, while 26% of countries provided programmes on parent and caregiver support; 21% of countries had programmes to change harmful norms; and 15% of countries had modifications to provide safe physical environments for children.
Although a majority of countries (83%) have national data on violence against children, only 21% used these to set baselines and national targets to prevent and respond to violence against children.
About 80% of countries have national plans of action and policies but only one-fifth have plans that are fully funded or have measurable targets. A lack of funding combined with inadequate professional capacity are likely contributing factors and a reason why implementation has been slow.
The COVID-19 response and its impact on children
Stay-at-home measures including school closures have limited the usual sources of support for families and individuals such as friends, extended family or professionals. This further erodes victims’ ability to successfully cope with crises and the new routines of daily life. Spikes in calls to helplines for child abuse and intimate partner violence have been observed.
And while online communities have become central to maintain many children’s learning, support and play, an increase in harmful online behaviours including cyberbullying, risky online behavior and sexual exploitation have been identified.
“Ending violence against children is the right thing to do, a smart investment to make, and it’s possible.  It is time to fully fund comprehensive national action plans that will keep children safe at home, at school, online and in their communities,” said Dr Howard Taylor, End Violence Partnership. “We can and must create a world where every child can thrive free from violence and become a new generation of adults to experience healthy and prosperous lives.”

The data for the report was compiled through a survey administered between 2018 and 2019 with responses from over 1000 decision-makers from 155 countries. The INSPIRE strategies launched in 2016 call for the implementation and enforcement of laws; changing norms and values to make violence unacceptable; creating safe physical environments for children; providing support to parent and caregivers; strengthening income and economic security and stability; improving response and support services for victims; and providing children with education and life skills.

Title: Every action counts: international conference to mark the World Refugee Day
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
22 June 2020
The conference launched with a video message by Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which was followed by a video message by the RA Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Zohrab Mnatsakanyan. The Minister depicted the mass flows of refugees to Armenia over the last three decades that were displaced in particular from Azerbaijan, Iraq and Syria, while highlighting the challenges in this area:
“I would like to highlight two aspects. First is the international solidarity underpinned in the 1951 Refugee Convention, and the second one, which persists as the imperative of all times, the exclusion of politicization of humanitarian crises. Under no circumstance should the refugees and displaced persons be used as instruments of political gains,” said the Minister adding that the task of the international cooperation to efficiently serve the humanitarian goals, in particular those referring to refugees, should know no boundaries and be inclusive to the extent possible.
Mr. Artak Apitonyan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, addressed the main theme and history of the event referring to Fridtjof Nansen as the Nation of League's first High Commissioner for Refugees and his humanitarian undertakings.
“UNHCR called the process of integrating refugees and granting them citizenship undertaken by Armenia as “one of the most successful voluntary naturalizations of refugees in the world”. Needless to say, that the shameful practice of the instrumentalization of the refugees and using them as a tool for political pressure has been alien to us from the outset,” mentioned the Deputy Minister.
He added that Despite its limited financial resources, like in the past, Armenia continues to be a host country for refugees, providing shelter to the people at various times affected by wars and internal turmoil, such as acceptance of refugees from Iraq and Syria.
The event was attended by members of the National Assembly, Government officials, representatives of non-governmental and international organizations, refugees from Armenia, USA and EU, who gathered together to once again voice refugee issues, develop new approaches to address those, and recommend solutions for facing the newly emerging challenges.
The UN Resident Coordinator in Armenia Mr. Shombi Sharp noted: "We work in partnership and coordination between the UN and the Government of Armenia. In the process of nationalization and realization of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), led by the ‘leaving no one behind’ principle, we should ensure that refugees and displaced populations are mainstreamed into the SDGs on an equal basis with locals.”
According to Ms. Anna-Carin Öst, UNHCR Representative in Armenia, the World Refugee Day celebrates the strength and resilience of the people who were forced to flee – the people who have found a safe haven and have the courage to start a new life in a new country they can call home.
"Refugees bring with them a great diversity of skills, knowledge and experience. If given the chance, they can make tangible contributions to the development of their host country," she said, adding that UNHCR appeals to everyone to help continue the global action for solidarity, where everyone can make a difference and everyone counts when it comes to the promotion of inclusion, respect and dignity of all, including refugees, displaced and stateless persons.
Mr. Armen Ghazaryan, Head of the Migration Service, underlined the new challenges emerging daily. He emphasized the work aimed at improving the asylum system in Armenia.
"Last year we launched the Program of Apartment Purchase Certificates. Together with international partners, we make every effort to support the integration of Syrian-Armenian refugees," he stated, accentuating the right to work, among other rights, of refugees almost equal to those enjoyed by the Armenian citizens, as the best practice of integration in Armenia.
Mr. Arman Tatoyan, the Human Rights Defender underlined the fact that refugees were more vulnerable in terms of human rights violations because of the linguistic, cultural and other differences. To that effect, he stressed that the level of the state's defense mechanisms should be higher.
Many of the participants welcomed the proposal made by Mr. Tevan Poghosyan, ICHD Chair, on establishing a common refugee platform. The scope of the collected issues will be further reviewed by the organizers as categories of sector-specific problems, challenges and best practices. Based on this, stand-alone agendas will be elaborated to make the collected issues a subject for discrete examination.
The Conference was organized with the joint efforts of the Migration Service of Armenia, UNHCR Armenia and the International Center for Human Development think tank.

Title: Universal child benefits critical in reducing poverty, new ODI and UNICEF report finds
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
22 June 2020
Universal child benefits, such as unconditional cash payments or tax transfers, are critical in the fight against child poverty, yet are only available in 1 in 10 countries worldwide, according to a new report published today by the Overseas Development Institute and UNICEF.
The report Universal Child Benefits: Policy Issues and Options highlights that universal cash benefits provided to children in middle-income countries at a cost of just 1 per cent of GDP would lead to 20 per cent decline in poverty across the entire population.
In 15 high-income countries, delivering universal child benefits alone led to a 5 percentage point reduction in child poverty, on average. Universal child benefits are also proven to reduce deprivation, improving children’s overall wellbeing, health, education, food security, productivity and ability to contribute to their societies and economies when they reach adulthood.
“Investing in children not only changes their lives but yields high dividends for their communities and for society as a whole,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “Now more than ever, as the economic fallout of COVID-19 threatens to roll back years of progress in reducing poverty, universal child benefits can be a lifeline. They can protect vulnerable families from deepening levels of poverty and deprivation, and can save countries from catastrophic societal and economic impacts.”
Universalizing benefits reduces risks often associated with narrow means testing whereby some families in need are left without financial support, including due to exclusion errors. Universalizing social protection programmes such as cash or tax transfers also helps to remove stigma associated with benefit schemes overall.
“Universal child benefits play a critical role in reducing poverty while promoting social cohesion and public support for social protection. In countries with established universal child benefits, they constitute a cornerstone of national social policy systems and are effective in scaling up social protection in times of crisis,” says Sara Pantuliano, Chief Executive at ODI.
Francesca Bastagli, lead author of the report and Director of Equity and Social Policy at ODI, adds “In practice, countries have achieved high population coverage, or full UCBs, following different trajectories. Progressive realisation is common, through an iterative process involving the adoption of UCB legislation and policy regulation, strengthening administrative and financing capacity, and building political and public support for policy.”
Importantly, the report notes that cash transfer programmes do not lead to a reduction in participation in paid work among the working-age population. Rather, cash transfers help parents balance the demands of employment with the needs of their families.
The report makes clear that expanding coverage of child and family benefits schemes requires national prioritization and international solidarity in financing – especially for lower income countries grappling with large populations and more constrained budgets due to COVID-19. It also stresses that universal child benefits must be supported by comprehensive social protection systems and quality social services, including healthcare and education.
The report further highlights pathways to achieving universal coverage, including ways low-income countries can implement transfers for young children and build up to universality for all age groups. Steps including the adoption of legislation and policy regulation, strengthening administrative and financing capacity, and building political and public support for policy are all critical to achieving universal child benefits.

Title: 1 per cent of humanity displaced: UNHCR Global Trends report
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
19 June 2020
UNHCR’s annual Global Trends report, which comes two days ahead of 20 June World Refugee Day, shows that an unprecedented 79.5 million were displaced as of the end of 2019. UNHCR has not seen a higher total.
The report also notes diminishing prospects for refugees when it comes to hopes of any quick end to their plight. In the 1990s, on average 1.5 million refugees were able to return home each year. Over the past decade that number has fallen to around 385,000, meaning that growth in displacement is today far outstripping solutions.
“We are witnessing a changed reality in that forced displacement nowadays is not only vastly more widespread but is simply no longer a short-term and temporary phenomenon,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. “People cannot be expected to live in a state of upheaval for years on end, without a chance of going home, nor a hope of building a future where they are. We need a fundamentally new and more accepting attitude towards all who flee, coupled with a much more determined drive to unlock conflicts that go on for years and that are at the root of such immense suffering.”
UNHCR’s Global Trends report shows that of the 79.5 million who were displaced at the end of last year, 45.7 million were people who had fled to other areas of their own countries. The rest were people displaced elsewhere, 4.2 million of them being people awaiting the outcome of asylum requests, while 29.6 million were refugees and others forcibly displaced outside their country.
The annual increase, from a figure of 70.8 million at the end of 2018, is a result of two main factors. First is worrying new displacement in 2019, particularly in Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sahel, Yemen and Syria – the latter now in its tenth year of conflict and accounting on its own for 13.2 million refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people, fully a sixth of the world’s total.
Second is a better presentation of the situation of Venezuelans outside their country, many of whom are not legally registered as refugees or asylum-seekers, but for whom protection-sensitive arrangements are required.
And within all of these numbers is a multitude of individual and very personal crises. As many children (estimated at 30-34 million, tens of thousands of them unaccompanied) are among the displaced than, for example, the entire populations of Australia, Denmark and Mongolia combined. Meanwhile, the proportion of displaced aged 60 and above (4 per cent) is far below that of the world population (12 per cent) – a statistic that speaks to immeasurable heartbreak, desperation, sacrifice and being torn apart from loved ones.
8 things you need to know about forced displacement today
Note:
UNHCR’s Global Trends report is released in parallel with its annual Global Report, which reports on actions UNHCR is taking to address the needs of all who are forced to flee, as well as the world’s known stateless populations.

Title: Better land management - better economic, social and ecological sustainability
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
17 June 2020
A new FAO project has kicked off helping Armenia achieve land degradation neutrality commitments through sustainable land management and restoration of degraded landscapes.
It should assist the government, among others, in protecting the country’s degraded croplands and pastures by scaling up improved land management practices and in better responding to the challenges posed by climate change.
The project was launched at a virtual inception workshop today in Yerevan. Participants were updated on project preparation, project sites, financial aspects, project design as well as discussed ways to identify synergies and areas of collaboration with different partners.
Around 40 officials and specialists from line ministries, together with representatives of international organizations, Armenian National Agrarian University, Cadastre Committee, and marz administrations participated in the workshop.
Currently, about 81 percent of Armenia’s territory is exposed by desertification driven by both, natural and anthropogenic factors. Anthropogenic causes of degradation include inefficient agricultural practices, illegal logging, overuse of groundwater resources (artesian wells), and soil contamination, as well as mining, urban development and road construction.
Almost half of all cropland in the country is affected by water erosion, while wind erosion can be seen in small cropland areas in the Ararat valley. More than the half of all pastures and hayfields are degraded, caused both by over- and under-grazing.
This project will support the country in achieving all the four targets of its land degradation neutrality strategy, including stopping cropland degradation and promoting agroecology; afforestation and/or reforesting two-third of the degraded land; stopping deforestation and improving forest management all across the country; stopping overgrazing and improve grassland management all across the country.
In addition to land degradation, climate change poses a serious risk to the vitality of the agriculture sectors in the country, exacerbating land degradation processes in the country unless action is taken.
To overcome the multiple challenges to sustainable land management in the country, the Government of Armenia is committed to set and implement measures that meet the global commitments of LDN, contributing to goal 15.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals to achieve LDN by 2030.
“The COVID-19 crisis has already shown the importance of a functioning and sustainable food system for each country and the resilience of smallholders to such shocks. Therefore, sustainable land management and eliminating degradation has gained further importance and to put in place appropriate policies,” said Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative to Armenia. “Armenia needs to increase its agricultural production and thus integrate unutilized land. Sustainable land management supports this approach.”
The FAO project will follow a landscape approach in line with Global Environmental Facility’s (GEF) vision to foster sustainable integrated landscapes. Working at landscape level allows issues to be addressed in a multifaceted way, integrating sectors, involving partners and working at different scales – tackling the underlying causes of degradation and challenges related food security and not just the symptoms.  Landscape and territorial approaches that focus on people and their aspirations are among the most effective ways to address development needs while restoring and protecting natural resources. In this context, the project will work to formulate comprehensive land use planning to rationalize land use in a way that addresses interconnectedness and trade-offs across multiple ecosystems, promote good governance to align policy directives at the national and sub-national level, and promote innovations in sustainable land management.
To remove the barriers of sustainable land management and implementing land degradation neutrality in Armenia, the project will take a three-pronged approach starting with strengthening the enabling environment for land degradation neutrality, followed by scaling up resilient sustainable land management practices in degraded landscapes.

17 June 2020
Hosted by NBC News and MSNBC anchor Savannah Sellers, the conversations will explore the themes of education, health, and the future—addressing some of the key issues at the forefront of young people’s minds around the world. World’s Largest Lesson Live aims to show that although we may be physically distanced from one another, young peoples’ voices, opinions and actions can make a difference. The three conversations will be as follows:
Education. With over a billion young people facing disruption to their education over the past few months, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed and UNICEF USA Supporter, actress and singer Sofia Carson and Adrian Hrabos, a Nord Anglia Education student from Prague, will reflect on the challenges young people have overcome. They will discuss how school closures have made the world re-think the value of education and how this is an opportunity to reimagine it for the future.
Health. With the global pandemic disrupting so many lives Savannah Sellers asks Dr Maria Van Kerkhove from the World Health Organisation how young people can look after their mental health. They are joined by Shashank Dollin a student and Scout from India to consider how Healthcare in the future might look.
The Future. Finally, Executive Director of UNICEF, Henrietta Fore and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Millie Bobby Brown and Yael Cuprinoff, a student from Argentina, will discuss what they hope the world will take forward from the pandemic. Positioning the pandemic as an opportunity as a “re-set” instead of a “re-start” Henrietta Fore and Millie Bobby Brown will discuss the energy of young people in participating in building a better future.
World’s Largest Lesson Live closes with a message from Dr Tedros Adhanom (Director General  WHO) thanking young people for the contribution they have made to prevent the spread of the COVID19 pandemic  and an uplifting performance from the Brooklyn Youth Chorus singing the popular song “You Will Be Found,” made famous by the Broadway Hit Dear Evan Hansen.
“Children are the hidden victims of COVID-19,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “The pandemic has left millions of children out of school, disrupted their access to health services, pushed their families further into poverty, and affected their physical and emotional well-being. With so many young lives upended, it is crucial that we meet children’s increasing needs and give them a voice as we respond to the pandemic, help families recover from it, and reimagine the world without it.”

Title: COVID-19 may push millions more children into child labour – ILO and UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
12 June 2020
Millions more children risk being pushed into child labour as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, which could lead to the first rise in child labour after 20 years of progress, according to a new brief from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF.
According to COVID-19 and child labour: A time of crisis, a time to act, child labour decreased by 94 million since 2000, but that gain is now at risk.
Children already in child labour may be working longer hours or under worsening conditions, the report says. More of them may be forced into the worst forms of labour, which causes significant harm to their health and safety.
“As the pandemic wreaks havoc on family incomes, without support, many could resort to child labour,” said ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder. “Social protection is vital in times of crisis, as it provides assistance to those who are most vulnerable. Integrating child labour concerns across broader policies for education, social protection, justice, labour markets, and international human and labour rights makes a critical difference.”
According to the brief, COVID-19 could result in a rise in poverty and therefore to an increase in child labour as households use every available means to survive. Some studies show that a one percentage point rise in poverty leads to at least a 0.7 per cent increase in child labour in certain countries.
“In times of crisis, child labour becomes a coping mechanism for many families,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “As poverty rises, schools close and the availability of social services decreases, more children are pushed into the workforce. As we reimagine the world post-COVID, we need to make sure that children and their families have the tools they need to weather similar storms in the future. Quality education, social protection services and better economic opportunities can be game changers.”
Vulnerable population groups – such as those working in the informal economy and migrant workers – will suffer most from economic downturn, increased informality and unemployment, the general fall in living standards, health shocks and insufficient social protection systems, among other pressures.
The brief proposes a number of measures to counter the threat of increased child labour, including more comprehensive social protection, easier access to credit for poor households, the promotion of decent work for adults, measures to get children back into school, including the elimination of school fees, and more resources for labour inspections and law enforcement.
ILO and UNICEF are developing a simulation model to look at the impact of COVID-19 on child labour globally. New global estimates on child labour will be released in 2021.

“Access to the technology and materials needed to continue learning while schools are closed is desperately unequal. Likewise, children with limited learning support at home have almost no means to support their education. Providing a range of learning tools and accelerating access to the internet for every school and every child is critical,” said UNICEF Chief of Education Robert Jenkins. “A learning crisis already existed before COVID-19 hit. We are now looking at an even more divisive and deepening education crisis.”

Title: Countries failing to stop harmful marketing of breast-milk substitutes, warn WHO and UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
29 May 2020
A new report by WHO, UNICEF, and the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) reveals that despite efforts to stop the harmful promotion of breast-milk substitutes, countries are still falling short in protecting parents from misleading information.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for stronger legislation to protect families from false claims about the safety of breast-milk substitutes or aggressive marketing practices. Breastmilk saves children’s lives as it provides antibodies that give babies a healthy boost and protect them against many childhood illnesses.
WHO and UNICEF encourage women to continue to breastfeed during the COVID-19 pandemic, even if they have confirmed or suspected COVID-19. While researchers continue to test breastmilk from mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, current evidence indicate that it is unlikely that COVID-19 would be transmitted through breastfeeding or by giving breastmilk that has been expressed by a mother who is confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19.  The numerous benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of illness associated with the virus. It is not safer to give infant formula milk.
Of the 194 countries analyzed in the report, 136 have in place some form of legal measure related to the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and subsequent resolutions adopted by the World Health Assembly (the Code). Attention to the Code is growing, as 44 countries have strengthened their regulations on marketing over the past two years.
However, the legal restrictions in most counties do not fully cover marketing that occurs in health facilities. Only 79 countries prohibit the promotion of breast-milk substitutes in health facilities, and only 51 have provisions that prohibit the distribution of free or low-cost supplies within the health care system.
Only 19 countries have prohibited the sponsorship of scientific and health professional association meetings by manufacturers of breast-milk substitutes, which include infant formula, follow-up formula, and growing up milks marketed for use by infants and children up to 36-months old.
“The aggressive marketing of breast-milk substitutes, especially through health professionals that parents trust for nutrition and health advice, is a major barrier to improving newborn and child health worldwide,” says Dr Francesco Branca, Director of WHO’s Department of Nutrition and Food Safety. “Health care systems must act to boost parent’s confidence in breastfeeding without industry influence so that children don’t miss out on its lifesaving benefits.”
WHO and UNICEF recommend that babies be fed nothing but breast milk for their first 6 months, after which they should continue breastfeeding – as well as eating other nutritious and safe foods – until 2 years of age or beyond.
Breastfeeding under threat as health systems stretched thin
Babies who are exclusively breastfed are 14 times less likely to die than babies who are not breastfed. However, today, only 41% of infants 0–6 months old are exclusively breastfed, a rate WHO Member States have committed to increasing to at least 50% by 2025. Inappropriate marketing of breast-milk substitutes continues to undermine efforts to improve breastfeeding rates and the COVID-19 crisis is intensifying the threat.
“As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, health workers are being diverted to the response and health systems are overstretched. At such time, breastfeeding can protect the lives of millions of children, but new mothers cannot do it without the support of health providers,” said Dr. Victor Aguayo, UNICEF’s Chief of Nutrition. “We must, more than ever, step up efforts to ensure that every mother and family receive the guidance and support they need from a trained health care worker to breastfeed their children, right from birth, everywhere.”
The Code bans all forms of promotion of breast-milk substitutes, including advertising, gifts to health workers and distribution of free samples. Labels cannot make nutritional and health claims or include images that idealize infant formula. Instead, labels must carry messages about the superiority of breastfeeding over formula and the risks of not breastfeeding.
WHO and UNICEF call on governments to urgently strengthen legislation on the Code during the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and civil society organizations should also not seek or accept donations of breast-milk substitutes in emergency situations.
Breastfeeding and COVID-19
Active COVID-19 virus has not, to date, been detected in the breastmilk of any mother with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. It appears unlikely, therefore, that COVID-19 would be transmitted through breastfeeding or by giving breastmilk that has been expressed by a mother who is confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19.
Women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can therefore breastfeed if they wish to do so. They should:
Even if mothers do not have a medical mask, they should follow all the other infection prevention measures listed and continue breastfeeding.

Title: COVID-19: Number of children living in household poverty to soar by up to 86 million by end of year
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
28 May 2020
The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic could push up to 86 million more children into household poverty by the end of 2020, an increase of 15 per cent, according to a new analysis released today by Save the Children and UNICEF.
The analysis highlights that, without urgent action to protect families from the financial hardships caused by the pandemic, the total number of children living below the national poverty line in low- and middle-income countries could reach 672 million by year-end.
Countries across Europe and Central Asia could see the most significant increase, up to 44 per cent across the region.
“The coronavirus pandemic has triggered an unprecedented socio-economic crisis that is draining resources for families all over the world,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “The scale and depth of financial hardship among families threatens to roll back years of progress in reducing child poverty and to leave children deprived of essential services. Without concerted action, families barely getting by could be pushed into poverty, and the poorest families could face levels of deprivation that have not been seen for decades.”
Before the pandemic, two-thirds of children worldwide did not have access to any form of social protection, making it impossible for families to withstand financial shocks when they hit and furthering the vicious cycle of intergenerational poverty.
Hundreds of millions of children remain multidimensionally poor - meaning they lack access to health care, education, proper nutrition, or adequate housing – often a reflection of inequitable investments by governments in social services.
For children living in countries already affected by conflict and violence, the impact of this crisis will further increase the risk of instability and of households falling into poverty.
To address and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on children in poor households, Save the Children and UNICEF call for rapid and large-scale expansion of social protection systems and programmes including cash transfers, school feeding and child benefits – all critical investments that address immediate financial needs and lay the foundation for countries to prepare for future shocks.
Governments must also invest in other forms of social protection, fiscal policies, employment and labor market interventions to support families. This includes expanding universal access to quality healthcare and other services; and investing in family friendly policies, such as paid leave and childcare.
Since COVID-19 hit, many countries have already scaled up their social protection programmes. For example:

Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
28 May 2020
To complement the Government’s efforts in mitigating the social and economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the state of emergency on the population, UNHCR initiated emergency humanitarian assistance in the form of a one-off cash assistance to vulnerable displaced households helping them cover their basic needs: food, hygienic items and other critical needs. The aim was to help the vulnerable beneficiaries who fell outside of the state assistance schemes to cope with adverse social and economic impact of COVID-19 on their livelihoods.
From 15 April to 22 May 2020, UNHCR’s partner - Mission Armenia NGO - made bank transfers to accounts of adult members of displaced households.
For the selection, households with (i) refugees, (ii) asylum-seekers, (iii) persons forcibly displaced from Syria or (iv) stateless persons were considered. Additional vulnerability criteria included the following: single parent or caregiver, elderly person, woman or child at risk, individual with disability or serious medical condition, without access to state social protection scheme or other known assistance provided by partner entities.
Acknowledging that the needs of persons may have exacerbated due to the outbreak of COVID-19, UNHCR expanded the emergency assistance to a limited number of households with no prior vulnerabilities, other than those described above.

27 May 2020
Climate activist Greta Thunberg today launched a child rights driven campaign with Danish NGO Human Act to support UNICEF’s efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic and protect children from its direct and knock-on consequences. These include food shortages, strained healthcare systems, violence and lost education.
“Like the climate crisis, the coronavirus pandemic is a child-rights crisis,” said Thunberg. “It will affect all children, now and in the long-term, but vulnerable groups will be impacted the most. I’m asking everyone to step up and join me in support of UNICEF’s vital work to save children's lives, to protect health and continue education.”
The campaign is being launched with an initial donation on behalf of Human Act and the Greta Thunberg Foundation to UNICEF of $200,000. Greta Thunberg was recently awarded for her global activism by Human Act who granted her foundation the prize money of $100,000. This sum will now go to UNICEF along with an additional $100,000 from Human Act.
Proceeds from the campaign will go directly towards UNICEF’s emergency programmes to fight COVID-19, including through the provision of soap, masks, gloves, hygiene kits, protective equipment, life-saving information and other support to healthcare systems.
A report issued this month by the United Nations warned that children risk being among the biggest victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. While children have been largely spared from the direct health effects of the disease up to this point, the crisis is having a profound effect on their overall wellbeing. All children, of all ages and in all countries, are being affected, in particular by the socio-economic impacts and, in some cases, by the mitigation measures implemented to stem the spread of the disease.

27 May 2020
UNICEF, UNDP, joined by UWC Dilijan and Ayb Education Foundation, launched Armenia’s first Generation Unlimited (GenU) competition today in an online Bootcamp, joined by 12 teams (50 young people), from Shirak, Vayots Dzor, Kotayk, Tavush, Gegharkunik, and Yerevan.
GenU is a global multi-sector partnership to meet the urgent need for expanded education, training and employment opportunities for young people, aged 10 to 24, on an unprecedented scale. The competition helps create public-private partnerships – globally and in countries – to co-create and support investment opportunities, programs, and innovations on a large scale, and to help young women and men become productive in life.
"We are going to co-design and co-create with young people. Adolescent girls and boys as well as youth can see the world with fresh eyes and imagine solutions that are needed to get the world back on track, we just need to give them opportunities to work together and think creatively," said Tanja Radocaj, UNICEF Representative in Armenia.
50 participants of the online Bootcamp were selected from 60 teams who applied in mid-February with initial ideas about social entrepreneurship and community projects. The ideas are many, spanning from smart agriculture to innovative volunteerism for the common good, creative industries, arts, fashion, video production, and many more. From May 18 to May 24, the Bootcamp will offer them a series of online meetings and mentoring from seasoned specialists in social entrepreneurship, business, and startups who will help them refine their ideas and turn them into projects.
“Through GenU we hope to inspire Armenia’s youth to generate new ideas and bring them to life, thus contributing to the creation of new opportunities, entrepreneurial initiatives, and workplaces in their communities,” said Dmitry Mariyasin, UNDP Resident Representative in Armenia.
On May 24, the teams will present their projects to the panel of judges, and the top five will receive a US$ 1000 grant to bring their ideas to life during the second half of 2020. In the second phase of the competition, the two most promising ideas from Armenia will be presented at the international stage in the USA, competing with teams from other countries for a chance to win up to US$ 20,000 and participate in the Idea Incubator Program.

Title: UNICEF launches #LearningAtHome campaign to support parents and young children in self-isolation due to the Coronavirus

27 May 2020
UNICEF is launching #LearningAtHome campaign in support of parents and young children, facing multiple challenges due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Many parents are struggling with taking care of their family, full time work, children’s online classes and helping younger children to cope with not being able to attend kindergarten or play with their peers.
#LearningAtHome campaign aims to support children’s physical, intellectual and emotional development and to contribute to creating a positive environment at home during the lockdown. “The early years are an important period for children in terms of brain development. Our brains develop at a very fast pace until five years, with neurons forming 700 new connections every second. This means that we build the ground for every child’s health, education, and future now, during their early years,” notes Tanja Radocaj, UNICEF Representative in Armenia. “It is also important to keep in mind that children’s development does not stop – there is no pause button for this during challenging times, such as pandemics or self-isolation. It is hence of utmost importance that we brace ourselves to nurture the early development and learning for young children, as their futures are in our hands.”
The games and challenges in this campaign will help parents to support their children’s brain development in a loving environment, laying a solid ground for the course of their children’s life. Play is a child’s right. It is essential not only for their mental and physical development, but also social and cognitive skills. Children need play even more now to cope with and make sense of these challenging times, and to grow to be able to reach their full potential in life.
The campaign is joined by UNICEF High Level Advocate for Children and beloved children’s author Mrs Nouneh Sarkissian who has filmed her reading of her “Pomengranate Seeds” fairy tale for children. “Children in their early age are the quickest and best learners. Let's help them to keep their mind and energy awake. This brilliant initiative by UNICEF will help the parents to spend the isolation in a useful, active and lively way with their kids,” says Mrs Sarkissian. Her reading is available on the campaign landing page.
Every Wednesday and Friday, UNICEF will issue a new challenge to parents through its Facebook page or Instagram page, encouraging parents to spend quality time with their children and providing with new ideas on how to do that.
Here’s how to participate in the campaign:

Title: New guidelines provide roadmap for safe reopening of schools
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
27 May 2020
The agencies also warned that the widespread closures of educational facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic present an unprecedented risk to children’s education and wellbeing, particularly for the most marginalized children who rely on school for their education, health, safety and nutrition. The guidelines offer practical advice for national and local authorities on how to keep children safe when they return to school.
“Rising inequality, poor health outcomes, violence, child labour and child marriage are just some of the long-term threats for children who miss out on school,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “We know the longer children stay out of school, the less likely they are to ever return. Unless we prioritize the reopening of schools – when it is safe to do so – we will likely see a devastating reversal in education gains.”
The new guidelines note that while there is not yet enough evidence to measure the impact of school closures on disease transmission rates, the adverse effects of school closures on children’s safety and learning are well documented. Gains made in increasing access to children’s education in recent decades risk being lost and, in the worse cases, reversed completely.
“In the poorest countries, children often rely on schools for their only meal of the day. But with many schools now closed because of COVID, 370 million children are missing out on these nutritious meals which are a lifeline for poor families. They are also being denied the health support they normally get through school. This could do lasting damage, so when schools reopen it is critical that these meal programmes and health services are restored, which can also help to draw the most vulnerable children back to school,” said David Beasley, WFP Executive Director.
The best interests of children and overall public health considerations – based on an assessment of the associated benefits and risks to education, public health and socio-economic factors – must be central to national and local authorities’ decisions to reopen schools, the guidelines say.
Schools must look at how they can reopen better – with improved learning and more comprehensive support for children at the school including health, nutrition, psychosocial support and water, sanitation and hygiene facilities.
As countries grapple with when to reopen schools, UNESCO, UNICEF, WFP and World Bank – as part of the Global Education Coalition – urge governments to assess the benefits of classroom-based instruction compared to remote learning, and the risk factors related to reopening of schools, noting the inconclusive evidence around the infection risks related to school attendance.

Title: UNICEF launches #Reimagine campaign to prevent the pandemic from becoming a lasting crisis for children, including in Armenia

27 May 2020
An additional 6,000 children could die every day from preventable causes over the next six months as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to weaken health systems and disrupt routine services, UNICEF said today. The estimate is based on an analysis by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, newly published in The Lancet Global Health journal. Based on the worst of three scenarios in 118 low- and middle-income countries, the analysis estimates that an additional 1.2 million under-five deaths could occur in just six months, due to reductions in routine health service coverage levels and an increase in child wasting.
These potential child deaths will be in addition to the 2.5 million children who already die before their 5th birthday every six months in the 118 countries included in the study, threatening to reverse nearly a decade of progress on ending preventable under-five mortality. Some 56,700 more maternal deaths could also occur in just six months, in addition to the 144,000 deaths that already take place in the same countries over a six-month period.
In addition, UNICEF is deeply alarmed by the other knock-on effects of the pandemic on children:
This week, UNICEF is launching #Reimagine, a global campaign to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from becoming a lasting crisis for children, especially the most vulnerable children – such as those affected by poverty, exclusion or family violence. Through the campaign, UNICEF is issuing an urgent appeal to governments, the public, donors and the private sector to join UNICEF globally, including in Armenia, as we seek to respond, recover and reimagine a world currently besieged by the coronavirus:
To kickstart the campaign, two of UNICEF’s valued global partners - Pandora and ING - have both agreed to pledge a generous donation to show their part in answering the call to this appeal and to spur more donations from the public in the coming weeks.
To support Armenia’s children, UNICEF invites partners, citizens, private sector companies and media to get involved, share, and donate to ensure:

Title: FAO addresses challenges of the seeds sector in the region, including Armenia
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
11 May 2020
A new technical cooperation project on making agriculture more resilient to climate change is about to start in Armenia with a project document signed by FAO and the Ministry of Economy of Armenia. The two-year project covers Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and North Macedonia.
All four countries are facing problems of adaptation and development of independent, diversified agricultural structures. One limiting factor is that the majority of seeds, and other input materials, come from outside, thus, farmers depend on imported seeds. They cannot yet fully benefit from the advantages of quality seeds due to a combination of factors, including hampered seed production, distribution, and quality assurance systems, as well as bottlenecks caused by a lack of good seed policy on key issues.
“Armenia, similarly to Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, and Tajikistan, is facing similar risks due to climate change, and the agricultural production of the country strongly depends on irrigation, weather conditions, proper genetic resources, soil and water management,” said Tania Santivanez, FAO agricultural officer.
To address the main problems as described above, the project in Armenia foresees improvements in planting material and seed certification system; laboratory testing for quality control; developing and adapting methodologies for testing new varieties.
Agriculture in Armenia, especially the seed sector, is facing several challenges. The project addresses the most urgent ones, including the lack of national breeds resulting in the dependence on seed import, well-established and trustworthy seed and planting material certification scheme, access and knowledge of high quality and climate tolerant seeds and planting material for farmers, and low awareness on the importance of the management of plant genetic resources. Farmers often use their own seeds, which carry risks of uncertain production outcomes and disease vulnerabilities. These issues contribute to the increase of the vulnerability of the country’s agriculture to the climate change.
“Moreover, in the context of the COVID-19 era, implementation of the project is very relevant due to the project will support strengthening the national seed system as one of the main pillars of crop production and food security”, added Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative to Armenia.
This project is in line with the Government’s recently approved strategy for sustainable agricultural development in Armenia; improving seed and planting material certification system is one of the prioritized actions there. The interventions will be integrated into the ongoing development actions to ensure the sustainability of the process beyond the project duration. They are tailored to the needs of the government, to build the capacity of government officials at the national and regional levels. These interventions are also in line with the current government policies and strategies.

Title: Futures of 370 million children in jeopardy as school closures deprive them of school meals – UNICEF and WFP
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
01 May 2020
“For millions of children around the world, the meal they get at school is the only meal they get in a day. Without it, they go hungry, they risk falling sick, dropping out of school and losing their best chance of escaping poverty. We must act now to prevent the health pandemic from becoming a hunger catastrophe,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley.
School meals are especially critical for girls. In many poor countries, the promise of a meal can be enough to make struggling parents send their daughter to school, allowing her to escape heavy domestic duties or early marriage.
“School is so much more than a place of learning. For many children it is a lifeline to safety, health services and nutrition. Unless we act now – by scaling up lifesaving services for the most vulnerable children – the devastating fallout caused by COVID-19 will be felt for decades to come,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director.
Alongside school meal programmes, children in poor countries often benefit from health services - such as vaccinations and deworming - delivered through their schools.
Under the partnership, WFP and UNICEF will assist governments in the coming months to ensure that when schools reopen returning children benefit from school meals and health programmes. This will also provide an incentive for parents to send their children back to school.

Title: 9 million children could die in a decade unless world acts on pneumonia, leading agencies warn
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
29 January 2020
Boosting efforts to fight pneumonia could avert nearly 9 million child deaths from pneumonia and other major diseases, a new analysis has found ahead of the first ever global forum on childhood pneumonia in Barcelona (January 29-31).
According to a modelling by Johns Hopkins University, scaling up pneumonia treatment and prevention services can save the lives of 3.2 million children under the age of five. It would also create ‘a ripple effect’ that would prevent 5.7 million extra child deaths from other major childhood diseases at the same time, underscoring the need for integrated health services.
Pneumonia is caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, and leaves children fighting for breath as their lungs fill with pus and fluid. It is the biggest single killer of children, claiming the lives of 800,000 children last year, or 1 child every 39 seconds. Although pneumonia can be prevented with vaccines and is easily treated with $1 antibiotics if properly diagnosed, tens of millions of children are still unvaccinated – and one in three children with symptoms do not receive essential medical care.
Child deaths from pneumonia are concentrated in the world’s poorest countries and it is the most deprived and marginalised children who suffer the most. Forecasts show 6.3 million children under the age of five could die from pneumonia between 2020 and 2030, on current trends. Over the next decade, deaths are likely to be highest in Nigeria (1.4 million), India (880,000), the Democratic Republic of Congo (350,000) and Ethiopia (280,000).
Health interventions aimed at improving nutrition, providing antibiotics and increasing vaccine coverage, boosting breastfeeding rates – key measures that reduce the risk of children dying from pneumonia – would also prevent millions of child deaths from diseases like diarrhoea (2.1 million), sepsis (1.3 million), and measles (280,000).
Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of UNICEF, said:
“If we are serious about saving the lives of children, we have to get serious about fighting pneumonia. As the current coronavirus outbreak shows, this means improving timely detection and prevention. It means making the right diagnosis and prescribing the right treatment. It also means addressing the major causes of pneumonia deaths like malnutrition, lack of access to vaccines and antibiotics, and tackling the more difficult challenge of air pollution.”
Outdoor air pollution contributes to 17.5 per cent – or nearly one in five – pneumonia deaths among children under five worldwide, according to a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME-GBD). Household pollution from the indoor use of solid cooking fuels contributes to an additional 195,000 (29.4 per cent) deaths.
On January 29-31, the nine leading health and children’s organisations – ISGlobal, Save the Children, UNICEF, Every Breath Counts, “la Caixa” Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID,Unitaid and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance – are hosting world leaders at the Global Forum on Childhood Pneumonia in Barcelona, the first international forum on childhood pneumonia.
Among the announcements to be made at the forum include a more affordable, PCV vaccine from the Serum Institute of India and political commitments from governments in high-burden countries to develop national strategies to reduce pneumonia deaths.

Title: 1 in 3 adolescent girls from the poorest households has never been to school - UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
20 January 2020
Nearly 1 in 3 adolescent girls from the poorest households around the world has never been to school, according to a new UNICEF paper launched today as education ministers gather at the Education World Forum and as leaders prepare to convene at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting.
Poverty, discrimination due to gender, disability, ethnic origin or language of instruction, physical distance from schools and poor infrastructure are among the obstacles that continue to prevent the poorest children from accessing quality education. Exclusion at every step of education perpetuates poverty and is a key driver of a global learning crisis.
The paper Addressing the learning crisis: an urgent need to better finance education for the poorest children highlights major disparities in the distribution of public education spending. Limited and unequally distributed funding results in large class sizes, poorly trained teachers, lack of education materials and poor school infrastructure. This in turn has an adverse impact on attendance, enrolment and learning.
“Countries everywhere are failing the world’s poorest children, and in doing so, failing themselves,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “As long as public education spending is disproportionately skewed towards children from the richest households, the poorest will have little hope of escaping poverty, learning the skills they need to compete and succeed in today’s world, and contributing to their countries’ economies.”
Looking at 42 countries with available data, the paper finds that education for children from the richest 20 per cent of households are allocated nearly double the amount of education funding than children from the poorest 20 per cent of households.
Barbados, Denmark, Ireland, Norway and Sweden are the only countries included in the analysis that distribute education funding equally between the richest and poorest quintiles.
The paper sets out clear guidelines for governments:
“We are at a critical juncture. If we invest wisely and equitably in children’s education, we have the best possible chance of lifting children out of poverty by empowering them with the skills they need to access opportunities, and create new ones for themselves,” said Fore.

Title: New Year’s Babies: Over 105 children will be born in Armenia on New Year’s Day - UNICEF
Content: Read UN Armenia Results e-Report for 2022
01 January 2020
An estimated 105 babies will be born in Armenia on New Year’s Day, UNICEF said today. Armenian babies will account for 0.03 per cent of the estimated 392,078 babies to be born on New Year’s Day.
“The beginning of a new year and a new decade is an opportunity to reflect on our hopes and aspirations not only for our future, but the future of those who will come after us,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “As the calendar flips each January, we are reminded of all the possibility and potential of each child embarking on her or his life’s journey—if they are just given that chance.”
Fiji in the Pacific will most likely deliver 2020’s first baby. The United States, its last. Globally, over half of these births are estimated to take place in eight countries:
Each January, UNICEF celebrates babies born on New Year’s Day, an auspicious day for child birth around the world. However, for millions of newborns around the world, the day of their birth is far less auspicious.
In 2018, 2.5 million newborns died in just their first month of life; about a third of them on the first day of life. Among those children, most died from preventable causes such as premature birth, complications during delivery, and infections like sepsis. In addition, more than 2.5 million babies are born dead each year.
Over the past three decades, the world has seen remarkable progress in child survival, cutting the number of children worldwide who die before their fifth birthday by more than half. But there has been slower progress for newborns. Babies dying in the first month accounted for 47 per cent of all deaths among children under five in 2018, up from 40 per cent in 1990.
UNICEF’s Every Child Alive campaign calls for immediate investment in health workers with the right training, who are equipped with the right medicines to ensure every mother and newborn is cared for by a safe pair of hands to prevent and treat complications during pregnancy, delivery and birth.
“Too many mothers and newborns are not being cared for by a trained and equipped midwife or nurse, and the results are devastating,” added Fore. “We can ensure that millions of babies survive their first day and live into this decade and beyond if every one of them is born into a safe pair of hands.”
An estimated 145 (or 0.04%) babies will be born in Georgia on New Year’s Day and an estimated 433 (or 0.11%) in Azerbaijan.
