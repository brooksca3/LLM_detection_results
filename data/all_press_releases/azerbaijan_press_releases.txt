Title: Empowering financial service providers in Azerbaijan to address financial needs of migrants
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 May 2024
The value of this training is that it is a two-way learning between the private sector and the government, which aligns with the whole-of-society approach principle of Global Compact for Migration calling for broad multi-stakeholder partnerships to address migration in all its dimensions.
Between 7 and 10 May, IOM Azerbaijan organized a series of capacity-building trainings for over 50 customer service specialists representing bank branches and post offices that serve migrants the most. The event was held at the Regional Training Centre on Migration within the “Enhancing the Socioeconomic Benefits of Remittances in Azerbaijan” project, implemented in cooperation with the State Migration Service and with funding by the IOM Development Fund.

An estimated 1 million Azerbaijani nationals live abroad, and 100 thousand migrants reside in Azerbaijan, all of whom use various financial services, including sending and receiving financial remittances. Even though the assessment, conducted in 2023, concluded that remittance cost in Azerbaijan is already below 3%, as aimed by SDG 10.c, and financial inclusion of migrants in the country is high, still there is a room for improvement in terms of better addressing migrants’ financial needs. Hence, in line with the roadmap approved by project’s Working Group, six major banks in Azerbaijan (AFB Bank, Xalq Bank, Rabitabank, ABB, Kapital Bank and Bank Respublika) and Azerpost (national postal service) were invited to one-day trainings, the aim of which was to foster a customer service that is more aware of and can better address the specific needs of migrants and persons in vulnerable situations.

The event was opened by Mr. Amr Taha, IOM Chief of Mission a.i. in Azerbaijan and Mr. Vahid Gahramanov, Chief of Head Department of the State Migration Service. The training focused on rights of migrants – including refugees and asylum seeker; their access to financial services with the different identification cards provided to foreign residents in Azerbaijan; and digital authentication of documents. Furthermore, the financial service providers were trained in customer due diligence and know your customer rules; understanding migrants’ financial needs; inter-cultural competences and understanding of persons in vulnerable situations.

The Director of “INNOLAND” Incubation and Acceleration Center, Mr. Nijat Amiraslanov moderated a competition during which participants, divided into groups, came up with innovative solutions to address the financial needs of migrants. Participants proposed creative and innovative ideas on seamless integration of government and bank portals, cashback cards and discounted products to migrants and nationals, offering multilingual services, and more.

The training was well received and in the words of a participant, “This training enabled us to understand better the financial needs of an important segment of Azerbaijani society – migrants. We are enthusiastic that our bank is continually improving the services we offer to make their stay in Azerbaijan as comfortable as possible.”

Studies have demonstrated that every additional 1% of immigration could boost GDP growth in destination countries by 2%. As Azerbaijan’s economic growth continues, and as it also expands in different sectors, the role of migrants will continue to grow – just as Azerbaijani emigrants contribute to economic development across the world.

The value of this training is that it is a two-way learning between the private sector and the government, which aligns with the whole-of-society approach principle of Global Compact for Migration calling for broad multi-stakeholder partnerships to address migration in all its dimensions.

This training supports SDG 10 on Reduced Inequalities and GCM objective 20 to promote faster, safer and cheaper transfer of remittances and foster financial inclusion of migrants.

MESSAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DAY AGAINST HOMOPHOBIA, BIPHOBIA AND TRANSPHOBIA
17 May 2024
On this International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, I applaud the brave work of LGBTIQ+ human rights defenders fighting to outlaw discrimination and secureequality before the law.
Yet there is a worrying surge in the opposite direction. New laws are codifying old bigotries, exploiting fears and stoking hate.
The theme of this year’s Day – “No one left behind: equality, freedom and justice for all” – reminds us of our obligations to respect the human rights and dignity of every person. We need action around the world to make those rights a reality.

The criminalisation of same-sex relationships must end, so must all violence, discrimination and harmful practices against LGBTIQ+ communities.

On this and every day, let’s commit to building a world of respect, dignity and human rights for all around the world.

Title: Scaling up climate action in agrifood / FAO, countries, and partners prepare for UNFCCC COP29

The UNFCCC COP29, scheduled for November 11-22, 2024, in Baku, presents an opportunity to highlight national and regional priorities in climate action and focus on the transformative potential of agriculture in the context of climate change

16 May 2024, Rome – A high-level panel discussion at the 34th Session of the FAO Regional Conference for Europe (ERC34) addressed the urgent need for scaled-up climate action in Europe and Central Asia's agrifood systems. The discussion, titled "Climate Action in Agrifood Systems in Europe and Central Asia: Bridging and Aligning National and Regional Priorities and Global Commitments in the Context of UNFCCC COP29" highlighted the region's vulnerability to climate change and the importance of a coordinated approach ahead of the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP29).

Climate change impacts agrifood systems worldwide, with the region of Europe and Central Asia being no exception. It leads to reduced agricultural productivity and disrupts food value chains, posing a significant threat to food security across the region. Adaptation and climate change mitigation are essential to ensuring that agrifood systems provide food and nutrition security for all.

FAO, jointly with the member countries and the regional and national partners, responds to the worldwide challenge of tackling the impacts of the climate crisis. Aligned with country priorities, the FAO Strategy on Climate Change 2022–2031 supports climate action in agrifood systems.

Raimund Jehle, FAO Regional Programme Leader for Europe and Central Asia, highlighted the development of a regional framework for Europe and Central Asia for applying the FAO Strategy on Climate Change and collaboration with Azerbaijan to integrate agrifood systems as part of UNFCCC COP29.

UNFCCC COP29: A platform for action

The UNFCCC COP29, scheduled for November 11-22, 2024, in Baku, presents an opportunity to highlight national and regional priorities in climate action and focus on the transformative potential of agriculture in the context of climate change.

Ilhama Gadimova, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Azerbaijan and a member of the Organizing Committee of the UNFCCC COP29, emphasized the country's commitment to leading discussions on the role of sustainable agrifood systems in climate action. She stressed the need for global unity and decisive action to address this pressing issue. “We aspire to see the world's leaders prioritize environmental sustainability and focus collaboratively on this pressing global issue during the conference”, said Ms Gadimova.

Nino Tandilashvili, First Deputy Minister of Environmental Protection and Agriculture of Georgia recognised the power of a combined approach to climate change and agriculture. Ms Tandilashvili emphasized that integrating "agrifood system solutions" into national plans like Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, and long-term emissions reduction strategies is crucial for effectively tackling climate change. This focus on unified action is reflected in the government's policies and interventions.

A key priority at UNFCCC COP29 will be securing climate finance, particularly for adaptation and emissions reduction within agrifood systems. Deputy Minister Gadimova, Herwig Ranner, Team Leader, Directorate General for Agriculture at the EU Commission, and Luisa Rölke, Head of Division Climate Change and Water at Germany's Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, all highlighted the importance of climate finance and initiatives like the Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation (FAST) Partnership in supporting capacity building and ensuring high-quality investments.

Julia Wolf, Natural Resources Officer at the FAO’s Office of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment echoed this sentiment. “Investing in agrifood systems is a key solution to climate change. Without increased investments, we run the risk of falling short of the targets set by the Paris Agreement and compromising our food security objectives. This is our key message we will advocate for.​”

Luisa Volpe, Advocacy, Policy and Partnerships Practice Leader at the World Farmers’ Organisation (WFO emphasized that transforming agrifood systems should prioritize the well-being of farmers, as they are not only affected by climate change, but are integral to the solution.

Fostering regional collaboration for climate action

Highlighting the importance of regional collaboration for effective climate action, Ibrokhim Abdurakhmonov, Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan, emphasized the need for coordinated efforts to align national and regional climate action priorities. Uzbekistan demonstrates its proactive approach to facilitating regional collaboration through the Central Asian Climate Dialogue.

Vladimir Grebnev, Regional Climate Change Specialist at the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program (CAREC) emphasized CAREC's support to member countries in aligning national and regional priorities, particularly in view of revising Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

Building on past progress

The 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), which was hosted by the United Arab Emirates, in Dubai, in December 2023, achieved significant milestones. Agrifood systems took centre stage, with several important achievements, such as the COP28 UAE Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems and Climate Action, endorsed by 159 countries.

UNFCCC COP29 offers an opportunity to build upon this progress and advance climate action in Europe, Central Asia, and globally. All speakers underscored the urgency of implementing the Emirates Declaration and expressed optimism that UNFCCC COP29 will serve as a springboard for critical progress.

Title: UNDP Collaborates with GCF and Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources to Launch Groundbreaking Climate Education Initiative in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
15 April 2024
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in partnership with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, is ready to give a start to the initiatives aimed at enhancing climate change adaptation knowledge and skills in management level.
UNDP’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP) project recently held a meeting with the management academic staff of the Academy of Public Administration (APA) under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan to finalize crucial details for the courses on climate change adaptation as part of the master's program on Sustainable Development and the modules for specialized executive-level courses tailored for decision-makers.
The learning programs aim to empower participants to develop and implement robust leadership to execute adaptation measures on the management level that will safeguard communities and ecosystems against the impacts of a changing climate.
In a first for Azerbaijan, the topic of climate change has been integrated into the master’s program, and enrollment for these courses will begin in September of this year.
These initiatives play a critical role in addressing the climate crisis. Climate education helps people understand and address the impacts of the climate crisis, empowering them with the knowledge, skills and values needed to build a more resilient and sustainable future.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
14 December 2023
For the first time in its history, the United Nations Development Programme in Azerbaijan participated in the annual United Nations climate change conference, known as the Conference of the Parties or COP. At this year's event, the Energy and Environment Portfolio, featuring the EU4Climate and GCF-funded National Adaptation Plan (NAP) projects, represented UNDP Azerbaijan at the Azerbaijan Country Pavilion of COP28.
The EU4Climate initiative and the NAP project mark significant milestones in accelerating Azerbaijan's commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
As a part of the event, Mr. Nazim Mammadov, the EU4Climate National Coordinator, and Mr. Zaur Aliyev, the NAP Project Manager, delivered a presentation titled “Azerbaijan's climate change actions for the sustainable future.”
“Engaging in COP28 provides us with the opportunity to showcase Azerbaijan's efforts in climate change adaptation and mitigation on the global stage, as well as to exchange experiences with other nations”, Mr Aliyev stressed.
During his speech, Mr. Mammadov highlighted the pivotal role of the EU4Climate project in Azerbaijan, engaging in modeling for priority sectors and exploring various development scenarios.
“A significant milestone achieved under the EU4Climate project is the development of a gender-sensitive, long-term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) aligned with the targets set in the NDC”, he shared the achievements and lessons learned from the implementation of the EU4Climate project in Azerbaijan.
The presentation was delivered during the COP28 side event organized jointly by UNDP Azerbaijan and the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. The event saw opening speeches by Mr. Mukhtar Babayev, the Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources, and Mr. Pradeep Kurukulasuriya, the UNDP Executive Coordinator and Director-Environmental Finance for Nature, Climate, and Energy. Mr. Nuri Ozbagdatli, the Climate Change Specialist for the Europe and Central Asia Region, joined the session as the main speaker.
“The partnership between UNDP and Azerbaijan has been instrumental in fostering innovation, knowledge exchange, and capacity building in various domains related to climate action”, Mr. Pradeep Kurukulasuriya said in his speech: “Together, over the last 30 years, UNDP has partnered with Azerbaijan with support from numerous donors, especially GEF and GCF, to implement projects that promote sustainable development, protect biodiversity, and empower communities to adapt to and mitigate the changing climate.”
EU4Climate and NAP projects pave the way for comprehensive, low-emission and climate-resistant development of Azerbaijan.
The NAP project supports the Government of Azerbaijan in three key sectors – water, agriculture, and coastal areas, identified as top priorities through stakeholder consultations conducted by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. This complements the EU4Climate project's focus on policy development and implementation to ensure the concerns of these sectors are heard at policy-making tables.
The participation of UNDP Azerbaijan projects at the global COP28 event highlights their dedication to the Paris Agreement and the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Azerbaijan is taking decisive action to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases it emits into the atmosphere. It has pledged to cut emissions by 35% by 2030 and reaffirmed its commitment to achieve a 40% reduction by 2050 by harnessing its vast potential for renewable energy generation and enhancing natural carbon sequestration via sustainable land and forest management. Upholding and actively implementing the commitments made in the Paris Agreement is currently a top priority for the Government of Azerbaijan.

‎
IOM Azerbaijan officially handed over the rehabilitated Karvansara kahriz located in Garadaghli village of Goranboy district to the local community within the IOM’s “Integrated Rural Development for IDP communities in Azerbaijan through Revitalization of Kahriz Water Supply System” project funded by Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA). The rehabilitated kahriz, which is 1037 meters long and has 17 wells, is the longest kehriz rehabilitated under the current project, and it will provide 68 ha of arable lands belonging to 50 rural households with irrigation water. Consequently, it will lead to the growth in the agricultural production and increase in incomes of rural population. In addition, laboratory analysis of the water from Karvansara kahriz proves that this kahriz water can be also used for drinkable purposes.
Shamkhal Hasanov, the deputy head of the Goranboy district's executive power highlighted the significance of rehabilitating kahrizes for the region's economy.
“Each kahriz that is rehabilitated and made available contributes to increased productivity in the area. Water shortage is a major concern for the district's population, with nearly 80% of appeals to the executive power related to this issue. The rehabilitation of kahrizes will help alleviate this problem, leading to reduced requests for water and improved agricultural yields for the local population,” said Shamkhal Hasanov.
A resident of Garadagli village, Nazaket Aliyeva, expressed how the villagers have long suffered from water scarcity and were unable to cultivate their land. However, with the restoration of kahrizes, dozens of families will now be able to utilize their land and sustain their livelihoods.
The chairman of the Garadagli village community, Samandar Musayev, noted the significant work being done by the International Migration Organization for the village population. He mentioned that the shortage of water prevented them from utilizing the villagers’ land in the area. However, with the rehabilitation of kahriz, they have already planted their land and are looking forward to a fruitful harvest. Musayev expressed deep gratitude for the important work done by the organization.
According to him, the Water Users' Union, created as part of the project and with the active involvement of community members, will ensure the long-term functionality of the village's crucial water source through consistent maintenance efforts.
Within the KOICA funded project, IOM Azerbaijan has already rehabilitated 30 kahrizes in Agdam, Fuzuli, Jabrayil, Goranboy, Goygol, Gazakh and Shamkir districts.
The main objective of the project is to prevent forced economic migration by improving access to water resources in rural communities in Azerbaijan. This is achieved through the enhancement of agricultural productivity and livelihoods by providing water infrastructure and creating income-generating opportunities linked to kahriz rehabilitation.
By addressing these objectives, the project contributes to three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Azerbaijan. These include reducing poverty and ensuring food security (SDG 1), promoting gender equality and empowering women in decision-making processes (SDG 5), and rehabilitating eco-friendly and sustainable water supply systems to enhance access to safe drinking water (SDG 6). The project also aligns with SDG target 10.7, which focuses on facilitating safe and responsible migration and mobility.

Within the framework of the campaign, the heads of UN agencies participate in discussions dedicated to combating violence against women and girls, organized with the support of the Women's Resource Centers operating in different regions of Azerbaijan.
The UN Office in Azerbaijan is carrying out 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence.
The campaign with the “Unite to end violence against women and girls!” slogan organized by the UN agencies together with The State Committee for Family, Women, and Children's Issues aims at drawing the attention of society to the issue of violence against women and girls and to call for action to combat it.
Vladanka Andrevaa, the UN Resident Coordinator in Azerbaijan, stated that violence against women and girls remains one of the most prevalent and pervasive human rights violations experienced by almost one in three women.
“In Azerbaijan, the United Nations is working together with the Government, civil society, and development partners to prevent, mitigate, and respond to violence against women and girls. Progress has been made, but we need more allies to say no to gender-based violence,” Vladanka Andreeva added.
The 16 Days of Activism, which started on November 25 - International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, will continue until December 10 - International Human Rights Day.
Within the framework of the campaign, the heads of UN agencies participate in discussions dedicated to combating violence against women and girls, organized with the support of the Women's Resource Centers operating in different regions of Azerbaijan.
"Starting from November 25th, we aim to draw public attention to our year-round fight with our partners against all manifestations of violence against women and girls. By combining our efforts, we can effectively implement and sustain the legal and normative framework to combat gender-based violence," said Bahar Muradova, Chairperson of the State Committee on Family, Women, and Children's Issues.
The Commissioner for the Human Rights Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Ombudsman) also joined this year's 16 Days Activism.
Ombudsman Sabina Aliyeva emphasized that violence, hurting people's lives, personality, spirituality, future, development, and progress of society, is one of the critical issues that must be solved on a global scale: "Cases of violence against women violate not only human rights but also have economic and social consequences. Unfortunately, women and girls experience the greatest pain and impact of such violence."
Within the 16 Days of Activism framework, the UN Office in Azerbaijan has launched the Orange T-shirt Challenge on social media platforms.
The UN Office in Azerbaijan urges all members of society to combat violence against women not just for 16 days but for all 365 days.

‎
For the second year in a row, IOM Azerbaijan brings the topic of remittances to the forefront of discussions at the International Banking Forum, the most authoritative finance and banking event of the region organized by the Azerbaijan Banks Association, Central Bank of Azerbaijan and MasterCard.
During the 7th International Banking Forum, held on 1-2 November 2023, IOM organized panel discussion titled “Remittances and Financial Inclusion of Migrants” within the “Enhancing the Socioeconomic Benefits of Remittances in Azerbaijan” project, funded by the IOM Development Fund and implemented in cooperation with the State Migration Service. The aim of the panel discussion was to present the importance of migrants’ economic contributions to their families back home in the South-Eastern, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, to highlight socio-economic benefits of remittances, as well as to explore ways to maximize these benefits jointly with private sector.
At the panel, moderated by Mr. Hurshid Rustamov, economist of the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office in Azerbaijan, it was noted that the importance of migrants’ economic contributions to their families back home is now more important than ever, especially for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Ms. Maria Bassermann, project officer at the IOM Regional Office in Vienna, informed that the total amount of remittances received in South-Eastern, Eastern Europe and Central Asia region last year was USD 72 billion, on average 11% of national GDP. In low- and middle-income countries, remittances and migrants’ savings exceed overseas development assistance (ODA) to these countries 5 times. Furthermore, Ms. Bassermann noted that “to increase the positive impact of remittances for development, a focus needs to be put on improving migrant decision-making in sending remittances, reducing costs of sending remittances, enhancing financial Inclusion of migrants and remittance recipients.”
Ms. Khayala Mammadova, senior specialist at the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, commended the IOM-implemented project that increased attention to problems related to financial inclusion faced by migrants. Hence, an action plan for improving the legal and regulatory framework is being drafted and training programs on financial inclusion for migrants will be prepared within Central Bank’s financial literacy activities.
Mr. Elvin Afandi, Head of Corporate Strategy & Research of the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector, highlighted contribution of digitalization of remittances to enhancing financial inclusion of migrants and their families. Mr. Matthieu de Heering, Head of Russia, Central Asia and Caucasus at the SWIFT, presented regional perspective on cross-border low-value payments.
Apart from joining to the panel discussion, visitors also had a chance to learn more about remittances and financial inclusion of migrants at the IOM stand for two days. In total, 7th International Banking Forum was attended by more than 1000 participants representing government agencies, commercial banks, and businesses, including fintech companies, international financial institutions, and non-governmental organizations from the USA, Türkiye, European Union, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East, and other countries.
The IDF-funded project encourages all actors engaged in the remittance market to acknowledge and act upon opportunities and best practices that can contribute to achieving the SDGs, and particularly SDG 10.c which calls for reducing to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent by 2030 and Objective 20 (Promote faster, safer and cheaper transfer of remittances and foster financial inclusion of migrants) of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM).

31 October 2023
The main objective of the project is to prevent forced economic migration by improving access to water resources in rural communities in Azerbaijan.
IOM Azerbaijan, and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) Office in Azerbaijan conducted a monitoring visit to the Aghdam, Shamkir, and Jabrail districts. The purpose of the visit was to assess the progress of the "Integrated Rural Development for IDP Communities in Azerbaijan through Revitalization of Kahriz Water Supply Systems" project. Prior to visiting the project sites, a meeting was held in Mingachevir to provide an overview of the completed and planned rehabilitation activities. The participants also discussed future plans and deadlines.
During the field visit, Mr Amr Taha, Chief of Mission a.i. in Azerbaijan recalled that rehabilitating kahrizes contributes to improved access to water and hygiene at the individual household level; to economic development at community level; and more broadly they concretely advance Azerbaijan’s vision for green and smart cities. “These are no little contributions for a project that should be replicated beyond Azerbaijan.” said Mr Taha.
The monitoring group inspected the kahrizes that were handed over to local communities in Agdam and Shamkir districts to assess their current condition. In Jabrail district, they observed the ongoing and planned rehabilitation works carried out in various kahrizes, including "Asgar", "Orta", "Khelife deresi", "Gul Gasim", and "Sighi". The group also met with engineers and locals involved in the project at the respective sites.
Galib Atakishiyev, head of the municipality of the Irmashli village of the Shamkir district highly appreciated the organization's efforts to rehabilitate their Garaoghlanli kahriz. He emphasized that the hand overed kahriz is critical for the provision of drinking water to residents of the village that faces adverse effects of climate change – water scarcity.
To date, as part of the project, IOM Azerbaijan has successfully rehabilitated a total of 28 kahrizes situated in the districts of Aghdam, Goranboy, Fuzuli, Goygol, Gazakh, Shamkir and Jabrayil.
The main objective of the project is to prevent forced economic migration by improving access to water resources in rural communities in Azerbaijan. This is achieved through the enhancement of agricultural productivity and livelihoods by providing water infrastructure and creating income-generating opportunities linked to kahriz rehabilitation.
By addressing these objectives, the project contributes to three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Azerbaijan. These include reducing poverty and ensuring food security (SDG 1), promoting gender equality and empowering women in decision-making processes (SDG 5), and rehabilitating eco-friendly and sustainable water supply systems to enhance access to safe drinking water (SDG 6). The project also aligns with SDG target 10.7, which focuses on facilitating safe and responsible migration and mobility.

05 October 2023
Approximately 30 individuals, comprising journalists representing diverse media outlets operating within the country, social media influencers and the media representatives of  local health agencies participated in this training that was conducted by experts from WHO Regional Office for Europe.
Within the European Union-funded “Vaccination Support” project and World Health Organization (WHO) Emergencies in Health Program, WHO Azerbaijan has organized a training program on Infodemic Management for journalists and social media influencers on September 26–27, 2023. The training was designed to equip them with the necessary tools to improve ways to combat widespread misinformation and myths about health topics, including vaccines
The spread of inaccurate and unscientific information in the digital age can lead people to make unhealthy decisions. It is therefore important for journalists and social media activists with broad audiences to refer people to reliable sources to get the right information.
The main purpose of this training was to convey to the participants the basic principles of infodemic management, including listening to public concerns and questions, understanding risks, and contributing to the development of a healthier information ecosystem in order to reduce the negative impacts of false information on the health of people.
Approximately 30 individuals, comprising journalists representing diverse media outlets operating within the country, social media influencers and the media representatives of  local health agencies participated in this training that was conducted by experts from WHO Regional Office for Europe. Throughout the training, the vital importance of fact-checking and the dissemination of evidence-based information when reporting on vaccination and related health events was emphasized.
The EU-funded COVID-19 Vaccination Support project implemented by WHO Azerbaijan Country Office since June 2021 covers three years and aims to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen the routine immunization programs in the country.

Title: UN team completes mission to Karabakh
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
02 October 2023
‎
(Baku, 2 October 2023) A United Nations mission, led by Vladanka Andreeva, UN Resident Coordinator in Azerbaijan, visited the Karabakh region in Azerbaijan on Sunday, 1 October.

The team also included Ramesh Rajasingham, the Director of the Coordination Division of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as well as representatives from the Food and Agriculture Organization, the UN Refugee Agency, UNICEF and the World Health Organization, as well as a technical team from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office and the UN Department of Safety and Security.

Traveling from Aghdam, the mission visited the city of Khankendi, where the team met with the local population and interlocutors and saw first-hand the situation regarding health and education facilities.  In parts of the city that the team visited, they saw no damage to civilian public infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and housing, or to cultural and religious structures.  The mission saw that the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan was preparing for the resumption of health services and some utilities in the city.  The mission saw that no shops were open.

The mission saw very few local population remaining in the city.  The team heard from interlocutors that between 50 and 1,000 ethnic Armenians remain in the Karabakh region.

The mission was struck by the sudden manner in which the local population left their homes and the suffering the experience must have caused.  The mission did not come across any reports – neither from the local population interviewed nor from the interlocutors - of incidences of violence against civilians following the latest ceasefire.

With limited access to rural areas, no information was available on livestock and farming, including whether the farmers have access to or are ready for wheat sowing in the upcoming season.  The mission did not observe any destruction of agricultural infrastructure or dead animals from the road.

From the conversations that the team was able to have, it is difficult to determine at this stage whether the local population intends to return.  What was clear is that there is a need to build trust and confidence, and this will require time and effort from all sides.

The mission then drove down the Lachin road to the border crossing, a journey taken by more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians in recent days. The mission did not come across civilian vehicles travelling towards Armenia, while in Khankendi, the mission saw a bus with a dozen or so passengers heading to Armenia.

While driving through Aghdam, which is part of the territories regained in 2020, the mission observed destruction and mine action needs, as well as the reconstruction efforts that are being made by the Government.

The mission thanks all the interlocutors and the local population who shared their views. The UN in Azerbaijan plans to continue to regularly visit the region.

The mission calls for all efforts to be made to ensure the protection of the rights of the local population.  The UN in Azerbaijan stands ready to support the remaining local population and those who wish to return, in support of the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan and in partnership with other stakeholders and partners.

Title: Adopting the electronic Readmission Case Management System: Azerbaijan passes its experience to Côte d'Ivoire
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
21 August 2023
The hosts shared with the representatives of the Government of Côte d'Ivoire their knowledge and first-hand experience accrued in the process of the System’s conceptualization, design, and installation, all this in context of the readmission regulatory framework and trends in Azerbaijan. The meetings were supplemented with a demonstration of the eRCMS functionality.
The electronic Readmission Case Management System (“eRCMS” or “the System”) developed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and being deployed in Azerbaijan jointly with the State Migration Service (SMS) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is attracting attention internationally. Various countries are considering the introduction of eRCMS to optimize readmission management with the European Union (EU) member states and are willing to learn from the pioneering case of Azerbaijan.
Thus, on 10-11 August 2023, a delegation from the Government of Côte d'Ivoire visited Baku. The guests planned to observe finalized eRCMS and best practices related to its deployment accumulated by their Azerbaijani counterparts in the course of implementation of the EU-funded “Strengthening Readmission Management in Azerbaijan” project.
Representatives of the Ivorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior and Security working in the area of migration and readmission management, identity and civil registration, IT project and data administration had a series of meetings with the officials from the Azerbaijani SMS and MFA. The topics of the discussion ranged from development, customization, and deployment of eRCMS to the project planning and implementation in broader terms. The hosts shared with the representatives of the Government of Côte d'Ivoire their knowledge and first-hand experience accrued in the process of the System’s conceptualization, design, and installation, all this in context of the readmission regulatory framework and trends in Azerbaijan. The meetings were supplemented with a demonstration of the eRCMS functionality.
Mr Vahid Gahramanov, Head of the Migration Policy and Legal Support Main Department leading the SMS delegation explained the rationale behind adopting eRCMS. While the System is expected to make readmission management more efficient it will also fit perfectly in the mainstream strategy of the Government of Azerbaijan aimed at the overall digitalization and paperless governance.
Mr Ziya Fataliyev, Head of the Citizenship Issues Unit at the MFA Consular Department emphasized importance of preparatory activities such as assessment of the existing regulatory framework, working processes, practices, capacities, and infrastructure related to readmission management. Considering that Côte d'Ivoire is currently at the beginning of the path towards introducing eRCMS, Mr Fataliyev shared practical advice stemming from his close participation in the mapping exercise in the early stages of the eRCMS development in Azerbaijan.
Ms Minata Dieket Nee Sanganoko, Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Côte d'Ivoire and a senior member of the delegation reiterated that Azerbaijan's experience in the field of readmission management including establishment of eRCMS is of special interest to her country.
As the eRCMS familiarization visit of the Ivorian delegation to Azerbaijan proved to bring added value, IOM Azerbaijan and the Azerbaijani Government partners agreed to continue organizing such visits for the benefit of other countries planning to introduce eRCMS.
The “Strengthening Readmission Management in Azerbaijan” project funded by the European Union via the EURCAP Facility and implemented by IOM Azerbaijan together with the State Migration Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan aims to enhance readmission management in Azerbaijan particularly through introduction and operationalization of an electronic Readmission Case Management System (eRCMS) that will optimize processing of readmission cases between Azerbaijan and the European Union member states.
In Côte d’Ivoire a project titled “Introducing the Government of Côte d’Ivoire to Electronic Readmission Case Management” is also being implemented under the EURCAP Facility.

10 August 2023
The campaign which addresses both sexual, labour, and child exploitation as a prevalent form of modern-day slavery, is part of IOM’s ongoing initiative that aims to support governments, civil society organizations, international organizations, and the private sector to combat human trafficking in Azerbaijan.
IOM Azerbaijan is currently conducting a public information campaign during the months of July and August to raise awareness about human trafficking.
The awareness-raising campaign carried out within the “Combatting Trafficking in Persons Activity” Project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) targets both vulnerable groups and the general public in Azerbaijan in the sense that not only those at immediate risk of trafficking will be targeted with direct preventative messages, but also the general population.
Promotional posters and videos in Azerbaijani and English languages were developed with the aim to raise public awareness about trafficking, prevent vulnerable persons from becoming victims of trafficking, and encourage people to report concerns to the specialized police department by advertising the Main Department on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings Helpline number 152.
The images of the awareness campaign are published on the Mission’s social media pages, as well the message about the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons is spread through the influencers which seek to encourage involvement and inspire action to combat human trafficking. Large posters are displayed in the streets of the capital of Azerbaijan, public places illustrating different types of human trafficking that pose a threat to society.
The campaign which addresses both sexual, labour, and child exploitation as a prevalent form of modern-day slavery, is part of IOM’s ongoing initiative that aims to support governments, civil society organizations, international organizations, and the private sector to combat human trafficking in Azerbaijan.
IOM works closely with the Azerbaijani government to support multi-sectoral collaboration in prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnership in order to effectively combat the trafficking crime and further improve the country’s effectiveness in preventing and combating human trafficking and forced labour in the framework of the 4th National Action Plan for 2020-2024 on Countering Trafficking in Person (NAP4).

03 August 2023
The workshop aimed to increase awareness among companies about human trafficking and emphasize the role of the private sector in combating this crime.
On July 31, 2023, as part of the initiatives commemorating the World Day against Trafficking in Persons, the IOM Mission to Azerbaijan organized a workshop specifically for representatives from the private sector. The workshop was held within the Countering Trafficking in Persons Activity project funded by USAID.
The workshop aimed to increase awareness among companies about human trafficking and emphasize the role of the private sector in combating this crime. The importance of strengthening partnerships between the private sector, public sector, and civil society organizations to effectively prevent trafficking and improve the lives of vulnerable populations was highlighted during the workshop.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Taha Amr, Officer in Charge of IOM Mission in Azerbaijan, emphasized the significance of the workshop, which brought together prominent private sector representatives, SME Unions, Azerbaijan Human Resources Institute, and various state and civil society organizations in Azerbaijan.
“According to the latest global estimates, 50 million people were living in modern slavery in 2021, and 28 million of them were in forced labor. Social and economic marginalization, lack of education and relevant skills, and unfavorable economic conditions are a few reasons for forced labor and other forms of trafficking to take place,” he noted.
During the workshop, it was stressed that the private sector has a crucial role to play in the fight against trafficking in persons. Private entities can act as facilitators, preventers, and combatants of human trafficking.
Furthermore, the private sector's importance in the reintegration of trafficking victims was highlighted. The participants emphasized the need to raise awareness among private sector members and establish an open dialogue between diverse business sectors, companies, governments, and NGOs to recognize the shared responsibility in effectively combating trafficking in persons at the national level.
During the workshop, experts and participants from the private sector shared best practices in engaging the private sector in combating trafficking, particularly in facilitating victim reintegration. They also discussed opportunities for enhancing partnerships between the private sector and civil society organizations in Azerbaijan.
Through the Countering Trafficking in Persons Activity funded by USAID, IOM collaborates closely with the Azerbaijani government to promote multi-sectoral collaboration in prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnership. The project aims to raise public awareness about human trafficking and provides technical and financial support to civil society organizations that operate shelters and assist potential and actual victims of trafficking and forced labor.

The training, conducted by trainers from the Mine Action Agency of The Republic of Azerbaijan, was particularly valuable for the ongoing and planned kahriz rehabilitation works in the liberated Jabrayl district, which is being carried out by IOM Azerbaijan.
IOM Azerbaijan organized training on Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) for its personnel working in liberated territories to prevent injuries and save lives. The training took place in Mingechevir city on 7 July 2023 and was attended by kankanks (kahriz masters), operators, technicians, engineers, and office personnel. It is crucial to implement effective EORE interventions with affected individuals and communities to ensure their safety.
During the training, participants were informed of the signs of danger zones and rules of conduct in unfamiliar and suspicious areas, different types of mines and ammunition were demonstrated, and the possible consequences they could cause were  explained.
The training, conducted by trainers from the Mine Action Agency of The Republic of Azerbaijan, was particularly valuable for the ongoing and planned kahriz rehabilitation works in the liberated Jabrayl district, which is being carried out by IOM Azerbaijan.
Currently, IOM Azerbaijan is working on the rehabilitation of Asgar and Orta kahrizes in Horovlu village in Jabrail district, as part of the "Integrated Rural Development for IDP Communities in Azerbaijan through Revitalization of Kahriz Water Supply Systems" project funded by the Korea International Cooperation Agency.
As part of the mentioned project, a total of 26 kahrizes located in the Aghdam, Goranboy, Fuzuli, Goygol, and Gazakh districts were successfully rehabilitated.
The main goal of the project is to prevent forced economic migration by improving the access of rural communities in Azerbaijan to energy-free water resources. This is achieved through the establishment of water infrastructure, which in turn increases agricultural productivity and improves livelihoods. Additionally, the project creates opportunities for income-generating activities that are linked to the renovation of kahrizes.
The project implemented by IOM Azerbaijan contributes to Azerbaijan’s efforts to fulfil three Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) through the provision of water for domestic and agricultural needs which has a direct impact on poverty reduction and food security (SDG 1), empowering and involving women into the decision-making process, increasing their role in the community in terms of leadership (SDG 5), and the rehabilitation of eco-friendly and sustainable water supply systems, kahrizes and enhanced access to safe drinking water (SDG 6).

This event supported the efforts of Azerbaijan, Belarus, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in becoming a party to the Rotterdam Convention.
The regional workshop, which will be held from July 4-6, 2023, afocuses on the needs identified through extensive online consultations held in 2022 and informal requests received from several non- The Rotterdam Convention Parties in the region. The event aimes to facilitate dialogue and build capacity towards the ratification and implementation of the Rotterdam Convention amongst these non-Party countries.
"The Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan and FAO are officially carrying out activities on the preparation of national action plans and strategies, including the promotion of sustainable development of agriculture and rural areas. Today's meeting also serves as an important platform for promoting this cooperation." Bariz Mehdiyev, deputy head of FAO's Partnership and Coordination Office in Azerbaijan, said in his opening speech.
Bariz Mehdiyev emphasized the successful implementation of the GEF-funded "Lifecycle Management of Pesticides and Disposal of POPs Pesticides in CA countries, Azerbaijan and Turkiye ",which has contributed to the reduction of persistent organic pollutants and other obsolete pesticides, which pose a high risk to public health and the environment, as well as to the strengthening of the legal and institutional framework in this area.
The RC Secretariat appreciates the cooperation of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of the Republic of Azerbaijan for co-hosting this high-level event.
The Rotterdam Convention's ultimate goal is to protect human health and the environment from potential hazards of certain chemicals and pesticides involved in international trade. It is a legally binding international instrument jointly administered by FAO and UNEP.
While the Convention doesn't ban any chemicals or pesticides, it promotes an information-sharing process to enable its Parties to make informed decisions about future imports of potentially hazardous substances. It supports transparency in international trade, encourages harmonized labelling, and fosters the necessary infrastructure and capacity for safely managing chemicals. In line with the FAO's Strategic Framework 2022-31, the work of the Rotterdam Convention is integral in transitioning to more efficient, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable agri-food systems by 2030.
The Secretariat provides continual support to Parties in all aspects of implementation, offering technical assistance, arranging face-to-face meetings, workshops, and providing assistance to projects focused on the safe management of hazardous chemicals. This comprehensive support has a significant impact on the global network, bolstering regional cooperation, and fostering synergies between various conventions.
The workshop serves as an essential platform for collaboration and capacity building, marking an important milestone in the journey towards broader ratification of the Rotterdam Convention in the region.

These success stories reflect the impact that the collective efforts can have on the lives of those affected by trafficking and forced labor.
On 20-21 June 2023, the representatives of IOM Azerbaijan conducted monitoring visits to Ganja-Goygol regions within the framework of the project "Counter-Trafficking (CT) in Persons Activity," implemented with the financial support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). During the visits, the supported micro-entrepreneurship activities were reviewed, the beneficiaries were provided with basic safety items and at the same time they were given initial instructions on occupational safety. All beneficiaries underwent an environmental impact assessment, in line with USAID requirements, ensuring their business ventures align with sustainable practices.
These beneficiaries who successfully established their own businesses have demonstrated exceptional resilience and entrepreneurial spirit in the face of adversity. The businesses they have opened span various sectors, including barbershops, manicure and pedicure services, patisseries, and even a pilates studio. The success of these ventures serves as a testament to the effectiveness of the project in empowering vulnerable individuals.
During the monitoring visit the project fields of nine beneficiaries were visited. Their stories reflect the transformative power of targeted assistance and support.
In total, 21 vulnerable beneficiaries have been provided with valuable in-kind support, enabling them to pursue sustainable livelihoods and rebuild their lives. These accomplishments signify the tangible impact that collaborative efforts can have in addressing the complex challenges of trafficking in persons and forced labor. These success stories reflect the impact that the collective efforts can have on the lives of those affected by trafficking and forced labor.
USAID’s Countering Trafficking in Persons Activity, implemented by IOM since 2015, assists the Government of Azerbaijan and NGOs to further improve Azerbaijan's effectiveness in preventing and combating trafficking in persons and forced labor as well as addressing gender-based violence.

22 June 2023
The MGI assessment process in Azerbaijan will be finalized based on the comments received during today’s consultation on the draft MGI report. This report will then be uploaded to IOM’s Global Migration Data Portal where it can easily be accessed.
On 21 June 2023, IOM Azerbaijan in close collaboration with the State Migration Service (SMS) organized the interministerial consultation meeting on the Migration Governance Indicators process in Azerbaijan.
The event started with the opening session where the participants were welcomed by Ms Amela Mujagic, Chief of Mission for IOM Azerbaijan, and Mr Vahid Gahramanov, Head of the Migration Policy and Legal Support General Department of the State Migration Service.
In her opening remarks, Ms Amela Mujagic highlighted the importance of the consultation meeting which gathered the relative government agencies and non-governmental organizations. She noted that Migration Governance Indicators is an IOM tool comprising a standard set of approximately 90 indicators, which can offer insights on the policy levers that countries can use to develop their migration governance structures. “In Azerbaijan, the process started on 8 December 2022, with the organization of an introductory meeting to brief the relevant Government Agencies about the process. IOM in close collaboration with SMS organized interviews with the relevant government agencies during December 2022 and March 2023 to collect data on the main indicators and based on this data, a draft Migration Governance Profile summarizing the most important findings has been produced and shared with the government of Azerbaijan,” said Ms Mujagic.
Mr Vahid Gahramanov expressed his confidence that the final document, which will be prepared as a result of the joint efforts of representatives of international organizations, the relevant state agencies, and civil society organizations, will contribute to migration management in Azerbaijan, and therefore called on the participants to actively participate in the consultations.
After opening speeches, presentations on MGI, its tool, and process, and links with national and international processes, the MGI report findings, the Migration policy of the Republic of Azerbaijan and MGI, and linkages of the MGI with the Global Compact for Migration were delivered to national government officials from Ministry of Foreign Affairs, SMS, Ministry of Interior Affairs, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Science and Education, Ministry of Emergency, State Committee on Refugees and IDPs, State Committee on Work with Diaspora, and representatives of local NGOs.
During the consultation meeting, the participants discussed the good practices and main gaps identified in the draft Migration Governance Profile. This consultation meeting was an opportunity for participants to comment on the draft profile so that it reflects the challenges specific to their context as well as their priorities in terms of migration governance.
Most importantly, the consultation is an opportunity for the government to discuss how it would like to address some of the areas for potential development identified.
The MGI assessment process in Azerbaijan will be finalized based on the comments received during today’s consultation on the draft MGI report. This report will then be uploaded to IOM’s Global Migration Data Portal where it can easily be accessed.
Migration Governance Indicators (MGI) is an IOM tool comprising a standard set of approximately 90 indicators, which helps countries identify good practices as well as areas with potential for further development. It can offer insights on the policy levers that countries can use to develop their migration governance structures. MGI assessments are conducted upon government request, and the profiles are published with their consent. It is a consultative process and governments are engaged through all stages of this process. Currently, over 90 countries worldwide participated in the MGI assessment process.

This high-level regional meeting represents a significant step forward in addressing the major challenges faced by hospitals in Europe.
On 5–7 June, WHO Regional Office for Europe, together with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance (SAMHI), and the Administration of the Regional Medical Divisions (TABIB) is co-hosting a high-level regional meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan on the future of hospitals. Focusing on the theme of ‘Fit-for-purpose hospitals: prioritizing quality and sustainability to meet the demands of modern healthcare’, the event brings together more than 200 government representatives, hospital practitioners, and partners from across WHO European Region to discuss major challenges facing hospitals in the European Region — with a particular emphasis on Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
Supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through a joint project with WHO Country Office in Azerbaijan, the three-day event will explore a wide range of topics, including the challenges and opportunities hospitals face, envisioning a transformative future for healthcare facilities, establishing climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable hospitals, digital transformation, optimizing human resources, effective governance and management for hospitals, and driving hospital transformation towards primary health-care-oriented systems.
Speaking at the opening speech, Health Minister Teymur Musayev highly appreciated the relevance of the essence and goals of the international meeting for the modern era. Teymur Musayev emphasized that Heydar Aliyev, the national leader of our nation, whose 100th anniversary was celebrated in Azerbaijan this year, laid the foundation for our country's successful cooperation with WHO: "The groundwork for most of the achievements of our national health care was made with the personal participation of the Great Leader during his leadership of our country."
Teymur Musayev pointed out that during the last 15 years, important works have been carried out in the direction of the infrastructure, human capital, and modernization of the national healthcare system of Azerbaijan: "During this period, more than 700 medical institutions equipped with modern equipment have been built and renovated. Important achievements have been accomplished in the formation and development of the potential of professional medical staff, and the curriculum of Azerbaijan Medical University has been adjusted to international standards. At the same time, there were great opportunities to reevaluate the paradigm of healthcare by making the citizen factor a priority goal in the treatment and prevention centers. "The initial stage is already being implemented with successful results."
"The event is taking place at a time when there is a special need to strengthen primary health services in the world. The transformation to a sustainable and rapid unified digital platform for primary healthcare, inpatient and outpatient treatments, and the application of modern management in healthcare systems are extremely urgent. Today's event will be an important step in preparing the functionality of healthcare systems for future public health issues," concluded the minister.
In his speech, the Executive Director of TABIB Dr. Vugar Gurbanov spoke about the important role of hospitals in health care and noted that continuous work is being done to adapt the operation of hospitals to the changing demands. However, along with that, he also drew attention to the importance of identifying the need of eliminating the main problems and improving management in the hospital sector.
According to Dr. Vugar Gurbanov: "It is our joint responsibility to create an environment that supports continuous learning and innovation in the hospital, to inculcate modern patient care methods among the medical staff, as well as to ensure the health and well-being of the hospital staff." According to him, work is currently being done to improve the way hospitals operate, and special attention is paid to ensuring that existing processes and systems work effectively in accordance with our goals. "This includes the introduction of new technologies, identification of new financing mechanisms, improvement of infrastructure, reduction of workload for staff, and efficient use of resources," said Dr. Vugar Gurbanov. At the same time, in his speech, he emphasized the implementation of new approaches to public health care and the provision of consistent activities in the direction of improving primary health care services. "I think that this high-level meeting will allow us to define new contours of our strategy," with the words of Dr. Vugar Gurbanov finished his speech.
“Each hospital is a special and unique place. It’s not only a building where we provide services; a hospital is part of its community, where people come to work every day, where families come hoping their loved ones are cured, feel better, and they are critical drivers of the health system transformation in the European Region,” said Dr. Natasha Azzopardi Muscat, the Director of WHO/Europe’s Division of Country Health Policies and Systems. “We as WHO/Europe are proud and honored to be co-hosting this regional meeting in Baku with the Ministry of Health and our partners in Azerbaijan, and look forward to moving this important agenda forward, together.”
Dr. Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative to Azerbaijan, highlighting the importance of transformative change in the area of hospitals, noted "Hospitals are an integral part of the healthcare system, and it is essential that we address their challenges and embrace opportunities for improvement. This meeting serves as a platform to bring together experts and stakeholders to collectively shape the future of hospitals in Europe."
The final day of the meeting will be dedicated to Azerbaijan, focusing on identifying the country's specific needs and defining WHO's role in providing support and solutions. This session will include the active participation of national and international participants, as well as WHO experts, ensuring a comprehensive and collaborative approach to addressing the country's healthcare needs in the field of hospitals.
This high-level regional meeting represents a significant step forward in addressing the major challenges faced by hospitals in Europe. Through robust discussions, sharing best practices, and leveraging expertise, it will contribute to the development of strategies and solutions that prioritize quality, sustainability, and the evolving demands of modern hospitals and the transformative change they need.

Title: USAID and WHO launched event series to teach people life-saving CPR skills
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
12 May 2023
The latest event of the series was held at Ganjlik Mall on May 9, where 122 people had a chance to learn and apply hands-only CPR on a mannequin under the supervision of experts
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a crucial first response during sudden cardiac arrest, as research shows that for each minute of cardiac arrest without CPR, the chance of survival decreases by about 10%. However, immediate hands-only CPR can double or triple the survival rates after cardiac arrest.
It is not necessary to be a trained medical professional to apply CPR. Everyone, including children aged 12 or above, can learn this life-saving skill. World Health Organization (WHO) in Azerbaijan is organizing a series of "Life-Saving Hands!" community engagement events to teach citizens the hands-only CPR technique and raise awareness about the importance of learning CPR skills.
The latest event of the series was held at Ganjlik Mall on May 9, where 122 people had a chance to learn and apply hands-only CPR on a mannequin under the supervision of experts. Similar event took place previously at Park Bulvar on May 6, where 108 visitors of the mall gained basic skills in applying hands-only CPR. The next event is planned for 28 Mall on May 11 from 17:00-19:00.
These CPR community engagement events are part of the Azerbaijan Pandemic Response Activity, which is funded by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by WHO Azerbaijan in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance, and TABIB.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
12 May 2023
The project is being implemented by FAO together with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Azerbaijan within the framework of the FAO-Azerbaijan Partnership Program.
In the framework of the joint cooperation of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and Agrarco LLC, the capacity building activities were carried out through hands-on training and demonstrations to increase the knowledge and skills of hazelnut farmers from Zagatala, Balaken, Gakh, Oguz, Gabala and Khachmaz districts, with a main focus on the management of hazelnut orchards, preparation for the new season, application of sulphur, and fertilizer application incorporated within irrigation system.

The activities were carried out under the government funded "Catalysing the Efficiency and Sustainability of Azerbaijan’s Hazelnut Sector” project.

As part of the training sessions, small-sized farm owners participated in the demonstrations of technological innovations and processes applied by Agrarco LLC, one of the leading agribusiness companies in the agricultural production. The mutual exchange of experience created an opportunity to increase the skills and awareness of the participants in this field. All the activities are carried out in accordance with the joint agreement between FAO and Agrarco LLC.

The cooperation aims to consolidate several efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by expanding partnership activities with the private sector. Increasing the knowledge and skills of more farmers (especially small-sized farm owners), contributing to the further development of agricultural and food production systems in the country, and increasing the opportunities for co-financing from large-scale development funds, especially the Green Climate Fund (GCF), are among  the main directions of activities.

During the practical training sessions held in Zagatala and Khachmaz, the farmers were provided with the detailed information about the ongoing activities in the hazelnut cultivation, and their importance for the region, as well as the hazelnut sector. During the sessions, 40 hazelnut farmers (9 women, 31 men) from the project's target regions were enlightened as to the seasonal diseases and control measures, preparation of different solutions and proper spraying of orchards by adjusting the sprayers. In addition, the participants were informed about the fertilization, fertilizer types and application norms that will have a positive effect on the future productivity of hazelnut trees, as well as their growth during the vegetation period. The application of proper fertilization through the fertigation method (technique of supplying dissolved fertiliser to crops through irrigation systems) was practically demonstrated to hazelnut farmers.

According to the agreement, it is aimed to organize such trainings and meetings continuously. The following experience exchange event is planned for the autumn covering the topics of proper harvesting, drying and storage. In addition, cooperation aiming at increasing the quality of the produced hazelnuts and adding value will be discussed as a joint activity of the parties at the next stage.

The project is being implemented by FAO together with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Azerbaijan within the framework of the FAO-Azerbaijan Partnership Program.

07 April 2023
Mentioning all these issues in her speech, Dr. Harmanci emphasized the role of purposeful joint action in achieving every success: "We achieved these achievements together with our local partners and we are proud to play a leading role in these activities. I hope that in the future, our relations will become stronger and we will achieve universal health coverage."
World Health Organization (WHO), founded in 1948, is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year on April 7 - World Health Day. In connection with this historic day, a series of events are planned to be held throughout the year by the WHO within the framework of the "Health for All" campaign.

The 75th anniversary of the WHO provides an opportunity to look back o the achievements in the field of public health that have improved the quality of life over the past 70 years in the country and globally. This outstanding event can also be seen as an opportunity to tackle the challenges that lie ahead in the healthcare field in the near future, while also spurring progress toward health for all.

On this occasion, Dr Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative in Azerbaijan and Head of the Country Office, delivered a speech on " World Health Organization's 75 years of Leading the Charge in Global Health" at Azerbaijan Medical University (AMU). At the event, Dr. Geray Geraybeyli, rector of the university, delivered his opening speech and expressed his satisfaction with the close cooperation with the organization. At the meeting attended by more than 200 students, Dr. Harmanci informed the participants about WHO's mission, structure, current activities, achievements gained in the world and Azerbaijan, and opportunities for cooperation.
Due to close cooperation and continuous support, Dr. Harmanci was awarded the "Certificate of appreciation" by Dr Garaybeyli at the event. In the end, students' opinions were heard and their questions were answered.

The WHO constitution is the first document in history that officially recognizes health as a human right. Since then, significant progress has been made toward the implementation of this idea. Globally, life expectancy has increased from 46 to 73 years, even in the poorest countries. Smallpox has been eradicated, and polio is almost completely eradicated. All these achievements are only two important points of the work done by the Organization during its 75 years of existence. In addition, malaria has been eliminated in 42 countries, HIV and tuberculosis epidemics have been stopped, and at least one tropical disease has been stopped in 47 countries.

In the past five years, the first vaccines for Ebola and malaria have been developed and licensed. For the past 3 years, WHO has coordinated the global response to the worst health crisis of this century, the COVID-19 pandemic.

Azerbaijan has also achieved many successes in the field of health care. Thus, in 2002, it was given the status of a country free from polio, and in 2023, from malaria. WHO Collaborating Centre (СС) on prevention and control of TB in Prisons is the only one of its kind in the world, established for the prevention and control of tuberculosis in prisons.

Mentioning all these issues in her speech, Dr. Harmanci emphasized the role of purposeful joint action in achieving every success: "We achieved these achievements together with our local partners and we are proud to play a leading role in these activities. I hope that in the future, our relations will become stronger and we will achieve universal health coverage."

31 March 2023
The workshop aimed to provide an overview of the System of Health Accounts 2011 methodology and discuss the preliminary data needed to produce a health accounts study in Azerbaijan.
As global health spending continues to increase, assessing how resources are used and comparing health systems across countries is critical. Providing technical support to countries introducing the System of Health Accounts is one of WHO’s priorities. Taking the global leadership in health expenditure tracking and providing data and international comparisons, WHO is providing technical support to Azerbaijan to help them study their country context, build local capacity, and ensure the sustainability of the SHA procedures.

To further support Azerbaijan's efforts, WHO conducted a two-day workshop on Introducing the System of Health Accounts, with representatives of the national working group from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health, the State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance, TABIB and the State Statistics Committee.

The workshop aimed to provide an overview of the System of Health Accounts 2011 methodology and discuss the preliminary data needed to produce a health accounts study in Azerbaijan. The workshop covered topics such as overview of the Health Accounts Production Tool (HAPT), country-tailored health expenditure tracking methodology, country examples of producing health accounts and discussing available data from the national partners for the health accounts study.

WHO continues its support to strengthen Azerbaijan’s health system.

The System of Health Accounts (SHA) is an internationally accepted methodology for summarising, describing, and analysing the financing of health systems. By systematically tracking the flow of expenditures in the health system SHA is critical for improving governance and accountability at the national and international levels of policymaking.

Title: Migration data management and the electronic Readmission Case Management System as a source of statistical data: a training workshop at the Regional Training Centre on Migration on 15 February 2023
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
17 February 2023
Trainers from the RTCM put together and delivered presentations on data sources of international migration statistics, role of data in migration management, demand for migration data, migration data management in Azerbaijan, and statistical functionalities of the eRCMS.
As part of the programme activities the electronic Readmission Case Management System (eRCMS, the System) is being developed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and deployed Azerbaijan in collaboration with the State Migration Service. The eRCMS will feature robust statistical functionalities and will allow for faster and more efficient processing of readmission cases exchanged between Azerbaijan and the European Union (EU) member states, but also for generating insightful statistical reports. The end-users of this System will be able to instantly compile various statistical datasets based on the anonymized data. Disaggregation and visualization of statistical data will support relevant state authorities and decision makers to improve analysis and its interpretation.
Access to accurate and versatile readmission related data facilitates budgetary and operational planning, staffing, policy development and legislative regulation, reintegration efforts at national level as well as meaningful and efficient dialogue with international partners, for example within the Azerbaijan-EU Joint Readmission Committee.
In practice readmission related statistics will often be analyzed in context of multiple migration processes, trends and fulfilment by the state authorities of broader range of migration management functions. With this in mind IOM Azerbaijan supported delivery of a training workshop on migration data management for the staff from several governmental agencies of Azerbaijan, including the State Migration Service, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs, State Statistical Committee, State Committee on Work with Diaspora, State Committee for Affairs of Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons, Office of the Ombudsperson, and Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population. Since the subject of migration data is of interest of wider audience, participants from the Migration School and the Migration Volunteer Public Union were welcomed at the workshop.
The event was hosted by the Regional Training Centre on Migration (RTCM), another joint initiative of the State Migration Service and IOM Azerbaijan. RTCM’s curriculum contains topics on migration data management and its significance for evidence-based policy development. Trainers from the RTCM put together and delivered presentations on data sources of international migration statistics, role of data in migration management, demand for migration data, migration data management in Azerbaijan, and statistical functionalities of the eRCMS.
The electronic Readmission Case Management System is developed by IOM under the EU Readmission Capacity Building Facility (EURCAP) funded by the European Union. Also, a bundle of related training modules was developed under the EURCAP Facility: for eRCMS end-users and administrators, on migration data management, on institutionalization of the eRCMS etc.
The Regional Training Centre on Migration is a training institution and knowledge hub for representatives of various stakeholders from Azerbaijan, its neighbouring countries, as well as countries from Central Asia, Middle East, Eastern Partnership and beyond. The RTCM has been established by the State Migration Service and IOM Azerbaijan with the financial assistance of the IOM Development Fund.

Title: Improving the quality of sheep farming in Azerbaijan by establishing Farmer Field Schools
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 January 2023
The "Farmer Field Schools" approach is a unique participatory approach that aims to help farmers to take ownership of their own development and training. The farmers determine the training agenda and curriculum. The approach aims to empower local farmers to analyze their own production systems and identify key constraints.
In the framework of the project FAO–Azerbaijan Partnership Programme "Development and application of sustainable sheep production and food value chains" project, refresher training for the establishment of Farmer Field Schools (FFS) in the field of sheep farming is being carried out for selected master trainers and facilitators. The activities are carried out by Jurjen Draaijer, an international expert on Farmer Field Schools at FAO, with the support of the national expert on training and capacity building – Elshad Rzayev.
The "Farmer Field Schools" approach is a unique participatory approach that aims to help farmers to take ownership of their own development and training. The farmers determine the training agenda and curriculum. The approach aims to empower local farmers to analyze their own production systems and identify key constraints. The FFS group will then find local solutions to these constraints, by doing on-farm experiments in order to test and validate new technologies, and/or, if needed, with the assistance of outside expert advice.
The training sessions were held in the Aghjabadi, Beylagan and Zagatala regions of Azerbaijan (the project's pilot districts). The project will now establish several FFS groups in the three districts that will meet every two weeks.
The FFS approach is new and unique in Azerbaijan," said Elshad Rzayev, FAO consultant on Farmer Field Schools. “So far, the facilitators and sheep farmers have been very enthusiastic. During the first meeting with the newly established FFS group in Kabirli village of the Aghjabadi district, we observed the willingness among the additional sheep farmers to be involved in FFS, which can be considered as existing big potential to establish more than one FFS group in each village”.
During the sessions, the facilitators' guide for sheep-related Farmer Field Schools (FFS) provided information to local farmers, helped them to understand their production systems, and identified the main constraints in sheep production. It also helped to facilitate possible solutions that can be tested and adapted within the FFS experiments.
The publication merges traditional knowledge with international expertise and practices, and farmers can choose and select the most suitable methods and technologies.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 January 2023
FAO-Türkiye Partnership Programmes are a powerful support mechanism for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG 1 No Poverty and SDG 2 Zero Hunger.
24 January 2023, Baku, Azerbaijan – A regional workshop dedicated to the FAO–Türkiye Partnership Programmes (FTPP) took place on 24 January in Baku, Republic of Azerbaijan, to discuss the results and successes of recent projects. The workshop participants consisted of high-level representatives of relevant institutions in the countries of the subregion involved in the projects. The workshop was held as part of the  “Enhancing the visibility of the FAO–Türkiye Partnership Programmes" project.
Building on Türkiye’s long-lasting partnership with FAO, the FAO–Türkiye Partnership Programmes have had a transformative impact on agriculture, food and natural resources management, notably in beneficiary countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Since the initial phase of FTPP in 2007, the scope of the programme has widened to include more countries and to encompass new themes. Türkiye’s total contribution reached USD 30 million. Currently, the FTPP consists of two modules: the FAO–Türkiye Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture (FTPP II) and the FAO–Türkiye Forestry Partnership Programme (FTFP). FTPP II and FTFP together comprise 20 projects covering a wide array of topics including but not limited to fisheries, forestry, food security, food safety, food loss and waste, and rural women.
The one-day workshop provided participants from the Republic of Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Moldova, the Republic of Tajikistan, the Republic of Türkiye, the Republic of Turkmenistan, and the Republic of Uzbekistan with a valuable opportunity exchange knowledge and share experiences on how to  enhance food security, reduce rural poverty and strengthen capacities in forestry, natural resources, desertification and sustainable development. Speakers, panelists and participants discussed the objectives, activities and accomplishments of FTPP projects implemented under the programmes, exchanging lessons learned and experiences, and providing an opportunity to discuss steps for the future.
During the opening session, speakers emphasized the role of FTPP in the development of food and agriculture sectors in the beneficiary countries, and expressed  their appreciation of Türkiye’s contributions to the programmes.
Two keynote sessions followed. In the first, the Assistant FAO Representatives of Türkiye and Azerbaijan presented a panoramic view of the FTPP, identifying priority issues in the partner countries related to food systems, natural resources, capacity building and sustainable development, and detailing the success of the projects. Moreover, in this session, Erzsebet Illes, planning and programme coordination officer explained how the FTPP contributes to the implementation of the new FAO Strategic Framework.
The second keynote session explored the sustainability of the FTPP across a series of presentations delivered by government representatives of the beneficiary countries.
The workshop included various panel discussions on good practices highlighting project successes with a focus on gender and rural development as well as on the future of the FTPP where Panelists shared their opinions on innovative approaches and linked current and emerging issues at the country level with global and regional trends in food and agriculture and natural resources management. The panel also discussed the relationship between FAO’s four betters concept and innovations in production, nutrition, environment, and life.
The last panel was dedicated to the communication and visibility activities of the FTPP. Specialists from Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Türkiye and Uzbekistan discussed regional communication strategies and public information campaigns for the programmes’ achievements. They also explored the linkages between the Sustainable Development Goals and FTPP communication activities. The closing session of the workshop then summarized the main lines of the workshop.
This regional event demonstrated that the FTPP responds effectively to current challenges in the agriculture and food sectors and natural resources management in the beneficiary countries. All participants agreed that the resulting regional collaboration and synergies enable the FTPP to function as a powerful support mechanism for achieving the SDGs, in particular No Poverty and Zero Hunger.

We need transformative solutions to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals and leave no one behind.
This requires greater public-private sector collaboration to develop strategies for, with and by persons with disabilities.
The cornerstone of this cooperation must be the active participation of persons with disabilities in their full diversity, and their full inclusion in all decision-making processes.
Innovation and technology can be powerful tools for inclusion.
They can enhance access to information, education, and lifelong learning. And they can open new avenues for persons with disabilities to participate in the workforce and society at large on an equal basis.
But to realize the promise of technology we must close the digital divide and safeguard human rights in the digital space.
For our part, the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy presents a concrete road map to advance disability inclusion and accessibility across the work of the Organization.
From headquarters to the field, we are working to assess, address and promote digital accessibility and lead by example on disability inclusion.
On this day and every day, let us work together in finding innovative solutions to build an accessible and equitable world for all.

On the second day of the mission, the experts informed participants about the implementation process of SHA, provision of information flow, and required time and resources. The reforms carried out in Azerbaijan's healthcare system in recent years, healthcare financing mechanisms, and the flow of healthcare costs were also discussed at the workshop.
SHA is used as an analytical tool to monitor and evaluate the performance of the healthcare system. In addition, tracking health expenditures based on the SHA methodology provides policymakers with richer information about the use of health services compared to traditional fiscal analysis.
WHO continues to provide technical support to Azerbaijan to study the country, conduct initial assessments, build local capacity and ensure the sustainability of the SHA process.

On 29 November 2022, the Chief of Mission for IOM in Azerbaijan, Vladimir Gjorgjiev, participated in the debate Forum against Gender-Based Violence and Discrimination held at Mingachevir State University. In his speech, Gjorgjiev underlined the importance of cooperation among partner organizations to improve the effectiveness of combating gender-based violence by raising public awareness within such campaigns.
In his speech, the Chief of Mission called for the protection and prevention for women and girls from all forms of violence.
“Protection is key to the victim-centered approach that the community should take in its efforts to combat gender-based violence. Effective victim protection entails identifying victims, providing referrals for a comprehensive array of services, and supporting these individuals as they rebuild their lives. Prevention efforts are an equally important component of the efforts to combat gender-based violence. With the dissemination of accurate and targeted information, raising awareness on violence against women and girls, communities will be better prepared to respond to the threat of such violence,” said Gjorgjiev.
It should be mentioned that along with its contributions to the 16 Days of Activism campaign, IOM Azerbaijan within USAID-funded project assists the Government of Azerbaijan and NGOs to further improve Azerbaijan's effectiveness in preventing and combating trafficking in persons and forced labor as well as addressing gender-based violence. This includes technical and financial support to civil society organizations operating shelters that provide housing and services supporting the dignity of survivors and offering them the opportunity to lead a normal life.

24 November 2022
The event held under the auspices of the Regional Training Center on Migration attended by more than 30 representatives of various government agencies, international organizations, banks, Azerbaijan’s diaspora organizations, migrants’ associations in Azerbaijan, and other non-governmental organizations started with the opening session where the participants were welcomed by Mr Vladimir Gjorgjiev, Chief of Mission for IOM Azerbaijan, and Mr Vahid Gahramanov, Head of the Migration Policy and Legal Support General Department of the State Migration Service.
In his opening remarks, Mr Gjorgjiev highlighted the importance of the project which is implemented in partnership with the relative government agencies, banks, diaspora, international, and non-governmental organizations. He noted that remittances in Azerbaijan represent an important source of income for households, particularly in rural areas. At the same time, remittances are an engine for the socioeconomic growth of the country. Hence, this project is very timely in the context of increased remittance flows to/from Azerbaijan.
“According to the World Bank’s and Azerbaijani Central Bank’s data, the total amount of remittances sent to Azerbaijan in 2021 equaled over 3% of GDP. During the first 6 months of 2022, remittance inflows totaled 1.6 billion USD. What is more, Azerbaijan hosts tens of thousands of migrants live in Azerbaijan that send a considerable amount of remittances back to their home countries. Hence, this project is very timely in the context of increased remittance flows to/from Azerbaijan,” said Gjorgjiev.
Mr Vahid Gahramanov noted that the successful implementation of the project will benefit not only migrants and their families, but also small businesses and the general economy of the country. “Since 2006 despite the implementation of various measures by certain partners in the field of money transfers, the creation of a relevant system or any other consistent result was not achieved. We have already started to see the results of the mentioned project and we hope that it will continue,” noted Gahramanov.
After opening speeches, the participants were informed about the results of an assessment of the government’s policies, strategies, and regulations, as well as the existing infrastructure, technology, and models pertaining to digital money transfers to determine legal, social, economic, and gender gaps regarding the growth of digital remittances and adjacent financial services, and stakeholder analysis. During the second day of the meeting organized virtually, participants were informed about various digital tools for remittances and IOM’s activities with regard to digital remittance solutions.  The participants discussed and exchanged views about digital remittance solutions to determine what would be applicable to Azerbaijan.
The overall objective of the 2-year project is to contribute towards greater financial inclusion and use of digital financial services among Azerbaijani migrants abroad and migrants in Azerbaijan, and remittance recipients in Azerbaijan and abroad how to support sustainable livelihood development. This project is implemented with funding from the IOM Development Fund and in cooperation with the State Migration Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Title: WHO continues work for supporting Rehabilitation and Assistive Technology services in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
17 October 2022
The objectives of the mission were to respond to the interest of the Government in scaling access to rehabilitation and AT services, expressed by the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population, and State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance.
The mission assessed the current Rehabilitation and AT situation in Azerbaijan using WHO standardized tools Systematic Assessment of the Rehabilitation Situation (STARS) and Assistive Technology Capacity Assessment (ATA-C) and provided technical assistance on the integration of Rehabilitation & AT in the coordinated development of multisectoral cooperation and (Inter) Departmental Action Plan within Azerbaijan Government.
During the mission, the experts held meetings with different government authorities and visited rehabilitation facilities in Baku, Ganja, Naftalan, Sheki, Gabala, Nakhchivan, and other regions of Azerbaijan. Focus group discussions were held with the participation of representatives from relevant ministries and government agencies on leadership, governance, emergency medical care, human resources for health, finance, information systems, and service delivery. Further engagements were also held with people who need access to vital rehabilitation and AT services as well as with groups of service providers. During these engagements, preliminary results of the assessments were introduced, and feedback was collected. At the end of the mission, the experts provided recommendations from the assessments that can aid planning for further development of the AT and Rehabilitation strategy to elaborate the National Roadmap Action Plan for Azerbaijan.
Rehabilitation is about helping children and adults to be as independent as possible in everyday activities and enables participation in education, work, recreation, and meaningful life roles such as taking care of family.  Similarly, access to vital AT products can help people see and hear better; it can help people with intellectual and cognitive disabilities to interact more effectively with others, and it can support people with psychosocial disabilities to manage and work through difficult times. Assistive technology helps people to realize their rights in tangible everyday ways.
Azerbaijan is committed to strengthening its Rehabilitation and AT sectors and is planning to develop a health roadmap under the leadership of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population. WHO Country Office in Azerbaijan continues to provide technical support to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population in this effort.
In the past two years, WHO has been engaging in multiple Rehabilitation and AT activities such as a rapid-AT Assessment (r-ATA) household survey that collected information from 5,597 respondents across 1,156 households in eight economic zones of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The results of the r-ATA survey were extremely useful in providing key information about the AT demand in the country.
On a global scale, WHO is implementing ambitious initiatives to strengthen Rehabilitation in health systems and scale access to AT products and services. These initiatives aim to improve people’s functioning, leading to greater participation and heightened quality of life, especially for persons with disabilities or non-communicable diseases, and for healthy aging.

Title: UNHCR continues promoting refugee education in Azerbaijan with the support of the United States and other donors
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
21 September 2022
UNHCR is thankful to the donors, particularly to the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany, as their financial contributions enabled UNHCR to continue promoting refugee education and inclusion.
Apart from ensuring free and unhindered access to primary and secondary education, UNHCR Azerbaijan provides material assistance to all refugee and asylum seeker families once a year to cover the expenses of purchasing school supplies and uniforms. As the new academic year is about to start, UNHCR Azerbaijan distributes one-time allowances for each refugee and asylum seeker child attending school. Last year, UNHCR distributed more than 350 tablets to refugee and asylum seeker schoolchildren to facilitate their access to online classes during the Covid-19 pandemic.
In 2021, within the DAFI Scholarship (Albert Einstein German Academic Refugee Initiative funded by the German Federal Government) Programme, UNHCR Azerbaijan supported 23 refugee students with tuition fees and monthly allowances. Additionally, UNHCR covered tuition fees for some 47 young refugees and asylum-seekers studying in universities and colleges with the funds allocated by other donors, primarily by the United States. Furthermore, some private universities, such as ADA and Khazar University, provided full or partial scholarships to refugee and asylum seeker students.
In 2022, additional 5 refugee students were enrolled in the DAFI Scholarship Program, while in parallel UNHCR committed to supporting more than 40 refugee students by transferring their annual fees to their higher education institutions.
Last week, the UN Refugee Agency published its annual education report as world leaders were preparing to debate the future of learning at the Transforming Education Summit at the UN General Assembly in two days. By publishing that report, UNHCR is calling for the inclusion of refugees in national education systems from the start of humanitarian emergencies, through protracted displacement situations, and in longer-term development planning. Also writing in the report, Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, noted that many countries had recently made great progress towards including refugee learners in formal national education systems.
The UNHCR Country Representative in Azerbaijan Guido Ambroso commended the cooperation with the Government that enabled UNHCR to ensure free access and unimpeded access to primary and secondary education for all refugee and asylum seeker children in Azerbaijan and the donor support. “We highly appreciate the openness of the Azerbaijani Government to grant refugee children access to its educational system and are very grateful for the continuous financial assistance by the United States and Germany which allows us to support young and talented refugees to study in colleges and universities in Azerbaijan. In cooperation with the State Migration Service, which I would like to thank, we have managed to get employment for some of the refugees after their successful graduation.” said the Representative.
Nilab Zeynaddin, a young refugee from Afghanistan, has recently been employed as a nurse by the Leyla Medical Centre after her successful graduation from Baku Medical College. Nilab was supported by UNHCR Azerbaijan throughout her studies as the Agency paid her annual tuition fees and some expenses related to transport and purchasing supplies. When Nilab received a job offer from the Leyla Medical Centre, the State Migration Service immediately issued a PIN code which was essential to document her labour contract.
UNHCR Azerbaijan, in cooperation with the relevant national authorities, continues to take measures to promote and facilitate refugee education at all levels. The goal is to improve self-reliance opportunities for the refugees in Azerbaijan and ensure their full and efficient inclusion in the social, economic, and cultural life of the society. As said by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, education is an investment in development, human rights and peace. In this regard, support from the donors is crucial and commendable as it is an investment in the people who will successfully integrate into the host societies or rebuild their countries when they can safely return home.

Title: UN, Azerbaijan discuss ways to improve data availability for SDGs
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
21 September 2022
The event “Azerbaijan in the Global SDG Index” brought together around 45 participants from the Government and the UN entities. They discussed ways to address inconsistencies and methodological issues across global and national databases; improve data collection for the indicators that miss data; and achieve progress on the ground for the indicators that are lagging behind. The participants also identified  a set of concrete actions for the responsible entities to follow up.
Azerbaijan progressed 15 steps in the Sustainable Development Report and Index since 2016 and ranked 50 among 163 countries with increased score of 73.5 exceeding the regional average of 71.6. Despite this paramount improvement, close look at the indicators and the data sources reveals issues that require further consideration.
The Sustainable Development Report and Index is the first worldwide study to assess where each country stands with regard to achieving the SDGs. It is a complement to the official SDG indicators and voluntary country-led review processes. The report uses publicly available data published by official data providers  and other organizations including research centres and non-governmental organizations. It helps the Governments and civil society to identify priorities for action, understand key implementation challenges, track progress, ensure accountability, and identify gaps that must be closed in order to achieve the SDGs.

02 August 2022
As part of the EU-funded ‘Developing innovation-driven and sustainable civil society in Azerbaijan’ project, a survey was held amongst social entrepreneurs working in various spheres such as promoting healthy lifestyles and well-being, supporting the employment of rural women and people of all abilities, improving education opportunities of youth, and providing environmental services.
The aim is of the survey was to better understand the profile of social enterprises, their most faced challenges and types of support needed in the future. The results of the survey will be used in preparing policy recommendations to support development of social entrepreneurship.
Collected from 25 respondents, the results show that majority of these enterprises are established in Baku and sell their goods and services in the local market. Most of these enterprises have small and gender – balanced teams of 5-10 people.
These social enterprises cover the startups and digital businesses alongside traditional businesses and focus on tackling the wellbeing, employment, and decent work, addressing the needs of people with disabilities, and sustainable production issues.
The legal definition of this type of enterprise, funding opportunities, public awareness, and economic climate are mentioned as challenges by the entrepreneurs, and investment support is at the top of their needs to scale up their businesses.
Through the workshops, meetings and advisory support within the social entrepreneurship component, this project aims to boost the country’s efforts to build an enabling policy framework which will help more people to start and grow businesses addressing socio-economic and environmental challenges in Azerbaijan.
This series will be continued with the next round of the international expert’s visit to Azerbaijan in September 2022 and certain steps for the future policy actions will be offered. Lana Lovasic, international expert leading the process, has been to Baku in mid- April and worked with social entrepreneurs on co-creating solutions to overcome existing barriers.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
21 July 2022
The results of the research conducted within the framework of the topic "Results on the interaction and potential opportunities of bioenergy and hazelnut value chain" were presented to the public.
The studies were carried out with the project's international experts, Ana Kojakovic (Energy and Natural Resources expert) and Manas Puri (Sustainable Energy expert).
According to the report, it is stated that a large part of hazelnut shells and pruning residues that can be mobilized for bioenergy production is currently not productively used, and there are fertile conditions for the development of this process. The report predicts that in the next 5 years, the residues of hazelnut products from the currently available areas will be planted in several regions of Azerbaijan (Zagatala, Sheki, Khachmaz, Balaken, Gabala, Gakh, Ismayilli) will increase. In 2026, it is predicted that the residues from hazelnut pruning will increase from 35,784 tons to 45,866 tons per year, the resulting hazelnut pulp from 41,875 tons to 70,704 tons, and the hazelnut shell from 7,466 tons to 13,132 tons. Based on the preliminary results of the report, the information was presented to the interested parties, and the economic potential and socio-economic benefits of the available bioenergy will be further discussed. The final results of the analysis will be given to national stakeholders later this year.
Within the framework of the above mentioned component of the project, 2-day training sessions on "FAO Bioenergy and Food Safety Approach" were held. The approach consists of tools and guidance to support countries through the main stages of the bioenergy policy development and implementation process. Countries may decide to use specific components of the BEFS Approach depending on the level of bioenergy development, and the status of bioenergy policy formulation and implementation. Sustainable bioenergy issues in the hazelnut value chain were also discussed with the participation of representatives representing the private and public sectors in training.
The project, financed by the government of Azerbaijan, is implemented within the framework of the FAO-Azerbaijan Partnership Program.

11 July 2022
This is an occasion to celebrate our diversity, recognize our common humanity, and marvel at advancements in health that have extended lifespans and dramatically reduced maternal and child mortality rates.
At the same time, it is a reminder of our shared responsibility to care for our planet and a moment to reflect on where we still fall short of our commitments to one another.
Amidst COVID-19, the climate crisis, wars and conflicts, humanitarian emergencies, hunger and poverty, our world is in peril.
We still live in a world of vast gender inequality – and we are witnessing renewed assaults on women’s rights, including on essential health services. Complications related to pregnancy and childbirth are still the leading cause of death among girls aged 15 to 19.
Reaching a global population of eight billion is a numerical landmark, but our focus must always be on people.
In the world we strive to build, 8 billion people means 8 billion opportunities to live dignified and fulfilled lives.
When we act on our shared values, we contribute to our common future.
Let us work together towards greater equality and solidarity to ensure that our planet can support our needs and those of future generations.
Let us protect human rights and the ability of all individuals to make informed choices about whether and when to have children.
And let us renew our promise to fully implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for a sustainable and inclusive future for all eight billion of us, leaving no one behind.

Title: A series of measures have been implemented to control pests and pesticides
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 July 2022
A meeting of the Regional Steering Committee of the project was held on June 27-28. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss priorities by country and approve the project's activities and work plans.
The events were attended by representatives of the relevant state institutions, experts, and dignitaries from Turkey, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. On the first day of the event, technical training covering pesticide behaviour, rules for using personal protective equipment, and gender elements were held. Gender aspects related to this field were discussed in technical exercises covering gender elements. The two-part workshop discussed how to promote gender equality in future activities to improve the safe use of pesticides. On the third day of the event, the guests visited the Cengi pesticide landfill and got acquainted with the advanced conditions created in the field and the work done. It should be noted that the packing of 217 tons of hazardous chemicals based on international standards is currently underway at the Cengi pesticide landfill, where obsolete pesticides are stored.
"Repackaging obsolete pesticides and securing them in a safe and controlled area is an important step to prevent health hazards and environmental risks in the region until a viable disposal option is available," said Tania Santivanez, FAO Agriculture Officer and lead technical officer of the project. "Therefore, it is crucial to increase the knowledge among responsible government staff about proper planning and implementation of safeguarding", she added.
Melek Cakmak, Head of Partnership and Liaison Office and FAO Representative in Azerbaijan, said, "due to the lack of proper management and planning in pesticide production and used during the Soviet period, all Central Asian countries and Azerbaijan suffered from the consequences of this. Many obsolete pesticides are still considered a serious hazard to both environment and human health." She highlighted that this project tackles this issue by creating sustainable solutions to support beneficiary governments.
Safeguarding 217 tonnes of liquid polidofen (an old Soviet DDT-based pesticide) and other very long-living pesticides started under the project at the Jangi landfill in Azerbaijan to initiate sustainable solutions in obsolete pesticide management. "Together with FAO, we would like to work on more sustainable management of obsolete pesticides in Azerbaijan, and the recent safeguarding activity is a key beginning of this important collaboration," explained Jafar Maharramov, Deputy Chairman of the Agrarian Services Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture.Several activities have been carried out within the framework of the project, which was launched in 2019. Inventory of unusable pesticides across the country, analysis of the legal framework, proposals to eliminate gaps, the study of alternative possibilities for the destruction of pesticides, incredibly persistent organic pollutants, and relevant technical studies were carried out in the past. In addition, to reduce the use of hazardous pesticides and promote alternative methods for them, pilot activities were carried out in the field of vegetable growing in Khachmaz, Samukh, Shamkir and Goranboy regions to apply advanced agricultural practices, including integrated pest control methods.

21 June 2022
Representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Azerbaijan, Food Safety Agency, the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, Agrarco LLC and Azersun Holding, other state agencies and private sector, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) gathered in the committee meeting.
The meeting discussed ways to protect the genetic resources of hazelnuts, ongoing fieldwork in the demonstration areas and the work done to assess the biomass potential in hazelnut growing, as well as other ongoing activities within the project.
"Hazelnut production is one of the most important agricultural products in Azerbaijan. Hazelnut cultivation is particularly sensitive to climatic conditions and is limited in its distribution to specific areas worldwide. To make hazelnut production more sustainable, we must use different genetic resources and high-quality technology and methods during production. Preserving and sustaining the genetic resources of hazelnuts will create a long-term basis for the quality production of this product." FAO Agriculture Specialist Bonnie Furman made a presentation at the meeting.
"Hazelnut growing areas in Azerbaijan are very favourable regarding soil conditions." According to Umit Sardar, an international expert on perennial planting systems, the declaration of hazelnut growing areas as organic farming zones can be discussed.
The bark of Atababa, the most widely grown variety in the country, is slightly thicker than other varieties. Although it reduces productivity, i.e. the proportion of the inner part, i.e. the kernel, it plays a significant role in the fight against aflatoxin. As part of the project, we carried out practical training on hazelnut pruning and cleaning, and I think that these experiments will positively impact the productivity and quality of hazelnuts, "the expert said in his speech.
It should be noted that the National Technical Committee was established to improve the production and quality of hazelnuts in Azerbaijan, focusing on small farms. Committee members represent the public, private and non-governmental.
The project is implemented jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Azerbaijan under the FAO-Azerbaijan Partnership Program (FATP). It covers Azerbaijan's north-western and north-eastern regions (main hazelnut growing regions - Balakan, Gakh, Zagatala, Khachmaz, Oguz and Gabala). The project's primary goal is to increase the efficiency of hazelnut production using different technologies and to apply advanced agricultural practices on small farms to improve the quality of hazelnuts, with a particular focus on reducing the risk of aflatoxin.

The project on Strenghtening Emergency Care and Infection Prevention and Control Systems in Azerbaijan will support governance structures, national strategies, standards, and procedures for both services, establish relevant education programs at the Azerbaijan Medical University, nursing colleges and other educational institutions. It will also upskill the existing and future workforce in ECS and IPC through national training and certification programs, create a training and simulation center in Sumgayit, establish a national IPC committee and create a best practice national reference laboratory on healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance.
“If COVID-19 taught us anything, it’s that Infection Prevention and Control is an integral part of health systems at all levels if we want to protect health care workers, patients and the greater community from infectious diseases. And during extraordinary times such as this pandemic, we need even better emergency medical care and well-trained staff to be able to respond to the increased needs of the community. We believe that this project will give us another valuable boost in our efforts to strengthen the health system in Azerbaijan,” said Dr. Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative in Azerbaijan.
"Azerbaijan Pandemic Response project is a strong testament to the enduring 30-year partnership between the United States and Azerbaijan.  USAID/Azerbaijan has provided more than $9 million to support the efforts aimed at the immediate and longer-term health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to strengthen and expand the Azerbaijani health system to reach every citizen in the country.  We look forward to deeper cooperation and collaboration with the Government of Azerbaijan in this area and to make the health system a model for the region," said Dr. Jaidev Singh, USAID Mission Director.
World Health Organization implemented a number of projects in close cooperation with the Republic of Azerbaijan to effectively prevent, prepare for, detect and strengthen public health emergencies. This project is a part of WHO and USAID’s ongoing support to Azerbaijan's healthcare.

Title: Message by UN Resident Coordinator Vladanka Andreeva on International Day for Countering Hate Speech
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
18 June 2022
In July 2021, the UN General Assembly highlighted global concerns over “the exponential spread and proliferation of hate speech” and adopted a resolution on “promoting inter-religious and intercultural dialogue and tolerance in countering hate speech”.
Unfortunately, hate speech is on the rise worldwide. It affects us all.
It has potential to incite violence, undermine social cohesion and tolerance, and cause psychological, emotional, and physical harm.
Its scale and impact are amplified today by new technologies of communication.
If left unchecked, hate speech can harm peace and development, as it lays the ground for conflicts and tensions, wide scale human rights violations.
The International Day of Countering Hate Speech is an initiative that builds on the UN Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech.
In line with this strategy, the United Nations has been supporting the civil society and the young people in Azerbaijan and neighboring countries to do their part to counter hate speech and engage in advocacy initiatives – including through social media - to foster peaceful, inclusive, and just societies.
We all have the moral duty of speaking out firmly against all instances of hate speech; we all have a crucial role to play to counter this scourge.
No one is born to hate. Hate is learned. But it can be unlearned – though joint actions, dialogue, and mutual understanding.

This day is declared by the United Nations General Assembly resolution of 2018, and it is a great chance to reiterate that remittances are vital source of income for many people, particularly in rural areas, and an engine for socio-economic growth and development of the countries around the world. “In addition to the economic benefits from sending remittances, migrants are also contributing with their ‘social and cultural remittances’ – which is the constant flow and transfer of their knowledge, experiences, skills, ideas, and cultural values that they regularly transmit back to their people in the country of origin, and this have even more wider development impact to the larger community,” said Vladimir Gjorgjiev, Chief of IOM Azerbaijan.
“While paying for essential items and funding human capital development is arguably the most important function of remittances, studies also show that up to $190 billion can be leveraged for local investment and development.” -IOM Director General António Vitorino on International Day of Family Remittances.
The IOM Azerbaijan in collaboration with the State Migration Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan also contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals related to remittances (SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth) via implementation of “Enhancing the Socioeconomic Benefits of Remittances in Azerbaijan” project, which is fully in line with the Azerbaijan UNSDCF Priority area 1: Inclusive Growth that reduces Vulnerabilities and Build Resilience.
On this occasion IOM Azerbaijan commends the work of the government, banks, private sector and development partners on promotion of digital and financial inclusion and calls upon them to spare no effort in continuing to improve the digital money transfers and assist migrants to send their remittances in a safe and less costly settings.

23 May 2022
The event was attended by the Chairperson of the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs Bahar Muradova, the British Ambassador to Azerbaijan James Sharp, UNDP Resident Representative a.i. Charu Bist, and head of Barda Executive Committee Vidadi Isayev.
The new Women’s Resource Centre located in Barda was opened as part of the “Empowering and creating equal opportunities for vulnerable, conflict affected women in Azerbaijan to overcome barriers towards greater economic and social participation (ECEO)” project implemented by UNDP in partnership with SCFWCA and with the support of the UK Government. The project’s long-term goal is to increase the resilience of conflict-affected women to conflict and trauma. It aims to serve vulnerable women, refugees and IDPs, local executive authorities and municipalities; private sector businesses and local communities, government institutions responsible for family, children and women affairs, labour and social protection, private sector, businesses and local communities.
“Established as part of a joint project with our international partners, this Women's Resource Centre will support the implementation of activities for vulnerable, conflict-affected women, as well as help increase their employment, knowledge and skills. We will continue our activities in this area” – said Chairperson of the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs Bahar Muradova.
“We believe that Women’s Resource Centres will become a platform for change bringing together women from different backgrounds. Services offered in Women’s Resource Centres will increase professional skills of women and contribute to the female entrepreneurship” – said British Ambassador to Azerbaijan James Sharp.
“Gender equality is one of the most important UN sustainable development goals that Azerbaijan committed to achieve. The country has made significant progress in the Gender Development Index. Yet progress is to be made in a number of areas, including reducing the gender wage gaps. The main purpose of establishing Women’s Resource Centres is to support women to stand on their own feet, ensuring stable income. We must also ensure women are active agents of peace and security in the region and that we Leave No One Behind”- said UNDP Resident Representative a.i. Charu Bist.
The project will last until 2024 and envisages the involvement of 360 women in trainings to develop business skills, the participation of more than 540 women in vocational training, and provision of psychological support to more than 800 women and legal support to 600 women.
With the new Center in Barda and WRCs in Agjabadi and Terter the project will ensure it follows Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda and secures women’s participation in peace processes, peacebuilding and security.
The new Centre in Barda builds on the successful model of 15 Women Resource Centres implemented by UNDP and the SCFWCA in the regions of Azerbaijan since 2011. The main mission of these Centres is to help strengthen rural women’s entrepreneurial skills and advance their competitiveness in the labour market, empowering them to overcome the many socio-economic challenges faced by women living in rural areas.

20 May 2022
In September 2021 the Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan has formally applied to WHO Director-General requesting to initiate the process for certification of malaria elimination in Azerbaijan. In framework of this process WHO pre-certification mission consisting of Dr Elkhan Gasimov, Head and Dr Hong Xiao Li, Technical Officer of the Elimination Unit of the Global Malaria Programme in WHO HQ visited Azerbaijan on 16-20 May 2022.
The objectives of the mission were to review documentation, prepared for certification of malaria elimination in Azerbaijan and provide technical advice on improving revealed shortages, if any, assess the programme for prevention of the re-establishment of indigenous malaria transmission, including field visits to formerly malaria-endemic areas, and discuss and reach a consensus with the Ministry of Health on the timeline for the certification process in Azerbaijan.
During the visit, mission members conducted a series of meetings with the health care authorities at central and regional levels. The mission met with the representatives of the Ministry of Health, the Administration of the Medical Regional Divisions (TABIB), Azerbaijan State Advanced Training Institute for Doctors, the epidemiological surveillance units of the Azerbaijan Railways Company and Azerbaijan Airlines and conducted site visits to Gakh, Sheki and Sabirabad districts.
Certification of malaria elimination is the official recognition by WHO of a country’s malaria-free status. WHO grants this certification when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of local transmission of all human malaria parasites has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past 3 consecutive years, and that a fully functional surveillance and response system that can prevent re-establishment of indigenous transmission is in place.
Certification on elimination of malaria of Azerbaijan is planned for 2022.

20 May 2022
The attendees were informed about the significance and importance of traditional agricultural systems, looking closer into potential areas to be designated as GIAHS sites in Azerbaijan. The workshop was an opportunity to discuss the possibility of establishing a framework of Nationally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems.
The importance of promoting GIAHS at a national level
During the event, international and local experts provided information about the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems identified and designated by FAO until today.
"As a positive outcome of the national workshop in Azerbaijan, it was announced that one potential GIAHS site has been identified in three adjacent regions in the North of the country and, subsequently, a draft proposal has been shared with FAO’s GIAHS Secretariat.  The candidate site focuses primarily on beekeeping and traditional honey production, traditional hazelnut production and processing, and the traditional persimmon productionand processing systems, as well as other traditionally produced food and agricultural products in the targetregion", Parviz Aliyev, focal point of Government on GIAHS and national expert on GIAHS stated in his speech.
During the meeting, experiences and best practices on the identification, management and dynamic conservation of such areas were shared with participants, including opportunities for local development after obtaining the GIAHS designation, such as the development of agro-tourism.
Looking back at 20 years of Globally Important Agricultural Heritage systems
Since 2005, FAO has designated 65 systems in 22 countries as agricultural heritage sites, and currently, 15 new proposals are under evaluation by the GIAHS Scientific Advisory Group 2022.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the FAO GIAHS Programme. FAO launched the GIAHS initiative at the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002. Since its inception, the number of agricultural systems recognized as GIAHS has been gradually increasing and contributing to safeguarding the environment, livelihoods, biodiversity and vulnerable communities. In the recent 7 years, the GIAHS programme has evolved and expanded the geographic coverage of GIAHS recognized areas, including Europe. The identification of these three candidates sites, including Azerbaijan, supports the recent development of FAO’s programme.

20 May 2022
Within the joint EU-WHO Solidarity for Health Initiative, an assessment of oxygen supply and use in hospitals has been conducted with the initiative and support of TABIB. Over the COVID-19 pandemic period, the importance of oxygen supply and use in hospitals was continously observed. The proper oxygen supply in hospitals, the oxygen infrastructure creation in intensive care units, and the capacity building on use of oxygen in the treatment are of great importance in terms of efficient cure for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
To assess oxygen supply and use in seven hospitals, as well as in two modular hospitals located in Baku, Sumgayit and Shamakhi a WHO mission was held from the 16th to the 20th of May. Within the mission, Dr Ulian Rotari, the WHO biomedical expert, and Dr Pervin Korkmaz Ekren, the WHO Consultant, assessed the safety of oxygen supply and use in selected hospitals and the oxygen therapy in intensive care medicine, respectively. Dr Jennifer Collins, the WHO disease management expert, undertook the overall coordination of the mission.
After the definition of gaps, the potential support to hospitals over oxygen supply and use, and the preparation of national guidelines were discussed in close consultation with TABIB. During the mission debriefing, a plenary presentation of initial findings and discussions were held. Participants have reiterated that the assessment of oxygen supply and use in hospitals is extremely helpful for the country to provide an opportunity for sharing experiences and collectively analyse the ongoing issues.
The “Solidarity for Health Initiative” is an EU-funded project being implemented by WHO Office in Azerbaijan since April 2020 to support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The project aims to help build a sustainable response capacity to potential pandemics in the future. The Project is part of the continued support of the European Union and the World Health Organization to Azerbaijan.

Title: EU and UNDP support apply ‘Dual Education’ approach  in vocational education in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
11 May 2022
The Dual Education Programme implemented in the framework of the EU-funded ‘VET for the future’ project, helps students to learn in a real-time working environment and directly increases the quality of education while contributing the modernisation process.
The project has helped to build partnerships with leading employers of Sheki, Lankaran, Jalilabad and Baku in the areas of tourism, furniture, textile and services, and the implementation has already been initiated.
As part of the Dual Education Programme, the agreements are made between the Sheki State VET Center and Marxal Resort & Spa, also Sheki Palace hotels in ‘hospitality administrator’ direction; the Jalilabad State VET Center and Woodpecker Furniture Company in ‘furniture master’, ‘carpenter’, ‘furniture fabric designer’ and ‘tailoring equipment operator’ specializations, also between the Lankaran VET Lyceum and the Lankaran Car Service Company in repair-mechanician vocation. Currently, students attend hands-up training courses in the mentioned enterprises.
The students of the Baku State VET Center for Culture and Arts have also joined the Dual Education Programme implemented in the Amburan Recreational Center under the Saffron Restaurants in ‘cook’ specialization, the Araz Supermarket Chain in food & non-food commodities seller and auditing treasurer vocations, while the students of the same Center in tailoring operator groups attend those courses at the Baku Textile Plant LLC.
Differently from traditional vocational education, the Dual Education Programme allows students to apply theoretical knowledge, gained in VET centers, in real working environment of the various enterprises. This learning process continues in parallel and throughout the academic year. At the same time, it helps vocational centers to be directly aware of the market requirements and enable them to make relevant changes in the educational content.
For the implementation of dual education approach, some agreements are made between several employers and VET Centers in the country. In line with these mutual agreements, students are provided with work uniforms, transportation, insurance, and daily food at those enterprises.
As part of the preliminary preparations in dual education, a series of meetings were held with the project stakeholders with the aim to share best practices, identify mutual expectations and commitments, as well as communication trainings were conducted for process participants on wider coverage of these topics.
Through the Dual Education/ Work-based Learning Programme delivered by the project, around 130 women and men students are involved in the process realized in districts while considering gender equality.
In the end of the Programme, 4 curricula and learning materials are planned to be updated accordingly. In the future, it is envisaged to develop the foundation concept for the larger application of this approach.
Activities implemented under the work-based learning approach will help students to directly gain knowledge and skills that meet market requirements, increase their employment opportunities, enhance public-private partnerships, and will contribute develop qualified professionals.

Title: IOM Azerbaijan organizes training sessions for the staff members of the State Migration Service to use its new electronic Readmission Case Management System
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
19 April 2022
This new digital solution for return and readmission case management developed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has intuitive interfaces and is adapted to the context of Azerbaijan. Therefore, it did not take long for the future users of the electronic RCMS to start exploring and probing the full functionality of the RCMS during the training and testing sessions.
The two training and testing sessions  delivered by IOM Azerbaijan’s service provider Technofusion LLC were tailored to the needs of different groups of the future RCMS users: those who will process readmission and transit cases through their individual regular user accounts and those who will adjust various settings in the RCMS through the primary user accounts to ensure the correct workflow and access rights.
The participants were provided with test scenarios that they can later apply in the RCMS, to check how the System responds, and to share the outcomes of the testing with the RCMS developers and IOM. The future users’ feedback and change requests will also be essential for the next releases of the System.
While future users are acquiring skills for operating the electronic RCMS, the IT staff of the State Migration Service is testing the newly installed IT equipment and software purchased and handed over by IOM Azerbaijan to ensure security and integrity of the RCMS when operations go live.
Deployment of the electronic Readmission Case Management System and related activities are implemented by IOM Azerbaijan in partnership with the State Migration Service and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan under the “Strengthening Readmission Management in Azerbaijan” project funded by the European Union via the EURCAP Facility.

Title: Agro-experts invited to provide advisory services to farmers in Guba-Khachmaz and Ganja-Gazakh regions
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
31 March 2022
The expert met with farmers grouped in commodity-based advisory platforms, which are the part of the new agricultural advisory services model proposed by the Project to the country.
During the meetings in Agstafa, Samukh, and Shamkir regions - sorghum and sunflower fields, tomato greenhouses, apple, cherry and plum orchards in Guba region, and tomato fields in Khachmaz region, it was noticed that most of the farmers' problems were caused by not using professional agronomist's advice.
"Unfortunately, today in Samukh district where farmers can sow 4 kg of certified sunflower seeds per hectare, while sowing 14 kg of uncertified seeds per hectare, they increase their costs more than 3 times" - Huseyn Idrisov, Associate Professor of the Department of Horticulture of Azerbaijan State Agrarian University said who was involved as agronomist expert of the project. The agronomist noted that apple orchards in Guba were replaced by cherry orchards without taking into account climate and soil factors, fertilizers and elements were used without soil analysis: "On the sour cherry based advisory platform the farmer gave the iron element to the soil without analysis, and as a result of the analysis, it was determined that this element exceeds normal indicator 7 times. The owner of the orchard explained it by the opportunity to buy this element at an affordable price”. It was also noted that the cases such as non-planting of pollinated varieties in sour cherry orchards, not thinning of flowers during flowering, frequent inter-row plowing in apple orchards and, as a result, drying the roots of the trees earlier, improper use of water, non-compliance with pruning rules show that the farmers treat their farms with the spontaneous habits, not informed skills.
At the meeting of the open field tomatoes` advisory platform in Khachmaz the development of seed production of the local tomato varieties was discussed. As the positive side was noted that the skills of local farmers create favourable conditions for the development of this area.
Commodity-based advisory platforms are groups of farmers that offer agricultural advisory services to be accessible to all farmers. Farmers growing any crop come together in a group and each farmer group  regularly work with a facilitator with a broad supply network. The facilitator, after the discussions with the farmers, provides them with solution or with the contact of other relevant professionals  who can solve the problem.

Title: EU-WHO Azerbaijan presented the results of the 7th wave of the COVID-19 Behavioural Insights Survey
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
28 December 2021
The survey was conducted among 1031 respondents across all regions of Azerbaijan in November with the technical support of WHO experts in collaboration with Public Health and Reforms Center.
The purpose of this study was to conduct monitoring of COVID-19 and vaccination risk perception, behavioural and other factors over time and to assess the relations between them. The survey also assessed disruption of the essential health services during pandemic. Results of the survey were presented by the WHO experts Martha Scherzer and Ardita Tahirukaj. The survey will help decision-makers tailor COVID-19-response strategies, identify key areas to focus on and select messages to communicate for encouraging collective behaviour change.
According to the survey results, health workers remain the most trusted source of information about COVID-19 and vaccination while the rate of those who feel the virus is media-hyped accounts for only 7% which is 5% lower than August. The share of respondents that think current restrictions are greatly exaggerated remains roughly unchanged from August, with 23% strongly agree, meanwhile 52% strongly disagree with restrictions being exaggerated. 89% of respondents report having been vaccinated. Among those unvaccinated, fewer than 5% reported that they would definitely not get vaccinated, whereas the share of undecided respondents increased to 35% compare to August (25 %).
Regarding the continuity of essential health services, about 20% of respondents reported that they postponed healthcare in general and about 22% of respondents were not able to obtain the needed medicines. Respondents with a chronic disease compared to respondents without a chronic disease were 3.5 times more likely to need care, almost twice as likely to postpone the needed care, about twice as likely to report increase in expenses for healthcare. Respondents with worsened income (compared to previous periods in their life) were 3.5 times more likely to need care, over 5 times more likely to postpone care, about 4 times more likely to be unable to obtain their medicines and report increased expenses for care.

03 December 2021
We need everyone, including persons with disabilities, on board to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Around the world, persons with disabilities and their representative organizations are taking action to realize the call: ‘Nothing about us, without us’.
COVID-19 has laid bare the persistent barriers and inequalities faced by the world’s 1 billion persons with disabilities, who have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic.
A disability-inclusive pandemic response and recovery should be guided by persons with disabilities themselves, forge partnerships, tackle injustice and discrimination, expand access to technology and strengthen institutions to create a more inclusive, accessible, and sustainable post-COVID-19 world.
I urge all countries to fully implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, increase accessibility, and dismantle legal, social, economic and other barriers with the active involvement of persons with disabilities and their representative organizations.
On this International Day of Persons with Disabilities, let us commit to build a sustainable, inclusive and just future for everyone, leaving no one behind.

In his opening remarks, Mr Gjorgjiev highlighted the importance of the RTCM for regional countries which will contribute to the process of training and education in the field of migration. “Azerbaijan was not chosen by chance for the location of the RTCM, since this country is located at the intersection of historical and cultural trade routes and is surrounded by countries which have important migration flows. All our partners from regions countries will be benefited and contribute to the RTCM, by sharing their best practices, expertise, and will establish more in-depth collaboration among migration stakeholders,” said Mr Gjorgjiev, Chief of IOM Azerbaijan.
According to the UN Resident Coordinator in Azerbaijan Vladanka Andreeva, the creation of the regional training center will help the countries share experience in migration. “The Regional Training Center for Migration will be a knowledge hub and countries will be able to share their best practices on migration management, to establish migration-specific national research institutions and build relevant knowledge cross-links at national and international level and in line with the Global Compact on Migration vision,” said Ms Vladanka UN Resident Coordinator.
Mr Vusal Huseynov, Chief of the State Migration Service in his speech said the RTCM which gathers experts from the region countries would be an effective platform for strengthening education and training opportunities. “The project on the creation of the regional training center on migration in Azerbaijan is being implemented for already a year. We have already held three training sessions as part of the project,” said Mr Huseynov.
The agenda of the workshop during which the participants elaborated recommendations for a roadmap of the RTCM covered the introductory presentation of RTCM and its future vision, Assessment of current institutional capacities and training needs on migration, Goals, and objectives of the Road Map, IOM African Capacity Building Centre for Migration Management, Identification of training capacity development needs in the main migration pillars.
The "Supporting the establishment of a Regional Training center on Migration Management in Azerbaijan" project funded by IDF (IOM Development Fund) aims to enhance regional training capacities and cooperation on migration management in Azerbaijan, region, CIS countries, and beyond via the Regional Training Centre on Migration that will serve as a hub for knowledge sharing, research, and policy dialogue with governments and a broad range of stakeholders in the field of migration in the region.

Title: The State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs, USAID and UNDP organize Azerbaijan’s first-ever National Conference of  Gender-Based Violence Responders
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
29 November 2021
This Conference was organized as part of the '16 days of activism against gender-based violence' and brought together over 100 representatives from state agencies, international organizations, NGOs and the private sector. They discussed challenges and shared best practices in building efficient systems across all sectors to help address violence against women and girls.
“Azerbaijan has adopted a number of normative and legal documents which paved the way towards comprehensive solutions for women’s issues and progress has been made in protecting and promoting women's rights. The level of women economic empowerment affects the level of violence against women. An economically independent woman is a self-confident woman,” – said Bahar Muradova, Chairperson of SCFWCA.
“The U.S. Government values our partnership with the Government of Azerbaijan to address gender-based violence.  Our joint efforts demonstrate our shared commitment to work and protect the rights of women so that women can live free from violence, ” US Ambassador Litzenberger said.
“In Azerbaijan, we have joined forces with the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs and the US Agency for International Development to help address gender-based violence and improve women’s access to legal and social support in the country. Each and every one of us can and must do more to end gender-based violence against women and girls and keep our promise to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,” – said UNDP Resident Representative a.i. Charu Bist.
At the conference, 12 data specialists from several regions of Azerbaijan who have successfully completed a “Gender disaggregated data collection and analysis” course organized by UNDP were awarded certificates. Over the next few months, these specialists will help build an online platform of Community Data Specialists across the regions and connect them with local and international organizations to ensure better cooperation and coordination.
The conference was organized as part of the “Addressing gender-based violence through comprehensive community effort” component of the "Economic Empowerment for Entrepreneurship and Employment (E4)" project funded by USAID and implemented by UNDP and SCFWCA. The component aims to help tackle violence against women and girls and support their economic empowerment.

Title: WHO’s mission: It is critical to enhance efforts to improve access to assistive technologies
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 November 2021
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss further steps to be taken in this regard. Addressing an opening speech, the WHO Representative in Azerbaijan, Dr. Hande Harmanci said that since the first online meeting conducted on April 2, 2021, significant progress was made with the thorough study of AT needs of the country through a survey and the achievement of goals determined for 2021.

After greeting participants and guests, Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Protection of Population, Hidayat Abdullayev, Deputy Minister of Health, Rahim Aliyev, Chairman of the Social Policy Committee of the Milli Majlis, Musa Guliyev and Chairman of the Human Rights Committee, Zahid Oruj spoke about the importance of the problem. Mr. Satish Mishra, Regional Adviser on Disability, Rehabilitation and Palliative Care of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, and Dr. Cathal Morgan, Disability, Rehabilitation and Health Services Specialist attended the event. Mr. Satish Misra briefed participants on "Rehabilitation and AT in the WHO European Region: Challenges and Opportunities". Thereafter, representatives of the WHO Country Office in Azerbaijan,Mrs. Fidan Talishinskaya and Professor Vugar Mammadov presented results of the “r-ATA” survey (rapid-Assistive Technology Assessment WHO survey tool) that was undertaken in 67 countries by the WHO and conducted in Azerbaijan during 2021 to ascertain the needs of the country. According to 5,597 respondents surveyed in 8 economic regions out of 11 of Azerbaijan, 2 out of 5 persons in the country are experiencing at least some difficulty in one or more of 6 functional domains (mobility, vision, hearing, communication, cognition, self-care). Although one in four people needs AT, but most do not have access to it or can’t afford due to financial difficulties and a lack of support. Furthermore, it is stated that 91% of the assistive products owned by respondents are either paid out of pocket or come thanks to the support of their families and friends. The private sector is the major source of assistive products in the country. In many cases, users have to make a long-distance travel to get AT. The respondents also do not have information about many of existing ATs that are available in the world.

There is a significant lack of awareness and understanding amongst the general population in Azerbaijan as to what an AP is and how APs can be accessed

Findings obtained through the "rATA" study in Azerbaijan were discussed interactively under the moderation of Cathal Morgan in the discussion part of the event when there were important recommendations received regarding the respective field of the country. These mainly covered two directions: 1) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current situation of AT supply/provision, including the development of a roadmap for strengthening the intersectoral cooperation; 2) to simplify access to AT, to raise awareness of AT workers, users and the general public on this matter.

It should be noted that representatives of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population, State Medical-Social Expertise and Rehabilitation Agency, DOST Agency, Ministry of Health, the State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance, TABIB, Milli Majlis, the State Statistical Committee, the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs, Ombudsman's Office, Social Research Center, Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, ADA University, Azerbaijan State Academy of Physical Culture and Sport, Azerbaijan Medical University, Azerbaijan State Advanced Training Institute named after A.Aliyev, embassies, UN agencies, USAID, ICRC and other international and local non-governmental organizations joined the event.

AT, as part of health technology is the application of organized knowledge and skills on assistive products that include systems and services.

Assistive products are any external products (including devices, tools, equipment, instruments of software) which are generally available or especially produced to maintain or improve a person’s functionality and independence in society as well as to promote their well-being. Assistive products also include all rehabilitation means used in the period of disability and have potential to prevent the complications of chronic diseases.

Title: Mission of the WHO Regional Office for Europe related to the strengthening Assistive Technologies and Rehabilitation sector in Azerbaijan has ended
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 November 2021
The objective of the mission was to observe the activities of the AT and Rehabilitation sector in Azerbaijan, to exchange views with stakeholders in AT on results of "r-ATA" survey (“rapid-Assistive Technology Assessment WHO survey tool”) undertaken by the WHO in 67 countries and implemented in Azerbaijan in 2021 with the purpose of studying needs of the people of the country and to discuss possible ways of strengthening this sector.

During the mission, experts met with the representatives of the WHO Country Office in Azerbaijan and leaderships of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population, Ministry of Health, State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance, TABIB and other relevant agencies, discussed in detail the current state of the AT and Rehabilitation sector in Azerbaijan, results of surveys and observations, as well as possible ways of development.

In addition, during visits to the Prosthetic-Orthopedic Production and Rehabilitation Center, DOST Agency of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population, the  Scientific Research Medical Rehabilitation Institute of the Ministry of Health, the manufacture of assistive products, provision of the population with these tools, quality of rehabilitation services and material-technical base were carefully inspected. The mission has ended with a meeting of key stakeholders while partners were provided with results of the survey.

AT enables people to live healthy, productive, independent, and dignified lives, and to participate in education, the labour market and civic life. Today, 1 billion people around the world need AT to live a productive, inclusive and dignified life, but globally only 1 in 10 people have access to assistive products. The use of AT is necessary for many people to preserve and improve their functionality, health and well-being, and to participate in education, work and social activities. The majority of people in need of AT are usually the elderly, people with disabilities, people injured in conflicts, and those suffering from chronic diseases. For the first time in Azerbaijan, the investigation of needs in 6 functional domains (mobility, vision, hearing, communication, cognition and self-care) survey was conducted through the “r-ATA” with the initiative of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population and support of the WHO in 2021.

The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in the international prices of a basket of food commodities, averaged 133.2 points in October, up 3.9 percent from September, rising for a third consecutive month.
The FAO Cereal Price Index in October increased by 3.2 percent from the previous month, with world wheat prices rising by 5 percent amid tightening global availabilities due to reduced harvests in major exporters, including Canada, the Russian Federation and the United States of America. International prices of all other major cereals also increased month-on-month.
The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index went up 9.6 percent in October, hitting an all-time high. The increase was driven by firmer price quotations for palm, soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils. Palm oil prices rose for a fourth consecutive month in October, largely underpinned by persisting concerns over subdued output in Malaysia due to ongoing migrant labour shortages.
The FAO Dairy Price Index rose by 2.6 points from September, influenced by generally firmer global import demand for butter, skim milk powder and whole milk powder amid buyers’ efforts to secure supplies to build stocks. By contrast, cheese prices remained largely stable, as supplies from major producing countries were adequate to meet global import demand.
The FAO Meat Price Index slipped 0.7 percent from its revised value in September, marking the third monthly decline. International quotations for pig and bovine meats fell amid reduced purchases from China of the former and a sharp decline in quotations for supplies from Brazil of the latter. By contrast, poultry and ovine meat prices rose, boosted by high global demand and low production expansion prospects.
The FAO Sugar Price Index dropped by 1.8 percent from September, marking the first decline after six consecutive monthly increases. The decline was mainly the result of limited global import demand and prospects of large exportable supplies from India and Thailand as well as a weakening of the Brazilian Real against the US dollar.
Record cereal output in 2021 but stocks set to decline
Despite an expected record world cereal production in 2021, global cereal inventories are seen heading for a contraction in 2021/22, according to new forecasts in FAO’s Cereal Supply and Demand Brief, also released today.
The forecast for world cereal output in 2021 is now pegged at 2 793 million tonnes, down by 6.7 million tonnes since the previous report in October, largely due to cuts to the estimates of wheat production in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Turkey and the United States of America. By contrast, global coarse grains output has been revised upwards. An upward revision to maize production was driven by better-than-previously expected yields in Brazil and India and improved prospects in several West African countries. Compared to last year, global cereal production is anticipated to increase and reach a new record level.
Forecast at 2 812 million tonnes, world total cereal utilization in 2021/22 is heading for a 1.7 percent gain from the 2020/21 estimated level, led by an anticipated increase in global food consumption of wheat, rising in tandem with world population, while foreseen higher feed and industrial uses of maize should also contribute to the expected annual increase.
World cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2022 are forecast to fall 0.8 percent below their opening levels, to 819 million tonnes. Consequently, the world cereals stocks-to-use ratio is forecast to decline slightly, from 29.4 percent in 2020/21 to 28.5 percent in 2021/22, but still indicating an overall comfortable level.
Following an upward revision this month on stronger-than-earlier-anticipated global trade in wheat and rice, world trade in cereals is now forecast to expand and reach a new record in 2021/22 at 478 million tonnes, up 0.3 percent from the 2020/21 level.

Title: Step up climate change adaptation efforts or face huge disruption: UN report
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
04 November 2021
The Adaptation Gap Report 2021: The Gathering Storm found that while policies and planning are growing for climate change adaptation, financing and implementation are still far behind where they need to be.In addition, the report finds that the opportunity to use the fiscal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize green economic growth that also helps nations adapt to climate impacts such as droughts, storms and wildfire is largely being missed.
“As the world looks to step up efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions – efforts that are still not anywhere strong enough – it must also dramatically up its game to adapt to climate change,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “Even if we were to turn off the tap on greenhouse gas emissions today, the impacts of climate change would be with us for many decades to come. We need a step change in adaptation ambition for funding and 
implementation to significantly reduce damages and losses from climate change. And we need it now.”
Financing of adaptation remains weak
Current promises under the Paris Agreement point to global warming of 2.7°C by the end of the century. Even if the world limits warming to 1.5°C or 2°C, as outlined in the agreement, many climate risks remain. While strong mitigation is the best way to lower impacts and long-term costs, raising ambition in adaptation, in particular for financing and implementation, is critical to keep existing gaps from widening.
The report finds that the costs of adaptation are likely in the higher end of an estimated USD 140-300 billion per year by 2030 and USD 280-500 billion per year by 2050 for developing countries only. Climate finance flowing to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation planning and implementation reached USD 79.6 billion in 2019. Overall, estimated adaptation costs in developing countries are five to ten times greater than current public adaptation finance flows, and the gap is widening.
COVID-19 opportunity being missed
USD 16.7 trillion of fiscal stimulus has been deployed around the globe, but only a small portion of this funding has targeted adaptation. Fewer than one-third of 66 countries studied had explicitly funded COVID-19 measures to address climate risks as of June 2021. At the same time, the heightened cost of servicing debt, combined with decreased government revenues, may hamper future government spending on adaptation, particularly in developing countries.
Some progress in planning and implementation
While early evidence suggests that National Adaptation Plan development processes have been disrupted by COVID-19, progress is being made on national adaptation planning agendas.
Around 79 per cent of countries have adopted at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument, such as a plan, strategy, policy or law. This is an increase of seven per cent since 2020.
Nine per cent of countries that do not have such an instrument in place are in the process of developing one. At least 65 per cent of countries have one or more sectoral plans in place, and at least 26 per cent have one or more subnational planning instruments.
Meanwhile, implementation of adaptation actions continues to grow slowly. Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reveals that the top ten donors funded more than 2,600 projects with a principal focus on adaptation between 2010 and 2019. Projects are also getting bigger, with more projects attracting funding over USD 10 million.
More action needed
Despite this progress, the report finds that further ambition is needed in financing and implementation.The world needs to scale up public adaptation finance through direct investment and byovercoming barriers to private sector involvement. More and stronger implementation of adaptation actions is needed to avoid falling behind on managing climate risks, particularly in developing countries. The world also needs to consider higher-end climate scenarios projected by the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The report also found that governments should use the fiscal recovery from the pandemic to prioritize interventions that achieve both economic growth and climate change resilience. They should set up integrated risk management approaches and establish flexible disaster finance frameworks. Advanced economies should also help developing countries to free up fiscal space for green and resilient COVID-19 recovery efforts through concessional finance and substantive debt relief.

Title: UNHCR urges governments to accelerate progress and resolve plight of world’s stateless
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
04 November 2021
“Significant progress has been made over the past few years, but governments must do more to close the legal and policy gaps that continue to leave millions of people stateless or allow children to be born into statelessness,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi.
Statelessness, or the situation of not being recognized as a citizen by any country, affects millions of people around the world. Stateless people cannot often access the most basic of rights, including being able to go to school, work legally, access health services, marry, or register the birth of a child.
Since UNHCR launched its #IBelong campaign in 2014 to raise attention and advocate for an end to global statelessness, more than 400,000 stateless people in 27 countries have acquired nationality, while tens of thousands of people across Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas now have a pathway to citizenship as a result of newly enacted legislative changes.
Over the past seven years, 29 states have acceded to the Statelessness Conventions, signaling strengthened political will to end statelessness.
“We are encouraged by this global momentum to tackle statelessness, which with concerted efforts by States, we can eradicate. But unless progress accelerates, the millions who remain deprived of a nationality will be stuck in a human rights limbo, unable to access the most basic rights,” said Grandi.
Statelessness has many causes which are typically the result of gaps or flaws in nationality laws, and how they are implemented. Discrimination - including on the basis of ethnicity, religion and gender - is a major driver of statelessness.
Because they are not recognized as citizens, stateless people are often deprived of legal rights or basic services. This leaves them politically and economically marginalized and vulnerable to discrimination, exploitation, and abuse. They may also not be able to access COVID-19 testing, treatment or vaccination, and may have little access to support or protection in the face of climate risks.
Governments hold power to enact legal and policy reforms that can help stateless people on their territory acquire citizenship or prevent statelessness from occurring in the first place, sometimes with the stroke of a pen, or a relatively simple legal change. It remains an easily avoidable and solvable issue.
UNHCR’s decade long #IBelong campaign calls on states to end statelessness by 2024.
ENDS
Notes to editors / background information:
Worldwide, UNHCR’s statistical reporting counts 4.2 million stateless people in some 94 countries. Given that most countries do not collect any data on statelessness, the actual figure is believed to be substantially higher.
To date, 96 States are party to the 1954 UN Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons, and 77 are party to the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.
Since the start of the #IBelong Campaign:
This Press Release is available here
Azerbaijan acceded to the UN Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons and Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness without reservations.
Within the #IBelong campaign, the State Migration Service of the Azerbaijan Republic launched the 2016 nationality determination campaign to identify and document stateless people. One of the pledges of Azerbaijan at the High-level Segment on Statelessness held in October 2019, was to ensure naturalization of registered stateless persons by the end of 2022.
As a result of measures taken by the Azerbaijani Government by 1 October 2021:

Title: UNHCR delegation visited Azerbaijan, discussed solutions for displaced and conflict-affected people
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
29 October 2021
The mission objective was to discuss the conditions and prospects for return of the internally displaced people and refugees as well as concrete aspects of UNHCR’s role as envisaged by the tripartite statement signed between Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in November 2020.
In Baku, to discuss solutions for displaced and conflict-affected people the UNHCR delegation met with the high-level officials, including Mr. Jeyhun Bayramov, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Hikmat Hajiyev, President’s Aide for External Affairs, Mr. Rovshan Rzayev, Chairman of the State Refugee and IDP Affairs Committee, Mr. Vusal Huseynov, Head of the State Migration Service and Mr. Fariz Rzayev Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.
During the meeting with Mr. Jeyhun Bayramov, UNHCR’s Deputy Director Angela Li Rosi thanked the Government of Azerbaijan for their efforts and emphasized that UNHCR stands ready to provide support to the return process in its areas of expertise and looks forward to stepping up its engagement in the weeks and months to come. “We are confident that the Government and UNHCR will continue their engagement to ensure a sustainable and inclusive approach to returns in safety and dignity”, said Li Rosi. Mr. Elchin Amirbekov, Assistant to the First Vice president was also present at the meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
In order to assess the conditions on the ground, the delegation visited several locations in the districts of Aghdam, Barda, Fuzuli, Terter, Jabrayil and Zangilan. In Terter, where UNHCR has been delivering cash assistance and core relief items to help the most vulnerable in the conflict affected areas, the delegation visited a settlement and met with families living there. One of the displaced women in Terter who was also affected by the 2020 conflict and received UNHCR’s assistance in 2021, said that she and her husband hope to be able to go back to their area of origin if the conditions are safe. In Barda and Aghdam UNHCR met partners providing legal advice for displaced people and conducting awareness raising and information sessions, including in view of returns. In Zangilan, the delegation visited a village identified for piloting returns where reconstruction is proceeding at a fast pace.
The UNHCR delegation expressed its appreciation for the long-standing partnership with the Government of Azerbaijan as well as local authorities. UNHCR established its presence in the country in December 1992 when it initiated a large emergency relief operation to assist hundreds of thousand persons displaced at the time.

Title: UN Secretary-General: "The Glasgow Climate Test"
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
29 October 2021
World leaders will soon be put to the test at the UN Climate Conference — known as COP26 — in Glasgow.
Their actions — or inactions — will show their seriousness about addressing this planetary emergency.
The warning signs are hard to miss: temperatures everywhere are reaching new highs; biodiversity is reaching new lows; oceans are warming, acidifying and choking with plastic waste. Increasing temperatures will make vast stretches of our planet dead zones for humanity by century’s end.
And the respected medical journal The Lancet just described climate change as the “defining narrative of human health” in the years to come — a crisis defined by widespread hunger, respiratory illness, deadly disasters and infectious disease outbreaks that could be even worse than COVID-19.
Despite these alarm bells ringing at fever pitch, we see new evidence in the latest UN reports that governments’ actions so far simply do not add up to what is so desperately needed.
Recent new announcements for climate action are welcome and critical — but even so, our world is on track for calamitous global temperature rises well above 2 degrees Celsius.
This is a far cry from the 1.5 degree Celsius target to which the world agreed under the Paris Agreement – a target that science tells us is the only sustainable pathway for our world.
This target is entirely achievable.
If we can reduce global emissions by 45 per cent compared to 2010 levels this decade.
If we can achieve global net-zero by 2050.
And if world leaders arrive in Glasgow with bold, ambitious and verifiable 2030 targets, and new, concrete policies to reverse this disaster.
G20 leaders — in particular — need to deliver.
The time has passed for diplomatic niceties.
If governments — especially G20 governments — do not stand up and lead this effort, we are headed for terrible human suffering.
But all countries need to realize that the old, carbon-burning model of development is a death sentence for their economies and our planet.
We need decarbonization now, across every sector in every country. We need to shift subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and tax pollution, not people.  We need to put a price on carbon, and channel that back towards resilient infrastructures and jobs.
And we need to phase-out coal — by 2030 in OECD countries and 2040 in all others. Increasing numbers of governments have pledged to stop financing coal — and private finance needs to do the same, urgently.
People rightly expect their governments to lead. But we all have a responsibility to safeguard our collective future.
Businesses need to reduce their climate impact, and fully and credibly  align their operations and financial flows to a net-zero future. No more excuses; no more greenwashing.
Investors — public and private alike — must do the same. They should join front runners like the net-zero asset owners alliance, and the UN’s own pension fund, which met its 2021 carbon reduction investment objectives ahead of time and above its target, with a 32 per cent reduction this year.
Individuals in every society need to make better, more responsible choices in what they eat, how they travel, and what they buy.
And young people — and climate activists — need to keep doing what they’re doing: demanding action from their leaders and keeping them accountable.
Throughout, we need global solidarity to help all countries make this shift.  Developing countries are grappling with debt and liquidity crises. They need support.
Public and multilateral development banks must significantly increase their climate portfolios and intensify their efforts to help countries transition to net-zero, resilient economies. The developed world must urgently meet its commitment of at least $100 billion in annual climate finance for developing countries.
Donors and multilateral development banks to allocate at least half their climate finance towards adaptation and resilience.
The United Nations was founded 76 years ago to build consensus for action against the greatest threats facing humanity.  But rarely have we faced a crisis like this one – a truly existential crisis that — if not addressed — threatens not only us, but future generations.
There is one path forward.  A 1.5 degree future is the only viable future for humanity.
Leaders must get on with the job in Glasgow, before it’s too late.

Title: FAO Azerbaijan Workshop on Gender and Food Loss and Waste
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
28 October 2021
Without this strive it is impossible to improve nutrition, agricultural productivity, natural resource management, rural livelihoods and food security.  FAO’s project “Reduction of Food Loss and Waste in the SEC Countries” funded by FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme successfully implemented in Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, aims at contributing to the reduction of food loss and waste.  Approximately one out of every four calories of food grown to feed people is not ultimately consumed by humans (WRI, 2013). All types of food are lost and wasted to a varying extent across the globe and across all stages of the food value chain. Food losses negatively affect food security and nutrition while significantly contributing to increased environmental and economic costs of food production, whereas gender relations have an impact on the overall efficiency of the food value chain and consequently on food losses
Considering the above, FAO Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia and the FAO Liaison Office in Azerbaijan held a two-day online workshop to raise awareness of on gender equality principles in food loss and waste (FLW) and strengthen national counterparts’ knowledge related to integrating gender concerns into FLW interventions. s.
The main purpose of the workshop was to raise awareness of the concepts of gender equality, Azerbaijan's national and FAO's commitments and present the current situation of rural women in the country. Despite their important role in food value chains in Azerbaijan, rural women often face specific constraints in accessing essential productive resources, services and information, and in participating in decision-making. These constraints affect their ability to fully contribute to and benefit from food loss reduction
24  (17 women and 7 men) participants attended the Workshop, representing public institutions, international organizations, private sector and CSOs working in the field of food value chains and food waste in Azerbaijan, including representatives of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture, Independent Consumers Union (ICU), Women's Entrepreneurship Development Association, Packaging Association of Azerbaijan, Food Safety Agency, Agrarian Research Center, GIZ, USAID and FAO Project Staff.
The gender experts, prior to the Workshop has identified the needs of the trainees and developed the methodology that consisted of theoretical and practical parts. The basics of gender equality, the gender issues in food loss and waste and application of these concepts into the work of the practitioners were introduced. The lively discussions mostly covered the area of field examples and gender relations as a primary component of the social and economic context, which shapes the functioning of the value chains at all levels.  A case of the dairy value chain was provided by participants, where a considerable amount of milk losses occurs at handling, storage, and collection.  Due to spillage and spoilage, the milk was rejected by companies because of poor quality. A gender-sensitive analysis applied revealed that it is mainly women producers who are experiencing losses due to the use of inappropriate equipment, lack of knowledge of quality standards, and their inability to reach a formal market in a timely manner (direct causes). In addition, cultural norms and the domestic workload limit women’s access to technologies and information, and their active participation in producer organizations.
“Addressing the gender and in particular women’s issues systematically are essential components of FAO’s effort to reduce food loss. We are delighted, that our solutions, in addition to the field and policy work, include capacity interventions”-, said Kaan Basaran, FAO Azerbaijan International Programme Specialist. “We hope to continue these efforts as part of the global mandate of eradicating hunger and attaining  food security”.
The training was held within the framework of the “Reduction of Food Loss and Waste in the SEC Countries” project funded by FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme, GCP/SEC/015/TUR “ and aims at contributing to the reduction of food loss and waste (FLW) in the context of national food systems and climate change. The project is being implemented in Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uz-bekistan, including Azerbaijan and aims to collaborate with and benefit from external international institutions, providing technical advice and knowledge in FLW measurement and accounting, FLW reduction methodologies, awareness raising and information dissemination.

27 October 2021
In the initial stage of the project, the comprehensive assessment of the emergency care system was conducted focusing on the system organization, governance and financing, emergency care data and quality improvement, scene care, transport and transfer and referral, facility-based care and emergency preparedness.
In the framework of the evaluation, the experts from the WHO Headquarters and Country Office in Azerbaijan together with the representatives of the TABIB visited six hospitals and dispatcher centers located in Baku, Shirvan, Salyan and Lankaran.
To discuss the findings of the assessment, a 2-day event was organized with the participation of local partners, including the representatives of the Parliament, Ministry of Health, TABIB, Ministry of Emergency Situations, United Nations specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations and health care workers from various hospitals.
During the event, consensus-based action priorities of emergency care services in Azerbaijan were identified. In this regard, Dr. Lee Wallis, WHO emergency care expert gave his recommendations on the development of action priorities based on the results of the assessment.
The project will provide technical support to eliminate gaps in emergency care measures identified by legislation, standards, system and authorities based on international practice. Further stages of the project will encompass training sessions for increasing capacities of health care workers specialized in emergency care and support to the country in the establishment of a new paramedic degree.

To this end, on 22 October 2021, VAC organized an info-session titled “Ethical treatment of victims of human trafficking: guide for health providers” at the Shirvan Central Hospital.
The info-session, which was attended by 25 employees of the hospital, served to increase health providers’ knowledge on ethical treatment guides and rules towards victims of human trafficking as well as legal responsibility for violation of confidentiality.
Gunel Efendiyeva, the sociologist at the Center for Assistance to Victims of Human Trafficking, stressed the importance of raising public awareness about human trafficking, noting the important role of healthcare workers in this issue, as well as in the detection of victims of trafficking.
During the training, participants were also provided with general information on human trafficking, victims and potential victims of trafficking, elements of human trafficking, types of exploitation, signs of victims of human trafficking, as well as the National Action Plan to combat human trafficking and existing legislation.
At the end of the training, a video on the fight against human trafficking was shown and brochures and booklets were distributed. The training ended with answering questions from participants.
The staff of the hospital expressed satisfaction with the organization of training and the information provided. One of the questions they were interested in was the indicators of victims of human trafficking and the forms of ethical treatment of them.
It should be noted that the same events were previously held for employees of Balakan, Shamakhi, Ismayilli, Zagatala, and Gusar district hospitals.
Currently, IOM Azerbaijan provides technical and financial support to the civil society organizations operating shelters assisting potential and actual victims of trafficking, labor force, and gender-based violence (GBV), and supports the enhancement of multi-stakeholder coordination and institutional cooperation on tackling forms of human trafficking, forced labor, and GBV within “Counter - Trafficking in Persons Activity” project funded by USAID.

Title: UN project helps policy makers in Azerbaijan form sustainable development policies for Belt Road Initiative
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
13 October 2021
Over two years, the project worked with policy makers in Azerbaijan to build their capacity in forming economic and sustainable development policies in relation to BRI, an initiative linking countries and seas across Asia, Europe and beyond, with huge potential for economic development.
The BRI-SDG project, implemented by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and funded by the UN Peace and Development Fund, trained technical staff and policy makers in Azerbaijan and thirteen other pilot countries. Workshops focused on how to design clear and integrated macroeconomic, social and environmental policies which align with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
‘To harness the opportunities brought by major regional initiatives like the BRI, Member States need to better assess the potential impacts of such initiatives, explore possible policy scenarios and develop integrated policies to optimize their impacts while managing the potential risks,’ Said Mr. Liu Zhenmin Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, ‘This will require enhancing the capacity of national policymakers and experts in data collection and analysis to support the evidence-based policy making.’
The project used the World Economic Forecasting Model to run simulations of the impact of various types of investments, including BRI infrastructure investments, in Azerbaijan. A national report was then produced from this analysis.
The simulation found that Azerbaijan could be driven by faster investments and consumption growth, resulting in GDP growth. Labour force participation may also increase, potentially leading to greater increases in output. The report highlights how Azerbaijan has embraced the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, developing national sustainable development strategies and plans. However, SDG financing requires extensive mobilization of public and private resources.
It is recommended that practicing best standards and sharing training and lessons learned on the links between BRI and SDG’s will further boost the impact of BRI activities on sustainable development in Azerbaijan. Greater benefits will also be evident if the country takes steps to actively track BRI activities and their integration with SDGs.
The report also recommends that evidence-based policymaking, derived from quality research and applied analysis, may be instrumental in producing better policy options, reducing poverty, stimulating economic growth, and enhancing the quality of life in Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan was one of fourteen BRI countries which participated in the project.  Full results of the simulations are outlined in a global report and each of the 14 country reports.
Overall analysis of the fourteen countries shows that BRI investments were found to have a positive impact in the early years if the size of the investment is significant enough. Beyond this, the risk of debt distress or environmental costs and the effects on other SDG indicators such as poverty and gender equality, will depend on the effectiveness of policy measures taken in each country.
About BRI-SDG - The Economic Analysis and Policy Division (EAPD) of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) implemented a multi-country, multi-year project to strengthen national capacities for jointly building the Belt and Road towards the Sustainable Development Goals. The project activities focused on training of policy-makers and technical staff to enhance their analytical capacities in designing coherent and integrated macroeconomic, social and environmental policies and promoting the achievement of the SDGs. Analytical and modelling tools, tailored to country needs, were used to facilitate the implementation of capacity development activities and strengthen the capacity of policy makers to integrate macroeconomic, environmental and social policies in national development strategies for achieving the goal of poverty eradication and other SDGs, under the broad context of implementing the 2030 Agenda.
Pilot countries: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Czech Republic, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Myanmar, Romania, Serbia, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

At his welcome speech, Namig Mammadov, FAPP Programme Manager, stated: “Today, we pay tribute to all rural women, including farmers and community leaders, from different socio-economic backgrounds who work to lead the gender transformations, strengthen women’s resilience and make efforts to establish more inclusive society. Women's leadership is particularly important in rural areas, where women mainly work in household business and agriculture, having less access to resources and services than men, including land, finance, training, inputs and equipment. We believe that economic empowerment of women in rural places will contribute to shape more equitable future and ensure sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.”
USAID Private Sector Activity (PSA) Chief of Party David Blood noted: “These joint activities demonstrate the significance of supporting women's priorities in the economy and advocating for a strengthened business enabling environment for women leaders and entrepreneurs in Azerbaijan's agricultural sector. Our goal is to expand women’s economic empowerment through an increased role for women in Azerbaijani agribusiness entrepreneurship.”
Round-table discussions were organized on the topic “Women in Development” to explore the effects and opportunities of development programmes and projects on strengthening rural women's engagement and leadership to ensure that rural women's voices are heard.
Leyla Mammadova, ACDA Deputy Chairperson, emphasized the care and support provided by the government to women farmers: “Apart from subsidies and incentives to small and medium business owners, the Government of Azerbaijan provides various support tools and programs. At the same time, we collaborate with international organizations to encourage women to engage in entrepreneurship and realize their business ideas. We want to see economically strong women who are able to have their say in society. By benefiting from these projects, women will expand their businesses, and encourage other rural women in communities and even in other regions to start their entrepreneurial activities.”
Women entrepreneurs engaged in agri-food sector presented their products at the fair that was organized within the event as well as had a chance to exchange their experiences with each other.
Within the event, FAPP’s “Women Empowerment Project” awarded 9 women’s groups from Balakan, Zaqatala, Gakh, Shamakhi, İsmayilli and Shaki with computers, printers and modems, which will contribute to improve rural women’s computer literacy, access to information and digital marketing skills as well as help them to strengthen the independence of their businesses and increase their profits.

10 October 2021
On World Mental Health Day this year it has been more than 18 months since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some countries, life is returning to some semblance of normality; in others, rates of transmission and hospital admissions remain high, disrupting the lives of families and communities.
This year’s slogan for the day is “Mental health care for all: let’s make it a reality.” In this context, a virtual meeting of National Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) Technical Group was organized focusing on major impacts of the pandemic on people’s mental health.
In the meeting, the representatives of WHO Azerbaijan, Ministry of Health, TABIB, Mental Health Center and Social Services Agency participated and delivered speeches on the importance of mental health.
“We must invest in suicide prevention to avoid further loss of life, especially among young people. Stigma and prejudice are widespread and affect every aspect of mental health, including whether people seek and receive help. Improving mental health literacy is essential for eliminating stigma against mental illness,” Dr Elturan İsmayilov, Public Health Officer of WHO Azerbaijan stated in his opening speech.
Mental health is one of the most neglected areas of public health. Close to 1 billion people are living with a mental disorder, 3 million people die every year from the harmful use of alcohol and one person dies every 40 seconds by suicide.
During the World Health Assembly in May 2021, governments from around the world recognized the need to scale up quality mental health services at all levels and endorsed WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030, including the Plan’s updated implementation options and indicators for measuring progress.

Patients at long-term health care facilities, being a particularly vulnerable group, experience more difficulties due to increased risk of infection and additional restrictive measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As part of the European Union (EU) funded Solidarity for Health Initiative project, WHO Azerbaijan and WHO Health Emergency Programme’s South Caucasus Hub experts assessed Republican Psychiatric Hospital No. 1 of the Ministry of Health and Psycho-Neurological Social Service Facility No 1 under Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, the biggest mental health facilities of the country, for infection prevention control and COVID-19 case management.
The assessment aimed to understand areas where COVID-19 has impacted on daily living of patients, to identify areas to provide support for implementing infection prevention control measures, and identifying and managing individuals with COVID-19, and to support long-term care facilities to access other health services when needed.
The project plans to continue supporting long-term mental health care facilities in the context of COVID-19 by providing medical supplies needed to prevent the spread of infections within the facilities, such as hand hygiene stations, hand sanitizers, and informative posters.
Previous discussions with national counterparts also revealed an increased need for psychosocial support for the patients in long-term facilities during the pandemic. Starting from September 1, the EU-WHO project deployed 3 psychologists and 3 social workers for 6 months to the abovementioned facilities to boost their capacities to cope with the impact of the pandemic. The deployed specialists are providing mental health and psycho-social support capacity building for healthcare workers in these facilities.

During the reporting time, under the AVRR projects, 181 returnees received reintegration assistance while extensive reintegration counseling sessions were conducted by IOM Azerbaijan staff for 76 returnees.
Out of those 181 beneficiaries, IOM Azerbaijan provided monetary aid to 106 persons, and 75 persons received in-kind assistance, which ranged from assistance with temporary housing (9 persons), startup of small business (3 persons), purchasing of home appliances and furniture items (60 persons), to covering health-related and educational needs (2 persons and 1 person respectively).
The main focus of reintegration assistance provided by IOM Azerbaijan is on establishment of income-generating activities such as small-farming (sheep, cattle breeding), businesses in the service sector (taxi), trade, and small-scale production that will sustainably benefit the returnees and their families and will therefore support their reintegration into the Azerbaijani society.

Title: WHO handed over medical masks to the State Customs Committee
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
23 September 2021
The delivery is part of Germany's donation of 121 million masks to the World Health Organization for distribution to the countries affected by COVID-19. 926,000 medical masks were sent to Azerbaijan from these medical supplies.
In a statement made at the handover event, Dr. Hande Harmanci stated, “Ensuring the safety and well-being of the health care workers and humanitarians, as well as government partners and stakeholders involved in the COVID-19 response has been a high priority for WHO since the onset of the pandemic. This generous donation facilitated by Germany will help to expand the current public health and social measures and play a role in enhancing preparedness to address health emergencies. We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to the Government of Germany for partnering with WHO and Azerbaijan to prevent the spread of COVID-19”.
Chairman of the State Customs Committee, Colonel-General of the Customs Service Safar Mehdiyev thanked the German government and the World Health Organization for the support, noting that Azerbaijan has been in close collaboration with the World Health Organization since the beginning of the pandemic.
The chairman of the committee noted that in the first stage of the pandemic, under the leadership of President Ilham Aliyev, timely measures were taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the country. From the first days of the pandemic, all customs and border checkpoints in the country have started to operate in an intensified mode of operation, and now sanitary-preventive and disinfection measures are being continued in a special mode. He also noted that the Central Customs Hospital of the State Customs Committee has completely restructured its work in the fight against coronavirus and started accepting only coronavirus patients in June last year. The Central Customs Hospital, which currently operates as a pandemic hospital, has all the necessary conditions for the treatment of coronavirus and is staffed by professional healthcare workers.
The German Ambassador to Azerbaijan, Dr Wolfgang Manig, underlined the importance of multilateral cooperation in the fight against COVID-19. “Germany is deeply committed to ensuring fair, transparent and affordable access to vaccines, diagnostics and medical aids like masks. Germany does not tie this access to political conditions in contrast to bilateral pledges of some states. The German Federal Government wants to secure regional healthcare in the long term. With a view to making use of the experience that has been gained in the future, Germany is calling for the WHO to be strengthened”, the Ambassador said. The German government is supporting the global efforts to fight the pandemic to the tune of 2.2 billion euro, including the distribution of 100 million vaccine doses worldwide.
The face masks will be distributed among the national partners, including NGOs as part of COVID-19 response activities, to be used by the healthcare workers, as well as frontline workers involved in managing public services amid the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in the country.

Title: IOM Azerbaijan builds capacities to local lawyers to better assist victims of human trafficking and forced labour
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
07 September 2021
Training for Practical Lawyers on Trafficking in Persons is taking place from 7 to 10 September in Baku and is carried out by the IOM Azerbaijan under the project “Counter-Trafficking in Persons Activity” Project, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), in close cooperation with Legal Aid and Training Centre of Azerbaijani Bar Association.
A four-day training covers the subjects on trafficking in person, forced labor, and assistance to people at risk of trafficking and exploitation, as well as potential victims of trafficking.
Speaking at the launch of the training, Vladimir Gjorgjiev, the Chief of IOM Mission to Azerbaijan highlighted the importance of cooperation with the Azerbaijani Bar Association in capacity-building initiatives aimed at sensitizing lawyers to the human rights dimension of human trafficking and to increase their capacity to counter the crime and to protect victims.
"We hope this capacity-building training will contribute to the exchange of best practices and methodologies to combat the serious challenges posed by human trafficking in the country," says Vladimir Gjorgjiev.
The Chairman of Azerbaijani Bar Association Mr. Anar Baghirov stressed the importance of cooperation with the IOM for their organization and the successful implementation of joint projects. Noting that the training for lawyers is important for the protection of victims of human trafficking, Bagirov also said that changes are needed in the legislation.
“We are concerned about the fact that the law does not provide for legal assistance to victims of human trafficking at public expense. Given that most victims are people in need of free legal assistance, then we must work to resolve this issue," said Bagirov.
During the training, lawyers are provided training from Izabela Hartman, expert and trainer with extensive experience in law, both theory and practice, and in the training of lawyers on a relevant subject. The participants will have the opportunity to discuss and exchange experiences, approaches, and broaden their knowledge on trafficking, the challenges, the achievements, and protection of victims of trafficking, build a stronger partnership, improve prosecution and learn more about preventive measures in the area of human trafficking and forced labour.
The IOM Azerbaijan’s project “Counter-Trafficking in Persons (C-TIP) Activity” funded by USAID is supporting the Government of Azerbaijan with several other activities to further improve the country’s effectiveness in preventing and combating human trafficking and forced labour through raising public awareness on TIP and providing technical and financial support to the civil society organization operating shelters for assisting potential and actual victims of trafficking and forced labour.

Title: School Reopening: WHO and UNICEF call for schools to remain open with safer measures
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 September 2021
As children prepare to return to school with the start of the new academic year, the adoption of measures to minimize transmission becomes more vital than ever.
As WHO and UNICEF state, these measures include ensuring vaccination is accessible to teachers and other school staff, improvements to the school environments to meet safety standards such as better classroom ventilation, smaller class size, physical distancing, regular testing of staff and constant sharing of information for parents on safety precautions.
Vaccination is one of the best and fastest ways of protection against the virus, including the Delta variant. Vaccination of teachers and other school staff is the advantage we have this year that will make the school safer.
“We live with COVID-19 pandemic almost two years and safely reopening schools has become an urgent priority. The long-term costs of closures are too high and hard to justify. We all need to work toward reopening schools safely to protect our children’s future.  WHO urges countries, including Azerbaijan to keep school open while putting in place measures to minimize the risk of COVID-19 and the spread of different variants. We are supporting our national partners in the implementation of national vaccination strategy which plays a vital role in the school re-opening,” – Dr. Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative to Azerbaijan stated.
“The pandemic has not only showed the devastating consequences school closures have on children but also proved the important role schools play in children`s education, mental health and social skills. Children and youth cannot risk having another year of disrupted learning. UNICEF is working closely with Ministry of Education of the Republic of Azerbaijan to ensure schools are opened safely on September 15 and children do not miss the opportunities school offers to them” Alex Heikens, UNICEF Representative in Azerbaijan, said.
UNICEF Azerbaijan currently partners the Ministry of Education to provide targeted learning recovery support to children in ten selected districts of Azerbaijan. Programme aims to provide additional teaching support for children and mentorship support to teachers to catch up with the new academic year. Mental health and psychosocial support to children and teachers will be one of the continuous priorities for both UNICEF and WHO.
UNICEF and WHO in Azerbaijan will jointly support the Ministry of Education, national health agencies for a joint #Back2School campaign with all necessary information suggested to parents, teachers and students for a safe back to schools of all Azerbaijani children.

During the visit held between 16th and 21st August, participants had a number of meetings in organizations specialized on potato production and gained new knowledge and skill. The main purpose of the study tour was to learn about various new technologies and innovations used in potato cultivation in Turkey in order to apply them in Azerbaijan within the project.
On first day of the tour, participants visited Potato Research Institute, located in Niğde province, where they get acquainted with Institute’s infrastructure, new administration building, laboratories, greenhouses and sown areas. At the meeting with participants, Director of the Institute Mr. Ugur Pirlak and heads of Institute’s Board, made a presentation on Institute’s general activities, its structure, research works and its activities in the region. The delegation got acquainted with Institute’s laboratories specialised in Tissue Culture, Genetics and Breeding, Potato Diseases and Technological Testing. An extensive work is being done here to create potato varieties resistant to various soil and climatic conditions, diseases and pests. Future cooperation between the Vegetable Research Institute under the Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Agriculture and Turkey’s Potato Research Institute in potato variety selection were discussed. The delegation expressed a special interest to the production of virus-free potato mini-tubers in the aeroponic growing system. The Vegetable Research Institute  discussed opportunities of applying new technologies in its practice, with a special focus on potato variety  selection for processing purpose and their future production in large areas in our country.
The delegation visited the huge underground cold storages – natural storage facilities in Nigde and Nevsehir provinces, which were used as warehouses for potatoes. The unique feature of these underground cold storages is that cold air is supplied completely from outside at cooler night times, without the use of any refrigeration equipment, and kept during warmer day due to the natural insulation of the rock walls.
During the study tour, the delegation also took part in Turkey’s largest fair on potato production, so called Potato Days Festival in Konya. The main feature of the exhibition, held with participation of major Turkish potato companies, was product presentation next to  demonstration plots where potatos were planted and produced.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
13 August 2021
Co-funded and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme with the Icheherisher Administration, over the past three years, this project has helped increase access to inclusive vocational programmes for over 100 young people of all abilities.
With the support of the project, Azerbaijan’s first Inclusive Vocational Arts and Crafts Training Centre has been established and is currently located in the Baku State Vocational Education Centre on Culture and Arts in Buzovna.
A total of 112 students with and without disabilities benefited from the inclusive educational programme; 20 students with disabilities submitted their self-employment projects for in-kind grants; 50 video lessons have been produced and shared on YouTube and are available to all citizens, 4 curricula and 11 teaching modules in traditional arts were developed and successfully piloted.
The project also helped improve accessibility to the Centre by constructing an outdoor elevator at the entrance of the building. New equipment, materials and supplies were purchased and two rooms were completely refurbished into vocational workshops.
Furthermore, a tailored capacity-building programme on inclusive education has been organized for arts teachers, special services providers, special educators-interns, teachers and psychologists, managers and deputy-managers of vocational schools – to ensure that they are better prepared to work with youth with disabilities.
The State Agency on Vocational Education is committed to replicating such inclusive education programmes and further promote the integration of inclusive education in vocational education settings throughout the country. Additional capacity-building programmes for specialists working in this area are foreseen in the near future to build on this project’s achievements and ensure sustainable support to students with disabilities.

Such assistance is intended to ensure sustainability of returns, i.e. to help individuals who return voluntarily to their countries of origin in firmly re-establishing themselves as part of the home society. IOM Azerbaijan has been implementing reintegration assistance activities for the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Poland, Finland, Turkey, and Latvia.
In the first half of 2021, under the AVRR projects 397 returnees received reintegration assistance while extensive reintegration counseling sessions were conducted by IOM Azerbaijan staff for 207 returnees.
Out of those 397 beneficiaries, IOM Azerbaijan provided monetary aid to 192 persons, and 205 persons received in-kind assistance, which ranged from assistance with temporary housing (34 persons), startup of small business (51 persons), purchasing of home appliances and furniture items (113 persons), to covering health-related and educational needs (6 persons and 1 person respectively).
The main focus of reintegration assistance provided by IOM Azerbaijan is on establishment of income-generating activities such as small-farming (sheep, cattle breeding), businesses in the service sector (taxi), trade, and small-scale production that will sustainably benefit the returnees and their families and will therefore support their reintegration into the Azerbaijani society.

This year the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons coincides with the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour. In this context, IOM Azerbaijan organized a sensitization event focusing on trafficking as a form of violence against children and put into light the potential of children and their right to an open future.
The sensitization activity was conducted with potential child victims of sexual exploitation, forced labour, and forced begging assisted by two shelters in Baku managed by the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) Clean World – Aid to Woman Public Union and Azerbaijan Children Union.
In coordination with the NGOs, IOM organized an art workshop in each shelter on “Children’s Potential”. Shelter’s personnel and IOM team explained to girls and boys what children’s rights are and discussed with them on their future and potential. Children were asked to paint where they see themselves in the future and draw their expectations and wishes.
On 30 July 2021, the paintings and handicrafts, made by the children from the shelter of Azerbaijan Children Union, reflecting the national attributes of Azerbaijan were exposed at the exhibition titled "The Second Breath" dedicated to the World Day Against Trafficking.
The exhibition organized by the Azerbaijan Children Public Union and supported by IOM Azerbaijan, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Lu-Moon Hoolding, "ASAN Volunteers" and Khatai Art Center, aimed to draw the public attention to the exploitation of child labour and violence against children as a form of trafficking and highlights the importance of combating trafficking.

Title: The 1951 Refugee Convention: 70 Years of Life-Saving Protection for People Forced to Flee
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
28 July 2021
“The Convention continues to protect the rights of refugees across the world,” said Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
“Thanks to the Convention, millions of lives have been saved. Seventy years since it was drawn up, it is crucial that the international community defends its principles.”
He expressed alarm at recent attempts by some governments to disregard or circumvent the Convention’s principles, from expulsions and pushbacks of refugees and asylum seekers at land and sea borders, to the proposals to forcibly transfer them to third states for processing without proper protection safeguards.
Speaking 70 years to the day that the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was presented to states for signing, Grandi said the treaty was a crucial component of international human rights law and remained as relevant now as it was when it was drafted and agreed.
“The language of the Convention is clear as to the rights of refugees and remains applicable in the context of contemporary and unprecedented challenges and emergencies – such as the COVID-19 pandemic,” Grandi said.
Both the 1951 Refugee Convention and the more recent Global Compact on Refugees call for international cooperation to find a range of solutions for refugees.
Grandi stressed the need for the international community to uphold the key principles of refugee protection as laid out in the Convention, including the right of someone fleeing persecution not to be sent back into the path of harm or danger.
The 70th anniversary of the Refugee Convention comes only a few months after UNHCR itself marked seven decades as the world’s mandated organisation for the protection of the forcibly displaced.

“The conflict increased the burden on the already strained health system in the area. Access to essential health services is a major challenge in the conflict-affected regions, especially in remote villages. We believe this project made a difference in people’s lives by providing these services free of charge to the people who are unable to access them and also by shining a light on the importance of this issue. We are now actively searching for partnerships to be able to continue our work here”, – Dr. Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative to Azerbaijan stated in the closing ceremony.

Strengthening the knowledge and skills of healthcare workers on infection prevention and control (IPC), one of the most important tools in the fight against the hospital-acquired infections, including COVID-19, is one of the major directions of such capacity building trainings provided by the WHO Country Office.
Based on the findings of the previous IPC assessment missions at healthcare facilities and discussions with TABIB, WHO Azerbaijan provided training to IPC committees from 29 healthcare facilities located in 13 city and districts of Azerbaijan. Overall, 56 hospital IPC committee members were trained over multiple sessions organized in partnership with TABIB's Department of Infectious Diseases Analysis and Management. The training was conducted by the expert of the WHO Health Emergency Programme’s South Caucasus Hub and focused on organizing the work of the committees utilizing WHO's core components for IPC, including on how to conduct monitoring and evaluation of IPC measures independently and in a sustainable manner. At the training, the committees have also been equipped with all necessary tools to build hand hygiene improvement strategies which proved to greatly improve patient outcomes.
EU-WHO project aims to continue capacity building support to increase the effectiveness of IPC committees in healthcare facilities in Azerbaijan. The training of these committees will not only improve infection control for COVID-19 and infectious diseases but also have an impact on reduction of antimicrobial resistance and hospital acquired infections.

Title: Next 18 months seen as pivotal in global efforts to reverse punishing pandemic impacts and boost actions to achieve key goals
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
06 July 2021
More countries and communities are recognizing the need to bolster efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in light of the toll the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on people around the world according to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2021, released by the United Nations today.
The decisions and actions taken during the next 18 months will determine whether pandemic recovery plans will put the world on a course to reach the globally agreed-upon goals that aim to boost economic growth and social well-being while protecting the environment.
According to the report, which tracks global efforts to achieve the SDGs, COVID-19 has caused a major disruption to people’s lives and livelihoods. While progress to achieve the SDGs had been slow even before the pandemic struck, an additional 119-124 million people were pushed back into poverty in 2020. An equivalent of 255 million full-time jobs were lost, and the number of people suffering from hunger, which was already climbing before the pandemic, may have increased by 83-132 million.
The pandemic has exposed and intensified inequalities within and among countries. As of 17 June 2021, around 68 vaccines were administered for every 100 people in Europe and Northern America compared with fewer than 2 in sub-Saharan Africa. Up to 10 million more girls will be at risk of child marriage as a result of the pandemic over the next decade. The collapse of international tourism disproportionally affects Small Island Developing States.
The economic slowdown in 2020 had done little to slow the climate crisis. Concentrations of major greenhouse gases continued to increase, while the global average temperature was about 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels, dangerously close to the 1.5°C limit established in the Paris Agreement.
Global flows of foreign direct investment fell by 40% in 2020 compared to 2019. The pandemic has brought immense financial challenges, especially for developing countries – with a significant rise in debt distress.
The 2030 Agenda, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Goals, to improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.
According to the Report, to get the SDGs back on track, governments, cities, business and industries have to use the recovery to adopt low-carbon, resilient and inclusive development pathways that will reduce carbon emissions, conserve natural resources, create better jobs, advance gender equality and tackle growing inequities.
“We are at a critical juncture in human history. The decisions and actions we take today will have momentous consequences for future generations,” said Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General of the | United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. “Lessons learned from the pandemic will help us rise to current and future challenges. Let us seize the moment together to make this a decade of action, transformation and restoration to achieve the SDGs and make good on the Paris Climate Agreement.”
Efforts to confront the pandemic have also shown immense community resilience, decisive action from governments, a rapid expansion of social protection, an acceleration of digital transformation; and a unique collaboration to develop life-saving vaccines and treatments in record time. According to the Report, these are solid foundations to build on to accelerate progress on the SDGs.
Some additional key facts and figures:
According to the Report, the recovery effort will also depend on the availability of data to inform policy making. Ensuring sufficient funding is available for data collection, both through the mobilization of international and domestic resources, will be critical to these efforts.

The project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), British Embassy in Baku, and Universal Health Coverage Partnership initiative (a joint initiative of WHO and its partners) aims to develop a high quality, accessible and comprehensive primary healthcare model tailored for the needs in Azerbaijan. It will also support local communities to live healthier lives and empower them to care for their own health. WHO Azerbaijan partners with the Executive Power of Shamakhi District, Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan, State Agency for Mandatory health Insurance, TABIB, Heydar Aliyev Foundation, and UNICEF for implementation of the project.
 
Tahir Mammadov, Head of Shamakhi District Executive Power noted in the handover event in Damirchi village of Shamakhi district that, as in all of the regions of Azerbaijan, a lot of work has been done in the healthcare sector in Shamakhi as part of the health reforms carried out in the country. He stressed that, along with already done work, this project will help to improve the quality of the primary healthcare services provided to the population in Shamakhi, particularly those living in remote villages.
According to Lee Litzenberger, United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan, “the United States is committed to the continued support to Azerbaijan as we all face a trying time in history. Only by working hand in hand can we defeat COVID-19”.
 
James Sharp, British Ambassador to Azerbaijan noted “The UK is committed to supporting the healthcare sector in Azerbaijan and I am sure these mobile clinics will make a significant difference to those living in rural areas where access to healthcare is most difficult.” According to him, “Not only will the mobile clinics strengthen primary healthcare to better respond to COVID 19 but also ensure the delivery of other essential health services, including neonatal, maternal and childcare in rural areas.”
 
Dr. Rahim Aliyev, Deputy Minister of Health of Azerbaijan, emphasizing the importance of international cooperation, information exchange and international assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, noted that the development of primary health care would both help the state to better cope with non-infectious chronic diseases and infectious diseases, and help to improve population’s health.
The chairman of TABIB, Dr. Ramin Bayramlı said that according to the experience during the pandemic, countries with strong primary health care systems had more successfully managed the COVID-19 pandemic. According to him, the project is very important from this point of view and its goals overlap with the goals of the healthcare reforms being conducted in Azerbaijan.
Mr. Soltan Mammadov, Member of the Health Committee at the Parliament of Azerbaijan, and Director of International Relations Department at the Heydar Aliyev Foundation emphasized the necessity of having efficient primary healthcare service for a strong healthcare system and noted that the Foundation is ready for continues support to the “PROACT-Care” project.
Dr. Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative in Azerbaijan highlighted that the PROACT-Care project is a product of comprehensive teamwork between WHO and its national and international partners and donors. According to her, mobile clinics delivered as part of the project will not only serve to scale up primary healthcare capacity – a key component of every sustainable healthcare system, but also be helpful in COVID-19 response in the Shamakhi district. 
 
After the handover event, the participants inaugurated WHO’s training center in Shamakhi where they were informed about other ongoing and planned activities within the PROACT-Care project. It was noted that the primary healthcare model implemented in the Shamakhi district is envisioned to be scaled up to the entire country in the future.

The assessment of COVID-19 vaccination sites was conducted to ensure that vaccination is carried out safely without an additional risk of COVID 19 or other infections to patients. The assessment at the primary healthcare centers will inform the creation of national primary healthcare guidance as requested by key national partners. Many posters on hand hygiene were distributed during the assessments, and up-to-date recommendations on hand hygiene were shared with the health care facility staff and managers.
Open-air training sessions were held on the principles of infection prevention and control for 25 primary healthcare professionals and vaccinators. The physically distanced training sessions included principles of infection control and hand hygiene, injection safety for vaccination and COVID-19 safety for communities.
In addition to the above activities, Hygiene and Epidemiology Centers in Barda, Tartar, and Agdam were assessed for capabilities to perform surveillance, case investigations and contact tracing. Vaccine storages at the facilities were checked to ensure adequate temperature control and safe storage of supply.
These activities will contribute to the improvement of the infection prevention and control system and surveillance in Azerbaijan, that will last much beyond the current emergency.

Title: UNHCR commends Azerbaijan’s continued support to refugees and Asylum Seekers on the World Refugee Day

18 June 2021
While many refugee emergencies are unfortunately becoming protracted, such as that of the Rohingya from Myanmar, new emergencies continue occurring, such as one in Tigray region of Ethiopia, which has displaced hundreds of thousands within Ethiopia and across the border in Sudan.
The global fight against the COVID19 pandemic and its consequences, has shown that we can only succeed if we stand together and this year’s World Refugee Day campaign calls for greater inclusion of refugees in host societies, with particular reference to health, education systems and sports with the key messages of “heal”, “learn” and “shine”.
Azerbaijan hosts 1,616 refugees in total originating mainly from Afghanistan and other countries in central Asia, the Middle East and eastern Europe.  On the World Refugee Day, UNHCR Azerbaijan commends the authorities and people of Azerbaijan for granting access to healthcare and employment rights to refugees and asylum seekers living in the country. As we continue working and collaborating to achieve integration and inclusion of refugees, we also sincerely express our gratitude to the Government of Azerbaijan for the successful legal amendment on employment of refugees and access to healthcare insurance.
With growing forced displacement world-wide, it is important more than ever that refugees and asylum seekers receive our solidarity, compassion and support. They want nothing more than protection and the opportunity to make a decent living away from home to support themselves, their families and be part of their host communities. In that regard, UNHCR continues advocating for securing legal status for refugees and asylum seekers living in Azerbaijan, as well as ensuring durable solutions prospects in the form of voluntary return in safety and dignity for Internally Displaced Persons.
“Some of the refugees were born or arrived as small children in Azerbaijan and have a lot of potential to contribute to the development of Azerbaijani society if they are given the opportunity to integrate and therefore to secure a durable solution,” said Guido Ambroso, UNHCR Representative to Azerbaijan. “While progress has been made, more needs to be done to ensure legal status. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the people of Azerbaijan as, after nearly three decades, hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons finally have the possibility to achieve a durable solution by returning to their lands.
World Refugee Day is the day to celebrate refugees’ contributions to communities, their unique experience, resilience and bravery in overcoming the toughest hardships the wars and conflicts can bring.

Mikayil Jabbarov, Minister of Economy, and Ghulam Isaczai, UN Resident Coordinator in Azerbaijan, have co-chaired the meeting, which brought together some 25 high-level officials from the Government and UNCT.
The Steering Committee has endorsed the joint work plans for 2021 and reviewed the funding framework for UNSDCF. The meeting participants also discussed challenges and opportunities to ensure the timely implementation of the framework.
“The joint work plans have been designed in the spirit of UNSDCF and reflect three main changes from the past: more focus on delivering as One UN, leaving no one behind, and supporting Azerbaijan’s efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,” Mr Isaczai said.
The UNSDCF is the fifth UN-Azerbaijan cooperation framework for a period from 2021 to 2025. It identifies four priority areas for partnership: inclusive growth that reduces vulnerability and builds resilience; stronger institutions for better public and social services delivery; protecting the environment and addressing climate change; and achieving a gender-equitable society that empowers women and girls.

14 June 2021
With the continued support of the U.S. Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM), who remains the largest donor to UNHCR programmes in Azerbaijan, the organization has been able to deliver vital emergency humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, as well as to refugees and asylum-seekers residing in Azerbaijan whose livelihoods were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The United States’ commitment to providing flexible funding has been critical as it gives UNHCR essential flexibility to determine how best to protect and assist those displaced people who are in greatest need or at greatest risk.
“The United States is not only a consistent and trusted partner, but also a compassionate and flexible donor which does not hesitate to provide additional emergency funds to support vulnerable refugees, IDPs and stateless persons at times of critical needs,” said Guido Ambroso, UNHCR Representative to Azerbaijan.
As the COVID-19 pandemic and Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have combined to exacerbate existing risks and cause new displacement within Azerbaijan, we remain grateful for the long-standing support of the United States, which allows UNHCR to continue to provide protection, legal support, and pursue durable solutions for refugees, IDPs and stateless persons throughout the country.

The 2021 Summit will bring together diverse range of stakeholders - before, during and after the Summit – to identify ways to make food systems stronger and more equitable and to bring tangible and positive changes to the world’s food systems (and ultimately driving progress in all of the SDGs)
The first national dialogue meeting in Azerbaijan brought together various stakeholders to discuss the country's food systems, food security and agricultural development prospects. "By strengthening food systems, we can achieve not only food security but also sustainable food supply systems, healthy food and a sustainable development agenda," said Melek Cakmak, the Represenatative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Azerbaijan.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Ilhama Gadimova said: “Today, the government works closely with international organizations, especially the FAO, to ensure food security and sustainable agriculture for sustainable development goals. It is useful and effective, ”she said.
The event continued with questions from the participants and general discussions.
Another important aspect of the national dialogue was to apply different approaches to food systems, to ensure the participation of parties from different areas in the dialogue, to formulate strategies that identify development prospects in line with today's challenges and to identify some specific steps for multilateral and sustainable food systems.

20 May 2021
This Inclusive Centre has been established by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Icherisheher Administration as part of a European Union co-funded project aiming to promote inclusive education in Azerbaijan.
The main objective of the three-year project titled ‘Promotion of Inclusive Education through Traditional Arts’ was to help increase access to inclusive vocational programmes tailored to the needs of children and youth with disabilities.
As a result of the project, 112 students with and without disabilities benefited from the inclusive educational programme; 20 students with disabilities submitted their self-employment projects for in-kind grants; 50 video lessons have been produced and shared on YouTube and are available to all citizens, 4 curricula and 11 teaching modules in traditional arts were developed and successfully piloted.
Furthermore, a tailored capacity building programme on inclusive education has been organized for arts teachers, special services providers, special educators-interns, teachers and psychologists, managers and deputy-managers of vocational schools – to ensure that they are better prepared to work with youth with disabilities.
The project also helped improve accessibility to the Centre by constructing an outdoor elevator at the entrance of the building. New equipment, materials and supplies were purchased and two rooms were completely refurbished into vocational workshops.
The project also conducted a series of master classes on souvenir production and piloted a new inclusive course on stained glass souvenirs production.
With this smooth transition, SAVE is committed to replicating inclusive education programmes and further promote the integration of inclusive education in vocational education settings. Additional capacity building programmes for specialists working in this area are foreseen in the near future to build on this project’s achievements and ensure sustainable support to students with disabilities.

Title: Potential brewing for Azerbaijani and Georgian tea industries
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 May 2021
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) hosted the roundtable event to highlight the countries’ potential to produce high quality and specialty teas. They also shared findings from their joint tea sector reviews, including options for developing the industries sustainably.
In his opening remarks, Vladimir Rakhmanin, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Europe and Central Asia, pointed to the cultural significance of tea in the Caucasus and the strong legacy of tea production in Georgia and Azerbaijan.
“Tea production has a storied past in both countries, dating back over a century. Preserving this heritage and popularising the unique characteristics of these teas, both domestically and abroad, are as equally important as efforts to improve quality along the supply chain,” he said.
On hand, too, was Wojtek Boniaszczuk, EBRD Regional Head for Central and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Turkey, Agribusiness, who noted that “while the international competitive environment for tea is not easy, with the right investments in knowledge and technology at both the farm and processing levels, Azerbaijani and Georgian teas could become recognized symbols of quality and sustainability.”
The virtual event drew over 100 people, including representatives from government agencies, research institutions, financial institutions and private sector companies as well as Azerbaijani and Georgian tea producers.
Reviving once thriving industries
Azerbaijan and Georgia are part of the world’s northernmost tea-producing region. Both supplied a large share of tea consumed in the former Soviet Union in the 1980s, making the Soviet Union the fourth largest tea producer in the world at the time, after India, China and Sri Lanka.
But the upheaval of the post-Soviet Union era led to a dramatic decline in the two countries’ tea industries. Today, with a total combined production of around 3 000 tonnes, they account for just under 0.05 percent of global tea production.
Interest in Georgian and Azerbaijani teas is picking up, however, with the governments, farmers and the private sector taking decisive steps in recent years to revive their once thriving tea sectors.
For example, Azerbaijan approved a development programme in 2018 that would increase tea production to 3 000 hectares with an annual output of 8 500 tonnes by 2027 – more than eight times what they produced in 2018.
And in Georgia, the government adopted a programme in 2016 to rehabilitate up to 7 000 hectares of abandoned tea plantations over the coming years.
Unique characteristics
Demand for specialty tea, both domestically and internationally, is on the rise.
Azerbaijanis are already avid tea drinkers, consuming over 2 kilograms of tea per capita, ranking them alongside the United Kingdom, Turkey and Morocco as some of the top tea-drinking countries.
Azerbaijani and Georgian teas boast unique characteristics thanks to their northerly origins and specific growing conditions along the Caspian and Black Sea coasts. The teas have a bright colour, for example, and can be produced with almost zero chemicals.
This could create interesting opportunities for organic production in both countries, potentially giving their teas an edge in the export tea market, catering to consumers concerned with health and environmental considerations.
FAO Investment Centre Service Chief, Wafaa Elkhouri said that “a sustainable and forward-looking approach is key to the successful development of Azerbaijan and Georgia’s tea sectors, taking into consideration potential risks, including those posed by climate change.”
In fact, rising temperatures and more irregular precipitation patterns could introduce new pests, posing a threat to the currently limited use of pesticides and putting further pressure on the two countries’ water resources.
But as the recently published FAO-EBRD publication shows,  the potential is there for producers of Georgian and Azerbaijani teas to build on the positive image their teas enjoy at home and in neighbouring countries and, with the right support, carve out a wider space in the international market.

They got acquainted with the renovation work carried out with the use of new technologies and got the opportunity to gain practical knowledge in the field of Kakhriz engineering.
According to the head of the ASAU department, professor Mirnaib Mirsalakhov, this visit gave the teachers and students of the university the opportunity to see with their own eyes the work of the new Horizontal and Vertical drilling technologies used in the restoration of kahrizes.
The main aim of the kahriz engineering course which is based on the curriculum prepared by ASAU teaching staff jointly with the IOM Azerbaijan is to revive and transfer the historical knowledge of the kahriz engineering profession to the next generation of local engineers that will further develop new renovation models based on the new available technology. The subject is taught by ASAU faculty members who participated in training courses on kahriz engineering and study visits to kahrizes located in Nakchivan to improve their knowledge and learn best practices of kahriz construction and maintenance organized by IOM Azerbaijan. These capacity-building activities were supported by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) as part of the project “Integrated Rural Development for IDP Communities in Azerbaijan through Revitalization of Kahriz Water Supply System.”
In the scope of collaboration between IOM Azerbaijan and ASAU the Kahriz Research and Information Center for collecting, researching, and disseminating the information, knowledge, and experiences on kahriz systems has been opened at the university.
The project also focuses on improving the water supply in rural areas of Aghdam, Aghjabedi, Barda, Fuzuli, Ganja, Gazakh, Goranboy, and Goygol districts through the renovation of over 40 kahrizes – a man-made, centuries-old, traditional water-supply system that does not need electricity or fossil fuel to function. This water supply method ensures the protection of biodiversity and contributes to local communities’ quality of life. In addition to renovating the kahrizes, the project has components that involve capacity building, business development, and a strong engagement with academia.

05 May 2021
There is no life without water! In a world affected by double crisis of rapid climate change and deterioration of the natural resources and ecosystems, leading to natural disasters such as drought and severe water scarcity, effective governance of available water resources is key to achieving water security and accordingly food security.
The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and aims to increase resilience in water sources governance.
At the opening ceremony of the event, Melek Cakmak, Head of the FAO Partnership and Coordination Office in Azerbaijan: "The activities under this project, including assistance for development, revision and implementation of norms/policies/and incentives are to eventually pave the ground to a change in the behaviour. In other words, sustainable impacts can be achieved through behavioural changes, and in this project, we will work closely with the Azerbaijan government to promote a sustainable water governance mechanism and behavioral change.
Development of an effective governance system for national water resources requires a multi-level perspective and recognizing the importance of interlinkages between macro, meso and micro levels to analyze the system. This principle will be followed throughout this project in support of the Government of Azerbaijan in formulating a comprehensive water governance strategy.” said in her speech.
Later at the event, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Azerbaijan Sarvan Jafarov said, Due to the global climate change observed in recent years, the reduction of surface water resources and precipitation from neighboring countries, the country's low freshwater resources and increasing demand for water make it crucial to take urgent measures to ensure water security. Only 30 percent of the annual water balance in Azerbaijan is formed in the country and 70 percent of the water originates in other countries and noted that the project will contribute to water management in the country.
Speaking at the event, Mr. Seymur Movlayev, Chairman of the Agrarian Credit and Development Agency, stressed the special role of the project, importance of proper water resources governance and strategic planning, and said that "Without water, agriculture cannot be successful."
In the insemination workshop, all stakeholders, including ministries, national and international organizations, came together to discuss the goals and future activities, and the event continued in the form of a panel discussion. The discussions will allow the developing water use strategy to be more comprehensive.

Title: Validation of non-formal and informal learning is creating new opportunities for workers in Azerbaijan’s informal sector with the financial support of the EU
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 May 2021
‘I’ve been working as a plasterer for thirteen years now and it’s never been so tough as now,’ says 34-year-old Zeynal Zeynalov. ‘What’s made it worse is that there’s always been a kind of free-for-all in this sector, so you’re competing for jobs and fees with people who have no training or experience.’
Zeynal is one of some twenty percent of the population who currently work in the informal sector in Azerbaijan.
Supporting the sustainable development of this sector is key not only to all these livelihoods but also to the country’s aim of diversifying its economy.
This is why UNDP has been working closely in recent years with the EU and the Government of Azerbaijan to modernise vocational education and training (VET) and thus encourage more people to gain additional skills.
An important aspect of modernising VET and reducing the precarity of working in the informal sector is to ensure equal opportunities for training and to develop a robust system of certification for skills.
As part of these efforts, and in line with its wider commitment to supporting VET and economic diversification, EU and UNDP have been working with Azerbaijan’s State Agency on Vocational Education and the Education Quality Assurance Agency (EQAA).
The outcome of this collaboration is the country’s first-ever validation process for certifying competences acquired through non-formal and informal learning.
Zeynal is one of 16 candidates to benefit from this new validation scheme, having applied to take part in the first official examination for a certificate in drywall plastering at the Ganja State Vocational Education School on Industry and Technologies.
All of the candidates underwent a self-assessment process, a written test, and a practical task.
The examination committee that assessed Zeynal’s skills included representatives from the EQAA, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population, an international expert specialized in validation processes of non-formal and informal learning, and two local field experts.
In addition, the assessment committee included representatives from Knauf Marketing Baku – a German company with outstanding expertise in construction and construction materials.
The candidates who successfully passed all the tests received official certificates from the Education Quality Assurance Agency.
‘It’s hard to describe how important this piece of paper is for me,’ says Zeynal. ‘I’ve been hoping for something like this for years. With this certificate I can prove my skills and charge the right price for my work. It makes me stand out from the rest when competing for jobs – and that’s only fair if you’ve put all the effort into learning your trade. I’m pretty sure it will be easier for me to get more regular work now.’
This new validation process is part of a bigger project to modernise Azerbaijan’s vocational education and training system, entitled ‘Support for the establishment of Regional Industrial Vocational Education and Training Competence Centre in Ganja’.
Funded by the EU and implemented by UNDP and the State Agency on Vocational Education, this project has already organised expert training programmes bringing together VET experts, private sector representatives and field consultants to conduct the validation process.
The Education Quality Assurance Agency will now continue to assess, recognise and certify this process for several specialties, thus ensuring sustainability.
The new validation framework is a great step forward in modernising VET, reducing inequalities in employment, and creating equal educational opportunities for all citizens in Azerbaijan.

Title: Join WHO’s #DoItAll Campaign
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
27 April 2021
Some of the reasons for the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases appears to be due to the relaxing of public health measures, the continued circulation of variants, and people letting down their guards. Basic public health measures remain the foundation of the response.
For public health authorities, that means testing, contact tracing, isolation, supported quarantine and quality care. For individuals, avoiding crowds, physical distancing, hand hygiene, masks and ventilation remain essential.  We need to drive the transmission down rather than expect it to continue on a downward trend on its own.
To do this, it is important that we maintain the preventive behaviours that we know are effective against COVID-19 and against the current variants, such as hand washing, mask-wearing and safe physical distance.
We are at the start of a global rollout of not one but several vaccines which brings us an enormous step closer to ending this current phase of the pandemic. As vaccines coverage increases, they will be able to help us reduce disease and deaths and maintain essential health services. However, to keep transmission rates down and reduce the opportunities for the virus to change, we must #DoItAll. Being vaccinated doesn't mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at risk.
WHO/Europe #DoItAll campaign is urging everyone to continue ALL the protective behaviours that we know are working at an individual level. This includes:

Title: IOM ensures historical profession of kankans will pass to the next generations
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
22 April 2021
The course which is based on the curriculum prepared by ASAU teaching staff jointly with the IOM Azerbaijan is the next step in reviving and transferring the historical knowledge of the kahriz engineering profession to the next generation of local engineers that will further develop new renovation models based on the new available technology. The subject is taught by ASAU faculty members who participated in training courses on kahriz engineering and study visits to kahrizes located in Nakhchivan to improve their knowledge and learn best practices of kahriz construction and maintenance organized by IOM Azerbaijan. These capacity-building activities were supported by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) as part of the project “Integrated Rural Development for IDP Communities in Azerbaijan through Revitalization of Kahriz Water Supply System.”
In the scope of collaboration between IOM Azerbaijan and ASAU the Kahriz Research and Information Center for collecting, researching and disseminating the information, knowledge and experiences on kahriz systems has been opened at the university.
The project also focuses on improving the water supply in rural areas of Aghdam, Aghjabedi, Barda, Fuzuli, Ganja, Gazakh, Goranboy and Goygol districts through the renovation of over 40 kahrizes – a man-made, centuries-old, traditional water-supply system that does not need electricity or fossil fuel to function. This water-supply method ensures the protection of biodiversity and contributes to local communities’ quality of life. In addition to the renovating the kahrizes, the project has components that involve capacity building, business development and a strong engagement with academia.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
22 April 2021
Located in Fuzuli-Horadiz, Aghjabadi and Tartar, the hubs will provide support to the most vulnerable groups and recovery assistance to the communities.
The Chairperson of the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs, Bahar Muradova, said the new hubs “will help identify the most urgent needs of the war-affected communities and provide socio-economic rehabilitation support to the affected citizens. The services offered by the hubs will include support for people to recover their livelihoods and psychosocial and business counselling. The hubs will especially focus on the needs of women, families and people with disabilities”.
Officially launching the new Community Resource Hubs, UNDP’s Resident Representative in Azerbaijan, Alessandro Fracassetti, highlighted the inclusive process of the project design:
“By listening to the concerns and challenges of the communities, we have helped to identify a number of potential services that can immediately be provided through the hubs. Ultimately we would love to see this network of hubs expanded across different regions and transformed into a large-scale programme that will serve as many people as possible.”
The new hubs are the latest outcome of UNDP’s work with the Government of Azerbaijan to provide support for conflict-affected areas in line with the Government’s priorities for medium and long-term recovery.
The hubs build on the successful model of the Women Resource Centres implemented by UNDP and the State Committee in nine regions since 2011. The main mission of these Centres is to help strengthen rural women’s entrepreneurial skills and advance their competitiveness in the labour market, empowering them to overcome the many socio-economic challenges faced by women living in rural areas.
The initiative is part of the larger UNDP-funded programme ‘Early Recovery and Community Resilience for the Most Vulnerable in the Fuzuli-Horadiz, Aghjabadi and Tartar regions of Azerbaijan’.
Over the upcoming period, this programme will focus on supporting local development through a series of measures, including enterprise development, vocational training, green jobs and quick impact projects designed to help rehabilitate key local infrastructure based on community priorities.

Title: New effort strengthens regional collaboration against wheat rust diseases
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
16 April 2021
Wheat is the most widely grown crop in the world and the key commodity for food security in many regions including Central Asia and Caucasus, as well as the basic staple in this region. Produced largely by smallholder farmers, wheat provides around 60 percent of people’s energy and protein needs. However, wheat rust diseases threaten yields and production, making continuous monitoring, international collaboration and information exchange a necessity.
To this end, the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture has launched a new project to strengthen regional collaboration and national capacities for management of wheat rust diseases and resistance breeding in Central Asia and Caucasus (CAC-Rust). Covering seven countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus – Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – the project will run until 2024.
A regional meeting held today marked the launch of the project. During the virtual event, key representatives – including officials from participating countries – advocated for improved regional collaboration, national surveillance, race analysis, integrated disease management and the development of disease resistant varieties essential for preventing and managing wheat rust diseases.
The project is expected to facilitate collaboration among national institutions and international organizations such as the Regional Cereal Rust Research Centre based in Izmir, Turkey, the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, and the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Centre.
The meeting included contributions from senior officers of FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture of Turkey. Sumiter Broca, FAO Senior Policy Officer, highlighted both the importance of wheat to food security and the need to increase its resilience against biotic and abiotic stresses. Volkan Güngören, Deputy Director General of the Ministry’s European Union and Foreign Relations Directorate, underlined the importance of regional collaboration to improving food security in the region and emphasized Turkey’s efforts to strengthen this collaboration through the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme.

Representatives from WHO Regional Office in Europe and WHO Collaborating Center in Russia attended as technical experts.
The training was attended by nearly 200 participants, including experts of the Medico-Social Expertise and Rehabilitation Agency, Medico-Social Expertise Committees, Rehabilitation Centers under the Ministry and DOST Centers. The training aimed to enhance capacity of relevant experts working in the area of disability assessment, with a particular focus on ICF.
Dr Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative and Head of Country Office in Azerbaijan delivered opening remarks, commending the government’s intention to implement ICF in the coming years. Mr. Anar Bayramov, Advisor to the Minister of Labor and Social Protection of Population of the Republic of Azerbaijan highlighted the importance of capacity-building in the area of ICF.
ICF is the WHO framework for measuring health and disability at both individual and population levels. ICF was officially endorsed by all 191 WHO Member States in the Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly in 2001 (resolution WHA 54.21) as the international standard to describe and measure health and disability. ICF puts emphasis on health and functioning, rather than on disability. This tool aims to measure one’s functioning in society, no matter what the reason for one's impairments.
Moreover, given that ICF has already been incorporated into the ICD 11 (International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision), this training offers a great opportunity for the national experts to prepare for the new classification.

07 April 2021
The COVID-19 crisis has revealed how unequal our societies are.
Within countries, illness and death from COVID-19 has been higher among people and communities that contend with poverty, unfavourable living and working conditions, discrimination and social exclusion.
Globally, the vast majority of vaccine doses administered have been in a few wealthy countries or those producing vaccines.
Thanks to the COVAX initiative, more nations are now beginning to receive vaccine supplies, but most people in low- and middle-income countries still must watch and wait.
Such inequities are immoral, and they are dangerous for our health, our economies and our societies.
As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we must implement policies and allocate resources so all can enjoy the same health outcomes.
That means achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
And it means delivering universal health coverage so everyone, everywhere, can thrive.
On this World Health Day, let us commit to work together for a healthy, equitable world.

Title: WHO supports the strengthening of Assistive Technology sector in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
06 April 2021
A total of 45 organizations were represented at the meeting, including senior officials of ministries, state committees, chairmen of parliamentary committees, rectors and professors of universities and academies, representatives of international organizations, embassies and NGOs.
After the opening speeches by Dr Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative in Azerbaijan and Anar Karimov, Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Protection it was stated that the WHO and the ministry have started working together to strengthen the AT sector in Azerbaijan. According to WHO, today 1 billion people globally need AT to lead productive, inclusive, and dignified lives, but only 1 in 10 people globally have access to the AT they need. Access to AT is essential for many people to maintain and improve function, health and wellbeing, to participate in education, work and social activities. People who commonly need AT are older people, those with disabilities, people with injuries resulting from conflict and people living with chronic conditions.
The initial stage of the project entails the assessment of the national assistive technology needs, using WHO’s rATA (rapid Assistive Technology Assessment) tool. The findings of this assessment will then yield important insights into the need, unmet need and barriers in accessing AT in Azerbaijan. One of the key elements of the project is to provide technical support to Azerbaijan in the development of the national Priority Assistive Products List, within WHO Global Assistive Technologies Engagement Program (GATE Initiative). The findings will also be presented in the WHO Global Report on AT by 2022 for the benefit of other countries.

Title: Azerbaijan joins projects implemented under the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 April 2021
The FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture (FTPP II) has been further strengthened by the endorsement of four projects by Azerbaijan. This endorsement has brought FAO, Turkey and Azerbaijan even closer to their objective of ensuring food security, promoting rural development and managing natural resources in a sustainable manner.
The projects funded by the Government of Turkey will support countries of Central Asia, Azerbaijan and Turkey by improving capacities in a variety of areas ranging from reduction of food loss and waste to ensuring sustainable fisheries and aquaculture management, combating wheat rust diseases and improving national food safety systems.
The first of these projects, FISHCap, aims to increase national capacities to effectively address the sustainable exploitation, management, protection and development of freshwater resources for sustainable fish production in support of food safety and security. Another project, CAC-Rust, will work to improve the productivity and resilience of wheat production against emerging wheat rust epidemics and races by strengthening national capacities and regional collaboration. The Food Loss and Waste project will support the countries in developing the capacities of their national institutions and elaborating national and regional policies and strategies on reducing food loss and waste. The fourth project on food safety aims to improve national food safety systems at both national and regional scales. This project will contribute to strengthening official food safety controls and risk communication in recipient countries, providing an enabling environment for public and private sectors to address priority food safety risks.
Azerbaijan’s participation in FTPP II will contribute to FAO’s existing work in the country on agricultural productivity, rural development, and animal disease and pest control. Melek Cakmak, FAO Representative in Azerbaijan, who signed the agreements on behalf of FAO, said that, “We are pleased to have Azerbaijan joining these important FTPP II projects, which complement ongoing projects and activities carried out under the FAO-Azerbaijan Partnership Programme (FAPP)”. The FAO-Azerbaijan Partnership Programme was established in 2015, and represents a milestone in the collaboration between Azerbaijan and FAO.

Title: A pilot project has been launched in Guba to develop agricultural advisory services
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
29 March 2021
A five-year strategy for the improvement of agricultural advisory services in Azerbaijan is being prepared within the framework of the "Strengthening Agricultural Advisory Services" project implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The project also envisages the development and implementation of three-year plans in accordance with this strategy in two pilot regions - Ganja and Guba.
The regional activities of the project will cover Guba, Gusar, Khachmaz, Shabran and Siyazan districts. A mechanism for using agricultural advisory services will be introduced, depending on the dominant agrarian sector in the region's economy and the employment of farmers. Project staff informed about the new model of agricultural advisory services in the meetings with farmers, agricultural advisory service providers, representatives of municipalities and subdivisions of the Ministry of Agriculture in the region. It was noted that the new model does not require additional (excessive) expenditures from the state budget and brings together both public and private agricultural advisory service providers to provide extension services to farmers. The model also provides a database where all parties can get information on innovations.
"There are a number of advantages for testing the new model in Guba-Khachmaz economic region: development of crop production in this region, formation of farming traditions, location of such institutions as the Scientific Research Institute of Fruit and Tea growing, Regional Agrarian Science and Innovation Center, fertile soil and climate conditions make advisory services important for all farmers. However, the distance of the region from the Azerbaijan State Agrarian University creates a lack of young professionals who can provide agricultural advisory services” said Vugar Bashirov, the project's national coordinator.
The national coordinator of the project noted that the activities have been launched to select communities in the region. During the meetings with the participants of the agrarian sector, their opinions and suggestions will be evaluated and pilot activities will be implemented in the selected communities.

Title: New project launched to improve Azerbaijan’s food safety system
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 March 2021
Food systems need to produce enough safe food for all. To this end, FAO has initiated a three-year project to amplify support for food safety controls in five countries: Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Moldova, Tajikistan, and Turkey. The project includes regional and national components and was launched at a high-level national inception meeting in Azerbaijan on 16 March, with the participation of representatives from FAO, Azerbaijan, and Turkey.
Entitled “Improving national food safety systems and regional cooperation”, the project is financed by the Government of Turkey through the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture (FTPP II). It aims to strengthen official food safety controls and communication about risks in recipient countries and provide an enabling environment for public and private sectors to address priority food safety risks. The project will also support the creation of more inclusive and efficient food safety systems in beneficiary countries and prioritize improvements in agrifood trade and market integration by focusing on the implementation of risk and evidence-based food safety controls. The project will last three years (1 January 2021 – 31 December 2023).
The project is based on the understanding that an effective food control system – from farm to table – provides benefits for all stages of the food supply chain and all actors involved. Being cognizant of the risks and social costs of unsafe food, the Government of Azerbaijan established the Food Safety Agency (AFSA), in 2018, with a view to developing and enforcing legal regulations and official food controls to protect consumers and ensure fair trade.
The national inception meeting began with opening remarks by Melek Çakmak, FAO Representative for Azerbaijan, Yunus Bayram, Deputy General Director of Food and Control at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Turkey, and Zakiyya Mustafayeva, Deputy Chairperson of AFSA.
Çakmak explained that this multi-country project will provide an excellent opportunity for the beneficiary countries to share experiences and take advantage of cross-learning opportunities. Mustafayeva was also highly positive that the outcome of the project will be supportive and advantageous for both food business operators in Azerbaijan and the AFSA. Bayram reiterated that this project will contribute to enhancing the capacities of national food safety authorities and food business actors involved in risk-based inspection, and will play an important role in the development of effective risk management structures.
Following the opening remarks, Mary Kenny, the Lead Technical Officer of the project, explained the main objectives of the project to the participants. She emphasized that the project builds on ongoing efforts by AFSA and the Agency’s longstanding cooperation with FAO. A series of technical presentations on planned activities provided an insight into upcoming aspects of the project.
The project meeting provided an opportunity for participants to share knowledge and experience in the area of food safety systems and represented a positive step in efforts to bolster Azerbaijan’s institutional arrangements in this field.

Title: When work experience means saving lives: Over 50k masks a day produced by Vocational Education grads to suppress Covid-19 in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 March 2021
Together with twenty other graduates from the tailoring course, Fadile was very busy over the past months, operating state-of-the-art machinery to produce hundreds of thousands of masks each week to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 in Azerbaijan.
“It was lucky enough getting a job in these difficult times,” she says. “But it’s even better to be doing something that’s contributing to a solution. It makes me feel really useful.”
The mask-production centre in which Fadile and some 85 other employees work was set up last year at the same VE Centre where she had studied. This initiative was launched by the State Agency on Vocational Education soon after the pandemic outbreak and supported by the European Union and UNDP.
To ramp up production as quickly as possible, two cutting-edge ultrasonic mask-welding machines and one ton of raw material that were rapidly purchased with the financial support of the EU delivered to Baku through UNDP’s international supply chains.
Beginning with 15,000 masks per day, production at the facility has quickly expanded to the capacity to produce 400,000 masks per week. Available in various colours and sizes, the masks are safe and affordable and can be purchased in local pharmacies.
The great majority of the 85 employees are either recent graduates or alumni of the VE Centre and over 50% are women.
By providing work experience and jobs to make use of the graduates valuable skills, the mask-production project helped the country to deal with the pandemic but also highlighted the growing importance of vocational education in a rapidly changing economy.
“Getting this work experience is really important for all of us,” says Fadile. “What’s really driving us, though, is the feeling we’re making a difference, stopping people getting infected and infecting others. Everyone should wear a mask!’
All evidence indicates that masks are an effective measure in reducing COVID-19 transmission and ultimately saving lives. But masks must be part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach that includes physical distancing, especially avoiding crowded and unventilated settings, covering one’s sneezes and coughs and washing our hands.
This initiative is part of the project ‘Support to the establishment of the Regional Industrial Vocational Education and Training (VET) Competence Centre in Ganja’. The project was funded by the EU and implemented by the UNDP and the State Agency on Vocational Education, with the aim to strengthen and modernise Azerbaijan’s vocational education and training system.

Title: EU and FAO support the development of a draft law on agricultural advisory services in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
16 March 2021
The new legislative mechanism to be developed will be a supporting the implementation of a new model of agricultural advisory services and a five-year strategy which will be submitted to the Government of Azerbaijan by the project.
Project specialists were included in the working group on the draft law preparation on AAS. The experts presented the Agricultural Advisory Service model tailored to Azerbaijan to the working group, informed them about the regulations required between the government bodies, private sector and civil society for the workability of this model, and advised that the legislation should be established in accordance with these requirements.
With the participation of the lead technical officer of the project, FAO extension officer Nevena Alexandrova, three webinars were organized for the working group on “Governance and coordination in a pluralistic AAS system”, “Funding mechanisms and partnerships for AAS in Azerbaijan” and “Increased knowledge, innovation quality assurance and qualification for AAS in Azerbaijan”. The expert elucidated to the webinar participants how the model proposed by the project reflects the funding of agricultural advisory services, the establishment of partnerships and regulation of relations between the parties, addressing the gaps, access to innovations and new knowledge. Ms. Alexandrova made clear that the model was developed using the good practices of European countries that are relevant to the situation in Azerbaijan and taking into account the local specifics on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the status of the advisory system in the country, including regional mapping and inclusive and participatory discussion. The FAO expert explained the role of the Government in the new model of AAS, the positions of key players and the functions of groups that will communicate directly with farmers and serve them. She stressed that the draft law must involve the regulations of relations between all these groups, the clear expression of the roles of each participant and the creation of incentives for the participation of the private sector in the agricultural advisory services system.
It should be noted that in addition to preparing the five-year strategy, the project "Strengthening of Agrarian Advisory Services" also works to pilot the proposed model in two selected regions of the country - Ganja-Gazakh and Guba-Khachmaz.

Title: Sustainable Development Goals can guide North and Central Asia to build back better, says UN report
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
16 March 2021
The 2021 edition of the Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report shows that the region fell short of its 2020 milestones for the Goals, even before entering the global pandemic.  In the last decade, Asia and the Pacific has made extraordinary progress in good health and well-being (Goal 3), which may partly explain its relative success in reducing the health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its population. Yet despite these hard-won gains, the region faces many challenges, such as providing an adequate healthcare workforce, reducing premature deaths and improving mental health.
Despite good progress on several goals, North and Central Asian countries need to redouble efforts in reversing negative trends. The prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity in the subregion is approximately 17 per cent of the total population and has been increasing in recent years. North and Central Asia also needs to reverse current trends on inequality indices for education, gender parity in labour force participation and compliance with labour rights.
An alarming observation in the report is regressing climate action trends (Goal 13) and life below water (Goal 14). The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for more than half of the global greenhouse gas emissions and adverse impacts of natural disasters on people and economies increase year-by-year. As we find our way out of this pandemic, the report suggests we must focus efforts on more equitable and greener growth.
“Recovery measures are an excellent opportunity for us to rethink our options for development pathways that are inclusive, more resilient, and respect planetary boundaries,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and ESCAP Executive Secretary Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. “As we enter the Decade of Action to deliver the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we need to reinforce our collective commitment to the SDGs and let it provide our compass for building back together, better and greener.”
The report highlights the impact of mandatory lockdowns and social distancing measures on data collection activities, particularly from vulnerable groups. To build back better, Governments should renew their commitments to the SDGs’ monitoring framework so that recovery can accelerate a global transformation as promised by the 2030 Agenda.
As part of its commitment to support countries with national level follow-up and review of the SDGs, ESCAP has developed a “National SDG Tracker” tool for countries looking to replicate the progress assessment found in the report. National governments can use the tool to produce snapshots of progress towards the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda.

Title: Boost for digital health as Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Health and UNDP team up with Equinor in tackling COVID-19
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
05 March 2021
This was announced today at a meeting held between the United Nations Development Programme Resident Representative, Alessandro Fracassetti, and the Country Manager of Equinor Apsheron AS, Fawad Quraishi during which a Memorandum of Understanding was signed on prospects for future cooperation to advance sustainable development in Azerbaijan.
The e-platform has been developed by the Ministry of Health with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to help the country cope with the pandemic.
It provides healthcare professionals with free online training courses and certification programmes and currently offers over 55 courses, including training in infection prevention, the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections, as well as numerous other educational resources. To date, over 500 healthcare professionals have enrolled in the courses.
The additional funding provided by Equinor will be used to develop four additional courses currently needed by health professionals:
1)  Mechanical ventilation and respiratory support in ICU
2)  Intubation techniques, including difficult intubation
3)  Respiratory therapy and O2 support in medical wards
4) Antibiotic therapy in COVID-19 patients
The courses will be developed by the Ministry of Health and UNDP, offering CME credits that will count towards the certification scores of the medical professionals that complete the courses. In addition, the teams have already started working on a simulation platform to prepare medical professionals to better respond to the most severe COVID-19 cases to save lives.
UNDP Resident Representative, Alessandro Fracassetti, hailed this as an example of how the private sector can contribute to improving public health services.
“Contributions from businesses and public-private cooperation are crucial factors in mounting a sustainable response to COVID-19 and ensuring a better recovery,” said Fracassetti. “The upgrades we are investing in today will help build more resilient societies.”
“Without a doubt, the Covid-19 pandemic has created severe challenges for nations around the world. Today, more than ever it is important to care for people. The scale of the global health emergency is huge, and it is placing individuals and societies under great pressure. Our contribution to the project supported by UNDP in Azerbaijan is an example of how Equinor can support the response to the Covid19 pandemic,” said Fawad Quraishi, VP and Country Manager for Equinor Azerbaijan.

Title: Azerbaijan marks the start of the National Adaptation Plan process for  climate change resilience
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
26 February 2021
The three-year project will help the Government of Azerbaijan to advance climate change adaptation actions in Azerbaijan in three priority sectors: water, agriculture, and coastal areas.
Funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and implemented by UNDP, the project will focus on strengthening institutional, technical, and financial capacities – in support of the Government’s efforts to ensure that medium-to-long-term climate adaptation needs are integrated into Azerbaijan’s national development planning.
Welcoming the launch of the project, Minister Babayev highlighted the benefits of the project for the country:
“The water sector is one of the areas that are sensitive to the effects of climate change in our country. In this regard, this new project will help mitigate the negative effects of climate change by creating conditions for more sustainable management of water resources and the application of flexible solutions in agriculture”.
UNDP Resident Representative Alessandro Fracassetti emphasised the importance of the project for building resilience to climate change and supporting Azerbaijan in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals:
“This strategic project will further support Azerbaijan in helping the most vulnerable communities to cope with the impacts of climate change. It will help people build climate-resilient livelihoods and help the country to achieve the targets outlined in the Paris Agreement and its Sustainable Development Goals.“
The project will help build institutional, technical, and financial capacities by introducing new tools and practices in data collection and sharing, as well as awareness-raising and training courses for decision-makers, technical personnel, and local communities. The project will further introduce improvements in the legal framework and in monitoring. These increased capacities will in turn help improve the overall capacity of the country and its population to cope with and manage the impacts of climate change.
The ‘National Adaptation Plan Support for adaptation planning and implementation in Azerbaijan’ project builds on the successful long-term partnership between the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources and UNDP.
Over the past years, the Ministry and UNDP have successfully implemented several joint projects on mitigating the impact of climate change through better management of the country’s land plots and forests, and biodiversity.
Currently, the Ministry and UNDP are finalizing the set-up of a tree drip irrigation system around the Hojahasan lake, to help preserve drinking water for the local population. The Aarhus Center in Baku has been fully renovated and refurbished with modern equipment, to ensure greater access to information and public participation in environmental matters.

Title: FAO outlines strategy for healthy and productive livestock in Europe and Central Asia
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
26 February 2021
Available in English and Russian, A wake-up call for impact urges both the private and public sectors to take the initiative on evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and coordinated actions.
The strategy, covering the period of 2020–2025, presents FAO’s work in the region in three main priority areas – animal health, animal production, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) – along with seven cross-cutting issues, among them gender, environmental sustainability, community farming as a business, and coordination with other international organizations.
As a critical step for animal health, the strategy helps countries in the region apply the One Health approach to clearly understand which disease or diseases have a major economic and public health importance. The blueprint also advocates more strongly for involving veterinary services, farmers, and other players along the value chain, as well as for the enhanced use of innovative technology, such as “smart” farming and digital animal-monitoring.
Livestock production depends on many factors, including the quality of feeding, animal health, genetic potential, and farming practices. To this end, the strategy describes the primary aspects of FAO’s related work in the region, particularly feeding and the key factors involved: sustainable pasture management, main feeding resources, reducing feed waste, improving feed quality such as hay and silage, and the importance of taking advantage of crop residues and agroindustry by-products.
With respect to cattle breeding, the document outlines the support to dairy production for small and medium farmers, artificial insemination, the National Animal Identification and Traceability System, and performance-recording. Given the richness of the region with respect to indigenous livestock breeds, the strategy presents opportunities for their conservation to capitalize on their local traits, such as disease resistance, as an added value to increase productivity.
The document points at the importance of developing small ruminant production, family poultry farming, and apiculture for increased production efficiency and sustainability, as well as to enhance child nutrition, women’s income-generating potential, and ecosystem services.
Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest challenges of our times that’s also closely interlinked with the livestock sector. In this regard, the new regional livestock strategy blends in with the global fight against AMR, foreseeing awareness-raising, better surveillance, monitoring, and strengthened governance of antimicrobial resistance and use in food and agriculture, in addition to promoting good practices that reduce the need for using antimicrobials.
“The proper use of antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance are not well-established concepts in most countries across Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and capacities to prevent, control, and reduce the related risks are very limited,” said Eran Raizman, FAO senior animal health officer. “In almost all countries, antimicrobials for livestock are sold without a certified veterinary prescription; this is one reason why ensuring more visibility and training on this issue became part of the strategy.”
Through the improvement of animal health and productivity, while reducing the threat of AMR under the One Health approach, the strategy supports the realization of the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals.
“FAO’s development work should start today with a fresh vision of more resilient systems for the next five years and beyond,” emphasized Vladimir Rakhmanin, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Europe and Central Asia, in the strategy’s foreword.

Given its importance, WHO Country Office in Azerbaijan organized a mission to assess the IPC situation in the conflict-affected regions in the country, in partnership with the Ministry of Health and TABIB. The mission was part of the Solidarity for Health Initiative project funded by the European Union and implemented by WHO Azerbaijan.
The mission team visited Barda, Tartar, Aghdam, Aghjabadi, and Fuzuli districts and assessed both the existing infection control standards and the ability of facilities to manage infection prevention and control in the context of increasing COVID-19 cases. Key areas assessed included screening & triage, intensive care units, maternity, sterilization, and surgical programs, as well as facility waste management in the health facilities in the mentioned districts.
The mission team also held discussions with hospital directors on how the best IPC needs within their facilities can be supported, and WHO experts provided recommendations on how to improve IPC based on WHO guidelines. Responsive trainings were then held with the participation of 100 staff members from seven health facilities, including doctors, epidemiologists, nurses, and other health workers to cover key elements of infection prevention and control which had been identified as high priority within the assessment visits. Trainings were held over multiple sessions and in line with current COVID-19 restrictions and IPC advice.

Title: Working together to create job opportunities for people with disabilities in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
18 February 2021
Today, a round-table event was held in Baku bringing together representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population, UNDP, UNFPA, and over 20 representatives of the largest state and private sector companies to discuss current best practices for employing people with disabilities as well as future steps on how to jointly create better and more job and education opportunities for people with disabilities in the country.
One of the main conclusions of the meeting is that an increasing number of companies in Azerbaijan are starting to recognize disability as a source of diversity, talent, and innovation. Companies have greater opportunities than ever before to recruit people with disabilities as employees and managers and thereby gain a competitive advantage.
Decent work empowers people with disabilities to lead more independent lives and contribute to the wellbeing of their families, communities, and society at large, building together a more inclusive economy.
The event, entitled ‘Employment of Persons with Disabilities: Employer Practices’, was organized as part of the project ‘Addressing the Rights and Well-being of Women with Disabilities and Veterans of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict’. This project is funded by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population and was launched on the initiative of the First Vice-President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Mehriban Aliyeva, and is being implemented by UNDP and UNFPA.
This project aims to complement the Government’s efforts to protect, respect, and fulfill the rights of persons living with disabilities, with a specific focus on women and war veterans of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. This is expected to result in greater protection and improved wellbeing for these groups by creating better access to education, career guidance services, and job opportunities. The project recently helped launch a first Virtual Skills Development and Training Lab, which can be accessed at www.vlaboratoriya.sosial.gov.az.

16 February 2021
The project funded by the European Union and implemented by WHO will cover all phases - constituting “end-to-end” support - of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and vaccination and will also serve as a major investment to strengthen the routine immunization system.
The project will be implemented by WHO to support the major national counterparts, the Ministry of Health and TABIB, over a three-year period as part of a €40 million European Union-funded initiative to support six countries in the WHO European Region in preparing for, deploying, and monitoring rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.
“This project will help the rapid deployment of vaccines in the EU partner countries, including Azerbaijan. We all are waiting for these vaccines trying to turn the last year of lockdowns into the new year of hope and return to normal life. We are proudly working as “Team Europe”, with WHO, in solidarity with our partners, build on the previous cooperation when we delivered personal protective and medical equipment last year and rapidly reoriented our bilateral programs to support socio-economic recovery” stated Kestutis Jankauskas, Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Azerbaijan.
“We have started vaccination against COVID-19 in Azerbaijan since January. We highly appreciate cooperation with EU and WHO on risk communications, vaccine logistics, and developing a cold chain for storing vaccines as part of our multiplatform approach to vaccine deployment,” stated Dr. Yagut Garayeva, head of the Disease Prevention and Control Department of TABİB while emphasizing the importance of the initiative.
Dr. Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Azerbaijan, said: “Vaccines offer hope and protection to those fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic and to those at highest risk living in fear of its devastating impact. Thanks to this generous support, WHO can strengthen its collaboration with the Government of Azerbaijan to ensure that vaccines can reach those who need them most, as soon and as efficiently as possible.”
The funds will be used initially to support the first phase of preparedness and deployment, with an emphasis on imminent needs in strategic programmatic areas such as planning, equipment/supplies, training of health workers, and information campaigns.
The project builds on the European Union’s and WHO’s ongoing support to countries’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the joint €35 million EU Solidarity for Health Initiative, aimed to support the partner countries in their fight against the virus and address better the needs of the most vulnerable people.

Every negative factor that disrupts social harmony in society is in fact just as harmful as the coronavirus. You can learn about these dangers from the illustrations produced as part of the campaign. We invite each of you to support us by sharing these images on various social media with the hashtag #ferqindeol. Detailed information on the "Be aware" public awareness campaign can be found on the website www.ferqindeol.az.
“In addition to the direct impacts of the COVID-19 virus on population, we should recognize the secondary potentially traumatic effects of the pandemic on individuals and communities. The combination of prolonged stress, close quarters, closed businesses and self-isolation guidelines has increased the risk of domestic violence, child abuse, xenophobia, and discrimination,” Vladimir Gjorgjiev, IOM’s Chief of Mission in Azerbaijan explained. “Through this information campaign, our mission seeks to equip the public with the information they need to know about the COVID-19 crisis and its consequences which are going to have a long, yet undetermined course.”
Within the framework of countering consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, IOM Azerbaijan designed a series of promotional materials with the aim of sensitizing citizens about the importance of avoiding xenophobia, hate speech, domestic violence, violent extremism, and disinformation.
In order to draw the attention of a wide audience to the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, as well as to increase knowledge and response from the targeted audience, the posts produced in Azerbaijani and English languages will be disseminated through online media channels and in a public banners.
Currently, within the campaign, large posters are displayed in streets of the capital and other main cities of Azerbaijan, public places illustrating different types of impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that pose a threat to society.
The "Be aware" public awareness campaign, which will continue through the end of April, is part of the Public Action for Sustainability project implemented by IOM Azerbaijan with financial support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The campaign's partner organization is the Foundation for the Promotion of Moral Values under the State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

09 February 2021
A regional office has been set up in Ganja within the framework of the ‘Strengthening of Agricultural Advisory Services’ project implemented by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) in Azerbaijan. This EU-funded project envisages the development of a 5-year strategy for strengthening agricultural advisory services in Azerbaijan, as well as the implementation of pilot activities following this strategy in two pilot regions - Ganja and Guba.
The project goal and objectives, the number of opportunities, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as threatening factors for the development of agricultural advisory services in the region, which covers 9 provinces, has been presented by the project's national coordinator Vugar Bashirov in the Ganja regional office. He noted that the development of educational institutions and research institutes in the field of agriculture, fertile lands, and vegetable growing are the advantages of the region. However, the expert noted that the limited access of small farmers to the market, the small number of certified agricultural consultants by region and sector, low productivity of both crops and animals in agriculture are weaknesses that will affect the development of this sector.
It was noted that in connection with the implementation of the project, discussions will begin in the coming days with the participants of the agricultural advisory services sector to strengthen agrarian advisory services. Discussions will focus on bringing the needs of farmers' agricultural advisory services and offers of the service providers to a common ground. Round tables and workshops involving regional experts and farmers are also planned to identify priorities and opportunities for local innovation. Two communities (rural and municipal) will be selected in the region, and pilot activities will be implemented in those communities.
The role of state agrarian development centers and private agrarian advisory service providers in the development of agrarian advisory services has been discussed in the presentation. Farmers of the region spoke about the need for agrarian advisory services and the existing problems.
It was noted in the presentation that the implementation of the project "Strengthening Agrarian Advisory Services" in the country will depend on the success of pilots in selected regions.

Title: Three regions in Azerbaijan will be registered as Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
04 February 2021
GIAHS are aesthetic sites that combine agricultural biodiversity, resilient ecosystems, and valuable cultural heritage. Thanks to traditional agricultural practices, sustainable ecosystems that protect agrarian biodiversity have been formed in these climate-tolerant areas. Being registered as a GIAHS area is of great importance for the current and future food security of the region, ensuring the livelihood of the population, as well as the development of other economic and environmental products and services.
The main goal of the project, which covers the Zagatala, Gakh, and Balakan regions, is to form value chains that support small agricultural entrepreneurship and contribute to the elimination of poverty in the area. The project also aims to develop the region's agricultural tourism potential.
The registration of the selected sites as GIAHS will be an important step for the promotion of not only these places but the whole country to foreign tourists. "The advantage of sites and communities which are registered by FAO as GIAHS is that the products of farmers and entrepreneurs living and working in these areas are recognized globally, creating favorable conditions for foreign tourists to visit these communities," commented Project Manager Yusif Akhundov.
Currently, 62 GIAHS territories from 22 countries have been registered.

Nowadays preparation and administration of vaccines have become a vital task in tackling COVID-19. Several countries, including Azerbaijan, have already started vaccination of the population.  Safety and timely detection and elimination of adverse reactions to vaccines are very important during vaccination. To address this necessity, WHO organized an international pharmacovigilance training for strengthening the control on detection and registration of adverse reactions to drugs and vaccines.  Azerbaijani health professionals achieved the highest scores on the exam among participants from different countries.
“It is very important to monitor that a vaccine or a medicine continues to stay safe and effective in real-life conditions after it is proven safe in clinical trials. Pharmacovigilance aims to achieve this,” noted Dr. Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative in Azerbaijan who presented the certificates to the doctors. She highlighted that therefore, it is important to constantly update the knowledge of healthcare professionals who are working in the field of pharmacovigilance.
Dr Olexandr Polishchuk, expert of WHO Regional Office for Europe, and Dr Javahir Suleymanova, expert of WHO Azerbaijan also delivered remarks at the event. The certified doctors, in turn, shared their views on the training program.

25 January 2021
WHO study shows that improved diagnosis, treatment, and control of hypertension in primary healthcare alone has the potential to save up to 24 000 lives and 600 million AZN per year in Azerbaijan. According to Dr. Harmanci, therefore, "development of primary healthcare can help to reduce mortality, lower health care costs, minimize economic losses and enhance labor productivity." During the meeting, the partners and stakeholders were also informed about THE progress in the PROACT-Care demonstration project, including results of the two needs assessment missions conducted last year.  The PROACT-Care will be officially launched in the Shamakhi district next month.
Along with the project presentations by the PROACT-Care team, Dr. Ramin Bayramli, Head of TABIB, Dr. Teymur Musayev, Head of the Organization of Healthcare Department at the Ministry of Health, Mr. Soltan Mammadov, Member of the Health Committee at the Parliament of Azerbaijan, and Director of International Relations Department at the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, and Dr. Firangiz Aliyeva, Head of Medical Services Department at TABIB joined the event as keynote speakers to deliver their reflections on the project. The meeting was also attended by the representatives of USAID, UK Aid, and RoAID. Tahir Mammadov, the head of the Shamakhi District Executive Power, Edward Carwardine, UNICEF Representative in Azerbaijan, Farid Babayev, Head of the UNFPA Office in Azerbaijan, Ehtiram Rustamzada, Director of the Shamakhi District Central Hospital, representatives of the State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance of Azerbaijan and other organizations participated in the meeting as partners and stakeholders of the project.
Dr. Ramin Bayramli noted in the meeting "launching such a project during major efforts to tackle the pandemic is important for us” and expressed hope that PROACT-Care will have a significant contribution to shaping the expected primary healthcare reforms in Azerbaijan. WHO expert Dr. Ibrahim Durak informed the meeting participants about the needs assessment missions conducted in Shamakhi district in August and December 2020 and noted that "only 1 in 9 persons (11%) with hypertension in Shamakhi district is diagnosed and only 1 in 11 persons (9%) treated for hypertension is well controlled." WHO expert Dr. Anne Johansen highlighted that 4% of the country's GDP is lost annually to non-communicable diseases. "An excellent primary healthcare can prevent 25% of the avoidable deaths in Azerbaijan" she noted. It was also mentioned that, as part of the project, over 100 healthcare workers will be trained on COVID-19 response, cardiometabolic risks, and mother and child health in the Shamakhi district in 8 February - 15 March 2021.
Delivering his reflections on the PRACT-Care project, Dr. Teymur Musayev pointed out that the PROACT-Care project can be very helpful to develop system and build human resources capacities to more efficiently use the existing healthcare resources in the Shamakhi district. Mr. Soltan Mammadov added that strengthening primary healthcare is among the key requirements of the introduction of mandatory health insurance in Azerbaijan and suggested to start similar needs assessment missions in the other regions of the country.
Other project stakeholders and partners also expressed their support to PROACT-Care and stressed the importance of the learnings of the project for developing a sustainable primary healthcare model in Azerbaijan.

25 December 2020
PROACT-Care aims to strengthen primary healthcare capacity to respond to the interruption of essential health care services in the context of COVID-19 and beyond, and at the same time, create a real-life demonstration of a primary healthcare model tailored for Azerbaijan, which could then be scaled-up to the whole country.
Seven focus groups were held to identify learning needs of primary healthcare workers. Focus groups were attended by 45 medical personnel from 27 primary healthcare facilities - 14 village doctor’s points, 11 village medical points, 2 Family Health Centers. Invaluable information regarding the needs and capabilities of Shamakhi healthcare workers were obtained, which will be used to develop training modules tailored to their needs.
The mission team which was joined by the representatives of TABIB and UNICEF also met with Dr. Ehtiram Rustamzada, the Director of the Shamakhi Central District Hospital, and a representative from the Shamakhi District Executive Power. Dr. Rustamzade, with whom the team discussed project plans, particularly in the field of healthcare workers capacity building and skills development, noted: “This mission was productive from all viewpoints as its objectives address very actual issues, I can say that such a meeting was long-awaited”. The mission team also handed over 12500 medical masks from WHO to the hospital to support the efforts to tackle COVID-19.
As part of the visit, the team also had focus groups with local community members. Community engagement focus groups with local residents are the first step to understand the current state of access to PHC from the local perspective. Six focus groups were conducted in Ahamadli and Galeybughurd villages and Shamakhi city with the participation of over 40 community members. The findings will be used as a baseline for the project planning and implementation, particularly for the upcoming telephone survey in the district about the perceptions of access to PHC.
“We learned a lot from this visit. Now we have a deeper understanding of the needs of local communities and healthcare workers in Shamakhi, their expectations and how we can cooperate toward better primary healthcare”, Dr. Halil Ibrahim Durak, WHO expert and the mission lead stated. “It was the first close encounter, but not the last. We will continue working together, learn together, change together and, of course, leave no one behind.”
The mission will conclude with meetings with representatives of the Ministry of Health, SAMHI and TABIB in Baku, with whom PROACT-Care project will closely cooperate.

Donation of these medical supplies is part of the Solidarity for Health Initiative project funded by the European Union and implemented by the WHO Country Office in Azerbaijan. On 27 March 2020, the EU a large assistance package to help prevent, detect and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in six countries of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, including Azerbaijan. Previously, two medical shipments were delivered to Azerbaijan in July and September 2020 as part of the Solidarity for Health Initiative.
“These 3rd and 4th shipments of protective gear and medical equipment that we are handing over to Azerbaijan today is yet another example of partnership and teamwork among the EU, WHO and Azerbaijan to help to fight the pandemic.”, stated Kestutis Jankauskas, Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Azerbaijan and wished Azerbaijani people healthy and happy New Year.
The funds have initially been used to meet immediate emergency needs, such as procuring essential supplies. “In the current stage, along with the continuation of the critical supply deliveries, we pay increased attention to providing additional training to healthcare workers and supporting the more structural healthcare needs of the country", Dr Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative and Head of Country Office in Azerbaijan said.
"Now the entire World has united efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. I consider that we can also overcome this problem by uniting our efforts. The medical supplies delivered today are needed in both policlinics and hospitals in Azerbaijan” noted Dr Nadir Zeynalov, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan, and thanked EU and WHO for their continued support.

Title: ‘EVDEQAL’ COVID-19 WEBSITE EXPORTED TO MALDIVES
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
22 December 2020
With the swift implementation of pandemic prevention measures, such as physical distancing and other containment measures including lockdowns, shutdown of facilities and services and restriction of movement, there emerged a need for innovation and technology to address the unexpected challenges arising from the COVID-19 crisis and the new way of life.  This brought out rising demand for online shops, products and services and in general, online ordering.
“As the COVID-19 crisis has evolved, the needs within our communities have continued to expand,” said UNDP Resident Representative Akiko Fujii. “The COVID-19 ‘Evdeqal’ tool will serve those in need with ready-access to vital information and services to meet their immediate needs and beyond.”
The website, which was initially launched in April 2020, is a digital platform set up by the Ministry of Transport, Communication and High Technologies (MTCHT) in Azerbaijan in partnership with UNDP Azerbaijan in response to COVID-19, which aimed to tackle the rising demand for basic services online and the need for e-learning resources during the pandemic. The website enables users to search for local resources, and access information for vital services such as links to online stores, e-education, e-health, e-entertainment, e-food and e-delivery. Along with the latest news and updates on COVID-19 and advice on preventative measures, the new digital resource also features information, guidance and other support services, such as blog posts on new developments.
“Homebased entrepreneurial activities have grown since the onset of COVID-19, and we anticipate this trend of entrepreneurial activity to continue beyond the pandemic,” said Business Center Corporation. “However, due to this exceptional boom, it has become increasingly difficult for such young start-ups to find their footing in this increasingly competitive and complex environment. Such businesses often seem to have markets restricted to the entrepreneurs’ own social circles and most attempts at branding seem to go unnoticed by their larger potential audience. Given the large pool of potential beneficiaries, and in identifying a real need for such a listings website, we believe that starting such an initiative in Maldives can also help these young firms find their balance in these competitive markets and ease the erratic first few months of business inception.”
Relying on UNDP’s global experience, UNDP Maldives initially supported the National Emergency Response Centre (NEOC) of Maldives to duplicate the efforts and apply these innovative digital solutions to the local context. This led to the formulation of UNDP Maldives’ partnership with BCC and Azerbaijan, in exporting and adapting ‘Evdeqal’ to the Maldivian context.
“As COVID-19 has exposed the consequences of the digital divide, it has also highlighted the potential for more collaboration between countries. To help people and economies recover from the pandemic, we need to significantly increase the speed that digital solutions work at scale and this is exactly what we are trying to do with ‘Evdeqal’”, said UNDP Resident Representative in Azerbaijan, Alessandro Fracassetti.
COVID-19 has caused serious challenges for both people and economies, but the demand for digital technologies and infrastructure is on the rise. For millions of people, technology has become the only way for people to work, learn and stay in touch with their loved ones.  The situation is no different in Azerbaijan with over one million students switching to online learning and thousands of employees moving to teleworking. The "Evdeqal.az" platform has helped both people and small businesses cope better in these challenging times and we are planning to develop and upgrade it further”, said Rashad Azizov, the Head of the Department of Innovations and Digital Development the Ministry of Transport, Communications and High Technologies of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Title: Psycho-social support and skill-building are critical in the conflict-affected regions of Azerbaijan, WHO mission says
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
16 December 2020
These are some of the initial findings of the WHO rapid Health Needs Assessment Mission to the conflict-affected regions of Azerbaijan.
WHO’s five-day visit aimed at evaluating existing response capacity and immediate needs, to identify short− and medium−term priorities in the health sector. The WHO mission deployed to work with people on the ground to address population health needs in conflict-affected regions both in general terms and specific to COVID-19.
“Getting in the field, close to those who work on the front-line of the response and to the people who suffer is the best way to understand the needs and tailor the support,” said Dr. Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative to Azerbaijan. “One of the main challenges we identified is the limitations of the health sector to address the escalating need for mental health and psychosocial support in the conflict-affected areas. WHO will continue to work with national counterparts and UN partners in Azerbaijan to support the country on these issues.”
WHO expert team was joined by representatives of the Ministry of Health and TABIB and travelled to Ganja, Terter, Barda, and Agdam between 8 and 12 December. They visited 12 healthcare facilities, including hospitals, primary healthcare centers, and medical points to observe the major health impacts due to the latest conflict on the civilian population and identify groups and areas most at risk.
Health care workers have been overwhelmed in the past months and their efforts have been heroic, as WHO experts acknowledged. Some health facilities have been partly damaged hence some of their patients had to be evacuated. Essential health services, such as immunization, care of chronic diseases, mother and child health services have been seriously interrupted. An increased number of COVID-19 infections has been reported among health care providers and some of them lost their lives.
Many civilians, especially those who lost family members and whose houses were destroyed by shelling seem heavily affected. We observed that the government along with international and national groups started to provide psycho-social support for some of these groups. There is a need for more work and a better coordination in this area to reach a larger population as soon as possible.
“The conflict in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic created a significant impact and challenge for the health system and more so for the health care providers to cope with the increased workload in these regions. They all do their best with the means that they have. The safety of health care workers is important for us. They are at continuous risk of contracting COVID-19. We need to work together, guided by science and evidence and learn to live with this new normal if we want to get the pandemic under control,” Dr. Marie T. Benner, the mission’s lead stated.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
14 December 2020
For the first, two new initiatives will reduce (and reverse) land degradation and conserve biodiversity of protected areas, while in the latter, sustainable water management will be supported with the neighbouring Afghanistan.
The projects will contribute to achieve the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically those on sustainable management of water (SDG 6) and life on land (SDG 15).
“FAO Azerbaijan, in close coordination with GEF, has been operating natural resources management projects since 2017, thus the approval of two additional proposals is a clear sign of the mutual trust among the three parties,” said Melek Cakmak, FAO Representative in Azerbaijan.
“In an upstream country like Tajikistan, the support of the Global Environment Facility to transboundary water management, combined with FAO expertise, will have a long-term positive impact on its development path of participating countries and other downstream countries of the region,” commented the FAO Representative to Tajikistan, Oleg Guchgeldiyev, on the approval of the project.
Restoring degraded land and biodiversity in Azerbaijan
Soils hold the largest terrestrial carbon pool and play a crucial role in the global carbon balance by regulating dynamic biochemical processes and the exchange of greenhouse gases with the atmosphere. Therefore, healthy soils and proper land use have beneficial effects on greenhouse gas emissions.
The project titled "Towards a land degradation-neutral Azerbaijan" aims to support national efforts to develop and implement national targets on land degradation neutrality, and pilots sustainable land management in Absheron Peninsula at the Caspian Sea, contributing to the rehabilitation of degraded lands and improved livelihood resilience.
It will take a phased approach, starting with a strengthened enabling environment for land degradation neutrality at phase 1, rehabilitating the saline and eroded land of the Absheron Peninsula – the most degraded area in the country at phase 2, and, finally, upscaling efforts, monitoring, and evaluation.
Another FAO initiative that received support from the Global Environmental Facility focuses on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity to improve governance and management of Azerbaijan’s protected areas. Additionally, it will contribute to more sustainable management of surrounding production areas by means of a holistic landscape approach.
A special attention will be given to women in achieving natural resource management, who will be supported to fully participate in training and biodiversity conservation planning, and to pursue alternative livelihoods reducing pressure on natural resources in the Hirkan and Shirvan National Parks, both key biodiversity areas in the Caucasus.

Title: UN joins efforts with development partners to mark 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaign in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 November 2020
This year, the campaign aims to contribute to prevention of and response to GBV in Azerbaijan by addressing combined impact of the armed conflict in and around Nagorno-Karabakh as well as the COVID-19 pandemic on women and girls.
The available evidence suggests that women and girls in the conflict-affected regions represent one of the most vulnerable groups regarding GBV-related vulnerabilities, which include but are not limited to psychological trauma, displacement, loss of financial resources, and most importantly, disruption of the available GBV service provision channels. The complex interplay of these challenges forces the affected women and girls to reside in the densely populated areas with limited opportunities to self-isolate as well as access water, sanitation and basic health supplies and services, increasing their pandemic-related vulnerabilities.
As part of the 16 Days of Activism, the UN Office in Azerbaijan has joined efforts with its development partners to support government's response and relief efforts by procurement and supply of about 400 dignity kits that include female hygiene items and COVID-19 related personal protective equipment to the displaced women. The dignity kits, will be delivered to women and girls temporarily residing in Aghdam and Terter districts. These kits will be used as entry points for providing the affected women and girls with the information on available GBV protection and support services including the national three-digit GBV hotline launched in the framework of partnership between the UN and the Government of Azerbaijan.
During the campaign days, the information materials to raise awareness on the available GBV protection mechanisms will also be shared through social media networks of the UN Office in Azerbaijan, partner organizations, as well as radio and television channels to reaffirm our commitment to building a gender equitable and violence-free society for all.
16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is an international campaign that runs every year from 25 November, the International Day for the elimination of Gender Based Violence to 10 December, the International Human Rights Day. The campaign is traditionally co-held in Azerbaijan by the United Nations Office and the State Committee for Family, Women and Children’s Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Title: USAID, State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs and UNDP launch new project to help address gender-  based violence in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 November 2020
This four-year 1.8 USD million project funded by USAID will also support women’s economic empowerment.
“Despite the difficult socio-political and military situation in the country and the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, our efforts to combat gender-based violence continue. Over the past months, we have taken a number of measures to help advance gender equality and women’s empowerment. It is important to put more focus on prevention, but also on providing more flexible support to victims of violence, protection, shelters and other resources,” says Bahar Muradova, the Chairperson of Azerbaijan’s State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs.
"When we talk about gender-based violence we often focus on the survivors – predominantly women and girls – rather than asking ourselves the more difficult and personal questions of who are the perpetrators – most commonly men – and why we too often ignore their violence against women and girls. As we launch this new Stand up for Women and Girls project, I am challenging myself and others to reflect on the role we play in stopping gender-based and domestic violence before it happens," says Dr. Jaidev Singh, Mission Director of USAID/Azerbaijan.
“This new project comes at the right time. It will help improve access for women to essential services such as health, legal aid and social support and further contribute to advancing women’s economic empowerment in the country. In times of COVID-19, women disproportionately bear the greater burden of caring for and teaching children who cannot attend school and looking after elderly family members. Women are also at higher risk of domestic violence now more than ever due to greater economic stress on households combined with increased social isolation,”, says UNDP Resident Representative Alessandro Fracassetti.
Working closely with the Women’s Resource Centres in Azerbaijan, the “Stand Up for Women and Girls” project will help create safe spaces for women and girls, offering psychological support and family counselling. Through the use of mobile clinics, these services will help support more than 1,100 survivors of domestic violence.
The project will further boost the capacity of the Women Resource Centres to advance women’s economic empowerment by providing training and business advisory services for women entrepreneurs and by working with the private sector to create more opportunities for vocational training and internships for women.
To help local and national authorities make better-informed and evidence-based decisions and policies on domestic violence, the project will conduct new studies to obtain more accurate data on this issue in Azerbaijan.
“Stand Up for Women and Girls” will also support innovation by tapping into the latest technology to help develop apps and platforms to ensure safer public spaces for women.
The project will work on changing attitudes and behavior by providing education to prevent violence against women through community-based sessions and advocacy campaigns.
It is time to stand up for women and girls everywhere, today and every day.

Title: UNHCR, supported by Azercell, to distribute Japan-donated eye-glasses to internally displaced persons in Baku
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 November 2020
The eyeglasses in the quantity of 1,500 pairs have been sent to Azerbaijan from Japan by a private company “Fuji Optical” Ltd. The company is acknowledged as an important private donor of UNHCR and is owned by the famous Optometrist Doctor Akio Kanai who is the prestigious Nansen Refugee Award winner of 2006 for his consistent in-kind donations and free of charge optometric services for the displaced people in different parts of the world since 1983.
In Azerbaijan, Fuji Optical had realized 15 vision aid missions to Azerbaijan during 2005-2019 and spent about 3 million USD by donating over 60 thousand pairs of high-quality eyeglasses and conducting eye-screening for more than 33 thousand IDPs, refugees, asylum seekers and other vulnerable people in the country. The next vision aid mission of Fuji Optical to Azerbaijan had been scheduled to May 2020, but the visit of the Japanese optometrist specialists under the leadership of Dr. Akio Kanai had to be suspended due to the global Covid-19 pandemic.
Humanitarian assistance of the Japanese Fuji Optical have always been highly appreciated by UNHCR, the Government of Azerbaijan and the beneficiary communities, says UNHCR Country Representative in Azerbaijan Mr. Guido Ambroso. “UNHCR continues to contribute to mobilize and coordinate assistance by various actors, including the private sector, to ensure that essential needs of refugees, IDPs and stateless people, are met and to facilitate the achievement of durable solution for all displaced persons. In this regard, the in-kind donations and humanitarian missions by the Japanese Fuji Optical, as well as its significant cash contribution to UNHCR should be highly praised” he added.
It should be noted that the prize money given to Dr. Akio Kanai as the Nansen Refugee Award in 2006 was donated back to UNHCR. That amount was spent to fund a water supply project for the Khojavend IDP community temporarily settled in Beylagan region. Furthermore, the prestigious “Yomiuri Shinbun International Cooperation” award in the amount of 5 million Yen (approximately 44 thousand USD) given to Dr. Akio Kanai by the Japanese Yomiuri newspaper was donated by him to the Azerbaijani Social Development Fund for IDPs in 2018. The donation was spent to purchase an agricultural machinery to be used by the IDPs who returned to the Jojug Marjanli village of Jabrayil.
UNHCR is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action, in cooperation with national authorities, to protect and find solutions for refugees worldwide. The Agency has been operating in Azerbaijan since December 1992 when the country was challenged with massive displacement.

Title: WHO urges coordinated action against antibiotics resistance

24 November 2020
The focus for this year is on stopping the COVID-19 pandemic from worsening the ongoing antibiotic resistance crisis.
We have learned that the increasing misuse of antibiotics during the crisis is driving AMR even faster and may lead to shortages of medicines for those who really need it.
To discuss antimicrobial resistance and raise awareness on the correct use antibiotics, World Health Organization Country Office in Azerbaijan organized a media briefing together with the Ministry of Health, TABIB and Food Safety Agency.
WHO Representative in Azerbaijan, Dr. Hande Harmanci, emphasized the importance of the correct use of antibiotics especially in the flu season and during the COVID-19 pandemic in her opening remarks. WHO’s specialist Dr. Javahir Suleymanova provided information on the WHO recommendations and the collaborative work in Azerbaijan in this area, while the representatives of the Ministry of Health and Food Safety Agency Nazifa Mursalova and Tamilla Aliyeva talked about their work around antibiotic resistance and COVID.
A survey to assess the level of antibiotic awareness among the population in Baku and Sumgait will be conducted within the month. This will be one of a series of surveys done each year to monitor the change in this area.
Every year, World Antimicrobial Awareness Week aims to increase awareness of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and to encourage best practices among the general public, health workers and policy makers to stop the further emergence and spread of drug-resistant infections.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
19 November 2020
Since 2015, this Week has been focusing on awareness-raising and education working towards the responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials. This year, the name of this awareness initiative, which was previously known as the World Antibiotic Awareness Week, was changed to World Antimicrobial Awareness Week to reflect the breadth of the initiative. Antimicrobials include antibiotic, antiviral, antifungal and antiprotozoal agents, which are critical tools for treating diseases in humans, animals, and plants.
The World Antibiotic Awareness Week is of particular importance this year as the COVID-19 crisis is increasing the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials, including antibiotics. Unless something is done, this could worsen the growing long-term problems of antimicrobial resistance.
The Tripartite recognizes the need for access to antimicrobials, as they are essential to ensure human and animal health, food supply and food safety. However, countries need to step up implementation of their national strategies and policies across sectors, as well as their commitment to tackling the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
Antimicrobial resistance is a global crisis. There is no time to wait. Everyone has a role to play to preserve the effectiveness of antimicrobials. The Tripartite calls on their Member States to strengthen measures to combat antimicrobial resistance, widely publicize the global challenge, and encourage people to change their behaviour regarding the use of antimicrobials. Human and animal health, the environment and food sectors, as well as civil society must unite efforts to preserve antimicrobial efficacy through a multisectoral One Health approach.

Title: Europe and Central Asia discuss solutions to promote sustainable agrifood systems
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 November 2020
The 32nd Session of the FAO Regional Conference for Europe started today as FAO Members from Europe and Central Asia discuss several challenges facing the region on food and agriculture, particularly how to promote sustainable agrifood systems and healthy diets as well as solutions for youth, employment and developing rural areas.
Hosted by Uzbekistan in collaboration with FAO, the Conference - held entirely virtually for the first time - brings together over 31 ministers and deputy-ministers, in total over 270 representatives from 51 Members in Europe and Central Asia, making it the highest attendance at a Regional Conference for Europe. The Azerbaijani delegation was attended by the Minister of Agriculture Inam Karimov, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Ilhama Gadimova and other representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture. Representatives of international organizations, the civil society and the private sector are also participating in the Conference, which is held biennially.
In his opening address, the Director-General thanked Uzbekistan for their flexibility in hosting the Conference virtually, and welcomed the representatives from civil society, private sector and other partners, stressing that their presence and contribution enriches the discussion.
The FAO Director-General, QU Dongyu, also highlighted that the region is an economic and agricultural powerhouse but also faces many enduring and new challenges.
These include “pressure on natural resources, land degradation and water scarcity in large parts of the region, persisting food insecurity but also growing levels of obesity, increasing gaps between rural and urban areas, gender inequalities and enduring pockets of hunger and poverty in many rural areas,” he said, noting that innovation and digital technologies are crucial to promote modern sustainable agriculture and rural development.
“Digital technologies such as satellite imaging, remote sensors and mobile and blockchain applications promise revolutionary changes for smallholder farmers and consumers,” he said, pointing out that “they can help optimize food chains, increase access to markets, reduce food loss and waste, improve water management and fight pests and diseases.”
Innovative tools and approaches for tailor-made support
In response to challenges facing the region, the FAO Director-General highlighted some key achievements, such as a strategy for accessing the Green Climate Fund, FAO’s normative and field work on land consolidation, as well as the Regional Gender Strategy and country gender assessments that are contributing to the empowerment of rural women across the region.
Qu also noted the compounding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on existing challenges and highlighted the recently launched FAO’s comprehensive COVID-19 Response and Recovery Programme, “which aims to mitigate immediate impacts while strengthening the long-term resilience of agrifood systems and livelihoods.”
FAO Director-General Qu also alluded to FAO’s flagship Hand-in-Hand Initiative - an evidence-based, initiative aimed at ending hunger and poverty in countries that cannot be left behind. The Initiative deploys sophisticated tools and analytics such as the Hand-in-Hand Geospatial Platform and Data Lab for Statistical Innovation to accelerate agricultural transformation and sustainable rural development.
Healthy diets and sustainable agri-food systems
Agri-food systems in Europe and Central Asia are diverse, at different stages of development and experiencing different external pressures and challenges. These include limited public spending, natural resources constraints and socio-political considerations. COVID-19 has exposed these fragilities but it also reinforced the importance of resilient food systems.
The 32nd Session of the Regional Conference for Europe ends on 4 November, and it is the last of a series of virtual FAO regional conferences that included Asia and the Pacific; Near East; Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa.

22 October 2020
Since late September, the violence has displaced tens of thousands of civilians, injured hundreds and killed many. Our deepest thoughts are with every family, every member of the community affected.
The hostilities are already contributing to a dramatic acceleration in COVID-19 transmission. Continued cycles of violence and subsequent population displacement will exacerbate the precariousness of the health situation.
The conflict is causing a direct disruption to health care, further burdening health systems that are already stretched by the pandemic. This comes at a time when COVID-19 case numbers across the WHO European Region continue to surge.
WHO calls for no time lost nor efforts unspent in protecting lives and livelihoods from a public health threat unprecedented in our lifetimes.
WHO urges all parties to the conflict to protect civilians and health-care facilities caring for the wounded and sick in line with international humanitarian law. In the context of COVID-19, it is especially crucial that all health workers are kept safe from violence so they can sustain the pandemic response.
An immediate cessation of hostilities is vital to preserve access to health services – a fundamental human right.

Title: Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General - on the situation between Armenia and Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
18 October 2020
The tragic loss of civilian lives, including children, from the latest reported strike on 16 October last night on the city of Ganja is totally unacceptable, as are indiscriminate attacks on populated areas anywhere, including in Stepanakert/Khankendi and other localities in and around the immediate Nagorno-Karabakh zone of conflict.
The Secretary-General deeply regrets that the sides have continuously ignored the repeated calls of the international community to immediately stop the fighting.  As he underscored again in his latest calls with the Foreign Ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan, both sides have the obligation under international humanitarian law to take constant care to spare and protect civilians and civilian infrastructure in the conduct of military operations. and protect civilians and civilian infrastructure.  The Secretary-General notes the latest announcement on the start of the humanitarian truce on 18 October and expects both parties to fully abide by this commitment and resume substantive negotiations without delay under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs.

In addition to the mounting number of child fatalities and injuries, dozens of homes and schools have been damaged or destroyed. Countless children and families have endured extreme psychological trauma and distress for weeks.
UNICEF appeals, in the strongest possible terms, for an immediate implementation of the humanitarian ceasefire which both parties agreed to on 9 October. Children, families and the civilian facilities that they depend upon must be protected, in line with international human rights and humanitarian law. A complete cessation of hostilities is in the best interest of all children.

Title: UN75: The Future We Want, The UN We Need
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
21 September 2020
In January 2020, the United Nations launched the global consultation to mark its 75th anniversary. Through surveys and dialogues, it asked people about their hopes and fears for the future – representing the UN’s most ambitious effort to date to understand expectations of international cooperation and of the UN in particular.  It is also the largest survey to date on priorities for recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of 21 September 2020, over a million people from all countries and all walks of life had taken part. Their answers provide unique insights into what the public wants at this challenging time for the world. They are released today to coincide with the UN General Assembly’s official commemoration of the 75th anniversary, held under the banner: the future we want, the UN we need. Key findings include:
Priorities for action
·        Across regions, ages and social groups, respondents were broadly united in their priorities for the future.
·        Amid the current COVID-19 crisis, the immediate priority for most respondents is improved access to basic services – healthcare, safe water, sanitation and education, followed by greater international solidarity and increased support to those hardest hit. This includes tackling inequalities and rebuilding a more inclusive economy.
·        Looking to the future, the overwhelming concerns are the climate crisis and the destruction of our natural environment. Other priorities include: ensuring greater respect for human rights, settling conflicts, tackling poverty and reducing corruption.
Perceptions of the UN
·        Over 87% of respondents believe global cooperation is vital to deal with today’s challenges, and that the pandemic has made international cooperation more urgent.
·        Seventy-five years after its founding, six in 10 respondents believe the UN has made the world a better place. Looking to the future, 74% see the UN as “essential” in tackling the challenges.
·        However, respondents want the UN to change and innovate: to be more inclusive of the diversity of actors in the 21st century, and to become more transparent, accountable and effective.
“Across this anniversary year, we have engaged in a global conversation. And the results are striking.
People are thinking big – they are also expressing an intense yearning for international cooperation and global solidarity. Now is the time to respond to these aspirations and realize these aims. In this 75th anniversary year, we face our own 1945 moment. We must meet that moment. We must show unity like never before to overcome today’s emergency, get the world moving and working and prospering again, and uphold the vision of the Charter.” – United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres

This is the third kahriz that rehabilitation work started, now using the new technology. In total 26 wells for Heyvali kahriz will be drilled by a vertical auger drilling machine. This new technology makes it possible to achieve large drilling depths in a relatively short amount of time without labor needs.
Heyvali kahriz beneficiaries are all the IDPs from Banovshali settlement and community of Ahmadaghali village.
The four-year project aims to provide safe and consistent water supplies for over 8,000 families in rural areas of Aghdam, Aghjabedi, Barda, Fuzuli, Ganja, Gazakh, Goranboy and Goygol districts through the renovation of over 40 kahrizes – a man-made, centuries-old, traditional water-supply system that does not need electricity or fossil fuel to function. In addition to the renovating the kahrizes, the project has components that involve capacity building, business development and a strong engagement with academia.

Title: Scientists call for urgent, targeted action to avoid reversing the development gains of recent decades
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
12 September 2020
The Report, requested by all countries to evaluate progress on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, is the first of its kind since the landmark Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted four years ago. Entitled “The Future is Now: Science for Achieving Sustainable Development,” the report finds that the current development model is not sustainable, and the progress made in the last two decades is in danger of being reversed through worsening social inequalities and potentially irreversible declines in the natural environment that sustains us. The scientists concluded that a far more optimistic future is still attainable, but only by drastically changing development policies, incentives and actions.
The report argues that understanding the interconnections between the individual SDGs and the concrete systems that define society today will be essential to devise policies that manage difficult trade-offs.
The full report, “The Future is Now: Science for Achieving Sustainable Development,” can be found here: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/gsdr2019

Title: Global food prices rise in August
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
10 September 2020
Global food prices rose for the third consecutive month in August, influenced by generally firmer demand and a weaker U.S. dollar, according to a report released today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks the international prices of the most commonly traded food commodities, averaged 96.1 points in August, up 2.0 percent from the previous month and reaching its highest level since February 2020.
The FAO Cereal Price Index rose by 1.9 percent from July, averaging 7.0 percent above its value in August 2019, with coarse grains leading the rise. Sorghum prices rose 8.6 percent – and stood at 33.4 percent above their year-ago level, mostly on the back of strong import demand by China. Maize prices rose 2.2 percent amid concerns that recent crop damages in Iowa would impact supply. International rice prices also rose, underpinned by seasonally tight availabilities and increasing African demand.
The FAO Sugar Price Index rose by 6.7 percent from the previous month, reflecting reduced production prospects due to unfavorable weather conditions in the European Union and Thailand, the world’s second-largest sugar exporter, as well as strong import demand by China.
The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index increased by 5.9 percent, led by firmer values for palm oil especially, but also soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils.
The FAO Dairy Price Index was virtually unchanged from July, with cheese and whole milk powder quotations declining amid expectations of ample seasonal export availabilities in Oceania, while butter prices rose due to tightening export availabilities in Europe in the wake of the August heat wave reducing milk output.
The FAO Meat Price Index was also almost unchanged since July – although down 8.9 percent from August 2019 – as the effect of lower import demand for bovine, poultry and ovine meats was offset by surging import demand for pigmeat from China.
Updated cereals outlook
FAO also lowered its forecast for world cereal production in 2020 by 25 million tonnes from a July projection, due largely to expectations of a lower maize output in the United States of America. However, despite this reduction, such an outcome would still represent an all-time high, amounting to 58 million tonnes above the 2019 output.
Record maize harvests are forecast for Argentina and Brazil, while global sorghum production is expected to grow by 6 percent from the previous year. Worldwide rice production in 2020 is also expected to reach a new record of 509 million tonnes.
More detailed assessments are available in the Cereal Supply and Demand Brief, also released today.
FAO’s new forecast for world cereal utilization in 2020/21 stands at 2 764 million tonnes, up 2.0 percent on an annualized basis.

Global cereal stocks are projected to rise by 1.7 percent to 895.5 million tonnes by close of the 2021 seasons, translating to a world cereal stocks-to-use ratio of 31.8 percent, slightly down from July but still relatively high from a historical perspective.
Buoyed by expected larger shipments of rice and coarse grains, world trade in cereals in 2020/21 is now pegged at 441.4 million tonnes, 1.6 percent above the 2019/20 level.

Title: EU and WHO deliver medical supplies to patients with COVID-19
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
07 September 2020
The equipment was procured by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, with funding from the EU, through the Solidarity for Health Initiative.
Oxygen concentrators are a non-invasive way of providing oxygen to patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Such supplemental oxygen is the first essential step for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with low blood oxygen levels and should be a primary focus for treatment.
The pulse oximeters supplied will help monitor patients by measuring their blood oxygen levels.
“As a part of Team Europe, the EU program “Solidarity for Health Initiative” continues to support the health system of our partner country Azerbaijan, first, through delivery of personal protective equipment, and now with essential medical devices which will help to save lives”, said Kestutis Jankauskas, Head of the EU Delegation to Azerbaijan.
“We are very pleased that with the Solidarity for Health Initiative we are contributing to the national efforts of and hopefully, making a difference in Azerbaijan”, said Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative in Azerbaijan. “Such equipment is crucial in preventing serious disease and deaths in people who need oxygen therapy. Providing appropriate care in hospitals is extremely important while we try our best to prevent transmission of the disease within the communities.”
“We are grateful to our partners to receive the best type of oxygen concentrators and pulse oximeters”, said Rahim Aliyev, Deputy Minister of Health. “These supplies from the EU and WHO to Azerbaijan will be used to treat severely ill patients with respiratory distress at designated COVID-19 treatment health-care facilities”.
In the first phase of the project, the PPEs were delivered 86 healthcare facilities in Baku and regions to help enable health-care workers in Azerbaijan to respond effectively and safely to the COVID-19 pandemic. EU and WHO also organized 8 face-to-face and 7 online training sessions for health care professionals, who will in turn train more health care workers on the latest methods in managing and supporting COVID-19 patients.
The donation of these critical supplies is part of the European Union’s response to the outbreak of COVID-19, currently affecting more than 216 countries and territories. On 27 March 2020, the European Union announced an assistance package of €30 million to help prevent, detect and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in six countries of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, including Azerbaijan.
The funds are being used initially to meet immediate emergency needs, such as procuring essential supplies and training for health-care workers and frontline responders. In the longer term, the assistance will go towards strengthening the country’s capacity to respond to public health emergencies.
The project builds upon the European Union’s and WHO’s ongoing support to Azerbaijan.

07 September 2020
The four-year project, funded by the EU and implemented by UNDP, will support the State Agency on Vocational Education in modernizing VET institutions to deliver competence-based training that is tailored to the current needs of the labour market.
“The EU is continuously supporting Azerbaijan to move to a new economic structure driven by a diversified, efficient and innovative non-oil sector,” explains EU Ambassador to Azerbaijan Kestutis Jankauskas, “A skilled and competent workforce is critical to achieving this goal.”
The new project aims to promote innovation and update the infrastructure and equipment of seven selected providers of vocational education, as well as to help develop the capacities of all VET providers throughout Azerbaijan. More than 5,000 students will directly benefit from the modernisation of these institutions.
The project will also cover several different areas, such as career guidance services, skills development through digitalization, cooperation with the private sector and the procurement of equipment and supplies to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19.
The Director of the State Agency on Vocational Education, Parviz Yusifov, stressed the importance of the partnership: “This initiative will help create a sustainable platform for collaboration, bringing together all key stakeholders to change the attitude and the discourse around vocational education and provide market-driven and future-focused changes in education provision.”
UNDP’s Resident Representative Alessandro Fracassetti added: “Ensuring quality education will prepare Azerbaijan’s skilled youth for the future of work and will contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by promoting inclusive and quality learning opportunities for all.”
This project is fully funded by the EU under its ‘Education for Employment’ Programme.

In order to ensure the safe work of employees, the temperature of employees and visitors entering the premises is checked, the recommendations and rules of the World Health Organization on COVID-19, hygiene procedures are followed, protective equipment such as masks, gloves, hand sanitizers are used.
From the beginning of the current year to the end of July, the IOM Azerbaijan provided 185 in-kind assistance to returnees within the framework of the AVRR project. Of them, 24 returnees were provided with temporary housing (rent), 30 returnees were assisted with small business, 120 returnees received material assistance (equipment and necessary furniture), 10 returnees received medical assistance and 1 returnee was assisted with education.
Kheyyam (pseudonym) is one of the Azerbaijani citizens who voluntarily returned from Switzerland within the above mentioned project implemented by IOM Azerbaijan. He returned to Azerbaijan with his family in February this year. According to him, he worked before emigrating abroad and did not face any financial difficulties. “There is a such stereotype that people migrate to other countries for a better life. In fact, there are enough people among migrants who go abroad for treatment. I was one of them. I worked as an engineer and head of department for a long time. The reason I went abroad was not money. We lived in Switzerland for 2 years. Living expenses were high and incomes were low. My income was not enough not only for treatment, but also for our normal life”, says Kheyyam.
In addition to all these difficulties, homesickness made him think of returning to Azerbaijan.
“As soon as we received information from friends about the Voluntary Return Assistance and Reintegration project, we immediately applied to the local office of the organization. In addition to reimbursing our family’s repatriation expenses, the IOM provided counseling and reintegration assistance through the Mission in Azerbaijan. The staff of the local office explained the necessary steps and legislation to start my business, and provided comprehensive assistance. With the help of the IOM Azerbaijan, I bought a car to satr my business. At present, I support my family by providing taxi services to people.
Thank God I am in my homeland. I hadn’t seen other countries,  it was interesting for me. I went and saw. It is better to live in your homeland,” says Kheyyam.
Currently, IOM Azerbaijan provides its assistance activities for migrants returned from Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Latvia. One of the main parts of reintegration assistance besides educational activities, temporary housing, is employment or setting-up income-generating activity, e.g., small business for voluntarily returned migrants.

Title: UNHCR Report: Coronavirus a dire threat to refugee education – half of the world’s refugee children out of school
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 September 2020
While children in every country have struggled with the impact of COVID-19 on their education, the report finds that refugee children have been particularly disadvantaged. Before the pandemic, a refugee child was twice as likely to be out of school as a non-refugee child. This is set to worsen – many may not have opportunities to resume their studies due to school closures, difficulties affording fees, uniforms or books, lack of access to technologies or because they are being required to work to support their families.
“Half of the world’s refugee children were already out of school,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. “After everything they have endured, we cannot rob them of their futures by denying them an education today. Despite the enormous challenges posed by the pandemic, with greater international support to refugees and their host communities, we can expand innovative ways to protect the critical gains made in refugee education over the past years.”
Without greater support, steady, hard-won increases in school, university, and technical and vocational education enrolment could be reversed – in some cases permanently – potentially jeopardizing efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4 of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all.
The 2019 data in the report is based on reporting from twelve countries hosting more than half of the world’s refugee children. While there is 77% gross enrolment in primary school, only 31% of youth are enrolled in secondary school. At the level of higher education, only 3% of refugee youth are enrolled.
Far behind global averages, these statistics nevertheless do represent progress. Enrolment in secondary education rose with tens of thousands of refugee children newly attending school; a 2% increase in 2019 alone. However, the COVID-19 pandemic now threatens to undo this and other crucial advances. For refugee girls, the threat is particularly grave.
Adapting to the limitations imposed by COVID-19 has been especially tough for the 85% of the world’s refugees who live in developing or least developed countries. Mobile phones, tablets, laptops, connectivity, even radio sets are often not readily available to displaced communities.
UNHCR, governments, and partners are working tirelessly to bridge critical gaps and ensure the continuity of refugee education during the pandemic through connected learning, television and radio, and by supporting teachers and caregivers to engage with students while observing health guidelines.
The report calls on governments, the private sector, civil society and other key stakeholders to join forces to find solutions which strengthen national education systems and link with pathways towards certified education, and to secure and safeguard education financing. Without such action, the report warns, we risk a lost generation of refugee children deprived of their education.
The risks to refugee education do not stop with COVID-19. Attacks on schools are a grim and growing reality. The report focuses on Africa’s Sahel region where violence has forced the closure of more than 2,500 schools affecting the education of 350,000 students.

Title: A five-year strategy is being developed to strengthen agricultural advisory services in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 September 2020
The project will also develop and recommend Agricultural Advisory Services models in two pilot regions - Ganja-Gazakh and Guba-Khachmaz. At the second steering committee meeting of the project, overall progress on the project implementation, the results of the regional agricultural mapping and survey assessment, challenges faced due to COVID 19 and work plan revisions were presented.
"It is very important that the works to be done within the "Strengthening of Agricultural Advisory Services" project, launched as part of the work of the Azerbaijani government for the development of the agricultural sector, will be sustainable and long-lasting," said Rainer Freund, Program Manager of the EU Delegation to Azerbaijan. "The pilot agricultural services models to be developed under the project will be able to show what the future models will look like in the country," Mr. Freund emphasized.
Head of FAO Partnership and Liaison Office in Azerbaijan, Malak Cakmak, noted that the draft law on agricultural advisory services should benefit from the recommendations and results of the "Strengthening of Agricultural Advisory Services" project. "We should try to ensure that our recommendations on the implementation of agricultural advisory services are reflected in the legislation. If the Ministry of Agriculture benefits from the results and conclusions of the project, we can talk about the sustainability of our project," said Ms. Cakmak.
Yagub Guliyev, a leading specialist in the Public Information and International Relations Department of the Agrarian Science and Innovation Center, said that they expect the project to create a system for agricultural advisory services in Azerbaijan in accordance with local conditions. “One of the most important issues is to establish contacts between agrarian advisers in Azerbaijan. This will provide an effective agrarian advisory service," Yagub Guliyev said.
The results of surveys among more than 700 farmers in two pilot regions, as well as in Lankaran Economic Region, which was selected as the focus region were presented to the Steering Committee. It was noted that the models of agrarian advisory services in developed countries will be adapted to local conditions in accordance with the results of these surveys when they selected as pilot AAS models.
The meeting was concluded and the PSC members accepted the report on the project implementation and agreed on the recommended steps for the further project implementation.

Title: IOM Azerbaijan supports protection measures against COVID-19 among vulnerable communities
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
02 September 2020
As part of IOM Azerbaijan and KOICA’s effort to support the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 and encourage the communities to participate basic prevention measures, IOM Azerbaijan started distributing the COVID-19 prevention posters in Banovshalar and Sharov villages located in Aghdam and Goranboy districts. The purpose is to raise awareness of COVID-19 and to be equipped with the necessary and accurate information on how to keep community members and their family healthy and safe. The message includes the general information on COVID-19, the importance of hand washing, countering discrimination and xenophobia, and how to use and dispose face masks.
Alongside with the distribution of the COVID-19 posters, the COVID-19 prevention training and sanitation items (disposable masks and hand sanitizers) are planning to be provided to the beneficiaries in 40 communities in 8 project target areas, once the government lockdown measures are eased and the community trainings are resumed. In the meantime, the soft copies of the COVID-19 posters were distributed to the Water User Committee (WUC) members and local authorities via Internet.
The above mentioned four-year project aims to provide safe and consistent water supplies for over 8,000 families in rural areas of Aghdam, Aghjabedi, Barda, Fuzuli, Ganja, Gazakh, Goranboy and Goygol districts through the renovation of over 40 kahrizes – a man-made, centuries-old, traditional water-supply system that does not need electricity or fossil fuel to function. In addition to the renovating the kahrizes, the project has components that involve capacity building, business development and a strong engagement with academia.

Title: IOM Azerbaijan assists stranded migrants due to COVID-19 to return homeland
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
31 August 2020
A group leader of the Sri Lankan migrants, Anuruddha Pathirathne said that after they had spent their last money on flight tickets they found out that only passengers with a certificate of negative COVID-19 test result issued within 48 hours before departure are allowed to board the flight. “These people are students of local universities and their family members. Since these people had to remain at home during quarantine regime for four months, and those who earned money could not go to work, most of their financial status were in dire state. That’s why they could not cover PCR test at their own expense,” says Pathirathne.
Therefore, they turned to the local IOM Mission for help.
“The situation was worsened by the fact that Sri Lanka does not have an embassy in Azerbaijan to help them. It was necessary to conduct PCR tests and sort out immigration matters for Sri Lankans in a short time prior to the departure, since many had already bought flight tickets, and without certificates they would not have been allowed on board,” says Ilyas Nabiyev, Project Coordinator.
After the appeal from the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Iran, the IOM Azerbaijan got agreement with one of the local clinics to conduct PCR tests and receive the results within some hours, since the next day the migrants had to fly away.
“We managed to collect all the migrants who applied to us the day before departure and with the help of local medics conducted PCR tests. Having received the results in the evening of the same day, we went to the airport where migrants, who had tickets for a plane that would take off in a few hours were waiting for us,” says Nabiyev.
Medical certificates confirming negative COVID-19 test results, Personal Protective Equipment, - i.e., face masks and gloves were delivered to the migrants by IOM Azerbaijan employees at the airport before their departure.
“Thanks to the well-coordinated work of the mission staff all the migrants safely fly back to their homeland,” said Pathirathne, a migrant from Sri Lanka.
The assistance was delivered to the Sir-Lankan citizens in the frame the regional project on humanitarian assistance to stranded, vulnerable migrants (foreign nationals) in the South Caucasian countries funded by the United States Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM). The project corresponds with four pillars of the IOM’s Global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan and the associated IOM South Caucasus Appeal: Tracking Mobility Impacts of COVID-19, Risk Communication, and Community Engagement (RCCE), Logistics, Procurement, and Supply Management, and Protection.

24 August 2020
Over 200 submissions were received on Azerbaijan’s first upcycling platform, launched this World Environment Day, with the aim to encourage more people to upcycle products they’d normally throw away.
“Ozun Yarat has brought together hundreds of people to promote upcycling through creative and amazing solutions. These upcycled solutions gave a new life to waste. These solutions are both economically viable and they help protect the environment”, said Deputy Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources, Firdovsi Aliyev.
“The Ozun Yarat platform was launched with the help of the EU two months ago to encourage people to share creative ways of upcycling objects to reduce harmful waste and conserve the environment. The response has been fantastic, with over 200 imaginative contributions received so far, showing the remarkable talents of the people of Azerbaijan in arts and crafts and their strong commitment to protecting nature. The message of this project is that change starts from home, meaning that each and every one of us should lead by example in caring for our natural environment”, said EU Ambassador to Azerbaijan Kestutis Jankauskas.
“The COVID-19 lockdown has been extremely stressful for many millions of people. At the same time these difficult circumstances have presented an opportunity for learning new skills and making our own personal contributions to helping build back better and greener from home. We each need to do more to help pave the way to a sustainable future. And we can do this by turning towards a circular economy in which products are made, used and then upcycled and reused. The creativity and skills of young Azerbaijanis displayed on the Ozun Yarat site are truly inspiring.”, said UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, Charu Bist.
A jury composed of experts and development professionals reviewed all submissions.
The first prize (3,000 AZN) was awarded to Leyla Mammadova for her “Plastic bags” project, which aims to provide a sustainable solution to the plastic pollution challenge.
The second prize (2,000 AZN) was awarded to Said Aliyev for making a portable barbecue case out of scrap metal.
The third prize (1,000 AZN) was awarded to Kamran Gasimzade for using an old metal barrel to create a colourful sink that can be used in any home.

Title: “The agrarian advisory service must be accountable. The field of farmers is not an experimental site”

20 August 2020
The international expert gave information on the models of state, public-private partnership, farmers’ associations, and private agrarian advisory services in the seminar attended by representatives of the State Agrarian Development Center, the Agrarian Science and Innovation Center, suppliers, agrarian consultants and farmers. As successful models of the countries of the European Union and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, she focused in detail on the examples of the Netherlands, which is run by farmers’ associations and Denmark which is completely private. However, she noted that it is not right to “import” any model of agricultural advisory services into the country as it is.
Yagub Guliyev, the senior specialist of the Agrarian Science and Innovation Center (ASIC), said that the main problem was the lack of accountability in the provision of agrarian advisory services. “The field of farmers is not an experimental site. It should be clarified how each piece of advice affects productivity,” said the ASIC representative. Noting that this situation is particularly affecting farmers who benefit from the advice of pest control agents, the senior expert cited the quality of pesticides as another problem.
The seminar participants were informed about the draft law on the provision of agricultural services in Azerbaijan.
Farmers who participated in the workshop spoke about the difficulties they face when seeking agricultural advisory services.
It should be noted that the project “Strengthening Agrarian Advisory Services” is implemented with the financial support of the European Union. The 2-year project will implement sub-projects to provide agrarian advisory services to farmers in pilot areas. The project will study the agrarian services needed by farmers in these regions, the appropriate methods to obtain these services, and test appropriate models of European countries by applying the opportunities of public-private partnerships. The main goal is to form an adequate agricultural advisory strategy through strengthening the system of advisory services for increasing agricultural productivity and sustainable rural development.

07 August 2020
Bariz Mehdiyev, Assistant FAO Representative, FAO Partnership and Liaison Office in the Republic of Azerbaijan, told about the goals of the project “Development of sustainable and inclusive agri-food systems in the north-western region of Azerbaijan” at the first meeting of the partners.
Rainer Freund, Program Manager of the EU Delegation to the Republic of Azerbaijan, thanked all the partners involved in the development of the project. “Azerbaijan has an incredible richness of agro-ecological areas, different climate conditions, and agricultural products. The tradition of processing local specialties from these products is going on. This diversity, which has been preserved for decades, perhaps centuries, in the European Union and other places, is being used as an advantage, and leads to develop market access of local products and strengthen the competitive environment. ”said Mr. Rainer Freund.
Firdovsi Fikretzadeh, the director of the Agrarian Research Center of the Agriculture Ministry, one of the main partners of the project, spoke about the impact of the new project on the welfare of farmers in the affected areas. Mr. Fikretzadeh said that unlike value-added products, which were harvested from the field, value-added products would bring more income to the villagers. “The project will allow us to create not only several value chains but also a system of value chains,” said the director of the ARC.
Yusif Akhundov, Project Manager, said that value chains will be created for 6 selected food products and market access for the products will be organized. The project manager added that a partnership of several public and private organizations will be established to find a market for the products.
Representatives of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Azerbaijan, several international projects, non-governmental organizations, farmers’ associations, and private organizations have attended to the meeting. Speakers informed about the steps to be taken to provide consulting services to farmers, innovative platforms to be created, and mentioned international examples.
The “Development of sustainable and inclusive local agri-food systems in north-west region of Azerbaijan” project is financed by the European Union and implemented Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Title: Improved testing, contact tracing and data management: WHO revealed key recommendations to Azerbaijan COVID-19 response
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
31 July 2020
“This week marks six months since WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. The timing for this mission allowed to reflect on the experience of the pandemic response in Azerbaijan from epidemiological, clinical and communication perspectives and to see how we can build on this valuable knowledge in the coming months”, said Dr Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative/Head of Country Office.
The WHO experts acknowledged the achievements of Azerbaijan in the course of the COVID-19 response including the substantial financial and human resource investments, extensive use of the digital tools for surveillance and public communications, and improvement of care of the patients with COVID-19.
“We observed significant progress in the COVID-19 pandemic response in Azerbaijan. The previous WHO mission held in March developed fifty-eight recommendations, approximately two-thirds of which were fully or partially implemented”, said Dr David Novillo Ortiz, WHO mission team lead, Unit Head Health Information at WHO/Europe. “As the pandemic evolves, new challenges arise. Improvement of the surveillance, testing strategy and thorough data analysis will help to take evidence-based decisions, including implementation of public health measures.”
Within the mission, WHO/Europe experts in epidemiology and surveillance, data management, health facility management and risk communications worked together with the national health authorities and local experts to assess the progress and identify areas for improvement in the country’s response mechanisms. The specialists visited primary health care centres and hospitals in Baku as well as Shamakhi and Ganja regions to make observations and gain insights.
Strengthening health partnerships for better preparedness and response
In addition to the provision of technical assistance through two COVID-19 response missions, WHO/Euro and WHO Country Office in Azerbaijan implemented the REACT-C19 – an initiative to exchange expertise between health care workers, use innovative solutions and digital platforms, and strengthen the hospital response to COVID-19. WHO CO is also implementing the EU-funded “Solidarity for Health Initiative” project which supplies PPEs to frontline responders in health care facilities and provides technical assistance to the government.

Title: “Strengthening of Agricultural Advisory Services” Project presents ongoing activities in the regions of Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
09 July 2020
This activity started in June 2020, aiming to cover five districts in the country identified by the country authorities. In July 2020, the assessment survey is planned to be conducted for the farmers, service providers, and other stakeholders in Guba, Khachmaz, and Lankaran regions.
The assessment surveys have already conducted in Samukh, Kurdamir, and Ismayilli districts in June 2020 with the involvement of the volunteers/surveyors in the regions.
Mr. Fariz Alakbarov, the Local Short Term Consultant of the project, organized a training program for the volunteers and selected the potential surveyors among the trained volunteers through interviewing in the target regions. The purpose of the training was to explain to them the methodology of the interviews and surveys and increase their professionalism for the collection of accurate information and to start the survey on the assessment for the farmers, service providers and other stakeholders according to the objective to see the problems of the agricultural advisory services in Azerbaijan.
Due to the quarantine restrictions and limits on movements inside the country, it has been decided that Mr. Alakbarov conducts assessment training, interviews with the volunteers/surveyors, and farmers through the online Zoom Programme in those restricted regions. In addition, the discussion WhatsApp groups have been set up for answers to the frequently asked questions and clarifications needed during the survey.
With the support of the Agrarian Science and Innovation Centre (ASIC) under the Ministry of Agriculture of Azerbaijan, and in close cooperation with their regional branches as well as with SADCs the participants involved in the survey have been selected. Accordingly, they have been informed about the project structure, main objectives of the assignment, the importance of the extension services, methods of the data collection, recommended practices to become good interviewer/surveyors, their responsibility regarding the assignment, a methodology to fill the questionnaires for extension providers and producers.
The ongoing surveys show that there is a need for the improvement of the agricultural advisory services in Azerbaijan to build a strong mechanism for receiving inquires, and feedback of the target groups for further development. The preliminary results of the survey demonstrate the necessity to improve the links between public and private sectors, raise the awareness on the AAS services among farmers in particular in remotes areas, and strengthen the cooperation of SADCs with all types of extension providers. In addition, the FAO AZE office in close cooperation with the providers’ regular support and help to the conduction of the survey in spite of specific challenging conditions raise by the COVID -19.
The achieved results will show the need for extension services for the farmers and improvement necessities of the AAS sector in Azerbaijan for reliable access by farmers to quality services.  The report will show the development mechanism for the regulation of the relations between extension providers and clients. More detailed information about the current situation of the AAS sector will be described in the country assessment report.

Within the project, 1185 attendances of health workers in trainings were achieved in total in a variety of subjects including management of severe COVID patients, interpretation of COVID laboratory results, etc. The project facilitated the establishment of  Infection Control Committees in 5 hospitals, setting an example for others to follow.
The Hospital Readiness Checklist of WHO implemented from the onset as a component of monitoring and evaluation of hospitals resulted in significant improvements especially in strengthening infection prevention and control measures, management of patients, surveillance and incident management across a majority of hospitals in the project. The bottlenecks and barriers to improvement were reported systematically to authorities together with recommendations.
In addition to supporting readiness in 12 hospitals, a Training Center was established within the New Clinic. Between 12-30 June, 119 healthcare workers participated in the trainings on how to protect themselves from COVID-19.
REACT-C19 project resulted in the strengthening of collaboration among WHO, Heydar Aliyev Foundation, State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance, TABIB and the Ministry of Health as well as other institutions such as Azerbaijan Medical University, Public Health, and Reform Center and Azerbaijan State Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education with special emphasis on building human resources capacity through targeted trainings.
As the REACT-C19 project closes, many of the project consultant doctors decided to stay in Azerbaijan for some more time to continue to support the country.
About REACT-C19 project

Title: Global food commodity prices rebound in June
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 July 2020
FAO expects new record-high global cereal production and comfortable stock levels for 2020/21, while food assistance needs up
The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks international prices of the most traded food commodities, averaged 93.2 points in June, some 2.4 percent higher than the previous month.
Effective from July 2020, the price coverage of the Food Price Index has been expanded and its base period revised from 2002– 2004 to 2014-2016. For more details on this revision, see the feature article published in the June 2020 issue of the FAO Food Outlook. A November 2013 article contains technical background on the previous construction of the Index.
The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index gained 11.3 percent in June, after declining for four consecutive months. The rebound mainly reflects a sharp rise in palm oil prices due to recovering global import demand, following the easing of COVID-19 related lockdowns in a number of countries, and concerns over possible production setbacks amid prolonged migrant labour shortages. Price quotations of soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils also went up.
The FAO Sugar Price Index climbed 10.6 percent in June from the previous month. The surge in crude oil prices provided strong support to sugar markets, encouraging Brazil’s sugar mills to use more sugarcane supplies to produce ethanol instead of sugar, thereby affecting sugar export availabilities and prices.
The FAO Dairy Price Index rose by 4.0 percent from May, marking the first increase after four months of successive declines. Renewed import demand for spot supplies, especially from the Middle East and East Asia, coupled with seasonally declining supplies in Europe and limited availability of uncommitted supplies in Oceania, underpinned the recent price increases.
The FAO Cereal Price Index declined 0.6 percent from May. Downward pressure on wheat prices in June was in part due to new harvests in the northern hemisphere and improved production prospects in a number of major exporting countries, including the Black Sea region.
The FAO Meat Price Index fell 0.6 percent from May, averaging 6.0 percent below its June 2019 value. Bovine meat and poultry price quotations fell, largely due to increased export availabilities in major producing regions, whereas pig meat prices registered a small increase, mostly in Europe, on expectation of the further easing of COVID-19 market restrictions.
Record global cereal production to boost stocks
World cereal production is poised to reach a new record level of 2 790 million tonnes in 2020 – up 9.3 million tonnes from the May forecast – surpassing the record-high registered in 2019 by as much as 3.0 percent, according to FAO’s Cereal Supply and Demand Brief, also released today.
Wheat production forecasts have been raised for India and the Russian Federation, more than offsetting a cutback to the EU and the UK expected outputs.
The forecast of world coarse grains production in 2020 has also been revised up to 1 519 million tonnes, up 5.7 million tonnes from the previous month, reflecting expectations of larger outputs of barley in Australia, the EU and Turkey.
FAO’s global rice production forecast for 2020 is now pegged at 509.2 million tonnes, 400 000 tonnes above June’s figure, primarily reflecting improved prospects for South American countries, where conducive weather raised yield expectations to all time-highs.
World cereal utilization in the year ahead is forecast to rise to 2 735 million tonnes – 1.6 percent up from the previous month’s forecast, mostly driven by an upturn in feed and industrial uses of coarse grains compared to earlier expectations. World rice utilization is also predicted to reach a fresh peak of 510.4 million tonnes in 2020/21, 1.6 percent up from June, based on expanding food use.
Reflecting new production and consumption forecasts, FAO now expects world cereal stocks by the end of seasons in 2021 to reach 929 million tonnes, representing a robust year-on-year expansion of 6.0 percent. This would drive the global cereal stock-to-use ratio in 2020/21 to a twenty-year high of 33.0 percent, highlighting the comfortable global supply prospects in the new season.
Food assistance needs to grow as pandemic hits incomes
While conflicts and weather shocks remain critical factors underpinning the high levels of severe food insecurity in countries requiring external assistance for food, the COVID-19 pandemic is also having wide-ranging and severe effects, particularly through the loss of income, according to the quarterly Crop Prospects and Food Situation report, also published today.
The report offers a special feature with regional roundups of the pandemic’s impacts.
Despite these issues, the global cereal harvest is on track for growth in all regions, except for Europe. Cereal production in Africa in 2020 is projected to increase by 1.0 percent, although declines are expected in northern, western and central regions of the continent.
FAO’s forecast for the aggregate cereal output of Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries in the 2020/21 season stands at 492.7 million tonnes, which is 6.0 percent above the average and would mark a fifth consecutive annual production increase. However, populations are growing even faster and the overall cereal import requirement for LIFDCs is estimated at 73.4 milion tonnes, up around 5 percent from the previous year, which also reflects production downturns in several countries.

Title: Confronting the silent and endemic crisis of harmful practices
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 July 2020
Urgent, accelerated action needed to stop female genital mutilation, child marriage, and other practices that harm women and girls, according to new UNFPA report
At least 19 harmful practices, ranging from breast ironing to virginity testing, are considered human rights violations, according to the UNFPA report, which focuses on the three most prevalent ones: female genital mutilation, child marriage, and extreme bias against daughters in favour of sons.
“Harmful practices against girls cause profound and lasting trauma, robbing them of their right to reach their full potential,” says UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem.
This year, an estimated 4.1 million girls will be subjected to female genital mutilation. Today, 33,000 girls under age 18 will be forced into marriages, usually to much older men. Also, an extreme preference for sons over daughters in some countries has fueled gender-biased sex selection or extreme neglect that leads to their death as children, resulting in 140 million “missing females.”
In the Eastern Europe and Central Asia, child marriage is generally illegal and on the decline overall, but is still practiced widely in parts of the region (up to 15% of women were married before they turned 18 in some countries; and in some communities one in two women was married as a child).
Son preference also remains common in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region, resulting in heavily imbalanced sex-at-birth ratios in parts of the South Caucasus and South-East Europe, as many more boys are born there than girls.
Countries that have ratified international treaties such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child have a duty to end the harm. Many have responded with laws, but laws alone are not enough.
Decades of experience and research show that bottom-up, grassroots approaches are better at bringing change, the UNFPA report states.
“These harmful practices have one root cause in common: the widespread and persistent under-valuing of girls and women,” says Alanna Armitage, UNFPA Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. “But we are seeing that social norms are shifting in the right direction, and there is a real chance that working together – governments, civil society, influencers and role models – we can make practices harming girls a thing of the past.”
Programmes to change discriminatory social norms are effective in eliminating harmful practices, but they must not focus narrowly on just these practices. Rather, they should address the broader issues at play, including the subordinate position of women and girls, their human rights, and how to elevate their status and access to opportunities, the report says.
Globally, ending child marriage and female genital mutilation worldwide is possible within 10 years by scaling up efforts to keep girls in school longer and teach them life skills and to engage men and boys in social change. Investments totaling $3.4 billion a year through 2030 would end these two harmful practices and end the suffering of an estimated 84 million girls, the report shows.
While progress has been made in ending some harmful practices worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to reverse gains. A recent analysis revealed that if services and programmes remain shuttered for six months, an additional 13 million girls may be forced into marriage and 2 million more girls may be subjected to female genital mutilation between now and 2030.
The pandemic may increase the risk of forced early marriage as a strategy to reduce the economic burdens in the family. And lockdowns, school closures and movement restrictions are disrupting adolescent girls’ routines and their support systems.
“The pandemic puts more girls at risk and threatens to undermine the progress we’ve made,” Armitage says. “We must redouble our efforts to ensure that girls everywhere are fully able to enjoy their rights, make choices about their lives and their bodies.”

Title: Statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Azerbaijan on changes in its refugee status determination procedure as of 1 July 2020
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 July 2020
Therefore, persons who will lodge an asylum application on or after 1 July 2020 will have their applications assessed only by the State Migration Service and national courts, but no longer by UNHCR. Similarly, UNHCR will not be issuing Protection Letters to new asylum-seekers who lodge asylum application in Azerbaijan on or after 1 July 2020. This measure will have no negative or retroactive effect in terms of registration or documentation with UNHCR for those asylum-seekers who have applied for asylum in Azerbaijan before 1 July 2020. UNHCR will otherwise continue its regular protection and assistance activities for persons of concern, within the limits of the financial resources at its disposal.
Over the past years, as a result of fruitful cooperation, technical support and capacity development activities, there have been a number of positive developments in the national asylum procedure in line with international standards that further emphasize the Government’s primary role in protecting and securing durable solutions for refugees. However, the process of bringing Azerbaijan’s asylum system in line with international standards is not yet over as additional measures need to be made by the Azerbaijani authorities to ensure adequate protection space in the country for those fleeing conflicts and persecution in other countries.
UNHCR stands ready to further strengthen existing cooperation with the Government of Azerbaijan in the above mentioned areas and will continue its support in tackling problems of people of concern to the organization.

Title: The European Union and WHO deliver critical supplies to the COVID-19 frontline in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 June 2020
The delivery of 168 000 personal protective equipment, funded by the European Union and procured by WHO, includes 10 000 face shields, 10 000 protective goggles, 8000 isolation gowns, 140 000 respirators. All items of equipment delivered have been checked to ensure they meet quality and safety standards for health-care workers on the frontline.
Kestutis Jankauskas, Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Azerbaijan, and Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative in Azerbaijan handed over the equipment to the Ministry of Health as part of a larger assistance package to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
“Now is the time for international solidarity and leadership, not isolation. The European Union and its Member States, acting together as ‘Team Europe’ are helping to prevent, detect and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to strengthen the EU’s Eastern neighbourhood’s resilience and capacity to respond to public health emergencies”, stated Kestutis Jankauskas, Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Azerbaijan.
"As COVID-19 does not recognize borders, the fight against it must be based on the principles of solidarity, mutual assistance, and the use of positive experience, and it should not limit with borders.
On behalf of the Ministry of Health, I thank the officials of the European Union and the World Health Organization and the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and express my unequivocal confidence that the protection of human health is the noblest work,” said Deputy Health Minister Rahim Aliyev.
The Ministry of Health will ensure the supplies are distributed to medical facilities across the country.
Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative and Head of Country Office in Azerbaijan, said: “Health-care workers are at the frontline of our response to COVID-19, placing them at higher risk of exposure to the virus. They are our heroes, but they are not superhuman.
“The delivery of this protective equipment, made possible thanks to the generous contribution of the European Union, will go far in reducing the risk health-care workers in our country face in their daily work and help protect them, patients and vulnerable people from this virus,” she added.
The donation of the personal protective equipment is part of the European Union’s response to the outbreak of COVID-19, currently affecting more than 188 countries and territories. On 27 March 2020, the European Union announced an assistance package of €30 million to help prevent, detect and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in six countries of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, including Azerbaijan.
The funds initially will be used to meet immediate emergency needs, such as procuring essential supplies and training for health-care workers and frontline responders. In the longer term, the assistance will go towards strengthening the country’s capacity to respond to public health emergencies.
The project builds upon the European Union’s and WHO’s ongoing support to Azerbaijan.

Title: FAO – Azerbaijan Partnership Programme – Inception Workshop – Catalyzing the efficiency and sustainability of hazelnut sector
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
23 June 2020
The main goal of the project is to empower smallholder farmers to adopt Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) to increase production efficiency of hazelnut, with adapted mechanization technologies and services and to increase the quality of nuts produced, with a specific focus on reducing the risk of aflatoxin contamination. “I would like perhaps to highlight the importance of working with different stakeholders on the hazelnut sector, including small and medium farmers and allowing them to feel ownership throughout the project implementation to ensure sustainability in the long term. The project will be a collective effort to enhance the quality and productivity of hazelnut production to improve the livelihoods of farmers in the field.”-said Mayling Flores Rojas, Expert on agricultural mechanization systems. The project empower newly established Government institutes and state agencies while linking to private sector actors. All the outputs and activities are designed to achieve the development of the capacities of actors in the sector for sustainable improvement of hazelnut production. FAO’s technical capacity in crop production and protection, genetic resources conservation, mechanization, remote sensing mapping, bioenergy, monitoring, and evaluation all play an important role in providing the right support. “The goal is to improve the productivity and quality of hazelnuts and increase incomes, business opportunities, social equity, and environmental protection. The success of the project will be guaranteed through active partnerships between technical, government agencies, and the private sector and will be governed by a National Technical Committee”-said Fenton Beed, Senior Agricultural Officer at FAO HQ.
Azerbaijan is one of the world’s top five hazelnut producers (along with Turkey, Italy, the United States of America, and Georgia). The total production of hazelnuts in 2018 was 52,000 metric tons (FAOSTAT) and recent years have experienced significant support from Government incentives (including for land, seedlings, fertilizer, machinery, and export revenue returns). Azerbaijan predominantly exported raw hazelnuts to low-profit markets such as Russia. Improvements in the hazelnut sector have a great potential to sustainably increase the quantity and quality of Azerbaijan’s hazelnut production and export, contributing to the goal of diversification of the economy.
To address the challenges described above the project “Catalyzing the efficiency and sustainability of Azerbaijan’s hazelnut sector” (HAZER) was developed under the FAO-Azerbaijan Partnership Programme (FAPP) with the Ministry of Agriculture of Azerbaijan.

Title: Joint Statement by State Migration Service and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on access to labour market for refugees
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
19 June 2020
Facilitation of legal employment and access to labour market for refugees was an important pledge made by the Azerbaijani delegation at the Global Refugee Forum which took place in December 2019 and was a true milestone in building solidarity with the world’s refugees and the countries and communities that host them. During the months following the Global Refugee Forum, the State Migration Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan engaged with the Ministry of Labour and other state entities in order to ensure the implementation of the pledge. A great achievement on the eve of World Refugee Day, marked on 20 June is that refugees and asylum-seekers in Azerbaijan can now apply for individual identification numbers and have their labour contracts registered.
“The Government of Azerbaijan has taken significant steps in order to facilitate legal employment and to improve access to the legal labour market for asylum seekers and refugees under the UNHCR protection, and recent arrangement of State Migration Service in cooperation with Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population fully ensured the labour rights of these people” said Vusal Huseynov, Chief of the State Migration Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
“Fortunately, the Government is now addressing the issue of access to legal employment which will allow these refugees to become self-sufficient and pay taxes instead of relying only informal employment and humanitarian assistance. This will be a major step forward on the road to inclusion and integration,” said Guido Ambroso, UNHCR Representative in the Republic of Azerbaijan.
As a result of fruitful cooperation, technical support and capacity development activities, over the past years, there have been a number of positive developments in the national asylum procedure in line with international standards that further emphasize the Government’s primary role in protecting and securing durable solutions for refugees.

Title: REACT-C19 project continues to support Azerbaijan in scaling-up COVID-19 readiness and response
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
22 May 2020
“During a month and a half, the REACT-C19 team of doctors assessed the current situation in selected hospitals and supported the elimination of identified gaps. We are grateful to the hospital management and staff for the commitment to the process and to our doctors for their motivation and contribution” said Dr Hande Harmanci, the WHO Representative to Azerbaijan.
“The appeal from the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, His Excellency Mr. Ilham Aliyev to our people “We are strong together”, which triggered the mobilization of all resources in the country to defeat the pandemic must be the message to the world community and to all the countries to demonstrate solidarity in our united battle with coronavirus pandemic. REACT – C19 project is the best reflection of the international partnership for solidarity and mobilization of all efforts to overcome this challenge,” stated Soltan Mammadov, the representative of Heydar Aliyev Foundation.
“The second phase of the REACT-C19 project has been successfully completed, and we are now in the next phase. I am confident that the support of our compatriots from Turkey to their counterparts in our country during the pandemic will bring very positive results, and we will complete the fight against coronavirus with minimal losses,” underlined Shahriyar Fatullayev, Advisor to the Chairman of the Executive Board of TABIB.
REACT-C19 teams in the field
After finishing their work in 4 hospitals (Central Hospital of Oilmen, New Clinics, Educational-Therapeutic Clinic of Azerbaijan Medical University and Surgical clinic of Azerbaijan Medical University) in Baku, the teams departed to 4 regions: Ganja, Agdash, Goranboy and Shamkir.
Using the WHO Hospital Readiness Checklist, the REACT-C19 team of doctors made an assessment in selected capacities in the hospitals, made a joint action plan with the hospital management and started activities to address them. The use of a standardized assessment tool gave healthcare workers confidence in their daily activities.
The teams worked in establishing or strengthening Infection Prevention and Control Committees, and setting up triage systems. These are important interventions to minimize infection spread to health care workers, patients and their families.
During this time, more than 400 healthcare workers including doctors, nurses and auxiliary personnel in hospitals (like cleaning staff, porters, cooks, etc.)  attended the hands-on training activities delivered by REACT-C19 teams.
In addition to training and setting of standards, the teams also helped the local doctors in the management of critically ill patients.
The REACT-C19 teams will continue their work in different parts of Azerbaijan until the end of June.
About REACT-C19 project
In partnership with the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, Ministry of Health, State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance, TABIB, USAID, the British Embassy in Baku and the Republic of Korea WHO is implementing the Rapid Scale-up of Essential Capacities for COVID-19 (REACT-C19) project for strengthening essential response capacities Azerbaijan. 19 doctors in the specialty areas of infectious diseases, pulmonology, anesthesiology and reanimation, internal medicine, currently working in Turkey, form the backbone of the REACT-C19 teams.

Title: United Nations launches global initiative to combat misinformation
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
22 May 2020
“We cannot cede our virtual spaces to those who traffic in lies, fear and hate,” said UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, who announced the initiative. “Misinformation spreads online, in messaging apps and person to person. Its creators use savvy production and distribution methods. To counter it, scientists and institutions like the United Nations need to reach people with accurate information they can trust.”
Verified, led by the UN Department for Global Communications (DGC), will provide information around three themes: science – to save lives; solidarity – to promote local and global cooperation; and solutions – to advocate for support to impacted populations. It will also promote recovery packages that tackle the climate crisis and address the root causes of poverty, inequality and hunger.
The initiative is calling on people around the world to sign up to become “information volunteers” to share trusted content to keep their families and communities safe and connected. Described as digital first responders, the volunteers will receive a daily feed of verified content optimized for social sharing with simple, compelling messaging that either directly counters misinformation or fills an information void.
DGC will partner with UN agencies and UN country teams, influencers, civil society, business and media organizations to distribute trusted, accurate content and work with social media platforms to root out hate and harmful assertions about COVID-19.
“In many countries the misinformation surging across digital channels is impeding the public health response and stirring unrest. There are disturbing efforts to exploit the crisis to advance nativism or to target minority groups, which could worsen as the strain on societies grows and the economic and social fallout kicks in,” Melissa Fleming, UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, said. “The Verified initiative will also work to address this trend with hopeful content that celebrates local acts of humanity, the contributions of refugees and migrants, and makes the case for global cooperation.”
The initiative is a collaboration with Purpose, one of the world’s leading social mobilization organizations. It is supported by the IKEA Foundation and Luminate.
Patricia Atkinson, the IKEA Foundation’s Chief Programmes Officer, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis. The IKEA Foundation is proud to be supporting Verified — an initiative aiming to make sure everyone has access to the trusted science and advice they need to keep their family and loved ones safe.”
Nishant Lalwani, Managing Director of Luminate, added: “COVID-19 has provided a stark reminder that access to accurate, trusted information can be the difference between fear and resilience, division and unity, and even life and death. We are proud to be supporting Verified and its work to tackle the coronavirus ‘infodemic’ by rapidly spreading reliable, science-based information to protect people and communities around the world.”

Title: Potential is brewing for tea growers in Georgia and Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
21 May 2020
Their once-booming tea industries rapidly declined in the years following the Soviet collapse. Today, their combined production is not even 2 percent of their peak from the 1980s, as Georgian and Azerbaijani consumers have turned to less expensive, better quality imports.
In recent years, both countries – boasting ideal tea growing conditions and natural tea stock – have taken steps to revitalize their tea sectors.
With the right support, including public and private investment and the transfer of know-how, Georgian and Azerbaijani tea industries could see a revival. Their tea producers could carve out an interesting niche in a dynamic international tea market catering to consumers of quality organic, green, and specialty teas.
From field to cup
According to tea expert John Snell, “the tea bush survives for a century or more, and with care can be brought back into production, which is happening in both Georgia and Azerbaijan.”

“We are continuously monitoring the latest COVID19 development and follow the recommendation, and in the same time we are trying to create conditions for employees to have safe space to feel right when not everyone gets back to work at the same time,” says Vladimir Gjorgjiev, the Chief of UN IOM Mission in Azerbaijan.
Among additional protective measures taken at the IOM office to ensure a safe return to work by staff members are checking the temperatures of staff and visitors entering the premises, all recommendations and guidance of WHO are placed in prominent places around the workplace, provision of protective equipment such as face masks, hand sanitizers, frequent hygiene procedures, etc are used.
Among a few employees who are required to return to work are staff members of the Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) project who needs to hold in-person meetings with returnees separated through the glass partition.
“During the peak of the pandemic, we temporarily canceled all meetings, but due to the fact that meetings in person are an essential part of our project we gradually started face to face meeting taking every possible measure in line with the WHO recommendations and guidance to protect workers and minimize the direct effects of the coronavirus in the workplace,” says Ilyas Nabiyev, the AVRR focal point of the Mission.
IOM is continuing its efforts to deliver reintegration assistance to returnees – the citizens of Azerbaijan who voluntarily returned to the country of origin under the AVRR projects.  IOM Azerbaijan provides its assistance activities for migrants returned from Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Latvia. One of the main parts of reintegration assistance besides educational activities, temporary housing, is employment or setting-up income-generating activity, e.g., small business for voluntarily returned migrants.

The FAO mapping tool displays information on planting and harvesting months for key food and agriculture commodities. Planting and harvesting calendars, indicate the critical periods that the activities need to take place, as commanded by local agro-ecological conditions. The commodities are chosen based on their importance for each country in terms of the value of production or because they constitute a key food staple.
The traffic lights present FAO recommendations on planting and harvesting for each commodity and country. A green light advises to proceed with the task while speeding up the pace. This happens in all cases that a task needs to take place in the month of April and irrespective of the total number of months needed to complete the task. A yellow light advises to monitor and assess the situation, as the crisis unfolds. The yellow light also suggests speeding up the task if this deems necessary and feasible.

Title: UNICEF says COVID-19 pandemic requires comprehensive action to protect children’s safety, well-being and futures
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
17 April 2020
UNICE’s Agenda for Action highlights several critical issues for children that extend beyond the immediate health threats of COVID-19. Many of these issues are already being addressed in Azerbaijan through close collaboration between UNICEF and the Government, according to UNICEF Representative to the Republic of Azerbaijan Edward Carwardine.
“We know that the impact of COVID-19 will be felt by children and families in many areas of their lives –the Agenda for Action focuses on child health and nutrition, education and early learning, protection of children from violence in the home and the psychological stress created by long periods of self-quarantine, and the economic impact on vulnerable sections of the community – in all these areas UNICEF is already working with government and non-government partners in Azerbaijan to deliver practical assistance to minimize these risks,” said Carwardine.
Guidance on simple prevention measures, especially handwashing, has already reached over 1 million people across the country through digital and direct communication, with UNICEF developing and supporting online and physical delivery of these materials with local partners including the Public Health and Reform Centre and the Regional Development Public Union (RiiB).
UNICEF is supporting provision of practical information on infant and young children’s nutrition for parents and is working with the Public Health and Reform Centre of the Ministry of Health, the State Agency for Mandatory Health Insurance and the Regional Development Public Union (RiiB) to develop online counselling and guidance by health professionals for parents on child health, nutrition and early childhood development, as well as assessing how to maintain essential routine child health care such as immunization.
Despite the necessary closure of schools and pre-schools. learning is being maintained. UNICEF is providing technical support to the Ministry of Education for virtual classes and to date has also provided online sessions and activity materials to support early child development in the home for more than 6,000 children.
UNICEF is also working with local partners, including the Azerbaijan Youth Foundation, to mobilize young people to develop online information materials on COVID-19 and its prevention, deliver online life skills training and to enable a planned 150,000 young people to support their own families at home. To date, online counselling and psychological support has also been provided to more than 500 adolescents.
Noting that domestic violence often increases during stressful periods of home isolation, UNICEF is also providing positive parenting guidance to help those caring for children to manage such stress, while existing social worker teams supported by UNICEF have used online and telephone outreach to keep in contact with at least 1,000 vulnerable families.
UNICEF is also offering its support to the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population to examine the socio-economic impact of the virus on vulnerable families, especially by ensuring that those with special needs such as one-parent families, families with children who have been moved back home from institutional care and children with disabilities are adequately supported. In addition, UNICEF is supporting the provision of food packages to an initial 1,000 especially vulnerable families in partnership with the Ministry and ASAN Volunteers.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is creating a potentially long-lasting impact on vulnerable families and children – UNICEF is encouraged by the wide-ranging response of the Government towards meeting the needs of these families, and we will continue to offer all the support and assistance that we can, including initiatives being supported by the European Union and USAID, to reduce this impact,” said Edward Carwardine.

The objectives are to set up systems of triage, infection prevention and control, case management and intensive care in selected hospitals in the regions, train teams in these hospitals to immediately create the necessary systems and to sustain them in the longer term and create online, mobile or digital technologies to mentor and support the newly-trained personnel.
Each of four hospital preparedness team consists of experts in the field of infection prevention and control, triage, case management and intensive care of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI).
The teams received instruction and hands-on practical training at Turkey’s selected universities in the areas indicated above. They also received practical training on change management and coping with stress. Since the doctors or nurses will already be specialists in the relevant area, the training courses will aim to update and standardize their knowledge and skills and provide them with additional tools for success during this deployment. They will be deployed to Azerbaijan to work under the Chief Medical Officer/Director of the selected hospitals. The resident hospital team will take over the responsibility to run the system after the external team moves on to another hospital.
The online platform will be created for healthcare workers to have easy access to materials, interaction with experts, online meetings, statistics and other supportive activities.

“With pre-schools and daycare services now closed, as well as schools, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, we know that parents face new challenges in keeping their children active and stimulated at home all day, and UNICEF wanted to offer some practical ideas and guidance to help families in these difficult times,” said UNICEF Representative in Azerbaijan Edward Carwardine. “The activities included in the new resources not only keep children occupied but also help build their brains at the same time. For the next 15 days, we will be unveiling a series of fun #LearningAtHome challenges and initiatives in which families can participate, along with practical suggestions to help parents play with their children to keep them active, stimulate their brains and support bonding between parent and child.”

Title: WHO calls on governments to invest in nurses
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
07 April 2020
Findings identify important gaps in the nursing workforce and priority areas for targeted investment in nursing education, jobs and leadership to strengthen nursing around the world and improve health for all.
Nurses account for more than half of all the world’s health workers, providing vital services throughout the health system. In the WHO European Region, 57% of the health workforce are nurses.
Historically and today, nurses are at the forefront of fighting epidemics and pandemics that threaten health. Nurses around the Region are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic with courage: never before has their value been more clearly demonstrated.
“Our fight against COVID-19 has once again brought home how fundamental the nursing profession is to society and to all of us. Faced with the most exceptional circumstances and toughest working conditions, nurses across the European Region and the world have met the challenge with bravery, compassion, and professionalism. They, together with all frontline health workers, deserve our deepest thanks and respect,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
“It is high time we give the nursing profession the recognition it deserves. Today, as we mark World Health Day, and in the future, countries must invest in nurses and support them to work to the full extent of their training and scope of practice. In so doing, our skilled and dedicated nursing workforce will have the strength and resources to build a healthier Europe,” he concluded.
In the European Region, there are 7.3 million nurses or about 79 nurses per 10 000 people. Although this is about double the global average, experts say that because of the age structure of the nursing workforce in the Region and a reliance on international recruitment of nurses in some high-income countries, there is no room for complacency.
About 90% of all nurses are female, yet only 25% of leadership positions are held by them. This emphasizes the need for policies that increase and enhance nursing leadership and encourage female participation at leadership levels.
“Nurses are the answer to many of our health problems. If we want strong health services, we must invest in nurses, educate them to international standards, and provide them with appropriate resources. Nurses should receive fair pay for their work and be able to continue to develop professionally. This will help enhance health outcomes, improve quality of care and advance universal health coverage,” said Dr Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative in Azerbaijan.
Governments should invest to accelerate nursing education and training, create nursing jobs, and empower nurse leadership. Without nurses, midwives and other health workers, countries cannot win the battle against outbreaks or achieve universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals.
“Nurses are the backbone of any health system. Today, many nurses find themselves on the frontline in the battle against COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This report is a stark reminder of the unique role they play and a wake-up call to ensure they get the support they need to keep the world healthy.”

The priority of course now is addressing the pandemic inside Azerbaijan. Staying at home, maintaining social distance, practicing good hygiene including regular handwashing and reporting any flu-like symptoms – including fever and prolonged dry cough – to the 103/113 hotline are essential steps we must all take to protect ourselves, our families and the country.
The United Nations is working closely with the Government and other partners to address the immediate challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic; with technical advice in health care, public information, maintaining education, and supporting social welfare for the most vulnerable, as well as helping procure vital medical and other supplies. In addition, the United Nations is engaging with the Government to assess the longer-term socio-economic impact of the pandemic and welcomes the Government’s allocation of AZN 2,5 billion to mitigate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on the population. We stand ready to support Azerbaijan in scaling up capacity for early identification and isolation of cases, contact tracing, and preparing the health system for increased demand.
Everyone working in the United Nations system in Azerbaijan – most of whom are themselves citizens of Azerbaijan – recognises that great sacrifices are being demanded of us all. We will do all we can to support the people of Azerbaijan to come through these challenging times. We are stronger together, and together we will overcome this crisis.

01 April 2020
The current coronavirus crisis has shown that men and women are not equally exposed to the effects of global pandemics and in many cases, women are more vulnerable:
All scenarios and experiences, faced both by men and women, should be taken into account in the global decision-making process so as to provide equal assistance to everyone during the crisis. The current pandemic of COVID-19 necessitates availability of sex-disaggregated data to better understand how men and women are affected, as well as economic consequences of the disease, distribution of social and healthcare services and the scale of gender-based violence. It would also be another manifestation of recognition of the hard and unprecedented work of women combatting COVID-19 on the frontline.
In parallel, gender-based violence referral pathways should be updated to reflect changes in available care facilities, while key communities and service providers must be informed about those updated pathways. Thus, it would be possible to ensure sustainable protection of the rights of women and girls exposed to the risk of gender-based violence, even in the times of crisis.

Title: Mitigating impacts of Covid-19 on food trade and markets
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
30 March 2020
Joint Statement by QU Dongyu and Roberto Azevedo, Directors-General of FAO and WTO
The sealing of national borders in response to COVID-19 could have unintended consequences on global food security. That raises concern. Millions of people around the world depend on international trade for their food security and livelihoods. While countries have a legitimate right to enact policies to halt the accelerating pandemic, care must be taken to minimise potential impacts on trade in food.
When acting to protect their citizens, countries should implement the least trade-restrictive measures to do so. Some of the new border restrictions put in place could break the food supply chain. They could hamper the movement of agricultural and food industry workers and extend border delays for food containers, resulting in the spoilage of perishables and increasing food waste. If such a scenario were to materialize, it would disrupt the food supply chain, with particularly pronounced consequences for the most vulnerable and food-insecure populations.
Uncertainty about food availability can spark a wave of export restrictions, creating a shortage on the global market. Such reactions can alter the balance between food supply and demand, resulting in price spikes and increased price volatility. We learned from previous crises that such measures are particularly damaging for low-income, food-deficit countries and to the efforts of humanitarian organizations to procure food for those in desperate need.
We must prevent the repeat of such ‘beggar thy neighbour’ policies. It is at times like this that more, not less, international cooperation becomes vital. In the midst of the COVID-19 lockdowns, every effort must be made to ensure that trade flows as freely as possible to avoid food shortage. Consumers must continue to be able to access food within their communities under strict safety requirements, in particular the neediest amongst them, such as the elderly and children.
We must also ensure that information on levels of food production, consumption and stocks, as well as food prices, is available to all in real-time. This reduces uncertainty and allows producers, consumers and traders to make informed decisions. Above all, it helps contain panic buying and the hoarding of food and other essential items.
Now is the time to show solidarity, act responsibly and adhere to our common goal of enhancing food security and nutrition and improving the general welfare of people around the world.  We must not let our response to COVID-19 create unwarranted shortages of essential items and exacerbate hunger and malnutrition.

Meanwhile, armed conflict rages on around the world.
The most vulnerable — women and children, people with disabilities, the marginalized and the displaced — pay the highest price.
They are also at the highest risk of suffering devastating losses from COVID-19.
Let’s not forget that in war-ravaged countries, health systems have collapsed.
Health professionals, already few in number, have often been targeted.
Refugees and others displaced by violent conflict are doubly vulnerable.
The fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war.
That is why today, I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world.
It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives.
To warring parties, I say:
Pull back from hostilities.
Put aside mistrust and animosity.
Silence the guns; stop the artillery; end the airstrikes.
This is crucial…
To help create corridors for life-saving aid.
To open precious windows for diplomacy.
To bring hope to places among the most vulnerable to COVID-19.
Let us take inspiration from coalitions and dialogue slowly taking shape among rival parties to enable joint approaches to COVID-19.  But we need much more.
End the sickness of war and fight the disease that is ravaging our world.
It starts by stopping the fighting everywhere. Now.
That is what our human family needs, now more than ever.

20 March 2020
Investigations to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the involvement of animals as a virus reservoir or intermediate hosts are ongoing. At this point in time, however, the highest risk of COVID-19 spread is through human-to-human transmission. Thus, WHO is the authority and primary source of information regarding the human health aspects of this outbreak.
FAO is continuously monitoring and sharing information on the disease situation globally and is coordinating prevention, preparedness, and detection activities in animals in liaison with WHO and OIE using the One Health approach.
There is no evidence of the involvement of animals (livestock and pets) in the spread of the coronavirus, and there is no justification in taking measures that may compromise animal welfare. Instead, FAO promotes the usual hygiene practices of washing hands before and after handling or feeding livestock and pets, including the careful handling of wild animal and bush meat, in accordance with normal good practice.
Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, FAO has been actively promoting hygiene practices and epidemic updates through its communication channels globally, and strongly advises the public to take the following messages into account:
In order to contribute to the prevention and control of the spread of the coronavirus, FAO strongly recommends all actions to be coordinated with a One Health approach, linking specialists in animal, human and environmental health.

Title: Azerbaijan Tourism and Management University obtains prestigious UNWTO TedQual Certification, with support of State Tourism Agency and UNDP
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
13 March 2020
ATMU is the first among universities in the South Caucasus that has successfully passed the UNWTO.TedQual certification process, which is an important achievement in enhancing the global competitiveness of Azerbaijan’s higher education.
This has been achieved as part of the “Capacity building of the Azerbaijan Tourism and Management University” project implemented by the State Tourism Agency of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The main objective of this project which began in December 2018 is to help ensure that the quality of education in tourism and management is fully in line with international standards and preparing students to become highly skilled professionals in the tourism field.
Established in 1998, the UNWTO.TedQual Certification System is one of the most advanced standards of education, training and research in the field of tourism, administered by the UNWTO Academy. This quality system assesses the effectiveness of the pedagogical content and organisation of higher education tourism programmes. One of the main requirements of the system is to measure the effectiveness of the academic system, as well as their degree of incorporation of the tourism industry, civil society and students needs in those programmes.
By having access to the UNWTO.TedQual Network, ATMU gets the right to participate in exchange programmes for academic staff and students, also tap into numerous opportunities for sharing knowledge and experience. Higher education institutions such as the George Washington University, the Université du Québec à Montréal, Bosphorus and Akdeniz Universities of Turkey, China’s Sun Yat-sen University and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University are all members of this prestigious network.
ATMU also obtained ISO 9001: 2015 – Quality Management System Certification in 2019 validating the university’s education for specialists in the tourism and hospitality field.

Title: Azerbaijan adopts action plan to combat gender-biased sex selection
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 March 2020
The action plan combines a series of important activities and measures to be implemented over the next five years by local authorities and institutions to address the phenomenon of son preference and promote the value of a girl child.
The analysis of the demographic processes observed in the country during the recent years reveals a persistent prevalence of boys among newborns resulting in a skewed sex ratio at birth of 1.14 (114 boys born for every 100 girls) which considerably exceeds the biological norm – 1.05/1.07 (105-107 boys per 100 newly-born girls). At the same time, findings show that as mothers become more aged, families are more inclined towards son preference, which also increases the share of boys in the structure of newborn babies. Such a situation is explained with gender-biased decisions and measures (such as sex-selective abortions) undertaken by parents with regard to the selection of sex of a child to be born. It is noteworthy that sex imbalance at birth is more often practiced by low-income households and mainly observed in rural territories of the country.
The action plan is assumed to play a vital role in the elimination of these imbalances in the population sex ratio in Azerbaijan. According to the document, measures to be implemented will ensure accessible and reliable data on newborns’ sex ratio and improving relevant legislative framework, enhance support measures for women and girls to eliminate gender-based discrimination and inequality, strengthen advocacy and awareness-raising efforts to dismantle gender stereotypes as well as reinforce inter-organizational cooperation to achieve the objectives set forth in the plan.
Throughout the preparation of the action plan, UNFPA has provided substantial support to the government of Azerbaijan – a team of local and international experts created by the Fund has taken active part in drafting the document in close collaboration with the government. The next five years of its implementation are expected to be a term of significant improvements in the sphere of prevention harmful practice of GBSS in Azerbaijan.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
02 January 2020
In a ‘global reality check’, four innovative data streams will build the first-ever repository of crowd-sourced solutions to major global challenges.
The UN75 dialogues together with a ‘One-minute Survey’ that anyone can take, opinion polling in 50 countries and artificial intelligence sentiment analysis of traditional and social media in 70 countries, will generate compelling data to inform national and international policies and debate.
In calling for participation, the Secretary-General said:
“No country, no community, is able to solve the complex problems of our world alone. We need to come together, not only to talk but to listen. It is absolutely essential that you all join the conversation. We need your opinion, your strategies and your ideas for us to be able to deliver better for the people of the world that we must serve.”
Intended to engage constituencies across borders, sectors, and generations, the UN75 team is collaborating with a wide multi-sector network, including the UN Resident Coordinators, for a diverse and global reach, and for dialogues to be convened in every country of the world. In a global listening exercise, with an emphasis on youth and groups not already engaged with the UN, the UN75 initiative aims to better understand expectations of international cooperation in light of pressing global challenges.
The views and ideas that are generated will be presented, by the Secretary-General, to world leaders and senior UN officials on September 21, 2020, at a high-level event to mark the 75th anniversary.
To inspire and inform the dialogues the UN is also partnering with Vox Media’s brand studio, Vox Creative to create a video informed by interviews with 38 people from around the world, sharing their experiences and opinions related to important global issues, to be launched January 6, 2020.
Those who want to be a part of the conversation – physically or online – can see how to join through the website: www.un.org/UN75.

Deputy Minister of Health Rahim Aliyev stated that combating non-communicable diseases worldwide and country-level has become one of the priorities of health care systems and states: “In modern times, rapid urbanization and globalization of unhealthy lifestyles have contributed to the increase of NCDs burden. The main purpose of today’s conference is to review the work done in this direction and to strive for better results,” he concluded.
Gahraman Hagverdiyev, Director of PHRC said that non-communicable diseases are linked to risk factors such as smoking, overweight and malnutrition. “The results of the STEPS survey have once again demonstrated that it is important for people to develop healthy lifestyles,” he said.
WHO Representative in Azerbaijan Dr Hande Harmanci underlined the importance of collaboration to achieve that success in this area. She highly appreciated the participation of doctors and medical professionals, representatives of other fields and agencies at the conference. “A comprehensive approach is needed to prevent and control NCDs, which will involve many sectors working together including Ministries of Health, Education, Youth and Sport, mass media, local NGOs, and others,” she stressed.
In her video message, Dr Bente Mikkelsen, the Director of the Division of Noncommunicable Diseases and Promoting Health through the Life-course at the WHO Regional Office for Europe highlighted the importance of improving the quality of health services and enhancing the information capacity.
Joao Breda, Head of the WHO European Centre for Prevention and control of NCD and Dr Ivo Rakovac, Programme Manager of NCD Surveillance spoke about the comparative analysis of the STEPS in Azerbaijan and implications for the prevention of NCDs and achieving SDGs with prevention of NCDs.
The second part of the conference was devoted to scientific issues and included presentations by the representatives of Azerbaijan Medical University, Scientific Research Institute of Pulmonary Diseases, PHRC, National Oncology Centre, Republican Endocrinology Centre and other leading institutions and centres. The participants discussed issues related to the prevention of cardiovascular, oncological diseases, diabetes and lung diseases, their risk factors, including the lack of physical activity, overweight and obesity, salt consumption and alcohol use.

Co-organised by the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office, UNICEF, UN Global Compact, UN Women and UNDP, the conference underlined the importance of integrating the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption into business policies and practices.
The event also featured the Children Rights and Business Principles developed by UNICEF, the UN Global Compact and Save the Children towards a new age of corporate respect and support for children’s rights.
“It is now well recognized that the high aspirations of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development depend on leveraging all sources of finance,” said Edward Carwardine, the UN Resident Coordinator a.i. in Azerbaijan.
“Within increasingly complex financing landscapes, different kinds of public and private financing, from domestic and international sources, have important roles to play in achieving sustainable development,” Mr Carwardine added.
The workshop discussions during the conference focused on successful examples of sustainable business practices in different countries and ways for companies to tangibly integrate the SDGs into their financing, operational processes and internal decision-making. Panelists also discussed the role of businesses in supporting women’s empowerment principles – the sets of principles for corporate action to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment.
Launched in 2000 as a special initiative of the UN Secretary-General, the UN Global Compact provides a framework for developing a more sustainable and responsible business. Today, the UN Global Compact is the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world, with more than 10,000 companies and 3,000 non-business signatories based in over 160 countries, and more than 60 Local Networks.

Title: 16 Days of Activism on combating gender-based violence launched in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 November 2019
The campaign, as implied by its name, aims to draw public attention to the VAWG phenomenon and runs throughout 16 days between 25 November and 10 December  each year.
As in past years, this year the organisers will try to attract the public’s attention to the problem of VAWG via a series of awareness-raising activities over the upcoming sixteen days. Thus, the first day of the campaign will be marked with an inception conference with participation of the representatives from government agencies, international organizations and civil society functioning in the sphere of combatting VAWG. During the campaign, video messages of the officials representing the UN Office in Azerbaijan as well as relevant government organizations calling on to end violence against women and girls, as well as PSA aimed at sensitizing the society on gender-based violence (GBV), are expected to be widely broadcasted on social media.
One of the topics around this year’s campaign is the Istanbul Convention, one of the key international legal frameworks existing in the sphere of combatting all forms of violence against women and girls. During the campaign, various booklets and other publications containing frequently asked questions with regard to the Istanbul Convention will be prepared and disseminated to the public. There will also be live discussions on the subject with the participation of experts on the radio these days.
Implemented under the slogan “Stop Violence Against Women and Girls”, this year’s 16 Days of Activism campaign is country-wide. During the campaign, posters containing information on where to apply for receiving professional care services in case of a GBV incident will be placed at public places throughout the country (subway, bus stops, shopping malls etc.). Additionally, as a result of cooperation with the State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations and the Caucasus Muslims Office, it is expected that Friday khutbas to be read at mosques across the country over the next two weeks will also include points about inadmissibility of violence against women and girls in the context of the religion of Islam.
Considering the importance of raising awareness of all groups of the population, especially young people, a series of trainings for youngsters are also planned to be carried out within the campaign. The trainings will take place in five regions of Azerbaijan – Masalli, Bilasuvar, Shamkir, Gazakh and Guba – and serve to sensitize youth in the regions on the topic of violence against women and girls.
A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding is also expected to be signed between the UN Office in Azerbaijan, State Committee on Family, Women and Children Affairs and Azerbaijani Bar Association. The document will enable the parties to cooperate more efficiently to improve GBV victims’ access to relevant support and care services.
Another activity to take place in the campaign’s days will be conducting of a GBV quiz competition among social media users. Followers will be awarded with symbolic presents by responding quickly and correctly to questions posted on the UN Azerbaijan’s Facebook page.

19 November 2019
The purpose of the event was to bring together partners to discuss the antimicrobial resistance and to identify effective solutions to increase public awareness.
Representatives of WHO, Ministry of Health, State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance and pilot medical institutions attended in the event.
WHO Representative in Azerbaijan Dr. Hande Harmanci emphasized the importance of this week in her opening remarks. WHO’s specialist Dr. Javahir Suleymanova made a presentation on the state of antibiotic resistance in the world, while the representatives of the Ministry of Health Nazifa Mursalova and Hagigat Gadirova talked about the antibiotic resistance and their effects in Azerbaijan.
Sharafat Ismayilova, a staff member of the State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance, spoke about antibiotic control mechanisms, and Inara Makayeva, a representative of the Public Health and Reforms Centre, gave a speech on the awareness campaign in the country conducted with the support of WHO.
Within the framework of this week training sessions for medical workers will be held in Mingachevir. Surveys will be conducted to assess the level of antibiotic awareness among the population in Baku and Sumgait.
The World Antibiotic Awareness Week, held each year in November, aims to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance, to promote proper use of antibiotics and to encourage best practices among the general public, health workers and policy makers to avoid the further emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.
Since their discovery, antibiotics have served as the cornerstone of modern medicine. However, the persistent overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal health have encouraged the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, which occurs when microbes, such as bacteria, become resistant to the drugs used to treat them.

Title: Statement by the United Nations in Azerbaijan on violence against women and girls
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
21 October 2019
Violence against women and girls comes at very high social and economic costs for individuals, families, societies as well as a country as a whole.
Violence against women and girls will undermine the nation’s efforts to grow and thrive – research commissioned by the UN has indicated that violence against women is likely to cost Azerbaijan US$ 764 million – close to 2 per cent of the country’s GDP  – every year in lost economic output caused by irreversible population losses, incapacity, disability, reduced productivity of victims and the costs of providing services in response to violence.
But above all, violence against women and girls destroys lives, families and futures. The human cost of every act of violence is beyond measure – and it is a price that Azerbaijan cannot afford, and no woman or girl should bear.
We acknowledge the political will and determination of the Government of Azerbaijan to address this problem, but more must be done.
The Government of Azerbaijan should urgently ratify the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention, which would put in place specific measures – including research on the prevalence of violence, strengthened protection of those at risk of violence, dedicated services for victims, and prosecution of offenders – in line with international standards.
Increased investment in practical measures to protect and support victims of violence is needed, including accessible and affordable coordinated referral and assistance services.
There must be a prompt and thorough investigation of all reports of violence against women and girls, with a focus on protecting victims and witnesses and with no impunity for perpetrators of violence.
And everyone in Azerbaijan should speak up and report any incident of violence against women and girls, wherever it takes place – remaining silent in the face of violence is not an option.
For its part, the United Nations in Azerbaijan will continue working closely with the Government and others, across the country, to better protect those at risk of violence – including through support for social service programmes for vulnerable women and girls, creating more opportunities for employment and self-development for women, training professionals and community workers to recognise and respond to signs of violence against girls and women, and through public awareness initiatives such as the forthcoming 16 Days of Activism Campaign Against Gender Based Violence, held annually between 25 November and 10 December. This campaign provides an opportunity for everyone to come together and shine a spotlight on violence against women and girls and speak out against this terrible phenomenon.

17 October 2019
The two-day workshop held on 15-16 October is a part of the regional initiative, introduced in 2014 by UNFPA Eastern Europe and Central Asia Regional Office in partnership with EEIRH.
The workshop brought together the representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs, the Public Health and Reforms Center of the Ministry of Health as well as NGOs and other related institutions working towards GBV prevention. The participants were given detailed information on the significance of multi-sectoral response to GBV and the best practices in this field. One of the main objectives of the workshop was to explore the ways of introducing the Essential Service Guidelines (ESGs) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on gender-based violence at a national level. The packages provide clear and detailed description of the coordinated actions to be taken by relevant organisations engaged in provision of assistance and services to GBV survivors. It was underlined that efficient multi-sectoral GBV prevention mechanisms require strong partnerships and exchange of information between the key actors and stakeholders.
The workshop also focused on the strategies of documenting GBV, collecting evidence and storing the information, intervention/immediate response measures to be taken by relevant authorities and organisations alike, risk assessment and safety planning with respect to GBV survivors as well as referral system (referral network, pathway and process) for GBV victims, followed by the practical exercises to ensure effective intake of the information and knowledge shared.
It is worth mentioning that the main objective of the regional initiative launched by UNFPA is to strengthen the capacity of the national stakeholders (in particular, institutions and organizations from key sectors such as psychosocial welfare, law enforcement and health care) and offices from EECA region for a comprehensive response to, and prevention of GBV.
About UNFPA:

16 October 2019
Events are organised in over 150 countries across the world, making it one of the most celebrated days of the UN calendar. These events promote worldwide awareness and action for those who suffer from hunger and other forms of malnutrition and for the need to ensure food security and healthy diets for all. World Food Day is also an important opportunity to send a strong message to the public: We can end hunger and all forms of malnutrition in this lifetime and become the Zero Hunger Generation, but everyone needs to work together to achieve this goal.
For decades, the world was making progress in the fight against hunger. Now, the number of undernourished people is on the rise again. More than 800 million people, or roughly one in nine people, are going hungry. But food security in our times isn’t only a matter of quantity, it’s also a question of quality. Unhealthy diets have now become a leading risk factor for disease and death worldwide. There is an urgent need to make healthy and sustainable diets affordable and accessible to everyone.

11 October 2019
Every day, they are challenging stereotypes and breaking barriers. Girls are organising and leading movements to tackle issues such as child marriage, education inequality, violence and the climate crisis. As the theme of this year’s observance underscores, they are proving to be unscripted and unstoppable.
On this International Day, we celebrate achievements by, with and for girls since the adoption of the landmark Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action – a comprehensive policy agenda for the empowerment of women and girls. Across nearly 25 years, we have seen more girls attending and completing school, fewer getting married or becoming mothers while still children themselves, and more gaining the skills they need to excel in the workplace.
To ensure that all girls can reach their potential, we need concerted efforts and investments in their health, safety and 21st-century skills. Every year of secondary schooling a girl receives boosts her earning power by as much as 25 per cent. If all girls and boys complete secondary education, 420 million people could be lifted out of poverty.  The benefits unfold across generations.
We need to uphold the equal rights, voices and influence of girls in our families, communities and nations. Girls can be powerful agents of change, and nothing should keep them from participating fully in all areas of life.

Title: Azerbaijan’s flourishing farming sector needs support for smallholders, says UN food expert
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
11 October 2019
“The fragility of Azerbaijan’s economy because of its heavy dependence on oil and gas production highlights a need for diversification by increasing investments in the non-oil sector,” said Elver, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, presenting a preliminary statement at the end of her 11-day visit.
“The Government is focusing its efforts on developing the country’s agricultural potential and on increasing productivity to guarantee economic stability. But this is still in its early stages and needs to incorporate a human rights-based approach to ensure sustainable development that is sensitive to the needs and traditions of the country’s regions and people of various ethnic backgrounds.
“In the past two years, Azerbaijan has made impressive efforts to establish new institutions such as the State Agency for Food Safety and has introduced new laws, policies and programmes for the development of the agricultural sector, food security and food safety. The challenge now is to ensure implementation of the goals, through the allocation of adequate budgets, and securing growth that benefits all levels of society,” she said.
The Special Rapporteur said that, in spite of positive achievements, Azerbaijan’s economic wealth had not been equitably shared among the population. She stressed that, globally, inequality was one of the stumbling blocks in the struggle to eliminate poverty, hunger and malnutrition.
“Although the emergence of a free market economy has contributed to the country’s recent impressive progress, this growth has not been sufficiently inclusive and agricultural development has not yet benefited the whole of society.
“The next 10 years are going to be crucial. Azerbaijan should concentrate its efforts on achieving self-sufficiency and strengthen its independence from big agricultural powers and companies to safeguard food security in the country. To achieve this, it is crucial to increase the market competitiveness of small farmers.
“Nearly 90% of the farms are smallholdings, which occupy 85% of agricultural land. Because of the small land sizes, usually between one and three hectares, and the lack of associations, these farmers encounter many difficulties when accessing markets and are in competition with big agro businesses. There is often a significant difference between the original wholesale ‘field price’ of products and the price paid by consumers.
“Smallholders are extremely vulnerable and often cannot expect to gain their livelihood from their own farms. To meet the needs of their families, they are having to take ‘day jobs’ in the oil and service sectors. The lack of public consultation is hindering efforts to bring about improvements. Without such involvement, programmes and projects will fail to take adequate account of the real human, environmental and production requirements of the agricultural sector.
“Many farmers also face severe water shortages and pollution, especially from rivers that flow across the border from Armenia. There are problems with lack of access to quality seeds, adequate machinery such as modern irrigation systems, and issues when selling and processing products for the market. Farmers are also frequently faced with financial difficulties when arranging loans and subsidies,” Elver said.
“In addition, environmental challenges are being exacerbated by climate change, severe air pollution from industrial plants and excessive use of pesticides to increase production. There are also difficulties in eliminating obsolete hazardous pesticides, and coping with water pollution, soil degradation and important biodiversity and forest maintenance challenges.”
She stressed the need for Azerbaijan to collect higher quality data to accurately assess poverty and determine whether the rights to food, education, healthcare, and housing were being met.
Elver said: “If the Government is ready to promote the country’s human capital through education, incorporate a human rights-based approach to its agricultural policies and adopt meaningful public consultation especially with vulnerable groups such as women, children, rural communities and people with disabilities, sustainable development could be accomplished. If this course is followed, Azerbaijan will deserve great praise for its record of achievement and reform.”
The Special Rapporteur visited Baku, Guba and Ganja between 1 and 11 October. She met farmers, weavers, women entrepreneurs, representatives of international development agencies, and children with disabilities in a public orphanage, as well as local and national government officials.
The Special Rapporteur will present a comprehensive report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva in March 2020.

Title: Water-saving awards for hotels in Azerbaijan and Georgia to contribute to water sustainability
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
09 October 2019
The training programme is organized as part of the Kura II Project for Advancing Integrated Water Resources Management across the Kura River Basin. Funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the project is implemented in Azerbaijan and Georgia by the UNDP, in close collaboration with the Governments of the two countries.
The H2Otel Water Saving Awards is to endorse hotels in Azerbaijan and Georgia for undertaking innovative measures to reduce water consumption and eliminate water pollution in the hospitality industry. Saving water helps hotels to maximise their profits and conserve precious natural resources, while also catering to a growing customer base that demonstrates a preference for hotels which minimise their environmental impact.
In South Caucasus, the H2Otel Water Saving Awards will be implemented in cooperation with the Azerbaijan Hotel Association and the Welcome to Georgia! National Tourism Awards, an annual hotel and hospitality recognition ceremony held in Georgia since 2015.
In both countries, the H2Otel Water Saving Awards programme will utilise the Hotel Water Measurement Initiative (HWMI) tools developed by International Tourism Partnership, a notable UK-based not-for-profit organization founded by HRH Prince Charles. The HWMI tools will offer new water assessment protocols to hoteliers in Azerbaijan and Georgia and will be made available for use in local languages. The HWMI tool is a simple method for tracking water consumption in hotels, developed in conjunction with KPMG and major global hotel brands.
In order to qualify for the H2Otel Water Saving Awards, hotels in Azerbaijan and Georgia are required to participate in three short training programmes, monitor their water consumption with the Hotel Water Measurement Initiative tool and develop innovative plans for water conservation at their properties.
Winners of the H2Otel Water Saving Awards will receive high-profile domestic, regional and international publicity from core partners of the Award programme, including the Azerbaijan Hotel Association, the Welcome to Georgia! National Tourism Awards and the UNDP.
Award winners will also be featured on Green Hotelier, the leading online knowledge management platform that offers hands-on insights on the sustainable and responsible business agenda within the hotel industry, reaching 24,000 properties in over 100 countries worldwide.
The first edition of the H2Otel Water Saving Awards will be issued in Azerbaijan and Georgia in December 2019.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
26 September 2019
“I look forward to the opportunity to assess the enjoyment of the right to food in Azerbaijan and learn more about the country’s food and agriculture policies that affect people’s livelihoods,” Elver said.
“The objective of my visit is to engage in constructive discussions to identify good practices as well as challenges, and provide useful recommendations to the Government and others.”
This is the first visit to the country by an independent expert on the right to food. The Special Rapporteur will visit Baku, Guba and Ganja. She will meet Government officials, the Ombudsman, representatives from the UN system, the international donor community, civil society organisations and different communities.
“I will be looking closely at how the benefits of economic growth and foreign investment affect the realisation of the right to food in Azerbaijan,” Elver said.
“I plan to examine the role that the agricultural sector plays, including examples of good practices and challenges. I will also assess the situation on the implementation of the right to food, particularly among women, children, minorities, people with disabilities and those forced to leave their homes in both urban and rural areas, known as internally displaced persons.
“I will also consider the role of the private sector; the impact of land tenure, environmental issues and climate change; and the issues related to nutrition and food quality, especially for infants and young children,” she said.
The Special Rapporteur will share the preliminary observations of her visit at a press conference to be held at the end of the visit at 12:00 local time on 11 October at: Winterpark Hotel, Zümrüd Conference Room, 210, Mirza-Aga Aliyev Street, Baku. Access will be strictly limited to accredited journalists.
Elver’s final report on the visit will be presented to the Human Rights Council in Geneva in March 2020.

Ms Hilal Elver (Turkey) was appointed Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food by the Human Rights Council in 2014. She is a Research Professor, and co-director of the Project on Global Climate Change, Human Security, and Democracy housed at the Orfalea Center for Global & International Studies and global distinguished fellow at the University of California Los Angeles Law School (UCLA) Resnick Food Law and Policy Center.
The Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world.

Title: UNDP, SOCAR, BP support tree-planting to fight climate change in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
17 September 2019
A tree-planting ceremony took place at SOCAR’s Waste Management Centre today with the participation of UNDP Resident Representative Mr. Alessandro Fracassetti, President of SOCAR Mr. Rovnaq Abdullayev, Vice-president of SOCAR on ecology Ms. Rafiga Huseynzade and Regional President of BP Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey Mr. Gary Jones. Recognising the importance of timely response to negative effects of critical environmental challenges, heads of UNDP mission in Azerbaijan, SOCAR and BP regional office discussed best ways to support Azerbaijan’s efforts to fight climate change, capitalising on energy efficiency measures and the country’s potential for alternative energy and renewables.
In Azerbaijan, where the energy-intense economy accounts for a significant portion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is a main contributor to global warming, tree planting and forestation have a great potential to curb the concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
The tree-planting campaign starts in Baku in the run-up to the upcoming Oil Workers’ Day on 20 September and the 25th anniversary of Azerbaijan’s historic production sharing agreement –the Contract of the Century signed with consortium of foreign oil companies, which turned Azerbaijan into a strategic energy centre of the world.
The tree-planting ceremony was made possible through contributions from SOCAR, BP as well as the UNDP’s joint project with SOCAR on Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Started in 2015, the NAMA project has since supported Azerbaijan in mitigating the GHG emissions and implementing energy efficiency measures across three key areas of intervention: in buildings, transport systems and through associated gas capturing.
The result of four years of intense work is that the total area of 10,000 square meters in SOCAR administrative and service buildings has been retrofitted and appointed with energy-saving equipment and environmentally friendly appliances, such as energy-efficient windows, ventilation and heat insulation systems and floor heating, among other things. Altogether, retrofitting of these buildings helped reduce CO2 emissions by 200 tons per year, while also cutting the energy consumption by 35 per cent, benefitting more than 2,500 people.
In addition to energy-efficient building design, the project has also introduced sustainable and environmentally-conscious driving technologies in Azerbaijan, including eco-driving simulators and hybrid cars that help transform energy from fuel combustion into electric energy. Along with the project’s capacity building offering for approximately 1,200 drivers, these sustainable driving measures can reduce carbon dioxide emission from vehicles by 10 to 15 percent.
In the Gala settlement of Baku, the project has also supported the establishment of Azerbaijan’s first Energy Efficiency Centre set to become a knowledge management hub on energy efficiency practices and services, which will also offer specialised capacity building training to oil workers, scholars, professors and students with background in energy technology.
Additionally, development work is currently underway in remote mountainous communities of Siyazan (north of Baku), where more than 600 families –approximately 2,500 residents living in 12 villages will soon have access to clean cooking fuels, which were not available to them before.
Recognising the need for more robust climate-smart practices and a shift from dependency on fossil fuels to alternative sources of energy in Azerbaijan, UNDP has built 63 kilowatt solar plants in SOCAR’s facilities in Qala, Garadagh and Sumgayit and 24 kilowatt wind power turbines in the proximity of the Garadagh Waste Management Centre. Most of it is currently being used for lighting purposes and provide a safer, cleaner and reliable alternative to conventional electrification.

13 September 2019
UNHCR’s higher education scholarship programme, DAFI plays an integral role in enabling refugees worldwide to access higher education. Since its inception in 1992, the programme has supported more than 15,500 refugee students to study at universities and colleges in over 50 countries of asylum, including Azerbaijan. DAFI Programme started to operate in Azerbaijan in 2010, so far 36 young refugees have been supported, including nine selected recently on the eve of the start of the 2019-2020 academic year.
In his speech at the meeting, the UNHCR Country Representative Guido Ambroso highlighted the importance and role of education in enabling refugees to rebuild their lives. “Promoting human potential through increased opportunities for quality education and livelihoods, is one of UNHCR’s Global Strategic Priorities and is in line with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4) which aims at free and quality education,” he said. The Representative also expressed his gratitude to the Government of Azerbaijan for allowing the persons in need of international protection to stay in the country and shared his positive expectation that refugees under UNHCR’s mandate will soon have the legal right to work which will allow them to contribute to the development of the country. Then Guido Ambroso addressed his appreciation to the International Bank of Azerbaijan for the free of charge provision of ATM cards to the refugees receiving cash assistance from UNHCR, including the students supported through the DAFI programme.
The German Ambassador Wolfgang Manig congratulated the students and wished them success in their higher education. “We are proud and grateful to support young and talented students in fully developing their potential and give them a life perspective” said the Ambassador.
The Head of the Refugee Status Determination Department of the Azerbaijani State Migration Service Aydan Seyidova highlighted the measures taken by the Government of Azerbaijan in improving the quality of protection and services offered to migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Azerbaijan.
The event was attended also by the parents of the newly selected students and refugee community representatives who appreciated the generous support of the German Government through UNHCR in addressing key barriers for their children to acquire higher education. They also appreciated the warm welcoming atmosphere enjoyed by refugees in Azerbaijan and praised the tolerance and hospitality of the hosting community.
UNHCR established its presence in Azerbaijan in December 1992 as part of UNHCR’s first emergency assistance operation in the former Soviet Union. The agency is mandated to ensure that everybody has the right to seek asylum and find safe refuge, having fled violence, persecution, war or disaster at home. Since 1950, the Agency has faced multiple crises on multiple continents, and provided vital assistance to refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced and stateless people.

Title: FAO works towards consolidating fragmented land in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
30 August 2019
During the event, experts highlighted activities within the project, such as community workshops to raise awareness on the benefits of land consolidation and drafting a community development plan in close collaboration with local partners. The plan focuses on the necessity of improved agricultural infrastructure in the village, including of the introduction of the irrigation scheme.
In the initial stage of the project, a feasibility study was conducted in the pilot village Shorsulu in Salyan district, where 89 per cent of the total 608 land-owner families were interviewed about their land use, problems related to land ownership registration and interest in participating in land consolidation through sale, purchase, exchange or lease agreements. A total of 88 per cent of respondents indicated their interest in consolidating their land parcels. Based on the outcome of the study, a re-allotment plan for the pilot village was drafted. As a result, after adoption of the law on consolidation of agricultural lands, new lands can be registered per plan.
“Azerbaijan has clearly stepped on the road leading to improved farm structures,” said Morten Hartvigsen, delivery manager of FAO’s Regional Initiative on smallholders and family farms and the responsible officer for the project. “However, the country will need further international technical assistance to achieve the vision of scaling up land consolidation activities to a fully operational national programme,” he added.
FAO has been working closely with the Azerbaijani Ministry of Agriculture in introducing land consolidation in the country in order to address structural problems in agriculture caused by land fragmentation, informal and not-updated land registry, and outdated agricultural infrastructure.
As a result of the project, a national land consolidation strategy, a state programme on land consolidation with an action plan, as well as a law on consolidation of agricultural lands were drafted and submitted to the Government for the further discussion and adoption.

The event brought together representatives from the Ministry of Health, State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance, Medical University, Public Health and Reforms Centre, Baku Health Department, Postgraduate Medical Institute, Milli Majlis (Parliament), UN agencies, as well as embassies and international organisations.
“Azerbaijan is taking very big steps to strengthen the health system, especially the Primary Healthcare, and WHO is proud to assist by making its expertise available to the country,” Dr. Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative and Head of Country Office, said in her opening speech.
“This mission was a great opportunity to observe the new system in action and provide our recommendations to contribute to a successful roll out. A strong healthcare system is a cornerstone of sustainable development, and the key to building the prosperous future we all want and deserve,” Dr. Harmanci concluded.
Important transformation efforts have been taking place in Azerbaijan in the past three years with the aim to increase the quality of health care services and decrease the out-of-pocket expenditures in health.
Since the beginning of this year, WHO has supported Azerbaijan in this area by evidence-based guidance and technical expertise, opportunities for direct observation and experience for national technical experts and by technical missions of WHO experts to provide recommendations for improvements.
Next steps are to work on a pilot of primary healthcare strengthening to build the best model for Azerbaijan. This is extremely important since primary care is usually the first contact for all people and a great majority of illnesses can be detected and treated at this level.

The initiative was launched with the support of the National Children’s Paralympic Committee. During the event, children with disabilities were able to showcase their skills and talents. Involving adolescents with disabilities, with a special focus on girls, in sport is an important part of new collaboration between the European Union and UNICEF in Azerbaijan.
''The European Union supports civil society organisations (CSO) providing inclusive community based outreach services. Most of the funds available for this project will be channeled via our CSO partners to support their work with vulnerable children and young people in Azerbaijan'', highlighted the EU Commissioner.
“Through this joint effort, we aim to bring quality services ranging from early childhood development programmes to youth development initiatives, and from integrated social services to increased opportunities for children with disabilities, to more and more children, young people and their families in the heart of the community'' said UNICEF Representative to Azerbaijan.
The initiative will contribute to enhancement of civil society as a valued and trusted ‘third sector’ to work alongside public and private sector entities in delivering the broadest range of support to vulnerable children across the country through community-based organisations. It will also contribute to the establishment of national standards across several sectors, strengthened technical and management capacities of civil society, and the modelling of high impact, cost-effective services and programmes at national and sub-national level through the engagement of CSOs.

Title: UNDP and Government bring youth enthusiasts to policy discussions around Internet
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 June 2019
Capitalising on greater involvement of young people in policy debates around Internet governance, the inaugural event was organized in partnership with the Azerbaijan Youth Fund and brought together nearly 250 students, representatives of youth organizations, university faculty, civil society, the public and private sector and beyond.
The first two days of the Forum focused on strengthening theoretical and practical knowledge of the Internet and its broader application for development among the key cohort of 24 participants aged 17-29 from around the world, including Georgia, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Albania, Greece, Moldova, Serbia and Turkey, as well as young students from across the regions of Azerbaijan. The third and concluding day followed with an engaging simulation game that featured some of the heated policy debates around the future of Internet governance where youth are the centrepiece of important policy-making and decision-making processes. Young delegates presented their policy arguments from the perspective of government officials, civil society representatives, innovators, businesses and other institutions.
The involvement of young people in policy debates is key for development. The United Nations estimates show that many young people aged 18-25 are the first generation of adults to grow up not knowing the world without the Internet. Yet a little less than half the world’s population have no access to Internet today, while 90 percent of them actually come from developing countries. Bridging this digital divide is one of the prerequisites for accelerating the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and 17 Sustainable Development Goals (the SDGs). Youth, innovation and technology combined together build an important pillar of national development ensuring equal access to information and knowledge, while also fostering greater partnerships and entrepreneurship.
Speaking at the opening of the Youth IGF today, Deputy Resident Representative a.i. for UNDP in Azerbaijan Ms. Yuliya Shcherbinina told young enthusiasts gathered in Baku: “Today, our world is home to the largest youth population ever in history, and you are among this critical cohort! You are the indispensable agents of change and we need you on board where the SDGs are at stake.”
There are currently 1.8 billion people around the globe between the ages of 10 and 24 and this number is expected to grow. By 2030, almost 2 billion young people will become part of the world’s youth cohort. Only in Azerbaijan, young people between the age of 14-29, make up close to one third of the population. Half of them live in rural areas. Through various platforms like the Youth IGF, UNDP programmes in Azerbaijan engage with young people from different socio-economic background in different parts of the country making sure that the development work this global organisation pursues benefits all Leaving No One Behind.
The first Youth Internet Governance Forum is organised as a part of yet another inaugural initiative taking place in Azerbaijan from 29 May to 4 June –the first ever Innovation Festival (InnoFest) in Azerbaijan launched at the initiative of the Ministry of Transport, Communications and High Technologies in partnership with a number of other key ministries and government agencies, innovation centres, youth organizations, a leading telecommunications company, the Heydar Aliyev Centre, the US Embassy in Baku and UNDP. The InnoFest features an impressive array of innovation summits, forums, start-up competitions, including UNDP’s nationwide Idea-to-Business (I2B) tours, as well as robotics competitions, eSports tournaments and exhibitions that brought together hundreds of multinational companies, international organizations, thought leaders, influencers and chief executives from all over the world.

Title: UNICEF urges renewed attention on Early Childhood Development and more family-friendly policies
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 June 2019
Under the theme of “It’s About Time”, UNICEF offices around the world and their partners are raising awareness of the impact on babies’ and young children’s brain development of good nutrition, stimulation and a protective environment in the earliest years of life. UNICEF is also urging more support for parents, through investment in family-friendly policies and more provision of practical advice and guidance on early childhood development.
In Azerbaijan, UNICEF is undertaking a social media campaign #Atabala Challenge to highlight the important role that fathers play in the development of their children. As part of the challenge, several personalities are sharing their personal stories of fatherhood on social media, encouraging other fathers to take part and spread the word on how fathers can help in the early development of their young children.
“The earliest years of a child’s life are those when their brains development most rapidly, and when there is unique opportunity to maximise their learning skills, their emotional development and their social behaviours,” said UNICEF Representative to Azerbaijan, Edward Carwardine. “Providing children with the best possible start to life relies on creating every chance to stimulate their cognitive skills, their sense of exploration and discovery, as well as their health and nutrition – and parents, and others who care for young children, have an essential role to play.”
Effective early childhood development requires several key elements from which children should benefit in the first 1,000 days of their lives, says UNICEF. These include: good nutrition, responsive care and protection form all forms of violence or harm.
Enabling parents and others who care for children to provide these inputs requires sufficient time to spend with children – however, a lack of investment in family-friendly policies in some countries means that many parents struggle to balance work and other commitments with the most formative time in their children’s lives.
“As we celebrate childhood today and reaffirm the important place children hold in our lives and our hearts, it’s time to make time for children – that means providing parents and others with practical guidance on how support their child’s early development and to put in place specific family-friendly measures such as respecting mandatory maternity leave, introducing paternity leave, creating flexible working arrangements so mothers can breastfeed new-borns or benefit from childcare facilities in their workplace,” said Carwardine.

One-week training course titled "Create your business idea" started on 15 April and took place in Ismayilli, Balakan, Agjabedi, Aghdam, Neftchala, Goranboy, Saatli, Imishli, Zagatala, Aghdash and Barda districts of Azerbaijan.
Internationally certified trainers of the International Labour Organization delivered training sessions on the identification of business ideas and design of business plans, marketing, expenditure calculation, investment management, cash circulation and legal literacy.
These training courses will allow young people to use their skills and knowledge in any workplace regardless of their field of study, such as effective management and assessment of their businesses and plans.
It should be noted that more than 1,000 young people applied to AMAL through the project’s website (amal.gov.az) and only 400 of them successfully passed the second stage of the project.
AMAL is an initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture aimed at supporting young people living in rural areas to implement business ideas in the agricultural sector and stimulate their innovative methods. The project will inform young people about effective and environmentally friendly new agricultural models and management methods. It will also support to form the initial capital of young farmers.

Title: Unleashing the transformative capacity of the business sector for sustainable development
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
15 May 2019
With the inception of this inaugural dialogue platform, Azerbaijan sets out a strategic course to engage the country’s vibrant business community in a joint action with the Government to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time, from poverty reduction to gender equality and greener economy, to name a few.
Opening the inaugural event, Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan and Chairperson of the NCCSD Mr. Ali Ahmadov noted the crucial importance of building effective partnership frameworks for engaging the private sector in the implementation of the Global Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and emphasised that a robust advocacy and awareness raising play a central role in advancing the cooperation between the public and private sectors.
Achieving the SDGs is a unique business case, which presents an incentive for the private sector to invest in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda – the new global blueprint for a sustainable and inclusive growth, with its 17 accompanying Global Goals. The private sector is an indispensable contributor to the SDGs increasing employment opportunities worldwide, bringing innovative solutions to social and environmental problems and financing large-scale infrastructure projects. It is estimated that business is responsible for up to 60 percent of the gross domestic product of most developing countries while also generating 90 percent of jobs and 80 percent of capital inflows.
Speaking at the opening of the public-private sector dialogue on the SDGs today, UNDP Resident Representative a.i. Mr. Alessandro Fracassetti noted that: “Achieving the SDGs opens up significant market opportunities for business across key sectors of the world economy, including food and agriculture, cities, energy and materials, and health and well-being.”
In Azerbaijan, each of these industries has a tremendous potential to transform the lives of the vulnerable and to unleash the capacity of both large, medium-sized and small enterprises to increase their bottom-line while making a social impact like never before. Globally, these four areas of intervention represent around 60 percent of the real economy and are critical to delivering the SDGs.
Mr Fracassetti emphasised the importance of bridging the Government’s commitment to achieving the SDGs with the private sector’s capacity, drive for innovation and capital to accelerate their implementation. He added that “UNDP will continue to facilitate collaborative initiatives between public and private sectors that will help accelerate progress in areas critical to sustainable development in Azerbaijan, such as inclusive growth, renewable energy, enhanced public services delivery, youth and gender”.
The event featured stimulating panel discussions, with insights from private sector representatives about investment and partnership opportunities for the achievement of the SDGs, specifically focusing on inclusive labour markets, innovations, big data and gender equality.
It is anticipated that the first public-private sector dialogue on the SDGs launched today will become a platform for building synergies between the Government and the private sector resulting in the development of Azerbaijan’s first of its kind Roadmap or Action Plan on Public-Private Sector Engagement and Partnership for the SDGs.

The presentation ceremony brought together representatives of FAO Office in Azerbaijan, Ministry of Agriculture, the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs, experts from public and private sector, international organisations, female farmers and entrepreneurs.
In Azerbaijan, women account for more than 20% of the official employment statistics in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. However, they face a number of challenges such as gender pay gap; informality of jobs; triple work burden and poor access to social services. Women's access to productive resources, financial assets and lack of marketing opportunities prevent them from engaging in successful business strategies.
Through the project, technical support will be provided to strengthen gender-sensitive rural advisory services; to support women’s self-organisation and access to information networks; and to enhance visibility of women and girls’ roles in agriculture and rural livelihoods to achieve social and behavioural change.
Women entrepreneurs will be supported through improved access to markets and credits, and capacity building activities on business creation, expansion and development.
AFAQ project is implemented within the framework of FAO Azerbaijan Partnership Programme.

06 May 2019
Deputy Prime Minister Ali Hasanov, UN Resident Coordinator Ghulam Isaczai, Chairman of Azerbaijan’s State Committee for Refugees and IDPs Rovshan Rzayev, Japan’s Ambassador to Azerbaijan Teruyuki Katori, Chairman and CEO of Fuji Optical Co. Ltd. Dr. Akio Kanai spoke at the UNHCR- organised event.
The Japanese private company of Fuji Optical Co. Ltd. has conducted humanitarian missions to Azerbaijan every year since 2005. During such missions, Japanese optometrist specialists conduct eye-check for internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees and other vulnerable people and distribute free of charge eyeglasses to them. All missions have been led by the Doctor Akio Kanai, who is the winner of the 2006 Nansen Refugee Award and many other prestigious awards.
More than 2.8 million USD have already been spent by Fuji Optical Co. Ltd. during its humanitarian missions to Azerbaijan. Around 59 thousand pairs of high quality optic eyeglasses and other items have been brought to the country as in-kind donation to the UNHCR operations in Azerbaijan. In total, more than 31 thousand vulnerable individuals have benefited from free of charge vision screening services rendered during the missions.
This year, Fuji Optical Co. Ltd. has donated 3,300 pairs of eyeglasses and other vision and hearing aid items to UNHCR and intends to screen about 2,400 IDPs, refugees and asylum-seekers during the six-day vision tests and eyeglasses distribution which will take place from 7 to 13 May 2019 in Yevlakh, Goranboy and Baku. As in previous years, UNHCR Representation in Azerbaijan is in liaison with the central and local authorities in order to ensure the necessary conditions in place for the provision of the mentioned services.
Fuji Optical Co. Ltd. is also one of the significant private donors of UNHCR. Apart from the consistent in-kind donation by delivering optometric services and dispensing eyeglasses to UNHCR’s persons of concern since 1983, the Company also supports UNHCR’s global operations with un-earmarked cash allocations. The company has committed to donate UNHCR 3 million USD and started to transfer since 2013.
The prize money given to Dr. Akio Kanai as the Nansen Refugee Award in 2006 was donated by him back to UNHCR. That amount was spent to fund a water supply project for the Khojavend IDP community temporarily settled in Beylagan region. Furthermore, the prestigious “Yomiuri Shinbun International Cooperation” award in the amount of 5 million Yen (approximately 44 thousand USD) given to Dr. Akio Kanai by the Japanese Yomiuri newspaper was donated by him to the Azerbaijani Social Development Fund for IDPs in 2018. The donation was spent to purchase an agricultural machinery to be used by the IDPs who returned to the Jojug Marjanli village of Jabrayil.
Humanitarian efforts made by the Japanese Fuji Optical Co. Ltd. through its Vision Aid Mission to Azerbaijan have always been highly appreciated by UNHCR, Government of Azerbaijan, as well as by the communities which benefitted from the assistance. These efforts demonstrate understanding and sympathy towards the displacement challenge faced by Azerbaijan and the work of the UN.
UNHCR is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action, in cooperation with national authorities, to protect and find solutions for refugees worldwide.

Title: FAO launches a four-year project on pest management in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 May 2019
A four-year project aims to release of organic pollutants from contaminated sites and stockpiles of obsolete pesticides to be decreased and for countries to be able to better manage pests and pesticides.
“When we refer to pest and pesticide management, we are not only speaking of crop production or productivity but also how pests and pesticides impact small farmers, markets, trade and natural resources. This means the impact on the whole food system, affecting the availability of and access to healthy food,” said Tania Santivanez, FAO agricultural officer. She also noted that 900 metric tonnes of pollutants and obsolete pesticides should be destroyed safely, and pesticide-contaminated sites should be remediated.
At the same time, climate change and the intensification of agricultural production have increased the pressure on crops from pests and diseases. According to estimates, the annual losses caused by insects, weeds and diseases are around 20–40 percent. Although pesticides play an important role in reducing crop losses, they can negatively affect human health and the environment if misused.
“Through this project, FAO aims to increase the successful uptake of alternative solutions, promoting integrated pest management and agroecological approaches on key crops in the spirit of sustainable agriculture,” Santivanez said.
A road map of the project is planned to be designed with the participation of partners from governments, the private and civil sectors, and experts from universities. Supported by the Global Environment Facility, the project had held its alike workshop in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.
It is estimated that about half of the world’s obsolete pesticides can be found in the former Soviet Union, with many of them stored throughout Central Asia. As an important centre for agriculture, particularly on cotton production, the subregion was a heavy user of pesticides. That leaves behind inappropriate burial sites, regulatory and management deficits, and other issues.

24 April 2019
Representatives from the Ministry of Health, the Scientific Research Institute of Pediatrics, the Azerbaijan State Medical Doctors Improvement Institute, the Republican Centre for Hygiene and Epidemiology, the Centre for Public Health and Reforms, the Analytical Expertise Centre, the Ministry of Justice, the State Agency on Compulsory Medical Insurance, the Country Coordinating Commission on Healthcare Programmes and UN agencies attended the roundtable discussion.
This year, the purpose of the European Immunization Week, April 24-30, is to extend the vaccine coverage by raising the awareness of the benefits of vaccination. Since 2007, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Health every year joins WHO European Region in celebrating the EIW.
“Vaccines save millions of children from serious diseases and deaths every year. Let’s not forget that the reason we don’t see much of measles, rubella, whooping cough and similar diseases any more is thanks to the vaccines,” said Dr. Hande Harmanci, WHO Representative in Azerbaijan.
“If we don’t vaccinate our children, these diseases are around the corner, waiting to make a come-back. Remember that all the vaccines that the Ministry of Health provide in Azerbaijan are of good quality,” she emphasized.
Vaccination is a life-long investment in children’s health and well-being. Thanks to vaccines, most children and adults in the European Region are immune to measles, rubella, mumps, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and polio. An increasing number are also vaccinated against pneumococcal bacteria, human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus to prevent the severe forms of disease they can cause. With an average of 90% coverage across the European Region, more children received the second dose of measles containing vaccine in 2017 than ever before. However, despite the progress already made in reducing the threat of vaccine-preventable diseases, too many people are still missing out on the protective benefits of vaccination. More effort is needed to ensure that immunization coverage gaps are closed and that no one is left behind.
In 2018, over 82 000 people suffered from measles and 72 died of related complications in the European Region. Gaps in immunization coverage are an open door for contagious vaccine-preventable diseases, allowing them to spread among those who are not vaccinated.
The European Vaccine Action Plan (2015-2020) envisions a European Region free of vaccine-preventable diseases, where countries provide equitable access to high-quality, safe, affordable vaccines and immunization services throughout the life course. Making this vision a reality is vital to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and in particular Goal 3 “to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”.

UNDP Resident Representative a.i. Mr. Alessandro Fracassetti highlighted the importance of financial autonomy for women’s social and economic empowerment. “By boosting women’s access to new opportunities that will enable them to learn, grow and develop entrepreneurial businesses, countries can escape poverty and improve their economic conditions,” –said Mr. Fracassetti in his opening speech. “It is important to acknowledge that the opportunities offered by women entrepreneurs help grow domestic markets and increase employment prospects.”
First launched in Nakhchivan, the project activities will also be replicated in the Ismayilli region of Azerbaijan. In Nakhchivan, the activities will be facilitated in partnership with the Nakhchivan Division of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan and the Agrarkredit Joint-Stock Credit Organisation.
The project launch conference is part of a two-day official mission by the Heads of the European Union Delegation and the UNDP in Azerbaijan to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan.

Title: EU, UNDP and Government launch groundbreaking new programme to fight climate change in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
15 April 2019
The initiative, which was launched in response to the direct and existential threat of climate change, aims at supporting the six Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine) to develop and implement climate-related policies based on the countries’ commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Association and Partnership Agreements with the EU, the Eastern Partnership policy initiative "20 Deliverables for 2020,” (in particular the climate-related Deliverables 15 and 16) and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (in particular SDG 13 on “Climate Action”). The project is funded by the European Union and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme.
The national launch of the regional project today offered an opportunity for government officials and the representatives of various stakeholder groups to discuss priorities and next steps for “EU4Climate” implementation in Azerbaijan until 2022.
Speaking at the opening of the EU4Climate project, Ms. Simona Gatti, Minister-Counsellor/Head of Cooperation at the European Union Delegation to Azerbaijan noted: “EU4Climate demonstrates the strategic partnership of the European Union with the Government of Azerbaijan in order to jointly take an action against climate change. It will support the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and improve climate policy and legislation in line with the European Union and international standards”.
The new initiative is tapping on a number of climate-related challenges facing the countries of the Eastern Partnership region, from water and energy shortage to energy intensity and inefficiency resulting from overreliance of some countries on fossil fuels for domestic energy consumption demand. Climate change makes urban and rural communities more vulnerable, while putting more financial burden on national governments.
“As the largest implementer of climate action in the UN System, UNDP works with countries around the world to turn their climate goals into action,” – UNDP Resident Representative a.i., Mr. Alessandro Fracassetti said. ”In Azerbaijan, UNDP has been successfully partnering with the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources for many years on a number of projects tackling environmental sustainability and climate change. I particularly welcome the financial support of the EU which will help Azerbaijan in building a more robust climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and practices”
The regional project will be financed by the European Union with EUR 8.8 million. In Azerbaijan, EU funds of around EUR 830,000 will go towards the implementation of nationally important climate change policies and practices.
The EU4Climate aims to build –for the first time in Azerbaijan – national capacities to integrate low-emission and climate-resilient actions into national development plans as well as align climate change legislation with EU standards. Long-term low greenhouse gas emission strategies will be developed as part of this initiative with a forward-looking vision to serve the climate action agenda in all six EaP countries till 2050. The project will establish concrete industry-specific guidelines for the implementation of the Paris Agreement across various sectors of the economy, including agriculture, construction and energy in each partner country.
In all six countries, the project will contribute to accelerating the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 accompanying Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, the project will directly support the implementation of SDG 13: Climate Action. Indirectly, EU4Climate will contribute to the achievement of other SDGs related to poverty, food and water security, urban and rural resilience, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, responsible production and consumption and strengthening partnerships for development.
The EU4Climate project will also build upon the results and lessons learnt from previously implemented ClimaEast Programme, which received substantial funding from the EU in 2013-2017 and supported climate change mitigation and adaptation in the EU Neighbours East countries –including Azerbaijan –as well as Russia.

Title: Third National Model United Nations gets underway as over 230 youth step in the shoes of diplomats
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
05 April 2019
The 3rd MilliMUN is held in the framework of a two-year project funded by the Ministry of Youth and Sports and implemented by UNDP which was signed last year to help support youth engagement in global policy debates and encourage innovative solutions to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The project also seeks to further promote and advance the Model UN traditions in Azerbaijan, with focus on strengthened youth participation and volunteerism.
The Minister of Youth and Sports, Mr. Azad Rahimov, hosted the 3rd MilliMUN with participation of senior officials from the Ministry of Education, Ecology and Natural Resources, Transport, Communications and High Technologies, and by the State Committee for Women, Families and Children.
Noting an immense importance of Model UN simulation programmers for Azerbaijani youth, Mr. Rahimov told young delegates: “I trust that the knowledge and skills you will gain and further improve during the 3rd MilliMUN will help you earn confidence and capabilities you need to represent our country and the youth both at the national and international levels no matter where you decide to pursue your career in the future.”
Speaking at the opening ceremony, UNDP Resident Representative a.i., Mr. Alessandro Fracassetti, said: “We are partnering with the government to support its effort to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs, each of them covering one global challenge of our time, from poverty to quality education, decent work, gender inequalities, environmental pollution and climate change, and many more.”
“In all these areas, —Mr. Fracassetti added addressing the MilliMUN youth delegates — “we can benefit from your ideas and enthusiasm. It is incumbent on all of us to help create more compassionate, inclusive and peaceful societies where No One is Left Behind.”
The 3rd National Model UN will offer four days of excitement to university students and graduates who will be tasked to assume the role of UN diplomats at the mock General Assembly, UN Security Council and UN committees.  Simulations this year will include a broad range of topics, from a discussion of the political situation in an African country to reducing the gender pay gap for men and men, to transitioning to digital citizenry and measuring the impact of the textile industry on environment.
The first ever Model UN Conference in Azerbaijan was organised by UNDP together with the Ministry back in 2013. In 2014-2016, following the successful cooperation between UNDP and Government of Azerbaijan, a new project was launched aiming to create the national platform for the Model United Nations –MilliMUN. The year 2016 saw the first edition of the national chapter of the Model UN, followed by the second MilliMUN in 2017.
The result of all these joint efforts was that over years, Azerbaijan saw three national Model UN Conferences, a MUN Conference in Nakhchivan, two Model UN Summer Schools in Ismayilli and Dashkesan, while UNDP and the Ministry of Youth and Sports also supported an impressive array of university-level MUN conferences led by enthusiastic youth groups at various MUN Clubs. Earlier in 2018, the new project also launched the first ever cohort of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Youth Ambassadors in Azerbaijan, each representing one global goal. The SDGs Youth Ambassadors will support the work of the state institutions involved with the SDGs, assist in spreading information about actions taken at the local, national, and international levels and will contribute to the preparations of national reports on SDG implementation.

Title: Azerbaijan to revise TB legislation in line with new WHO recommendations
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 March 2019
WTB is a worldwide call to action and a means to mobilize political and social commitment. This campaign aims to raise awareness among the public and policymakers regarding TB as it still remains an epidemic disease in most parts of the world, and a public health problem in developed countries.
“TB is preventable and curable; the time to take action is now to end TB by 2030. If we don’t act rapidly and decisively, the drug-resistant forms of the disease will increase their hold on Europe,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
“Despite the challenges and threats that we face, I believe that Europe has the full potential to lead the way. We have science and technology, skilled health professionals and high-level political commitment to leaving no-one behind – we have got what it takes to end TB,” she concluded.
Tuberculosis is a major public health challenge in the WHO European Region, including Azerbaijan. In 2017, 275 000 people fell ill with TB in the region. In Azerbaijan, in 2017, 3871 people were diagnosed with TB, of whom 2949 were new pulmonary tuberculosis cases. Multi-drug Resistance TB (MDR-TB) treatment success rate is 59% in the country, 57.2 % in the European Region, and 54% globally in 2017. MDR-TB is one of the key drivers of the TB epidemic in Europe.
The recent United Nations High-Level Meeting on TB, held in September 2018, brought hope to the world as global leaders stepped up their commitment to end TB by 2030, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
WHO supports Azerbaijan in taking important steps in addressing TB. Since 2014, the Medical Department of Azerbaijan’s Justice Ministry has been a WHO Collaborating Centre on TB Control in prisons. This is the only centre of its kind in the world. The centre has been at the forefront of TB control with modern infection prevention and control measures, and the introduction of rapid diagnostic services. WHO Collaborating Centres are credible institutions, designated by the Director-General to carry out activities in support of the organisation's programmes.

14 March 2019
Our world faces a paradox:  challenges are increasingly interconnected, yet responses are fragmented.  From environmental threats and armed conflicts to rising inequality and intolerance, multilateralism is needed more than ever.  But simply saying this is not enough.  We need to show that we are mobilizing solutions that respond to people’s fears and anxieties, and that build fair globalization that works for all.  That is what the United Nations strives to do every day: from peacekeeping to humanitarian assistance; from defending human rights to promoting sustainable development.
One looming threat can undo all our good work - climate disruption.  Climate change is running much faster than our efforts to slow it. I am convening a climate action summit in September in New York to raise ambition to meet this global existential challenge. I will count on your support in both sounding the alarm and highlighting the opportunities of climate action.
Cooperation with other multilateral institutions, regional organizations, civil society, the private sector, and other stakeholders is essential.  In that spirit of partnership, I welcome your commitment to dialogue and offer my best wishes for a fruitful meeting.

Title: UNDP, UNFPA sign programme to improve livelihoods of women, people with disabilities and war veterans
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
12 February 2019
The programme, which was developed at the initiative of the First Vice-President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, will help the Government produce gender and age-disaggregated data on disability and allow it to design inclusive policies for the employment of war veterans and women and girls living with disabilities. It will also foster positive attitudes and perceptions to eliminate stigma and discrimination towards vulnerable population groups.
Jointly funded by the Government of Azerbaijan, UNDP and UNFPA the Programme is worth around USD 1 million and is expected to provide an accessible and inclusive environment for personal and professional growth of up to 3,000 vulnerable people, including those who lived through traumatic experiences of war.
The programme is expected to be a life-changing experience for a country in which more than 6% of the population are people with disabilities and over 50,000 persons were left with war-related injuries, multiple forms of physical disabilities and mental problems as a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. A new state-of the art Virtual Skills Development and Training Lab (V-Lab) will be launched for women with disabilities and war veterans offering them access to knowledge, information and employment opportunities through the use of modern ICT.  A model art school will also be established in Baku to promote social inclusion and offer a wide range of innovation start-up and business development platforms to women and girls with and without disability as well as to veterans of war.
Awareness-raising and grassroots advocacy campaigns will be organised throughout the country to eliminate stigma towards persons with disabilities. This will also include sensitising the country’s top decision-makers, members of parliament, business executives, who are also potential employers, and the broader public on the importance of creating disability-friendly premises, attitudes and policies.
To address existing gaps in empirical data, conceptually new methodological guidelines will be developed to guide the integration of age and gender-disaggregated disability data in national monitoring and reporting schemes. The project will also improve the capacity-building of government institutions to ensure that such data can later be produced independently.
The programme will be implemented in the cities of Baku, Salyan and Masalli in close partnership with the State Committee for Family, Women and Children’s Affairs and the State Statistics Committee. It will entail close collaboration with local authorities, the public and private employers, media, grassroots communities and not-for-profit organisations.
The new collaborative framework is in line with the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and will address a number of Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 8, which aims to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for persons with disabilities. Echoing Goal 10, it will aim to reduce existing inequalities by promoting the social, economic and political inclusion of all, including persons with disabilities. The new programme will also contribute to Goal 17, by highlighting capacity-building support to countries to increase the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by disability.

Both trainings for trainers will be conducted by the international experts within the project on Expanding Quality Inclusive Education for Children with Disabilities in Azerbaijan implemented by UNICEF in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and funded by the European Union.
“Inclusion of children with disabilities in quality education will not only have a major impact on their potential for learning and development, but will also challenge the misconception that children with disabilities cannot play an active part in the life of their communities,” said UNICEF Representative to Azerbaijan, Mr. Edward Carwardine. “These trainings will focus on building the skills of teachers to deliver high quality inclusive education in mainstream classrooms and is part of the process that we hope will transform education for every child.”
The university and school teachers who participated in the training will in their turn, train 300 university teachers, over 1,300 students of 5 pedagogical universities and over 10,000 primary school teachers in Baku, Ganja, Sumgayit, Guba, Sheki, Agjabedi and Gazakh during 2019-2020.
At the next stage, the new training programmes on Inclusive Education will be integrated into the curriculum of the national teacher training institutes. The project will enable national capacity development and create a new generation of teachers able to deliver inclusive education at regular schools of Azerbaijan.

WHO representative stated that influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was a virus causing seasonal flu in the last 10 years. "As every year, this is a seasonal flu, not a swine flu," said Dr Harmanci.
It should be noted that WHO has a global surveillance system for influenza viruses (GISRS) in all member states, including in Azerbaijan. Laboratories operating in in these countries provide entries on viruses. Currently, influenza registered in some countries is considered as a typical seasonal flu in a low and moderate intensity.
Vaccination is considered the best protection against influenza among high-risk groups. This group includes up to five-years-old children, persons over 65 years, pregnant women, people with chronic illnesses and healthcare workers.
To avoid flu, and to prevent the spread of flu, it is recommended to wash hands with soap regularly, to cover mouth and nasals while coughing or sneezing, as well as not to touch eye, nose or mouth, and to isolate when not feeling well at first stage of flu and not to be in close contact with sick people.

Title: Effective system of Robson classification for reducing caesarean section rates in focus of WHO-supported event
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 January 2019
The event aims to introduce the Robson classification, a tool to compare and monitor caesarean section rates that has increased both in the world and in Azerbaijan in recent years. The participants will also learn about its further implementation in healthcare facilities.
In 2015, WHO proposed the use of the Robson classification as a global standard for assessing, monitoring and comparing caesarean section rates both within healthcare facilities and among them.
WHO considers that the implementation of Robson classification will help to identify and analyse the groups of women which contribute to overall CS rates and assess the quality of care by analysing outcomes by groups of women. It will also contribute to raise staff awareness about the importance of this data, interpretation and use.
Caesarean section is one of the most common surgeries in the world, with rates continuing to rise, particularly in high- and middle-income countries. Although it can save lives, caesarean section is often performed without medical need, putting women and their babies at-risk of short- and long-term health problems. The WHO underscores the importance of focusing on the needs of the patient, and recommends this procedure only when there is a medical necessity.

Azerbaijan and FAO have implemented 53 projects in the last 23 years. The implementation of another six projects are underway and four are planned to commence soon.
Speaking at the event, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Europe and Central Asia Vladimir Rakhmanin noted that the partnership between Azerbaijan and FAO successfully developed over the past 20 years paving the way to the opening of the FAO Partnership and Liaison Office in Baku.
An agreement on the establishment of FAO-Azerbaijan Partnership Programme (FAPP) was signed in May 2015, during FAO Director-General’s visit to the country and a US$10 million cooperation framework was set up for 2016-2020.

Title: Government of Azerbaijan, UNDP to create 500 new businesses for people with disabilities

18 December 2018
The five-year project – ‘Creating Inclusive and Decent Jobs for Socially Vulnerable Groups’ – will enhance the capacities of unemployed job-seekers among the less fortunate segments of society and introduce them to a wide array of opportunities in the formal labour market.
The project, which is funded by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection and UNDP, will involve in its first phase an unprecedented and ambitious plan to support 500 households with a person with disability nationwide in the establishment of sustainable businesses of their own.
Up to 500 candidates with the best business plans will receive financial and technical support to facilitate the registration and formalisation process for these new establishments. The support will include the provision of necessary equipment and raw material to businesses.
Emphasising the Government’s commitment and continuous leadership in disability inclusion today, Minister of Labour and Social Protection of the Republic of Azerbaijan Mr. Sahil Babayev noted that successful history of partnership with UNDP was crucial for all the progressive improvements and reforms in this area. Noting the importance of joint activities, Minister Babayev also spoke about milestone achievements of another collaborative work with UNDP, which, similar to the current project, also tackles employment needs of vulnerable population groups. Mr. Babayev added that this project, "Promoting Innovation and Employment", helps young people to acquire necessary job search skills and, through training centres in Baku and other parts of the country, facilitates greater employment opportunities for the youth within a fairly short period of time.
Within the new project signed today, UNDP will provide technical assistance, capacity development and operational support aimed at strengthening the capacity of employment practitioners to design and implement effective Active Labour Market Measures (ALMMs). A team of designated mentors and trainers will also provide individual support to people with disabilities after the registration of their businesses while the project team will be available to provide coaching throughout the process.
Speaking at the signing ceremony, UNDP Resident Representative a.i., Mr. Alessandro Fracassetti, noted that self-employment projects such as this can show that entrepreneurship can work for all. “Inclusive employment can significantly accelerate the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the spirt of leaving no one behind”, he added.
The project is part of a larger self-employment programme implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Azerbaijan since 2016.

10 December 2018
The launch event brought together some 80 participants from the government agencies, United Nations, Parliament, civil society, academia and the media.
The exhibition highlights what UDHR means for people in their everyday life and how it empowers them by establishing the equal dignity and worth of every person. It also marks the conclusion of this year’s 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based, the international campaign that calls to end violence against women and girls around the world.
“The principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration are as relevant today as they were in 1948. They call us to stand up for our own rights and those of others and to uphold the rights that protect us all,” Ghulam Isaczai, UN Resident Coordinator in Azerbaijan, said in his opening speech.
Opening session also included speeches from Elmira Suleymanova, Human Rights Commissioner of Azerbaijan (Ombudsperson), Bahar Muradova, vice-speaker of the Milli Majlis (Parliament), and a video message by Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The exhibition will give visitors an opportunity to explore each of 30 articles of the Universal Declaration in cartoons submitted by cartoonists all over the world and see a series of posters created by 40 renowned graphic designers, illustrating their perception of human rights and inviting everyone to stand up for human rights. Further, visitors will be invited to look at and collect various human rights-related publications and educational materials printed by UN agencies.
Human Rights Day is observed every year on 10 December – the day the United Nations General Assembly adopted, in 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Drafted by representatives of diverse legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, the Declaration sets out universal values and a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. It is the most translated document in the world, available in more than 500 languages.

20 November 2018
The workshop brought together main gender focal points of line ministries, involved in crafting the report.
The participants were informed in detail about the rules, processes and guidelines regarding preparation of the periodic report on CEDAW implementation. The workshop was delivered by a renowned international expert Ms. Mary Shanthi Dairiam, who elaborated on the CEDAW Committee’s functions to assess state party compliance with obligations under CEDAW by reviewing the state party reports, issue concluding observations, general recommendations and review the cases under the Optional Protocol. She also provided information on the core principles of the Convention.
Azerbaijan has submitted its fifth periodic report back in 2015. Along with welcoming the progress achieved since the consideration in 2009 of the state party’s fourth periodic report in undertaking legislative reforms, CEDAW Committee urged state party to take several important steps including through the adoption of a multi-sectorial plan of action aimed at eliminating the phenomenon of son-preference, the national strategy on prevention of domestic violence and the national action plan on prevention of domestic violence, and setting a timeframe for the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence.
The CEDAW Convention, adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly, is often described as the international bill of rights for women or the “Women’s Convention”. Azerbaijan ratified the Convention in 1995.
Countries that have ratified or acceded to the Convention are legally bound to put its provisions into practice and to move beyond “de jure” equality and to ensure an equality of results – equality which is felt by the average woman and man. They are also committed to submit national reports - an initial report a year after ratifying the Convention and then regular reports every four years - on measures they have taken to comply with treaty obligations. Azerbaijani government is expected to submit its next periodic report in March 2019.

Title: Four years into its #IBelong Campaign to end statelessness, UNHCR calls for more resolute action by states
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
13 November 2018
Important results have been achieved since November 2014 when UNHCR’s #IBelong campaign began. More than 166,000 stateless people have acquired or had their nationality confirmed, 20 states have acceded to the Statelessness Conventions bringing the total number of parties to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons to 91 and 73 to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. Nine states have established or improved statelessness determination procedures, six states reformed their nationality laws and another two have eliminated gender discrimination preventing women from passing on their nationality to their children. National plans to end statelessness have been formally adopted in nine countries.
Yet, despite these accomplishments, millions remain stateless and living in limbo around the world, with the majority to be found in countries in Asia and Africa. It is difficult to determine with precision how many people are stateless or at risk of statelessness worldwide. In 2017, approximately 70 countries reported 3.9 million stateless individuals. But UNHCR estimates that this is only a fraction of the total – the true number could be as much as three times higher.
“Today I call on politicians, governments and legislators around the world to act now, to take and support decisive action to eliminate statelessness globally by 2024,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. “Humanly, ethically and politically it is the right thing to do. Every person on this planet has the right to nationality and the right to say I BELONG.”
Statelessness has many causes, but the biggest driver is problems in nationality laws, including discrimination. The impact on individuals and their families is immediate and can be dire. Statelessness means a life without a nationality and everything that comes with it. Being stateless can mean a life without education, without medical care, or legal employment. It can mean a life without the ability to get married, own a home, to move freely - a life on the margins of society, without prospects, or hope.
“Stateless people still face huge barriers to exercising fundamental human rights”, Grandi said. “Eradicating statelessness requires eliminating discrimination from nationality laws and practices. States like Kenya, Kyrgyzstan and Thailand are paving the way, showing that with political will and commitment, and concerted national efforts, the lives of tens of thousands of people can be transformed through the acquisition of nationality.”
Only 25 countries around the world retain gender discrimination in their nationality laws that prevent mothers from conferring their nationality to their children on an equal basis as men - with Madagascar and Sierra Leone being the most recent countries to change these laws.  In almost every region of the world, a declaration and action plan to address statelessness has been launched.  These regional initiatives are driving blocs of nations to work with each other to confront and resolve this human rights problem.  Among the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 16 is the elimination of statelessness - with its goal of ensuring legal identity for all by 2030.
With a view to boosting the capacity of parliaments and legislators’ to effectively prevent and reduce statelessness and identify and protect stateless persons, UNHCR in cooperation with the International Parliamentary Union is releasing a new handbook on “Good Practices in Nationality Laws for the Prevention and Reduction of Statelessness” http://www.refworld.org/docid/5be41d524.html.

12 November 2018
Key experts from ministries of Health, Agriculture and Justice, as well as Food Safety Agency, Medical University and representatives of UN agencies in Azerbaijan attended the event.
They discussed the role and responsibilities of relative stakeholders, including food agencies, universities and mass media in awareness raising initiatives on antibiotics.
The event is implemented within the framework of global initiative of WHO, FAO Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Sub-Regional Representation for Central Asia for WAAW 2018.
Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat to global health. As a result of infection with multidrug resistant bacteria an estimated 700,000 people die each year worldwide, while European Union alone accounts for 33,000 deaths each year.
To combat antimicrobial resistance “One Health” approach has been endorsed that is considered the only workable way to make real progress in the region and the world.
The One Health approach recognises that the health of humans, animals and ecosystems are interconnected. It involves applying a coordinated, collaborative, multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach to address potential or existing risks that originate at the animal-human-ecosystems interface.

Bringing together key experts from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Justice, the Medical University and the Post Graduate Institute of Azerbaijan, the event aims to disseminate knowledge and information on the new approaches to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of TB in line with WHO recommendations.
Participants will also discuss epidemiological situation and response actions to TB in the WHO European region and in Azerbaijan, as well as diagnosis and treatment features of drug-resistant TB, implementation of new and modified TB drugs and short-term treatment regimes.
WHO passed a resolution on new Global Tuberculosis Strategy in May 2014. The Strategy aims to end the global TB epidemic, with targets to reduce TB deaths by 95% and to cut new cases by 90% between 2015 and 2035, and to ensure that no family is burdened with catastrophic expenses due to TB.
WHO supports member states, including Azerbaijan, in adaptation of the Strategy and targets at the country level, as well as implementation of the main components such as early diagnosis of TB; treatment of all people with TB including drug-resistant TB; supporting patients support; co-infection with HIV; and prevention and vaccination against TB.

29 October 2018
The four-year project aims to provide safe and consistent water supplies for over 8,000 families in eight districts through the renovation of 40 kahrizes, a traditional, sustainable water supply system. Building upon IOM’s successful past experiences and unique expertise, the project’s activities will not be limited to the rehabilitation of kahrizes only, but will also support the Government of Azerbaijan to establish a national master plan for kahriz revitalization; strengthen the local capacity of kahriz engineers and kankans (kahriz technicians); and support IDPs’, especially women IDPs’, small business start-ups through assistance to the creation of micro and small enterprises. IOM’s intervention strategy will put women at the centre of the project’s focus as primary beneficiaries and thus managers of water supplies.
“While the environment has always played an impact on people’s mobility and where populations concentrate, we are only now beginning to better understand the complex relationship that exists between the environment, climate change, and migration. As a pioneer of kahriz rehabilitation in Azerbaijan, we are thrilled to be able to continue our work in this field and to benefit thousands of rural families across Azerbaijan,” said Serhan Aktoprak, Chief of IOM Mission in Azerbaijan.
Kumok Park, Country Director of KOICA Azerbaijan, said: “People should be the centre of our development work. Economic and social progress should be achieved for the prosperity of humanity. Peace should be in place and sustained in pursuing this prosperity. Kahriz project is perfectly in line with the KOICA’s 3P (People, Prosperity and Peace) philosophies and I am pleased that KOICA could support this project, working together with IOM.”
This project will also contribute to Azerbaijan’s efforts to follow through on the principles of the upcoming Global Compact on Migration (GCM) and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through:

Title: UNHCR welcomes Presidential Decree related to issuance of Convention Travel Documents to Refugees
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 October 2018
UNHCR Representative Guido Ambroso said that the issuance of the Presidential Decree is a substantial step forward in the promotion of fundamental human rights, in particular freedom of movement for refugees.
“We highly commend the efforts of our governmental counterparts, namely the State Migration Service and the Cabinet of Ministers Office, which have resulted in the signature of this decree by the President of Azerbaijan. Now we are optimistic that expected legislative amendments to introduce a humanitarian status complementary to refugee status will also be approved very soon. These amendments should secure a legal status for all persons in need of international protection,” the Representative said.
The Presidential decree allows the authorities to issue machine readable passports compliant with the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organisation to refugees recognised in Azerbaijan. Although there used to be a legislative basis for issuance of travel documents to refugees, in practice however refugees had never received such documents because they lacked the necessary technical specifications. By obtaining Convention Travel Documents refugees will be able to travel to other countries for various purposes, such as business, education, medical treatment, family visits or even tourism, instead of just being confined in their country of asylum, Azerbaijan.
UNHCR established its presence in Azerbaijan in late 1992 and has been supporting the Government in protecting and assisting over one million refugees, asylum seekers and IDPs in the country. The organisation attempts to ensure that all persons in need of protection enjoy their rights and have an opportunity to contribute to the economic, social and cultural life of the society in Azerbaijan.

Title: United Nations Population Fund produced a video dedicated to International Girl Child Day

11 October 2018
The PSA demonstrates how much girls can contribute to society if they are given a chance to born and emphasises that selective abortions are derived from gender-based discrimination and stereotypes that limit women’s participation in society.
11 October has been marked as the International Day of the Girl in most countries. The day, established since 2012 by the UN General Assembly decision, aims to highlight protection of the rights of girls, their access to health, education and other opportunities, as well as to increase attention to gender equality in society.
Unfortunately, the attitude towards girl child is not unambiguous in Azerbaijan. Several dominant stereotypes in society make girls undesirable in family. Although the biological norm of the gender ratio is usually 105-106, due to such attitude this number has reached 114 in Azerbaijan. If we review experiences of other countries facing the same situation, it becomes apparent that Azerbaijani society is highly likely to face various problems hard to prevent.
Thus, UNFPA has launched several projects in order to prevent gender-based abortions. Young men and fathers are involved to these projects for the first time in the country. Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population, Ministry of Youth and Sport and the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs also support these initiatives as main partners.
UNFPA produced this video under the framework of Global Programme on “Preventing preference of boy child and promoting values of girls” with the financial support of the European Union.

Title: WHO collaborating centre in Baku welcomes a delegation from Uzbekistan for a study tour on prevention and treatment of tuberculosis in prison
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 September 2018
The delegation, consisting of 13 professionals from penitentiary system, civil society and WHO Office in Uzbekistan, will also participate at the training session on prevention and treatment of tuberculosis in prison.
“Justice Ministry’s Medical Department made significant progress in combating tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) by working with international organisations. WHO/Europe acknowledged the Department’s best practice in implementing the ‘Stop TB Strategy’ in the penitentiary sector,” said Dr. Hande Harmanci, head of the WHO Country Office in Azerbaijan.
Based on these positive experiences WHO supported establishment of the collaborating centre on tuberculosis in prison in 2014, which is the only WHO-supported centre of its kind in the world. It promotes WHO strategies and guidelines through high-quality, evidence-based education on tuberculosis control in prisons, provides support to WHO and gives technical assistance to national tuberculosis programmes worldwide, including programmes in prisons.
Tuberculosis is a contagious disease that spreads when a person breathes in bacteria breathed out by an infected person. It is mainly caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. About one third of the world’s population is infected with the latent form of the disease, and one-tenth of infected people become ill with active tuberculosis during their lifetimes. Europe’s tuberculosis burden is among the lowest in the world, but the number of new MDR-TB cases is the highest.
WHO Regional Office for Europe and WHO Country Offices are continuously lending support to WHO collaborating centre by means of attracting study participants from around the world, involvement of international experts, provision of handouts and materials, facilitation and organisation of training courses and study tours.

The SDGs can only be realised if countries show strong commitment to working together, including through regional projects that aim to improve livelihoods and create safe grounds for the mobility of people and goods across borders, in a global call to foster peace, security and free trade. In this regard, moving towards more robust, bilateral, regional and international cooperation in border management, Azerbaijan and Georgia have taken a proactive approach to improving and modernising integrated border management systems at joint customs control checkpoints, which connect the two countries of the South Caucasus.

Title: Mediterranean crossings deadlier than ever, new UNHCR report shows
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
04 September 2018

UNHCR’s new Desperate Journeys report shows that more than 1,600 people have died or gone missing while attempting to reach Europe so far this year.
The report shows that while the total number of people arriving in Europe has fallen, the rate of deaths has risen sharply, particularly for those crossing via the Mediterranean Sea. In the Central Mediterranean, one person died or went missing for every 18 people who crossed to Europe between January and July 2018, compared to one death for every 42 people who crossed in the same period in 2017.
“This report once again confirms the Mediterranean as one of the world’s deadliest sea crossings,” said UNHCR’s Director of the Bureau for Europe, Pascale Moreau. “With the number of people arriving on European shores falling, this is no longer a test of whether Europe can manage the numbers, but whether Europe can muster the humanity to save lives.”
In recent months, UNHCR, together with the UN Migration Agency, IOM, has called for a predictable, regional approach for the rescue and disembarkation of people in distress in the Mediterranean Sea.
UNHCR is also calling on Europe to increase access to safe and legal pathways for refugees, including by increasing resettlement places and removing obstacles to family reunification – helping to provide alternatives to potentially deadly journeys.
The report also outlines the dangers refugees face while traveling along land routes to or within Europe. Noting the steps that some have taken to prevent refugees and migrants from accessing their territory, the report urges States to grant those seeking international protection readily-available access to asylum procedures. It also appeals to States to strengthen mechanisms to protect children traveling alone and seeking asylum.
Best-selling author UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Khaled Hosseini, himself a former refugee from Afghanistan, has published a new illustrated book, coinciding with the three-year anniversary of Kurdi’s death. ‘Sea Prayer’ is dedicated to the thousands of refugees who have perished around the world while fleeing war, violence and persecution.
“When I saw those devastating images of the body of Alan Kurdi, my heart shattered,” said Hosseini. “Yet, just three years on and despite thousands more people losing their lives at sea, our collective memory and urgency to do better seems to have faded.”
In June and July 2018, Hosseini visited Lebanon and Italy and saw the devastating impact on families who have lost relatives while attempting to reach Europe.
“In Sicily I visited a lonely, unkempt cemetery full of unmarked graves of people – including many children – who have drowned on journeys just like Alan’s in the past years,” said Hosseini. “Each one of those people is now reduced to just a number, a code on a grave, but they were all men, women and children who dared to dream of a brighter future. Three years on from Alan’s death, it’s time we came together to do more to prevent future tragedies and let our friends, families, communities and governments know that we stand with refugees.”
The full report can be accessed here
Key stats
•   Along the Central Mediterranean route, so far this year there have been ten incidents in which 50 or more people died, most after departing from Libya. Seven of these incidents have been since June.
•   Along the sea route from North Africa to Spain, more than 300 people have perished this year already, a marked increase on 2017 - when 200 deaths were recorded in the whole year.
•   In April this year, when over 1,200 reached Spain by sea, the rate of deaths climbed as high as one death for every 14 persons arriving in Spain by sea.
•   More than 78 deaths of refugees and migrants have been recorded so far along land routes in Europe or at Europe’s borders compared to 45 in the same period last year.

Title: On World Humanitarian Day, the Secretary-General calls on global leaders to use their power to protect people in conflicts
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
19 August 2018
This year’s commemoration marks the fifteenth anniversary since the attack on the United Nations in Baghdad, Iraq, in which 22 of our colleagues were killed. Since that tragedy, which led to this day’s designation as World Humanitarian Day, over 4,000 aid workers have been killed, injured, detained or kidnapped. That is an average of 300 fellow humanitarians killed, detained or injured every year.
Civilians in conflict zones also continue to be killed and maimed, deliberately or in indiscriminate attacks. Last year, the United Nations recorded the deaths or injuries of more than 26,000 civilians in attacks in just six countries: Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen.
Around the world, conflict is forcing record numbers of people from their homes, with over 65 million people now displaced. Children are recruited by armed groups and used to fight. Women are abused and humiliated. As humanitarian workers deliver aid and medical workers provide for those in need, they are all too often targeted or treated as threats.
On World Humanitarian Day, I call on global leaders to do everything in their power to protect people caught up in conflict.
And I call on all who are concerned to join our campaign at worldhumanitarianday.org to show that civilians are #NotATarget.
Together, we stand in solidarity with civilians in conflict, and with the humanitarian workers who risk their lives to help them.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
30 July 2018
The conference brought together government officials, members of the diplomatic corps, civil society organizations and other experts to strengthen cooperation to address this challenging cross-border issue.
In his opening remarks, United States Chargé d’Affaires William Gill shared the story of an Azerbaijani survivor of human trafficking and said, “When we talk about ending trafficking in persons, it is important to remember we are talking about human beings – each one deserving of respect for their fundamental, inalienable human dignity.”
IOM Chief of Mission Serhan Aktoprak spoke about the importance of ending trafficking in persons. “One of the key challenges standing before us today is supply chain engagement: companies can and must take responsibility for harm perpetrated against their workers and ensure that all possible steps are taken to assist victims of trafficking in their recovery – which they can do by working closely with governments, civil society organizations, international organizations, and the victims themselves,” he said.
Mr. Samir Zeynalov, Deputy Head of the Main Department on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Mr. Hidayat Rustamov, Head of Khachmaz Regional Migration Department of the State Migration Service, also gave remarks at the event.
With the financial support of the U.S. government, including USAID, IOM works with the Azerbaijani government to help prevent trafficking in persons, prosecute traffickers, and help survivors of trafficking and their families.  With USAID funding, IOM has supported three civil society shelters in Azerbaijan to help vulnerable women and children, including survivors of domestic violence, exploitation and trafficking in persons. The shelters provide psychological, medical and legal support to help survivors of trafficking rebuild their lives and reintegrate into society. The three shelters supported by the project have provided direct assistance to over 118 trafficking survivors, and over 1,211 individuals vulnerable to trafficking in persons.

28 July 2018
Hepatitis B and C are chronic infections that may not show symptoms for a long period, sometimes years or decades. At least 60% of liver cancer cases are due to late testing and treatment of viral hepatitis B and C. Low coverage of testing and treatment is the most important gap to be addressed in order to achieve the global elimination goals by 2030.
WHO will focus on the theme: "Test. Treat. Hepatitis" for World Hepatitis Day 2018 events. WHO events and activities can aim to achieve the following objectives globally, in regions and in countries:
WHO and the Government of Mongolia will hold a series of events in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia to commemorate the World Hepatitis Day 2018. The events will engage high-level leaders, advocates and patient representatives from global, regional and national organizations, highlighting the innovative solutions and partnerships needed in scaling up hepatitis testing and treatment services, as well as celebrating the country's championing experience in the global hepatitis response.
Timely testing and treatment of viral hepatitis B and C can save lives.

Title: Towards sustainable development: promoting rural women’s leadership and economic empowerment

05 July 2018
Gender equality and empowerment, including through financial autonomy and entrepreneurial maturity, is one of the 17 SDGs, yet women today own only 30% of formal small and medium-sized enterprises, while 70% of these women do not have access to the capital they need to grow, and this disproportion is even higher for women living in rural communities.
In Azerbaijan, where rural women represent 77 percent of the total women population of the country, engrained cultural stereotypes oftentimes reiterate the image of women solely as homemakers, a problem faced in most rural communities of Azerbaijan. While women strive to play a more integrated role in society they frequently struggle to find jobs outside the home. More often than not, the lack of basic literacy skills or access to job vacancy resources only amplifies their challenge, preventing them from exploring opportunities outside of what is traditionally expected.

This is Dr Tedros’s first official visit to the country in his capacity as WHO Director-General.
The Conference, which starts on 5 July, will look into how SDGs can be achieved at the national level and how the country can synchronize SDGs global targets and indicators with its national priorities and development agenda. The meeting will also focus on a range of achievements already being made in the national health sector in the process of SDGs implementation.
The event is a preparatory step towards the High-level SDGs Conference planned in Baku for October 2018, which is expected to adopt the “Baku Principles for National SDGs Mainstreaming and Acceleration”. The draft document is now being discussed by the Azerbaijan Government and UN partners that will support its implementation.
During the visit, the Director-General will stop by the Tuberculosis Training Centre of the Medical Department at the Ministry of Justice of Azerbaijan, which is a WHO collaborating centre on tuberculosis in prisons – the only one in this matter worldwide. The good work of the Centre serves as prove of country’s commitment to the Universal Health Coverage principle of leaving no one behind and to ensuring that it applies to all, in particular vulnerable groups such as inmates.
Dr Tedros will also visit the National Center of Oncology of Azerbaijan where he will meet both healthcare workers and patients to discuss key challenges and achievements. WHO encourages cervical cancer screening and is ready to assist the country in developing its national screening and HPV vaccination programs. A WHO expert mission on these issues will be discussed for early 2019.
The visit includes meetings with His Excellency Mr Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan, and other Azerbaijani high-level officials, including Mr. Ali Akhmadov, Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan, Chairman of the National Coordination Council for Sustainable Development; Mr. Ogtay Shiraliyev, Minister of Health, Mr. Elmar Mammadyarov, Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Every year UNHCR Azerbaijan facilitates such missions in close cooperation with the authorities to arrange free of charge eye-screening and eyeglasses distribution for refugees, internally displaced and other vulnerable people. This year the humanitarian activities will be carried out in Ganja from 3 to 5 July, in Shamkir from 6 to 7 July and in Baku on 9 July. At the end of the visit the mission leaders will meet with the high level relevant Government officials of Azerbaijan.
More than 2.6 million USD has been spent by Fuji Optical to accomplish its humanitarian activity in Azerbaijan since 2005. Around 54 thousand pairs of high quality optic eyeglasses and other items have been brought to the country as in-kind donation to the UNHCR operations in Azerbaijan. In total, more than 28 thousand refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other vulnerable people have benefited from free of charge vision screening services facilitated by the UNHCR Representation in Azerbaijan together with the relevant authorities. This year, Fuji Vision Aid Mission has donated 4,000 pairs of eye-glasses and other vision and hearing aid items to UNHCR and it is targeting to screen about 2,500 IDPs, refugees and other vulnerable people during the six-day vision tests and eye-glasses distribution. Last year the number of screened people was over three thousand - the highest since the start of the Japanese vision aid missions to Azerbaijan.
In general, since 1983, when the Company started its humanitarian activity among Indo-Chinese refugees in Thailand, Fuji Vision Aid Mission has donated about 160 thousand pairs of eyeglasses to refugees, IDPs and other vulnerable people in six countries of Asia, Europe and Africa, conducted vision aid missions in four out of those countries, including Azerbaijan.
Humanitarian efforts made through the Japanese Vision Aid Mission have always been highly appreciated by UNHCR and also by the Government of Azerbaijan and the targeted communities. These efforts demonstrate understanding and sympathy towards the displacement challenge faced by Azerbaijan and the work of the UN Refugee Agency. Along with the official recommendation from the Government of Azerbaijan, Dr. Akio Kanai received the Nansen Refugee Award in 2006 and used the prize money to fund a water supply project for the IDP community in Beylagan district.
UNHCR is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international interventions, in cooperation with national authorities, for the protection and well-being of refugees and IDPs. It continues to raise awareness and facilitate all efforts aimed to support the displaced people in Azerbaijan until the time a solution is found to their displacement.

Title: GEF, UNDP to enhance agricultural biodiversity and sustainable use of indigenous plant resources in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
29 June 2018
Known for the enormous diversity of its soil potential, genetic plant resources and robust climatic conditions, Azerbaijan is considered one of the evolution centres of cultivated plants. With more than 4500 higher plants and over 230 endemic plants registered in the country, crop production in Azerbaijan accounts for almost half of the total agricultural production nationwide, whereas livestock farming makes up the remaining half.
In spite of this significant potential, Azerbaijan’s genetic plant resources are vulnerable to a number of factors that put the country’s agrobiodiversity potential in jeopardy.

The course, organised by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), aims to strengthen the national capacities in phytosanitary inspection techniques corresponding to international standards, provide comprehensive information related to the pest quarantine list of Azerbaijan, as well as describe specific pests and plant diseases to participants.
The event is part of the project on strengthening phytosanitary inspection and diagnostic services in Azerbaijan, which is funded by the Standards Trade Development Facility of the World Trade Organization and implemented in the country from February 2016. It focuses on improvement of phytosanitary control in three directions: control of imported and exported plants and plant products, as well as pest diagnostics in the laboratories.
FAO have already organized similar training sessions in June 2016 and April 2017, and inspectors from SPCS and SCC have significantly benefited from these activities. These events also helped to reduce the risks of pest dissemination, secure the plant health in the country and promote wider export of Azerbaijani plants and plant products to other countries.

The event was part of the UN-supported Environmental Week in Azerbaijan and organised by the United Nations Office in Baku in collaboration with the IDEA Public Union, Clean City Joint Stock Company and Azerbaijani Youth Foundation.
“Seeing hundreds of mostly young people supporting today’s initiative was truly an inspiration in action, which demonstrated their care for protection of the environment,” said Ghulam Isaczai, UN Resident Coordinator in Azerbaijan, who also joined the cleanup initiative along with other 35 staff members of UN agencies operating in the country.
“More such actions are needed to raise awareness and mobilise citizens of the country towards a drastic reduction of single-use plastic,” he added.
The participants collected plastics, such as bottles, straws and cutlery, as well as cans, cigarette butts and other types of waste and submitted them to the Clean City state agency for recycling.
The beach clean-up aimed to support the theme of the World Environmental Day for 2018 - “Beat Plastic Pollution”. The theme invites to consider how we can make changes in our everyday lives to reduce the heavy burden of plastic pollution on our natural places, our wildlife and our own health.

Moreover, school enrolment rates reached 99.8-100% and progress was made on gender equality and women’s empowerment. Gender gaps in primary and secondary education have dropped considerably in comparison with previous years. During this time, employment opportunities have also seen a significant rise, as numerous new business openings were introduced both in the capital Baku and in the regions.
However, despite all the progressive developments, the unemployment rate among women in Azerbaijan continues to be remarkably higher than among men. Oftentimes faced with segregation in a number of industries and occupations, women tend to be primarily employed in low-wage sectors traditionally regarded as ‘female’ jobs, such as in education, health and social services. Disparities are also observed in the level of men’s and women’s participation in entrepreneurial activity, with women comprising only 26.38 % of the country’s total number of entrepreneurs.

Title: UNFPA and partners mark the end of the pilot project on preventing gender-biased sex selection in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
31 May 2018
The one-year project was implemented by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in close collaboration with the Ministry of Youth and Sports of Azerbaijan Republic, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population of Azerbaijan Republic, State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs.
The main objective of the project was promoting the value and emphasizing the role of girls in society through advocacy activities involving young males and fathers. During the project lifetime through information sessions and public events implementing partners capitalised on raising awareness on gender equality, promoting the value of girl child and enhancing emotional ties between fathers and daughters.
To that end, trainers reached about 1400 young males in 29 cities and regions of Azerbaijan. The topics such as exploring gender roles, combating gender stereotypes, work share in family were presented to target audience.
In addition, to complement the strategic interventions aimed at addressing the issue of the gender-biased sex selection (GBSS) a grassroots advocacy campaign in the regions was initiated to engage faith-based groups and local community leaders in the efforts to address the phenomenon. Highlighting the advancement of women rights and covering about 1700 beneficiaries, information sessions were organized in 40 mosques of various cities of Azerbaijan.
During the first week of July last year capacity building workshop for journalist writing about gender-biased sex selection was organized in Baku. As a result of the workshop competition for best journalistic work covering gender-biased sex selection and consequences was announced.
Moreover, to mark the International Day of the Girl Child, project strove to increase efficiency of message dissemination among wider audience via advocacy events. UNFPA in cooperation with state and non-government partners organised “Fathers and Daughters Festival” in the downtown Baku and Ganja. The aim of the open-air festival was to reinforce the father’s crucial role in empowering a girl child. Festival’s agenda included a number of activities for fathers and daughters to spend time together, to take care of each other.
To mark International Women’s Day, project holders filmed public services announcements (PSA) with the participation of famous male athletes who cited one after another an empowering poem to support and inspire girl children. Rafael Aghayev, Ilham Zakiyev, Rovshan Bayramov and other prominent sportsmen portrayed fathers affirming daughters for their future lives. Titled “The life is much better when you are in it!”, PSA was posted in social media.
UNFPA is particularly concerned about this problem, as it directly relates to reproductive health and population matters, as well as the dynamics of gender relations.

Title: EU, UNDP extend support for vocational education development in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 May 2018
The project titled ‘Modernising Vocational Education and Training (VET) Centres in Azerbaijan’ came into effect in 2017 and will be implemented through 2020, focusing primarily on strengthening the vocational education and development capacity of two regions in Azerbaijan –Ganja and Jalilabad.
In both regions, the project will capitalise on developing local talent as a pivotal backbone for a robust and knowledge-based economy. It will ensure that the most vulnerable sections of the workforce, including young people, women and persons with disabilities, have access to skills and resources that match labour market demand. To this end, UNDP will support national institutions in designing and rolling out new vocational education programmes in the non-oil sectors.
The concept of quality education is central to the 2030 Agenda and is one of the Sustainable Development Goals, popularly known as Global Goals. Specifically targeting inclusive and equitable education and lifelong learning opportunities for all, Goal 4: Quality Education aims to provide equal access to affordable vocational training and ensure that no one is left behind.
With the labour markets becoming increasingly specialised, the demand for high quality professional education is currently on the rise. Tapping on this demand, the Government of Azerbaijan has been implementing a wide range of policy programs and strategies aimed at fostering a more competitive national VET system.
To support the Government in these efforts, the project on Modernising Vocational Education and Training (VET) Centres in Azerbaijan led by the EU and UNDP is set to enhance the quality, equality and inclusion in education as well as to ensure the adherence of the national vocational education and training system to European standards and best practices.
Today, the first of the two regional components of the project –Support to the Establishment of Ganja Regional Industrial VET Competence Centre, kicks off in Ganja, bringing together 60 representatives of the international community, local government, the private sector and the faculty of VET schools. Highlighting the primary vision for this new partnership for development, the project kick-off meeting also coincides with the mission of the Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR) to Azerbaijan.
Emphasising the importance of vocational competence, Head of the EU Delegation Ambassador Kestutis Jankauskas noted that the “VET sector is a prerequisite for a modern, diverse economy”. He added that “with 40% of the population below 25 years, education, including vocational education and training, is a key investment for the long-term economic resilience of Azerbaijan.’
As the project activities unfold in Ganja, they will aim to improve the quality and overall competitiveness of technical education both in Ganja city and surrounding regions, ensuring that vocational education offered at the VET Competence Centre meet international standards as well as specific industry requirements. This will be achieved through strengthening the capacities of the Ganja State Vocational Education Centre on Industry and Technology.
Speaking of a strategic outlook for professional education development, Deputy Resident Representative for UNDP in Azerbaijan Alessandro Fracassetti emphasised that “continuous support for the modernisation of vocational education and professional training institutions in the country should be directed at long-term capacity-building and structural development of these institutions.”

Title: A New Approach to Peace - Op-Ed by Miroslav Lajčák
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 April 2018
A world in which disputes were resolved in meeting rooms and not battlefields. A world in which wars were stopped before they broke out. A world that didn’t wait for lives to be lost before springing into action.
But violent conflicts are on the rise in many parts of the world today. They’re becoming more drawn out, complex and deadly.  Civilians are no longer killed in cross-fire; they are now the targets of direct attacks. We are also seeing an unprecedented number of people leaving their homes, out of fear and desperation.
And that is why the UN needs a new approach to peace.
I will convene a High-Level Meeting on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace in New York on 24 and 25 April. It will bring world leaders together to focus on conflict prevention, mediation, dialogue and diplomacy. This is part of a wider effort by UN Member States to help our Organisation do better at fostering peace.
And when I say peace, I’m talking about the kind of peace that can be taken for granted. The kind of peace that won’t disappear at the next election cycle. The kind of peace that is measured not in months or years, but in generations.
This is what we call “Sustaining Peace”. And this is what we should be working for – rather than scrambling for solutions, once conflict has broken out.
Some might say that true lasting peace is impossible in certain parts of the world. But it is not. I have seen this firsthand. When Montenegro split from Serbia, peace was not a given. In fact, some people were predicting serious violence. But through intense diplomatic efforts, and real political will, peace persevered. And it has lasted – with no signs that it will waver in the future.
Last month, I traveled to western Colombia and was inspired to see indigenous communities working with the UN to build peace through strengthening social bonds. I was inspired to see villagers, some of whom had suffered through more than 50 years of war, excited about their futures. One woman told me about her people’s determination not to slide back into conflict.
These are the examples of Sustaining Peace, which are taking place now – all around the world. We may have the bulk of our discussions in New York. But they should be led by experience from the ground. We need to highlight what the real peacebuilders are doing – from those running women’s peace huts in Liberia, to those organising mediation workshops in Kyrgyzstan. That’s why the High-Level Meeting will pool actors from across different countries, sectors and societies, and allow them to share their insights.
Of course, it won’t matter that everyone buys into Sustaining Peace if there are no funds to make it happen. We need more investment in prevention. When conflict causes societies to collapse, social fabric tears. Buildings are destroyed, and no one fixes them. Salaries stop getting paid. Water stops flowing out of taps.
So then we spend money on rebuilding – but so much more than what we’d spend on preventing conflict in the first place. Aside from the suffering that we’re failing to avert, that just doesn’t make financial sense. Increasing investment in even a handful of countries can result in billions of dollars of savings for the international community.
At the end of the day, what we can’t forget is that the UN was founded for peace. That’s what its flag should stand for. Its success in preventing conflict should be the norm – not the exception.
It must be the world's broker for peace.

07 April 2018
Over the past 7 decades, WHO has spearheaded efforts to rid the world of killer diseases like smallpox and to fight against deadly habits like tobacco use.
This year, World Health Day is dedicated to one of WHO’s founding principles: “The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.”
“Good health is the most precious thing anyone can have,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “When people are healthy, they can learn, work, and support themselves and their families. When they are sick, nothing else matters. Families and communities fall behind. That’s why WHO is so committed to ensuring good health for all.”
With 194 Member States, across six regions, and working from more than 150 offices, WHO staff are united in a shared drive to achieve better health for everyone, everywhere – and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring “healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages”.
The tagline for this year’s World Health Day is “Universal Health Coverage: everyone, everywhere”.

The tournament was initiated and financed by the British School Baku with the support of the UNHCR Representation in Azerbaijan and the Baku Education Department. The project intended to reinforce favourable hosting environment and promote successful social and cultural integration prospects for refugees in the country.
“UNHCR highly values this initiative which brings together refugee children with the local community and fosters an environment of tolerance, understanding and solidarity” said Mr. Furio De Angelis, UNHCR Country Representative.
The two mini-football teams, consisted of teenage boys from Afghan, Chechen and Iranian refugee communities residing in Baku, undertook the play offs along with the children from public secondary schools #177, #212 and #82, as well as from the private ones like the British School in Baku and the Modern School. All twelve members of the two refugee teams were awarded with football kits by the British School in Baku at the final ceremony of the tournament.
The UNHCR Country Representative Mr. Furio De Angelis, the Principal of the British School in Baku Ms. Maxene Whittingham, as well as teachers, schoolchildren and parents, including those from refugee families, watched the final matches.
UNHCR established its presence in Azerbaijan in late 1992 and has been supporting the Government in protecting and assisting over one million refugees, asylum seekers and IDPs in the country. The organisation attempts to ensure that all its persons of concern enjoy their rights and have an opportunity to contribute the economic, social and cultural life of the society in Azerbaijan.

At a time of immense challenges and global divisions, I congratulate the Nizami Ganjavi International Centre for its role in building bridges among societies and promoting tolerance and inter-cultural dialogue and understanding.
I welcome your focus at this year’s event on creating inclusive societies, an objective that is a crucial part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – the universal and transformative roadmap for building a better world for all on a healthy planet.
Sustainable Development Goal 16 calls for the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies based on respect for human rights, the rule of law and transparent, effective and accountable institutions.  To bring this goal to life and to prevent armed conflict, we have to address the root causes of discontent, disenfranchisement and inequalities, and defend the dignity and human rights of every individual.
Your discussions, including on youth empowerment and the role of science and technological innovation in confronting today’s threats, can contribute to our shared efforts.  Thank you for your commitment to a peaceful and sustainable future.

Title: UNICEF report: Investment in data on children is essential to changing their lives
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
07 March 2018
The UNICEF report, Progress for Children in the SDG Era, is the first thematic report assessing performance toward achieving global development goals which impact on children’s rights and well-being. It tracks progress on five dimensions of children’s rights: good health, learning, protection from violence and exploitation, safe and clean environment, and a fair chance to succeed in life.
Where sufficient data is available, the scale of the challenge posed by the SDG targets remains daunting. The report warns that 650 million children live in countries where at least two-thirds of the SDGs are out of reach without accelerated progress. In fact, in those countries, even more children could face worse outcomes in life by 2030 than now.
“Azerbaijan has made a strong commitment to achieving the goals of the Sustainable Development Agenda, and delivering on that commitment will require continued investment in robust collection, analysis and use of data on the situation of children,” said UNICEF Representative in Azerbaijan Edward Carwardine.
“UNICEF’s new global report highlights the challenges to monitoring progress that are caused by data deficiency – those are challenges we all want to avoid in Azerbaijan,” said Carwardine.
“UNICEF will continue to support government efforts on data collection and analysis, including a planned Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey that will generate data on over 30 key indicators on the well-being of children and women and contribute to strengthened policies and programmes for every child in the country.”
Progress for Children in the SDG Era calls for renewed efforts to address the global data-deficiency, while recognizing that developing strong national data institutions and capacity takes time and investment. The report identifies three principles to underpin this work:
UNICEF and the Government of Azerbaijan are committed to these principles, and will make effective collection and use of disaggregated children, especially in relation to vulnerable and at-risk children, a central part of their ongoing collaboration.

Title: Azerbaijan capitalises on energy efficient architectural design, sustainable transport and access to clean fuel
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
06 March 2018
Carbon emissions occur in the petroleum production and end-use energy consumption sectors due to the combustion of fossil fuel during the oil and natural gas extraction processes, transportation, and in residential facilities, which, altogether, have an overall negative impact on global warming and climate change. To address this environmental challenge, since 2015 UNDP and the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) have been implementing a series of measures to reduce the amount of GHG released into the atmosphere.

Title: Azerbaijan strengthens its system of early detection and prevention of disability among children
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
19 February 2018
Ankara University Prof.Ilgi Ertem and her team will supervise trainings on monitoring of child development to be conducted by 6 local master trainers on 20-21st February at policlinic number 13 in Baku.  More than 60 health professionals, psychologists and social workers and psycho-educators from different districts and institutions, such as Baku Mental Health Centre, Azerbaijan Medical University, Scientific-Research Institute of Pediatrics, Baku, Lankaran, Shamkir, Sheki, Zagatala and Kurdamir policlinics and child mental health centers will participate in the this training. National trainers will be assessed by international experts during this training in Baku in order to receive international trainer certificate from Ankara University.
The partnership with Ankara University team also involved development of a training package on Monitoring of Child Development (GMCD) for the State Advanced Training Institute for Doctors and preparation of local master trainers. All these activities are part of the UNICEF joint efforts with the Ministry of Health on development of skills and knowledge of national pediatricians and other relevant specialists on monitoring of development of all children, early detection of developmental delays and early intervention for prevention and proper management of childhood disabilities. Since 2016 more than 300 physicians (mainly paediatricians and child neurologists) were trained both in Baku and districts. After certification, local master trainers will be able to provide these trainings  - already incorporated into curriculum of State Advanced Training Institute for Doctors -  on regular basis. It’s expected that about 200-300 health professionals will go through this training program each academic year.
“When disabilities and development delays are detected early in a child’s life, we can reduce the incidence of future challenges to infants’  learning, behaviour and health,” said UNICEF Representative in Azerbaijan Mr. Edward Carwardine. “This investment in the skills of health workers to detect disabilities and respond quickly, means we can have a significant impact at a critical stage of a child’s mental and physical development, and in a way that is shown to be more cost-effective than a later intervention.”

14 February 2018
Bringing together around 50 representatives of Government, United Nations Agencies and the private sector, the workshop is the continuation of a strategic policy support mission that started in Azerbaijan in May-June 2017.
Based on consultations with the Government and a range of subject-matter experts, the mission produced an SDG Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) report, which outlines a set of conclusive policy and programming steps to drive the national SDG implementation process in Azerbaijan. The report, which was first submitted to the Government last November, has been the key focus of today’s workshop, as United Nations agencies teamed up with national stakeholders aiming to draw a tangible vision for development change in the country.
MAPS is a globally recognised approach to supporting national capacities to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs conceptually and strategically. It puts the importance of partnership networks, public accountability, reporting, financing and enforcement of reliable data at the forefront of holistic development policy.
UNDP Deputy Assistant Administrator and Deputy Regional Director at UNDP Regional Bureau for Europe and the CIS Rastislav Vrbensky mentioned that, to date MAPS missions have been conducted in more than two dozen countries and another two dozen missions are planned for this year. Mr. Vrbensky emphasised that the analysis of the MAPS report from Azerbaijan, along with its recommendations, is important not only for Azerbaijan, but for other countries that are now using this platform to accelerate national SDG implementation.
Acknowledging the remarkable dedication the country has shown in the implementation of the SDGs, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in Azerbaijan Ghulam Isaczai noted that “Azerbaijan has been a frontrunner in promoting Sustainable Development Goals in the region”. In this spirit, he reiterated, the UN will continue to work with Government of Azerbaijan, the private sector, media and civil society to ensure that skills, technical expertise and guidance of the UN system in this area are available and provided in a timely and efficient manner.
The MAPS workshop is organised as part of the project on “Supporting the localisation of Sustainable Development Goals and alignment of national development plans to the SDGs”. The project, ending in March 2018, is implemented by the United Nations Development Programme in partnership with the National Coordination Council on Sustainable Development.

25 January 2018
The theme of this year’s Remembrance Day highlights the importance of education as a shared responsibility. The theme highlights the universal dimension of the Holocaust and encourages education on this tragedy so that future generations will firmly reject all forms of racism, violence and anti-Semitism.
As part of the Holocaust Week, series of events will take place at the academic institutions, such as ADA University and the Baku Oxford School, and at the Youth House in Baku. The events include three exhibitions and the screening of a documentary film translated into Azerbaijani language.
One of the exhibitions - The Butterfly Project: Remembering the Children of the Holocaust - outlines the impact of the Holocaust on children, and showcases an educational initiative called The Butterfly Project developed by Holocaust Museum Houston to teach this history to young people, encourage them to remember the 1.5 million children who perished and to stand up against hatred and prejudice.
A second exhibit titled The Holocaust – Keeping the Memory Alive features the 12 best posters by designers and students of design from different countries. The exhibit is a joint initiative of Yad Vashem - The World Holocaust Remembrance Center and the Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme.
The documentary film Children of the Holocaust combines animation and interviews with elderly survivors who recount their childhood experiences of Nazi atrocities, their escape from occupied mainland Europe to Britain and the impact that this had on their lives.

Title: Official launch ceremony of CountrySTAT-Azerbaijan by FAO & the Ministry of Agriculture
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
18 December 2017
CountrySTAT is a web-based information system on food and agriculture which provides easy access to statistical data of good quality that can aid decision-makers in better, evidence-based policy-making and greater efficiency in development politics. Nationally owned and maintained, it serves as a one-stop centre that enables the collection and harmonisation of timely and reliable official data from different sources and their integration in a common location. Data provided through CountrySTAT serves researchers, policymakers, development organisations, and the private sector to design and implement better policy and investments in agriculture.
The last report on State of Food Insecurity in the World (SOFI 2014), published annually by the FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) confirmed a positive trend which saw the number of hungry people decline globally by more than 100 million over the last decade and by 209 million since 1990-92.
With the number of undernourished people remaining "unacceptably high", the agency heads stressed the need to renew the political commitment to tackle hunger and to transform it into concrete actions.
Best practices of the CountrySTAT system include ownership and sustainability, increased data availability and accessibility through the national one-stop centre on food and agriculture statistics.
The system also aims to strengthen sustainable development of rural and agricultural statistical information targeting better integration of new scalable information technologies, to support food security and the relevant decision-making based on facts.

Title: Launch of a year-long celebration of UDHR’s 70th anniversary
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
14 December 2017
The campaign has three core objectives: to promote, engage and reflect. Its aim is to engage a broad base of audiences the world over; to help promote understanding of how the Universal Declaration empowers us all; and encourage further reflection on the ways that each of us can stand up for rights, every day.
The launch event, organized jointly by the United Nations (UN) in Azerbaijan and the Institute of Law and Human Rights of Azerbaijan’s National Academy of Science, brought together over 50 representatives of the state agencies, parliament, international organisations, civil society, academia and mass media.
“The Universal Declaration – the most translated document in the world, available in more than 500 languages - is as relevant today as it was on the day that it was proclaimed,” said Ghulam Isaczai, the UN Resident Coordinator in Azerbaijan. “Drafted by representatives of diverse legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, UDHR sets out universal values and a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.”
Aytan Mustafazadeh, Director of the Institute of Law and Human Rights and Member of Parliament, spoke about the history and development of human rights protection in Azerbaijan. She also emphasised existing threats against human rights, peace and tranquillity in modern world; challenges in protection from risks such as terror, separatism, extremism and environmental disasters; as well as the role of international organisations, including the United Nations, in addressing these problems.
In the lead-up to the 70th anniversary of the UDHR, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called on everybody to stand up for human rights by taking part in “Add Your Voice”  - a participatory project to promote and disseminate the UDHR articles in more than 100 languages. “Add Your Voice” is an online platform that allows people to video-record themselves reading an article of the UDHR in their own language and share it on social media – encouraging others to do the same.

Title: EU, UNDP and ABAD team up to support family business in Azerbaijan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
13 December 2017
Implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the project will entail a close collaboration with the “ABAD” Public Legal Entity of the State Agency for Public Service and Social Innovations under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The new engagement seeks to enhance local capacity-building in rural areas of Azerbaijan by offering extensive support to the ABAD regional centre in Balakan and will serve as the keystone premises for fostering the formation of modern and sustainable family business models in the country.
Head of the EU Delegation Ambassador Kestutis Jankauskas, UNDP Resident Representative Ghulam Isaczai and Chairman of the State Agency for Public Service and Social Innovations Inam Karimov jointly presented the project at the ceremony.
In his opening remarks, Inam Karimov emphasised that “of all the projects implemented to promote the development of small-scale family businesses and farms as well as to contribute to regional development, the ABAD has a special place. It is a new social innovation concept that aims to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals and is the result of public service reforms in Azerbaijan”.
Introducing the new cooperation framework between the three organisations, Ambassador Jankauskas noted that that “the EU is proud to be able to continue supporting ABAD and ASAN through this new grant implemented by UNDP. ASAN has become an internationally renowned model for successful public services provision making a significant positive difference for many citizens of Azerbaijan, as well as businesses. Through this new EU programme we hope to further contribute to the success of ABAD while improving the lives of 30 small holder family groups that involve a broader range of individual family businesses in Balakan”.
Acknowledging ABAD’s achievements in economic development processes, Ghulam Isaczai stated that it is “a great example of Azerbaijan’s pursuit to advance effective governance, human capital and public institutions in line with Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030.
Envisioned to enable equal opportunities and inclusivity in line with European standards and best practices, this new endeavour will last three years and conclude in 2020. The project will support and promote Azerbaijan’s efforts in developing community-based family businesses and rural entrepreneurship and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Committed to continuously helping communities, to grow organically and holistically, the partners see the newly launched initiative as a promising opportunity to stimulate and facilitate economic regeneration and job creation in the Sheki-Zagatala Economic Region.
The project is funded by the European Union, ABAD and UNDP. Collectively, the project partners have contributed a generous amount of USD 1,074,000 towards the implementation of project goals and objectives (this is an amount equivalent to AZN 1,825,800, based on 12 December 2017 exchange rates at the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan).

Title: Half of HIV-infected people in Europe is diagnosed late
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 December 2017
With more than 160,000 people newly diagnosed with HIV across the region, including more than 29,000 new cases from the European Union and European Economic Area, this trend continued in 2016. One reason for this worrying trend: over half (51%) of the reported HIV diagnoses happen in a late stage of infection.
“Testing people late, particularly those at higher risk of infection, results in late treatment and further contributes to the ongoing spread of HIV,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
“The HIV epidemic continues to rise at an alarming pace in the European Region, mostly in its eastern part, which is home to almost 80% of the 160 000 new HIV diagnoses. This is the highest number of new cases ever recorded in one year. If this trend persists, we will not be able to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030,” warned Dr Jakab.
The WHO Member States created World AIDS Day in 1988, which is celebrated around the world on 1 December every year. It has become one of the most recognised international health days and a key opportunity to raise awareness, commemorate those who have passed on, and celebrate victories, such as increased access to treatment and prevention services.
WHO and its country office support Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Health and the National AIDS Centre in conducting number of activities devoted to World AIDS Day 2017 and European HIV Testing Week, as well as preparing the awareness materials.

24 October 2017
The book “United Nations-Azerbaijan: 25 years of partnership”, written in English and Azerbaijani, brings together more than 100 photos and a number of quotes from UN and Azerbaijani officials reflecting on different aspects of partnership throughout 25 years.
“We hope that you enjoy this special retrospective of the people, milestones, key projects and activities conducted throughout the last 25 years of partnership,” Ghulam Isaczai, the UN Resident Coordinator in Azerbaijan wrote in his foreword for the book.
“This is an opportunity not just to reflect on all that has been achieved since 1992, but also a chance to consider how the continued partnership between the United Nations and Azerbaijan can contribute to a better world for all in the future,” the Resident Coordinator noted.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, Elmar Mammadyarov, also provided a foreword for the commemorative book: “The present book sheds light about the history of 25 years of partnership between the UN and Azerbaijan outlining major activities, milestones and contributions made by both sides to each other's development.”
Minister also added: “Membership to the UN allowed Azerbaijan to re-integrate into the world community as an independent State. Since then, the Republic of Azerbaijan has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to the Charter of the UN and working with the UN has been one of the major foreign policy objectives of the country.”
From the humanitarian assistance for refugees and internally displaced persons provided by the UN in the early years, to Azerbaijan's involvement in both regional and global UN affairs, including the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the commemorative book covers a magnitude of issues and celebrates Azerbaijan's accession to the United Nations with pride.
Overall, it concludes that during these 25 years of partnership, a solid foundation has been built for further improving the lives of all Azerbaijanis and a better world for all.
