02 February 2024
Belize City, February 2, 2024 - The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank launched a new initiative to help Belize strengthen its financial preparedness for natural disasters and climate shocks.
This initiative aims to help Belize design a robust disaster risk financing strategy and adopt innovative financial protection instruments. By developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy, Belize will enhance its ability to safeguard its economy and citizens.
According to the World Bank, the annual average loss from hurricanes in Belize is estimated at US$7.7M (or 0.45% of GDP) and from earthquakes at US$ 883,000 (or 0.05% of GDP). The increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather events highlight the pressing need for systematic financial preparedness and innovative protection against natural hazards.
Rocío Medina Bolivar, IDB Country Representative, and Federico Baechli, WB Senior Country Officer, emphasized the importance of providing holistic support to Belize. This includes strengthening the country's ex-ante financial preparedness and ensuring the availability of resources for immediate crisis response and recovery. The approach involves coordinated technical assistance, innovative financial instruments, and risk transfer solutions. The first deliverable – a comprehensive analysis of disaster risk financing needs in Belize - is scheduled to be completed early next year.
The work will be carried out jointly between the IDB and the WB as part of the Memorandum of Understanding agreed between the IDB President Ilan Goldfajn and the World Bank President Ajay Banga in 2023
Dr. Osmond Martinez, CEO for the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment expressed the Government of Belize’s commitment to this transformative collaboration with the IDB and WB and stated that in the face of escalating climate threats, this partnership between the banks mark a significant step toward the global effort in mitigating the impacts of climate change and natural disasters in Belize. He also made mention that together, with the support of our international partners and through our own national efforts, we are committed to safeguarding our country's future against these growing threats, ensuring that Belize remains strong, resilient, and sustainable for generations to come.
The mission team extended gratitude to Dr. Martinez, Mr. Joseph Waight, and the Belize authorities for their hospitality, support, and insightful discussions.

City of Belmopan, August 16, 2023 — During a diplomatic courtesy visit today, Raul Salazar, the recently designated United Nations Resident Coordinator for Belize and El Salvador, presented his credentials to the Honourable Eamon Courtenay, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade & Immigration. This officially marked his new appointment by the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and reaffirmed the UN's commitment to continuous partnership with Belize.

Among the topics discussed, special emphasis was placed on the advances in the Country Implementation Plan 2022-2023 through the great collaboration of the UN with the government of Belize in support of the economic and climate resilience, poverty reduction and equity and justice and rule of law, in a context where nations continued facing vulnerabilities due to the climate emergency, the impact of the war in Ukraine and lack of access to financing for development.
While affirming Belize's commitment to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), as outlined in the Plan Belize Medium-Term Development Strategy 2022-2026, the Minister Courtenay reiterated his pledge to establish an Integrated National Financing Framework to optimize the efficiency of financial resources allocated for advancing the SDGs.
Other key priorities that the Government of Belize highlighted is the continued policy and technical collaboration with the UN in areas such as strengthening capacities for immigration management to ensure orderly, safe, and regular mobility.
As part of his inaugural mission to Belize, the Resident Coordinator also paid a courtesy visit to Prime Minister Johnny Briceño. Their discussion focused around potential avenues through which the United Nations can enhance its support in helping Belize to realize the objectives of the Medium-Term Development Strategy.
With the 2023 SDG Summit in September drawing closer, the Resident Coordinator expressed appreciation to the Prime Minister for Belize's proactive preparations and emphasized the significance of the country's renewed commitment to achieving these global goals.

Title: FAO and SICA sign an unprecedented agreement to promote the Dry Corridor in Central America
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
28 June 2023
The initiative aims to expand investments and enhance solutions to support the countries of this sub-region in the transformation of agriculture to adapt to climate change and improve food security.
Placencia, Belize, June 27, 2023 – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Central American Integration System (SICA) signed an unprecedented Framework Cooperation Agreement whose main objective is to jointly support the transformation of agrifood systems in the countries of the dry corridor.
This agreement enhances collaboration and joint efforts between FAO and SICA to promote economic, social, environmental, and cultural determinants of food and nutritional security in SICA member countries. It also seeks to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience on issues such as resilient agriculture, climate change, and sustainable management of natural resources (including water, land, forests, and biodiversity).
In this context, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, Mario Lubetkin, spoke at the LVII Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Central American Integration System, held in Placencia, Belize.
During his speech, Lubetkin stressed the importance of organizations such as FAO being able to work in coordination with member states and thus work together to address the impact that hunger, malnutrition, and poverty have caused in nations.
In addition, the FAO Assistant Director-General stressed that "food security and nutrition have been consolidated as central axes in the development agendas of all regions of the world with notable actions that demand us to promote greater joint cooperation, through an open and permanent dialogue."
In this line, Lubetkin highlighted the agreement reached between FAO and SICA, ensuring that "this agreement adds cooperation efforts to expand investments and sustainable solutions in the large territory of the Dry Corridor, supporting countries in the transformation of agriculture, to make it more resilient and adapted to climate change and in turn, generating food and more employment opportunities and income, based on sustainable production systems".
FAO and various SICA bodies work in a coordinated manner to ensure an agricultural sector that not only meets food production needs but also contributes to restoring ecosystem integrity. Together, they develop policies prioritizing forest integrity and implementing solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation, thus promoting sustainable economic development while ensuring the conservation of carbon stocks and biodiversity. These joint efforts are vital steps to reduce climate vulnerability in the SICA region.
The FAO-SICA agreement serves as a model for regional cooperation and demonstrates the collective strength and commitment of the participating organizations to address the complex challenges facing the agricultural sector and the environment in the SICA region.
Post-crisis scenario
Latin America and the Caribbean have been impacted by a series of successive crises that have led to an increase in hunger and malnutrition in all its forms. Income inequality in the region, climate change, and a generalized economic crisis have been major factors in this situation.
Food insecurity in the region increased by nearly 100 million people, and the number of hungry people rose from 43.3 million to 56.5 million between 2019 and 2021.
In SICA member countries, a growth from 7.2 to 7.5 million people was evidenced, values recorded 20 years ago, also an impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

14 April 2023
City of Belmopan, 14 April 2023 — Friday 14th April marked another historic day as Belize formally inaugurated its new UN premise in Belize, bringing together various UN agencies in one building, standing as a symbol of collective efforts to work towards a more peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world for all.
This new UN House is located on the 2nd floor of the David L. Mckoy Business Centre, Bliss Parade, Belmopan. The opening was celebrated by the Prime Minister of Belize, Hon. John Briceño; and included the UN Resident Coordinator to Belize and El Salvador, RC Birgit Gerstenberg; UNDP Deputy Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Linda Maguire; and UNDP’s Resident Representative for Jamaica, Belize, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, The Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos, Ms Denise Antonio. Also in attendance was the Hon. Chief Justice, Madam Louise Blenman, members of Cabinet and members of Parliament, members of the Diplomatic Corps and other government, UN and other partners.
In her opening remarks, RC Gerstenberg welcomed guests on behalf of the UN Family noting this was consistent with the global commitment to a more coherent and efficient UN, specifically she noted: “In his December 2017 report, the UN Secretary General António Guterres presented his vision and proposals to reposition the UN development system to better respond to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. He noted that the code for achieving the United Nations objectives, it needs to be nimble, efficient, and effective. It must focus more on delivery and less on process, more on people, and less on bureaucracy.”
Following up with RC Gerstenberg’s remarks, UNDP’s Deputy Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Linda Maguire also highlighted what this inauguration means for UN Cooperation, “The diverse and intuitive interactions among and between agencies provide a platform for enhanced cooperation, problem-solving, sharing of ideas, and piloting of new ways of doing things. The effective cooperation and collaboration among UN agencies, more or less in one space, and with key national counterparts encourage collaborative innovation. Hence, if maximised, the UN Common Premise can be an Innovation Hub for Belize, a laboratory for new and disruptive ways of addressing multi- dimensional development problems.”
UNDP Resident Representative, Denise Antonio noted that the move to the new Common Premises in September 2022 occurred during the 40th anniversary of partnership between UNDP and the Government of Belize and further noted “The occasion that we are marking of course is about moving into a new and “fit for purpose” space that ultimately will ensure that we, the United Nations Agencies Funds and Programs, deliver on our mandate in Belize.”
“We believe that the UN played a great role in the achievement of our sovereignty and territorial integrity. It was in the hands of the United Nations, that we unlike minded nations, who believed in the right to self determination, stood our ground, to achieve our political independence and to ensure Belize's territorial integrity.” Noted Prime Minister of Belize, Honourable John Briceño. “The UN remains an indispensable partner in the international landscape, as it seeks to accomplish its goal to maintaining international peace and security, promote the well being of the world's peoples and foster international cooperation. As outlined in the coverage of the country implementation plan, UN has always been deemed an ambitious agenda. With those ambitions come expected raised expectations. All government entities expect you to work smart, effectively and collaboratively for the betterment of all beneficiaries. So I wish you success. Know that we appreciate what you all do for all. We look forward to greater cooperation and collaboration as we continue this meaningful partnership.”
In the UN House are the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator (UNRCO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the GEF Small Grants Programme (GEF SGP UNDP).

14 April 2022
The Government of Belize along with the programme's Participating United Nations Organizations (PUNOs)— International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Food Programme (WFP) —last Thursday launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Joint Programme to support in building a resilient Belize through universal, adaptive and sustainable social protection and local economic development.
This launch signified a major achievement for the Government of Belize as the programme factors in and prioritizes key outcomes outlined in Plan Belize and the Government’s Medium-Term Development Strategy Priority Areas of Poverty reduction and Economic growth. The programme, which will run from 2022-2023, will also accelerate the government’s commitments to the SDGs, through the enhancement of a social protection system and an enabling environment for local economic development.
In her keynote remarks, Hon. Dolores Balderamos Garcia, Minister of Human Development Families and Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs, emphasized the need to address the most vulnerable through coordinated partnerships to reduce poverty. She explained, “the SDG Joint Programme builds on the consensus that social protection is a human right; and supports poverty reduction and economic growth as articulated in our Medium-term Development Strategy.” She elaborated on the need and relevance of a Social Protection Floor that establishes a basic set of rights for all Belizeans and lauded the Joint Programme as providing inclusive socioeconomic development as a key component.
Belize has a current debt/GDP of approximately 123% in which the COVID-19 pandemic has had significant social, economic, and political impacts. Additionally, poverty was already high, at 41% in 2009, and is estimated at 52% prior to COVID-19, in 2018, with children being the most affected. Birgit Gerstenberg, the UN Resident Coordinator in Belize, expressed the UN system’s appreciation for the government's commitment as the Joint Programme will “enable economic opportunities, decent jobs, and livelihood opportunities that will sequentially improve the standard of living for the most vulnerable.”
Additionally, Dr. Osmond Martinez, Chief Executive Officer, Ministry of Economic Development (MED), spoke of the SDG Joint Programme as a complement to the government’s work to redistribute wealth and increase the social protection floor to ensure we leave no one behind. He also highlighted the programme support to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) as a pivotal role in poverty reduction and increasing prosperity and equity for all Belizeans.
The launch also provided a platform for discussion to identify immediate next steps and key milestones towards implementation of the programme.

As part of the continued response in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also necessary to increase public awareness of the multiple risks of being infected with COVID-19 and smoking. Thus, 175 posters depicting that smoking can increase the risk of getting COVID-19 infection were donated to the National Drug Abuse and Control Council of the Ministry of Health and Wellness. These posters will be used by field officers countrywide.
298 booklets promoting the protection of Human Rights of Older Persons were also donated to the National Council on Ageing. These booklets will be used to sensitize the management of residential homes and caregivers within public and private residential homes.

02 December 2021
To enable proper electronic data collection and to support rapid response teams and surveillance, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) donated 17 Samsung Galaxy tablets to the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) for use by contact tracers.
As we continue the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, it is still crucial to capture every single COVID-19 case. Thus, the MoHW very innovatively started using Go.Data to capture cases from private health facilities and points of entry to Belize.
The Go.Data software, developed by WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), was designed to facilitate faster and more accurate outbreak investigations during public health emergencies. The tool offers multiple functionalities for case investigation, contact follow-up, and visualization of chains of transmission.
The MOHW will install the app on the donated tablets to help ensure that country response teams can analyze and visualize the case and contact data in a timely manner. This will allow them to make informed decisions and identify evidence-informed public health response interventions.
The tablets will be distributed to 17 contact tracers who will be able to transition from the current manual data collection to electronic data collection.
PAHO/WHO continues to support surveillance and contact tracing activities in the country in response to the ongoing pandemic.

Title: PAHO/WHO Belize and the Government of Germany donate PPEs to the Belize Tourism Board to support COVID-19 Infection, Prevention, & Control measures for micro and small enterprises
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
23 November 2021
To support Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures in the workplace especially during COVID-19, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), through funding from the Government of Germany, donated several Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to the Belize Tourism Board (BTB).
“The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges particularly in the workplace where IPC measures are crucial to reducing the risk and spread of the virus,” said Lealou Reballos, PAHO/WHO Technical Officer for Health Emergencies. “By collaborating with the BTB, we can strengthen the prevention measures for businesses within the tourism industry in Belize.”
In a country that is highly dependent on tourism, Belize’s tourism industry is one of the industries particularly affected by the effects of the coronavirus. As Belize begins reopening its economy, occupational safety and health must be taken into consideration. Through this donation of PPEs, 300 micro and small enterprises (MSEs) will benefit from having additional supplies to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection in their workplace. The donated items included:
Mr. Jose Carballo, BTB’s Director of Industry Development noted, “With the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Belize’s tourism sector; the BTB remains committed to aiding in its recovery. This support from PAHO will contribute to this effort as these donations of PPEs will be distributed to MSEs throughout the country and will increase standards and quality of public health and safety plans for all tourism sectors. Further, combined with extensive training components this distribution will allow our stakeholders and partners to achieve certification and other pertinent growth opportunities. The BTB expresses its gratitude for PAHO’s generous contribution and remains confident that through strengthened partnership and collaboration on promoting health and safety we can aid in reducing the risk of COVID-19 in Belize.”

Title: PAHO/WHO Belize donate IT equipment to strengthen Belize’s COVID-19 data collection and emergency health response to the Ministry of Health and Wellness
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
16 November 2021
To strengthen Belize’s data collection and health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) donated 50 tablets to the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) for its vaccinators. These are in addition to the laptops, tablets, printers and wireless routers previously donated to the MoHW earlier in June for the country’s Immunization Information System (IIS).
“The donation of tablets will allow effective and efficient recording of demographic information of persons who receive the COVID-19 vaccine,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize. “With the proper records, the collected immunization data can be analyzed and used to establish a population-based immunization registry which is key in assessing vaccine coverage.”
Electronic data collection at the vaccinations sites will support the development of an IIS that consists of confidential, population-based, computerized databases that record all immunization doses administered by participating providers to persons residing within a given geopolitical area.
Apart from the tablets, PAHO/WHO Belize also handed over several IT equipment to strengthen MoHW’s emergency communication capacity during emergencies and disasters. This equipment will be distributed to the district Health Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) throughout the country to develop their capacity to maintain 24-hour radio communication during emergencies and disasters. The donated items included:
“I can’t emphasize how much these donations have helped the country of Belize and the MoHW in the fight against the COVID-19 virus,” said Hon. Michel Chebat, Minister of the MoHW. “One of the many goals of this ministry is to educate the public about pressing matters in the health sector. At this moment, those matters are mainly centered around education concerning the COVID-19 virus and the importance of the COVID-19 vaccination initiative. These donations allow us, at the MoHW, to take a step forward and move closer to achieving our goals. Thank you to our partners at PAHO/WHO for the continued support.”

Title: PAHO/WHO Belize and the Government of Canada jointly donate two portable ultrasound machines to strengthen the capacity in treating COVID-19 patients at the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
09 November 2021
To contribute to the strengthening of Belize’s health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and the Government of Canada jointly financed the donation of two portable ultrasound machines with software and accessories to the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital Authority (KHMHA).
These state-of-the-art ultrasound machines will be a valuable tool for treating persons with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit. It allows for quick and prompt results in evaluating the heart and lungs, two of the organs commonly affected by the COVID-19 virus.
“Ultrasound machines play a critical role in supporting the capacity in managing patients with COVID-19,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize. “Because of the machines’ mobility and imaging capabilities, health workers can conduct diagnosis right at the bedside of the patient, providing more time-efficient and effective patient care.”
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect countries globally, safety measures such as sanitizing and disinfecting have become crucial in all environments especially in health facilities. The size, model, and functionality of the portable Ultrasound Machine donated to KHMHA allow for easy disinfecting without compromising the machine while supporting patient and staff safety efforts.
“We would like to sincerely thank PAHO and the Government of Canada for this kind gift,” said Mrs. Chandra Cansino, Chief Executive Officer of the KHMHA. “For us, at the COVID unit, we are struggling with having the availability of resources. These (equipment) are certainly going to take us along in ensuring that patients within the unit can get the services that they need without having to move.”
Along with the donation, the staff will also be trained on the use and maintenance of the machine, integral to the care and life cycle of the ultrasounds. Diagnostic ultrasound, being a highly operator-dependent imaging modality, requires proper training to optimize the use of the equipment, produce diagnostic quality images, and interpret them correctly to make reliable diagnostic judgments and clinical decisions.

Title: Ministry of Health and Wellness Belize receives twenty patient monitors at visibility event for the India-UN Development Partnership Fund
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
01 November 2021
As the country tries to balance preparedness response actions including continuity of essential services while simultaneously managing case surges within the current economic reality, Belize must continue to strengthen its COVID-19 response. For that reason, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Immigration (MoFATI) and the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) submitted a proposal to the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations on 23 June 2020.
“Once again, this affirms the great and solid relationship shared between India and Belize and with that brotherhood spirit we are honored to be a part of it this donation,” commented Mr. Arun Hotchandani, Honorary Consul of India.
Through the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, a dedicated facility within the United Nations Fund for South-South Cooperation established in 2017, the Government of the Republic of India approved this US$1 million fund for Belize.
“The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) is the implementing agency for the India-UN Development Partnership Fund,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize. “The fund specifically aims to strengthen clinical management of COVID-19 patients, and, most importantly, to fund actions that will reduce the risk of the transmission of COVID-19 among health workers in Belize.”
Also, in collaboration with the United Nations Office of South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC), the project is centered around ‘Strengthening Clinical Management of COVID-19 Patients and Reducing of Risk of COVID-19 Transmission among Health Workers in Belize’ targeting three main objectives:
“We in the United Nations stand in solidarity and remain committed to supporting the people and Government of Belize to address the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said UN Resident Coordinator to Belize, Birgit Gerstenberg. “We reaffirm our pledge to continue accompanying all necessary actions to reduce the health and socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to allow for Belize’s recovery that is inclusive, equitable, green, and digital for all.”
During this morning’s visibility event to launch the multi-partner fund, twenty (20) patient monitors were also donated to the MoWH as part of the first set of medical equipment being procured through this fund.
Dr. Deysi Mendez, Chief Executive Officer of the MoHW, commented, “While health systems all over the world are overwhelmed and struggling, Belize is no different as we are faced with another wave which may seem to have no end in sight. The challenges range from having adequate human resources, to having the right medical and equipment and supplies to assist us to with proper diagnosis, management and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Today, we thank, the Government of the Republic of India, PAHO/WHO, and the UNOSSC for this grant and donation of medical equipment.”
As Belize copes with delays the pandemic has created in the supply chain, collaborations such as the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, continues with the procurement of incubators, patient and delivery beds, EKG machine, among others.
Complementing these actions was the development of a risk communication and community engagement strategy implementation of which has resulted in public service announcements in English, Spanish, Garifuna and Mopan Maya being prepared.
“The Risk Communication meets the unprecedented need to increase community engagement to not only stop the spread of the virus, but also to build lasting trust and social cohesion in the country,” stated H.E. Mrs. Amalia Mai, Chief Executive Officer, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Immigration.

Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
22 October 2021
U.S. Embassy Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) Coordinator Mary Walz and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Deputy Resident Representative in Belize, Ian King handed over US$26,760 in Information Communication Technology (ICT) equipment today to the Minister in the Ministry of Home Affairs & New Growth Industries Kareem Musa.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded this project through its the “Evidence-Based Information Management for Citizen Security in Central America and the Dominican Republic” program; UNDP Belize procured the equipment. This collaborative effort, also known as the InfoSegura Project, is an integral part of broader U.S. efforts to support improvements in citizen security in the region.
The donation includes a high-powered Hewlett-Packard (HP) server, three HP workstations with high-quality monitors, and three rugged tablets. This equipment will strengthen the sharing of inter-agency crime data and other relevant information among key agencies in Belize.
The recipients of today’s donation are the Belize Police Department, the National Forensic Science, and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. These are among the agencies that contribute data and information to the Belize Crime Observatory (BCO), which is the national repository of crime data and information.
Through this donation, the United States Government has responded to the urgent needs outlined in the BCO’s Strategic Action Plan (2020-2023), which advances collaborative efforts to develop Belize’s multi-agency Crime Intelligence Architecture, enhancing both national and regional security.
“We are proud to partner with regional agencies and stand with Belize to improve its comprehensive framework for information sharing. Being able to access crime data easily and quickly will help authorities to better detect, prevent, and prosecute criminal offenses. This multi-agency approach is critical to reducing crime and promoting national security, which in turns makes the region safer,” INL Coordinator Mary Walz highlighted.
“In our rapidly evolving world, Information and Communications Technology is king! We are very pleased that the Ministry of Home Affairs & New Growth Industries’ focus on strategic crime interventions through innovation and technology is receiving a much-needed boost through the USAID-funded InfoSegura project. This donation of ICT equipment will go a long way to realizing our vision for the development of a state-of the-art, Crime Intelligence Architecture for Belize,” noted Minister of Home Affairs Kareem Musa.
In April 2021, InfoSegura also donated US$15,205 worth of ICT equipment to the ministry, including a high-powered Dell server and three Dell workstations.
UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Ian King remarked, “UNDP applauds the continued commitment of the Ministry of Home Affairs to addressing citizen security with the support of the United States Agency for International Development. InfoSegura is already assisting in the provision of data and information as well as tools to enhance policies, strategies, and plans of the Government of Belize to improving safety and security in Belize, but we do have much more to do and UNDP is committed to partnering with the government and stakeholders to realise these goals.”
The InfoSegura project supports interventions and policies that aim to strengthen crime and justice data platforms both nationally and regionally, including working to support the formulation of evidenced-based policies and decisions. The project is being implemented in Belize by the UNDP and implementing partner the Ministry of Home Affairs & New Growth Industries.

19 October 2021
To boost COVID-19 risk communication efforts, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) donated several equipment and materials to the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) in supporting their COVID-19 Vaccine Campaign.
During a global pandemic like COVID-19, community preventive measures are crucial to fighting and controlling this disease. Thus, proper risk communication plans and actions are key to introducing and ensuring public health interventions and raising awareness of the seriousness of the pandemic.
Good management of communications is key to a successful vaccination campaign and for the population to accept and receive the vaccine and recommend it to others. Furthermore, successfully managed communication mitigates the impact of potential adverse events and demonstrates responsibility and transparency.
As the Ministry of Health and Wellness continues their COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign, the donated equipment is primarily intended to improve their capacity to develop and disseminate health campaigns needed to encourage positive behavior changes and informed decision-making.
The equipment included:
As we continue to face these unprecedented times due to COVID-19, it has become increasingly necessary to keep the public informed on proper health measures and strengthen the risk communication component as an essential tool for providing the population with relevant and empowering information regarding COVID-19 vaccines as a vital defense in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: PAHO/WHO Belize donate IT equipment and supplies for vaccine safety surveillance to the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital, the PAHO/WHO selected sentinel hospital
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
12 October 2021
The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) continues to support the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital (KHMH) with the latest donation of IT equipment and office supplies to strengthen existing surveillance activities as part of ensuring COVID-19 vaccine safety.
Due to the vast increase in COVID-19 vaccine administration, on both global and national scales, it is imperative to promote safe vaccines and safe vaccination procedures which will ultimately decrease health risks. Thus, monitoring the effects of the vaccines on the population will help prevent unnecessary health risks while maintaining trust in vaccination.
In January 2021, PAHO/WHO conducted a regional survey to evaluate the capacities of potential hospitals for vaccines against COVID-19. Based on the response submitted by the KHMH in May 2021, the hospital was selected as part of the Sentinel Hospital for the Surveillance of AESI (Adverse Event of Special Interest) and AEFIS (Adverse Event Following Immunization) for COVID-19 Vaccines.
As a sentinel hospital, it plays an important role in the surveillance system of the country, particularly in its ability to timely detect and notify ESAVI (Events Supposedly Attributable to Vaccination or Immunization) and AESI through passive, stimulated, or active surveillance. With the following donated IT equipment and office supplies, KHMH will be able to set up an ESAVI Situation Room to conduct proper vaccine safety surveillance in Belize, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Wellness which received the same donation for its own ESAVI Situation Room three weeks earlier.
The office supplies and IT equipment included, amongst other miscellaneous stationery items, for use by the ESAVI Situation Room at the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital:
“This donation will be used to help with the continuous collection of data from COVID patients and their vaccination status to track any possible side effects of vaccines and to track the number of cases,” said Dr. Selma Bermudez, Epidemiologist at KHMH.

Title: PAHO/WHO Belize and the Ministry of Health and Wellness hold visibility event and site visit at the Corozal Community Hospital for the launch of works through the EU-Funded Health Sector Support Programme Belize Project
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
08 October 2021
As part of the European Union (EU)-funded Health Sector Support Programme Belize  (HSSP), the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) held a visibility event and site visit at the Corozal Community Hospital to highlight the retrofitting works to make the hospital ‘smart’ – disaster-resilient (safe) and environmentally-friendly (green).
Since September 2018, PAHO/WHO has been implementing this multi-year project with total funding from the EU of 8.8 million euros with the overall goal of “achieving a better quality of life, for all Belizeans, living now and in the future.” One of the components of the project is to develop efficient, effective, disaster-resilient, and environmentally friendly health facilities based on the Smart Health Facility concept.
“The retrofitting works that will be undertaken here at the Corozal Community Hospital will embody this concept, and by the end of the project, we will all see a Corozal Community Hospital that is safer, greener, and more disaster-resilient,” said Dr. Edwin Bolastig, Health Systems and Services Technical Advisor of PAHO/WHO.
As the lead contributor to global health, the EU has been partnering with PAHO/WHO Belize for almost 20 years in various health projects – the HSSP Belize project being one of the largest funded health projects in the country. The Head of Cooperation for the European Union was also present at the event sharing his appreciation to PAHO/WHO and the MoHW.
“Strengthening the health system in Belize has become even more significant now due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has changed and affected not only Belizeans but also the global health system,” said Mr. Aniceto Rodriguez, Head of Cooperation for the EU. “The EU will continue assisting the Ministry of Health and Wellness through its Health Sector Support Programme. Today’s visit to the Corozal Community Hospital is a landmark to unveil what will be the future renovations. I thank you (PAHO/WHO and MoHW) for the excellent joint effort to implement together those vital projects for the well-being of all Belizeans.”
After consultations with the staff and management, the proposed scope of works for the Corozal Community Hospital includes renovating and reorganizing the entire emergency area of the hospital, upgrading the hospital to withstand hurricanes, improving the electrical and plumbing systems, among other interior and exterior renovations. Mitchell-Moody and Associates was contracted for the design of the facility.
“It is estimated that when this project is concluded it will directly improve the health and the livelihood of the people of Corozal town and surrounding communities,” said Hon. Michel Chebat, Minister of Health and Wellness Belize. “The risks posed by natural disasters are extremely high in Corozal town due to its positioning along the coast. Hence, ensuring our health facility can continue to operate in times of natural disasters is imperative. It is our mission to continue to partner with our national, regional and international partners like the European Union and PAHO/WHO to find the financial and technical resources we need to invest in the health of our people.”
Along with the Corozal Community Hospital, the other health facilities to be retrofitted under this
project are Southern Regional Hospital in Dangriga, Northern Regional in Orange Walk, Western Regional Hospital in Belmopan, Punta Gorda Community Hospital, and Central Medical Laboratory in Belize City. By 2023, these facilities will become a ‘smart’ health facility.
Other components of the HSSP include improving the structure, organization and management of health services to achieve universal health care and ensure equitable access to a whole range of quality, effective, efficient and people-centered health services. The third objective is to facilitate the tender, installation and operationalization of a platform that will make the Belize Health Information System (BHIS) interoperable with other information systems, bringing the digitalization of health information in the country to the 21st century.

Title: USAID and UNDP renews partnership for strengthening evidence-based public policies
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
05 October 2021
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for Latin America and the Caribbean agreed to a three-year renewal of the strategic partnership to strengthen evidence-based policies on citizen security in Central America and the Dominican Republic. This partnership set in motion the Infosegura Regional Project in 2014, mobilizing $21 million for national and regional public institutions responsible for information management in the area of citizen security.
This new stage involves the deployment of $10 million to the countries in the region to continue to demonstrate results and sustain the progress that countries have achieved in institutionalizing the use of evidence in public policymaking on the matter of people-centered citizen security with a focus on prevention.
The new $10 million investment will strengthen and help ensure sustainability for progress the countries have achieved in institutionalizing the use of evidence in policymaking and following up on public policies for citizen security. "We work in close collaboration with the UNDP on the programme called Infosegura, and it is a really important tool to help certain governments compile data on crime and violence, and governments and civil society in those countries are using the data to inform public policy," stated Peter Natiello, USAID Deputy Assistant Administrator, Latin America and the Caribbean Bureau.
InfoSegura is the first USAID and UNDP regional strategic partnership in the matter of citizen security, enhancing work the UNDP does with strategic partner institutions in the sector, and a robust model for regional integration, spotlighting the inclusion of voices from civil society and academia by consolidating the CONOSE network. This new phase will see InfoSegura continuing to enhance the knowledge, capacities, and lessons learned in the institutions that specialize in citizen security and justice.
This coordinated work involves 42 public institutions, 27 civil society organizations, and 11 academic institutions, supporting capacity-building for over 400 public officials, seven digital multidimensional information management systems, over 10 specialized regional studies, and 62 national reports.
InfoSegura contributes to the creation of evidence to reconsider and redefine the rules of the game, reimagining institutions from the perspective of inclusion, transparent management, and high-quality, people-centered public services. Therefore, citizen security is a prerequisite to achieve the sustainable development and human rights agenda, the key to strengthening the ecosystem for the Rule of Law, and eradicating the use of violence as a mechanism for negotiation between political and social actors, and an inclusive justice system.
"InfoSegura is a fundamental stakeholder in strengthening different governments' capacity for the production, use, and dissemination of information for public policies. In this context, cooperation with USAID continues to be fundamental to be able to contribute to increasing citizen trust and engagement in social transformation," stated Luis Felipe López Calva, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director of the Regional Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean.
Between May 2014 and May 2021, the UNDP had ongoing work through InfoSegura in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic with the motto: “Going from telling to understanding, and understanding for transformation.” This vision has helped drive the shift from quantifying and standardizing data on the incidence of crime to more strategic information management, focusing on the multidimensional analysis of populations and territories most impacted by different forms of violence and insecurity, the production of knowledge, innovation, and new technologies, using evidence to strengthen public policies on citizen security, with an emphasis on the prevention of violence and access to justice, the promotion of social cohesion, with a focus on gender and human rights.
In addition to knowledge products and informing public policy, the work has developed tools to monitor the 2030 Agenda, specifically Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice and strong institutions; and SDG 5: Gender equality, and to develop targets for eradicating crime and violence affecting men and women. Furthermore, reliable data is showing that between 2015 and 2020, in the sub-region of Central America and the Dominican Republic the joint total of violent deaths declined by 51%, (48.5% female victims and 51.5% male victims). In 2015, the rate in the region was 45.7 per 100,000 and in 2020 it reached 18.5 per 100,000 people, closing in on the rate for Latin America.
The key has been institutionalizing the processes and aligning them with national security strategies, making it possible for the processes to be sustainable even with elections campaigns and turnover in administrations, this has even been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this sense, Infosegura will make effective contributions to the UNDP response for recovery from the COVID-19 Crisis: Updated multidimensional analysis enabling sharp, swift, and sustained territorialized and targeted responses to health crises, natural disasters, surges in violence, and other obstacles to the progress of sustainable development. Therefore, InfoSegura contributes in a cross-cutting way to the 2030 Agenda, ensuring no one is left behind. Project resources go towards greater and enhanced data disaggregation, multidimensional analysis, updating risk maps that are created with interinstitutional information, and are useful in prioritising and targeting investments and actions in cases where resources are limited.
InfoSegura is also an active community of practice, enhancing South-South exchange of knowledge and experiences in implementation, as well as an ongoing exploration of innovation and use of technology to transform data into actions and responses to different needs in citizen security, justice, and cohesion in the different settings where it operates. Be a part of this far-reaching conversation on the Project website where there are details of the main developments, as well as specialized knowledge products, webinars, tools, and multidimensional reports with updated and validated data.
This partnership renewal reinforces the UNDP and the Project in their commitment to transforming the lives and institutions along the path of sustainable development.

01 October 2021
In continuing with COVID-19 response efforts, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Belize Country Office under the framework of the Global Fund project titled “Building Resilience Through Innovation and National Accountability for the HIV and TB Response in Belize” has delivered a Cepheid Gene Xpert Machine to support the Ministry of Health and Wellness in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.
During a small ceremony today in Belmopan, the Gene Xpert machine was officially handed over to the Minister of Health and Wellness, Hon. Michel Chebat by Mrs. Denise Antonio, Resident Representative, UNDP in Jamaica, Belize, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, The Bahamas, and Turks & Caicos. Mrs. Antonio assured the Ministry of their continued partnership including support from the Global Fund towards the health sector in response to the challenges posed by COVID-19 in Belize.  “I extend a special thanks to The Global Fund who for over 10 years has entrusted UNDP as Principal Recipient of their grants in Belize and has invested over $16m to date.  Without them most of this would not be possible.”
Minister Chebat expressed appreciation on behalf of the Ministry of Health & Wellness for the donation and partnership. “The fight to defeat COVID-19 will continue to require the collaboration of all our national, regional, and international partners. This occasion today is a manifestation of UNDP’s commitment in helping to create a healthier Belize.”
The donation today represents a total of three Gene Xpert machines of which two are already in use at Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital and also at Western Regional Hospital.  Today’s donation came along with the diagnostic reagents and associated equipment valued at over $20,000. This equipment will support our efforts to further decentralize our analytical capacity to test for SARS-CoV-2, Tuberculosis, Drug Resistant Tuberculosis and Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis, as well as to carry out viral load studies in HIV positive persons.
The Global Fund project is implemented by UNDP on behalf of the National AIDS Commission who serves as the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) of the grant.

24 September 2021
To support the national deployment of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), through financial support from the Government of Germany, donated an ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezer to the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MOHW). Additionally, IT equipment and supplies were also donated to boost passive and active surveillance for Events Supposedly Attributable to Vaccination and Immunization (ESAVI) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI).
“The donation of this ULT freezer will help to boost the vaccine cold chain capacity for the country, particularly in storing the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize. “The mass vaccination campaign for the country is underway and the ULT freezer will be an integral part of keeping our vaccines stored at the optimal temperature to ensure citizens receive safe and effective vaccines.”
This special type of freezer will help the MOHW properly store COVID-19 vaccines and other types of medicines developed using mRNA technology. This is especially important because mRNA is naturally an unstable molecule that is prone to break down when exposed to temperature fluctuations. Hence, investing in an ultra-low temperature freezer for COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration is integral to national vaccine deployment.
Apart from the freezer, IT equipment and supplies were purchased to strengthen the country’s capacity to conduct surveillance of adverse events following immunization. Due to the vast increase in COVID-19 vaccine administration, on both global and national scales, it is imperative to promote safe vaccines and safe vaccination procedures which will ultimately decrease health risks. Monitoring the effects of the vaccines on the population will help prevent unnecessary health risks while maintaining trust in vaccination.
The office supplies and items included, amongst other miscellaneous stationary items, for use by the ESAVI Situation Room at the Ministry of Health and Wellness:

21 September 2021
To strengthen the capacity to screen for diabetes in a timely manner, through the European Union Directorate-General for International Partnerships (formerly EU-DEVCO), the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization donated medical equipment to the Belize Family Life Association (BFLA).
Persons with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, are at higher risk of getting severely ill from SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is crucial to recognize diabetes as a very significant underlying disease of COVID-19. It has also been shown that many young persons and adults are not aware of their levels of blood sugar.  Therefore, making timely screenings are important measures to diagnosing persons with diabetes.
The medical equipment donated included:
As we continue the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, this essential medical equipment will directly enhance the efforts in health systems strengthening by assisting BFLA in the timely diagnosing of diabetes.

20 September 2021
The European Union (EU) has been partnering with PAHO/WHO Belize for almost 20 years in projects that advance the goal of providing more efficient and higher quality health care for the people of Belize.
As one of the largest projects being implemented in Belize, the Health Sector Support Programme (HSSP) is a five-year project created under the 11th European Development Fund (EDF). The project aims to achieve a better quality of life, for all Belizeans, living now and in the future and prioritizes disaster resilient, and environmentally friendly health facility strengthening structure, organization and management of health services, and improving Belize’s health information system.
PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize, Dr. Noreen Jack highlighted the project’s goals and achievements thus far and shared her gratitude:
“I want to thank the European Union for their ongoing support to Belize and the health system and the ongoing partnership with PAHO/WHO and the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) to contribute to achieving a better quality of life for all Belizeans,” said Dr. Jack.
During the 2020 pandemic, PAHO/WHO engaged with the European Union for reorientation of 500,000 to support Belize’s COVID-19, which were used to
The Spotlight Initiative is another global, multi-year partnership between the European Union and the United Nations (UN) to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by 2030. Given the continued evolving situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belize, funds from the project were also used to increase access to mobile and community level health, psychosocial and legal services, increase awareness of family violence and prevent violence against women and girls, strengthen capacity of national authorities to prepare, coordinate and respond to family violence during COVID-19 and improve safety of healthcare workers by procuring hospital equipment and personal protective equipment (PPEs).
“By adopting to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN agencies implementing the Spotlight Initiative (UNICEF, UNFPA, and UNDP) along with government and civil society organizations, shifted their plan to strengthen the country’s capacity to respond to family violence,” said Mrs. Birgit Gerstenberg, UN Resident Coordinator in Belize.
In attendance was also Her Excellency Marianne Van Steen, Ambassador of the EU:
“We have been able to rely on the expertise of PAHO/WHO and the UN in order to make sure that the funds that we made available are well used,” said H.E. Van Steen. “I want to reiterate the importance the European Union attaches to assist countries to face this global pandemic through emergency support of the Health Programme and the Spotlight Initiative. I wish you, Minister, and every Belizean person present today a lot of courage and good luck to ensure that you can face this challenge and the European Union will for sure be at your side, as much as we can to support you.”
The Ministry of Health and Wellness continues to partner with global organizations like PAHO/WHO, the EU, and the UN to improve Belize’s health system to confront evolving challenges due to new technologies, emerging diseases, the burden of non-communicable diseases and threats of climate-related disaster.
“One of the key roles of the Ministry of Economic Development is to interface with the European Union on behalf of the Government of Belize and jointly determine the priorities and allocation of funds by sector,” said Dr. Osmond Martinez, Chief Executive Officer of the National Authorizing Office. “Over the past three decades, the EU has committed over 200 million euros to the improvement and standard of living and quality of life to the people of Belize.”
In closing, the Minister of Health and Wellness thanked the European Union:
“Thank you to the European Union for their commitment to Belize,” said Hon. Michel Chebat. “Thank you for your assistance in repairing and retrofitting our hospitals to upgrade them to smart hospitals. Thank you for your assistance with our BHIS system which has become so critical in this fight against the COVID pandemic and thank you for all the medical equipment and supplies. And one close to my heart is vaccinations – thanks to the European Union through CARPHA we have been able to get vaccinations to Belize.”

Title: PAHO/WHO Donate BiPaP Machine to the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital to Support the Country’s COVID-19 Response in Belize
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
06 September 2021
As part of the country's ongoing COVID-19 response, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) donated a Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure (BPap/BiPap) Unit to Belize's national referral hospital for COVID-19, the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital (KHMH).
With the KHMH now kicked into emergency mode due to the pandemic, this much-needed equipment is crucial at this time to assist the critical care unit of the KHMH to save lives by providing timely and appropriate oxygen therapy support to patients affected by COVID-19.
The donated BiPap machine is the only type of positive pressure ventilator, meaning persons receive higher air pressure when breathing in and thus, opening the lungs. With the lungs being one of the organs most affected by COVID-19, this machine can help patients breathe better by pushing the air into the lungs through a mask or nasal plug while supplying pressurized air into the airways.
To allow the KHMH to use the full capacity of the machine, the donation of the BiPAP also came with a bundle of accessories that include, but are not limited to, antibacterial filters, reusable masks, disposable masks, oxygen ports, leak valves, and other accessories.
"This machine allows us to get oxygen into the lungs of the patient, it is to be used mainly when the patient has obstruction in their lungs and in the early stages when they have difficulty breathing," said Dr. Pedro Arriaga, Head of Intensive Care at KHMH.
PAHO/WHO Belize continues to support the country, the Ministry of Health and Wellness and health facilities like the KHMH with technical cooperation and equipment as we continue the fight against this pandemic.

Title: British High Commission, PAHO/WHO, and the Ministry of Health and Wellness hold ceremony to handover and celebrate the Palm View Center in Belmopan, Belize becoming a Smart Health Facility
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
01 September 2021
As part of the Smart Health Care Facilities in the Caribbean Project Phase II Project, supported by the United Kingdom Department for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (UK FCDO), the British High Commission and the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) officially handed over the Palm View Center in Belmopan to the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) and credited the facility as a ‘Smart Health Care’ Facility.
Palm View Center is one of five (5) health facilities in Belize selected to be retrofitted to become a safer and greener facility. A ‘smart’ facility is a facility that can deliver care effectively and efficiently during disasters, generate operational savings and reduce disaster losses.
“There are more than 67% of hospitals in the Caribbean and Latin America that are considered located in high-risk disaster areas,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize. “As one of the countries in the region that are prone to natural hazards and disasters, it is crucial for the health facilities in Belize to be able to deliver care and protect its staff and patients during emergencies. This COVID-19 pandemic has shown us the importance of emergency and disaster preparedness, and through this partnership with FCDO, we can strengthen five of Belize’s health facilities throughout the country.”
Despite the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the retrofitting works for Palm View Center commenced last year October 2020 with the assistance of Guerra’s Construction Ltd, the contractor for the retrofitting works, and Gutierrez and Associates Architects who assisted in the Design and Inspection. To improve overall safety, functionality and sustainability, the scopes are work included interior works and repairs, bathroom improvements and extension to patient bathrooms, doors and windows replacements, repainting of exterior and interior surfaces, construction of a generator building with fuel dyke, construction of water tank structure, water harvesting improvements, electrical improvements, plumbing and drainage improvements, air conditioning services, as well as other site works such as installation of new pipes, fire extinguishers and smoke detectors among others.
“Living in this part of the world, we, and our neighbours, are hit by natural disasters every year and along with our vulnerability to climate change, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of our health services has been highlighted like never before,” said Her Excellency Claire Evans OBE, British High Commissioner. “It has shown how the right functional support structures and layouts can really help, or if not right, can hinder the amazing work being delivered by so many wonderful health care professionals, and all those who work to support their efforts. The SMART health care facilities programme, supported by the UK and delivered in partnership with PAHO, with support from the Government of Belize is another example of the UK’s commitment to helping vulnerable communities to guard and protect their resources against future storms, disasters and the increased risk from Climate Change.”
The Smart Health Care Facilities in the Caribbean Project is a £43.8m project currently being implemented in seven (7) countries – Dominica, St. Lucia, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Guyana, Jamaica, and Belize. The project aims to increase protection from disasters and climate change for several health facilities in the project countries where work on vulnerability reduction and climate resilience improvement in health facilities will be made. Along with the Palm View Center, the other selected health facilities in Belize include San Ignacio Community Hospital, Independence Polyclinic, Isabel Palma Polyclinic, and Cleopatra White Polyclinic.
The Minister of Health and Wellness, Hon. Michel Chebat, expressed his appreciation of this facility retrofitting because it is in line with this Government's commitment as it continues to strengthen the commitment in health which includes physical, mental and social well-being.
Facility Administrator, Ms. Dianelie Cabral, also gave her thanks and appreciation to the pioneers of the project who made this huge success a reality, but also to the staff of the Palm View Center who relentlessly deliver their utmost labor and services to the health facility on a daily basis.
PAHO/WHO continues to stay committed to collaborating with partners like the UK FCDO to support the country and the Ministry of Health and Wellness in the strengthening of Belize’s overall health system especially its health facilities in providing the best care while being environmentally sound.

Title: European Union (EU) and PAHO/WHO donate a 16-module GeneXpert machine to Belize’s Central Medical Laboratory and MoHW bids farewell to the EU’s Team Leader in Belize
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
26 August 2021
Through the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), the European Union Directorate-General for International Partnerships (formerly EU-DEVCO) donated a 16-module GeneXpert machine to the Central Medical Laboratory (CML)/Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) as part of the EU-WHO regional project on Health Systems Strengthening of Universal Health Care (UHC).
The donation of this 16-module analyzer will allow the lab to run more tests simultaneously and will enhance its diagnostic capacity for early detection of various disease-causing organisms. Of further significance, the GeneXpert will mainly assist with the overall testing for sexually transmitted diseases, but could also facilitate the expansion of the lab’s molecular testing capabilities for COVID-19.
“This is a significant and essential investment in strengthening the country’s laboratory capacity to timely detect and respond to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, within the context of International Health Regulations,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize. “Through ongoing collaboration with partners like the European Union, we can continue to support the Ministry and the country. For example, through the Health Sector Support Programme (also funded by the EU), we are currently supporting health systems strengthening, retrofitting of six health facilities, as well as assisting in the fight against the current pandemic.”
This state-of-the-art analyzer will allow laboratory technicians to deliver faster and quality-assured laboratory services that will guide the decision-making process of physicians and improve overall patient care. This automated rapid diagnosis technology will aid Belize’s health system to effectively detect and respond to infectious diseases, improve the surveillance of sexually transmitted infections, and tackle the global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
“The European Union recognizes that the Government of Belize achieved to stem the corona virus outbreak in the country and to protect its population from even more severe impacts of the pandemic,” said Mr. Nicolaus Hansmann, EU’s Team Leader in Belize. “Since April 2020, the European Union supported the efforts of the Ministry of Health and Wellness with three million Belize Dollars in equipment, supplies and services. Through our partnership with PAHO, today’s delivery of a 16-module GeneXpert machine to the Central Medical Laboratory will further strengthen the capacity of the health sector to control further outbreaks.”
As the only national referral laboratory in Belize, the CML’s overall capacity to conduct molecular diagnostic testing will be upgraded, while staff efficiency and productivity will be enhanced. Given the need to address backlogs especially during emergencies even beyond COVID-19, it is expected that both the access to diagnosis and timeliness of results will be improved with this technology.
“As we continue to grapple with the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, this GeneXpert machine will allow our laboratory personnel to receive results in a timely manner and it will allow for isolation of COVID-19 cases,” said Hon. Michel Chebat, Minister of the Ministry of Health and Wellness. “I extend appreciation to our partners and reaffirm the commitment of the Government of Belize to protect our people.”
The EU is one of the lead contributors to global health and has been partnering with the PAHO/WHO Belize country office for almost 20 years in projects that advance the goal of providing a more efficient and higher quality health care for the people of Belize. Mr. Nicolaus Hansmann has been the Team Leader of the EU in Belize for three years, and we must say thank you and appreciate the guidance and hands-on collaboration he has given on behalf of the European Union, as he ends his tour of duty in the country.
Furthermore, in response to the request from the National AIDS Commission (NAC), PAHO/WHO also donated a smaller 4-module GeneXpert to the Ministry of Health and Wellness to support its efforts in decentralizing testing for TB, viral load testing for HIV and other tests in the regions, as part of the overall strategy of strengthening the national laboratory network.

Title: PAHO/WHO Belize donates emergency family kits to Belize Red Cross
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
25 August 2021
As part of its work in infection prevention and control, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) donated 150 emergency family health kits. The donation seeks to support the efforts of the Belize Red Cross in the management of shelters in Belize in times of natural disasters.
These emergency health kits will be given to families that use designated shelters during hurricanes, flooding, or other natural disasters. Not only do the health kits prevent and control infections in these settings; but, during the pandemic, they allow families to continue the preventive measures that protect them against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
“Sanitation and hygiene become especially important during an emergency and more so during the COVID-19 pandemic,” commented PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize, Dr. Noreen Jack. “During unplanned events, such as hurricanes, shelters protect against loss of life; however, ensuring the safety of persons in these shelters can be accomplished through basic hygiene practices. The emergency health kits not only protect families from getting sick but also protect the health care system from being overwhelmed during an emergency.”
To ensure equitable distribution of the emergency health kits, PAHO/WHO partnered with the Belize Red Cross. Director-General of the Belize Red Cross, Mrs. Lily Bowman explained:
“The Belize Red Cross collaborates closely with the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO). We are in the hurricane season, and we need to be prepared. There are many vulnerable populations in Belize associated with low-lying areas that are prone to flooding, or to hurricane threats. We ensure safe management and safe stay for persons while in shelters. These kits will directly contribute to the area of health and hygiene which is crucial, especially now with the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Each emergency health kit contains shampoos, soap detergent, bars of soap, bleach, rolls of toilet paper, sanitizing wipes, liquid hand soaps, dishwashing liquid, bottles of 70% alcohol, packs of sanitary pads, cleaning cloths, adult toothbrushes, children’s toothbrushes, tubes of toothpaste and combs.
During health emergencies and disasters, PAHO/WHO’s objective is to increase the health sector's resilience. The priority is to deliver rapid and comprehensive support in areas of prevention, risk reduction, preparedness, surveillance, response, and early recovery.

Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
30 July 2021
The Spotlight Initiative held a high-level meeting with the Government of Belize on 23 July 2021 at the San Ignacio Resort Hotel. The objective of the meeting was the alignment of the Women’s and Families Agenda within Plan Belize and the United Nations (UN) Women’s and Families Agenda and identify strategies for strengthening and accelerating the implementation of the Spotlight Initiative.
In her opening remarks, Hon. Dolores Balderamos-Garcia, Minister of Human Development, Families & Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs, as Co-Chair of the National Steering Committee, mentioned that the issue of violence, including gender-based violence (GBV), dishonours women and girls and that the “measure of any country is how we treat our women and girls, and most vulnerable people.” Birgit Gerstenberg, UN Resident Coordinator and Co-Chair of the Committee said the meeting was a space to “listen to the government and see their main points of commitment and how the Spotlight Initiative can support their efforts.” H.E. Marianne Van Steen, Ambassador, European Union Delegation to Jamaica, Belize, and The, Bahamas, said political ownership and commitment to finding solutions to the problem of family violence were crucial for the success of current efforts. “We see this programme as an opportunity to spotlight the issues of family violence and GBV because too often, not only in Belize but in the world, it is an issue that remains continuously in the dark,” she said.
High-level government officials as well as policy and decision-makers responsible for leading the implementation of various areas of Plan Belize were present. Key recommendations from the meeting included the development of a Cabinet information paper on Spotlight Initiative to include its’ contribution to the Women’s and Families Agenda and increased commitment and collaboration of respective Ministries. Participants also recognized the need to identify gender advocates from line ministries to support the continuous partnership within the programme and for ongoing dialogue with civil society partners, including the civil society national reference group (CSNRG).

Title: PAHO/WHO, Government of Germany and the European Union (EU) donate additional items as the Ministry of Health and Wellness Belize intensifies COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
29 July 2021
The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) handed over t-shirts, bumper stickers, and a Smart Samsung TV with mount as the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) intensifies its COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign – Before You Relax, Get Vax. This was made possible through generous funding support from the Government of Germany and the European Union (EU) under the Health Sector Support Programme (HSSP) Belize project.
As an effort to increase awareness of the importance of getting vaccinated against COVID-19, these Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials are a public health intervention aimed at reinforcing positive health-related behaviors such as vaccination. These items will provide the public with the opportunity to be a part of the message. By wearing the t-shirts or placing the bumper stickers on the vehicle, the public participates in raising awareness especially at the community level.
“PAHO/WHO encourages countries to educate and inform the public on COVID-19 and the vaccines,” said Dr. Edwin Bolastig, PAHO/WHO Health Systems and Services Advisor. “PAHO/WHO commends Belize for its untiring efforts to raise awareness on the importance of COVID-19 vaccines and for organizing mass vaccination campaigns nationwide to ensure access to these protective vaccines.”
Public willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 is of high priority to achieve the goal of reaching the eligible target populations; thus, health communication strategies play a vital role in informing people to make the best possible decisions especially during public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.
“As the MoHW Communications team and other colleagues continue their activities in visiting the districts, villages and public spaces such as markets and bus terminals throughout the country, this donation allows them to continue this work in raising awareness to encourage the public to get vaccinated and continue to practice public health measures,” said Dr. Deysi Mendez, Chief Executive Officer of the MoHW.
PAHO/WHO continues to support the Ministry of Health and Wellness and collaborate with partners like the Government of Germany and the European Union as we keep up the fight against COVID-19.

Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
06 July 2021
The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and the Government of Canada donated 25 portable hand-held pulse oximeters to the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital’s COVID-19 Unit.
The donation of pulse oximeters is part of PAHO’s ongoing technical support to facilitate the monitoring of oxygen saturation among patients admitted to the KHMH for observation and treatment of COVID-19.  The device, used in case management and patient follow-up, provides quick and accurate, non-invasive measurements of oxygen concentration in the bloodstream.
Dr. Edwin Bolastig, PAHO/WHO Health Systems and Services Advisor, said “PAHO/WHO continues to provide support to KHMH through procurement of much-needed medical equipment as part of the overall strategy to improve health outcomes and save lives of those who have been afflicted with COVID-19.”
He further explained that these equipment represent continuing efforts to help strengthen the health system’s capacity to respond to the pandemic and beyond.
Five (5) oximeters were purchased from a grant from the Government of Canada to PAHO/WHO aimed at supporting countries in the Americas to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining 20 oximeters s were purchased from WHO Funds for COVID-19 response.
“These portable pulse oximeters will be used in the monitoring of patients who have been discharged from the COVID-19 unit and are recovering,” said Dr. Adrian Coye, Acting Director of Medical Services of the KHMH. “Some of these patients may still have respiratory symptoms for a while therefore we need to be able to monitor their oxygen levels. With this tool, we can monitor their oxygen status and the heart rate, which is an important indicator to determine how well they are.”
The KHMH is the only public facility in the country providing critical care services for COVID-19 patients. By monitoring the oxygen status for the clinical management of moderate to severe cases of COVID-19, more lives are saved. Improving KHMH’s capacity will allow the national referral facility for COVID-19 to be able to play a more effective role in the overall national health system response to the pandemic.

02 July 2021
On 2 July 2021, the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean (UNLIREC) and the Caribbean Community’s Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (CARICOM IMPACS), in collaboration with the Government of Belize, and with support of the Government of Germany, hosted a virtual Executive Seminar for the Advancement of Belize’s National Action Plan for the implementation of the Caribbean Firearms Roadmap.
The Executive Seminar was carried out within the framework of the ‘Roadmap for Implementing The Caribbean Priority Actions on the Illicit Proliferation of Firearms and Ammunition across the Caribbean in a Sustainable Manner by 2030’ (Caribbean Firearms Roadmap). The Roadmap, which was officially adopted on 22 January 2021 by CARICOM’s Council of National Security and Law Enforcement (CONSLE), consolidates and builds upon the 2019 actions adopted by Caribbean Heads of Governments on addressing the illicit trafficking of firearms in the region.
In line with measures taken by nine other States in the region, Belize adopted the Caribbean Firearms Roadmap in May 2021 and has already initiated concrete actions contemplated in the Roadmap by taking steps to create its National Action Plan (NAP). A total of 12 representatives of the Ministry of Home Affairs and New Growth Industries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Human Development, Families and Indigenous People´s Affairs, the Attorney General’s Ministry, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution, Belize´s Police Department, the Coast Guard, and Belize Defense Force, along with members of the German Embassy, UNLIREC and CARICOM IMPACS participated in the NAP Executive Seminar.
In the Seminar, UNLIREC presented the Roadmap and participants discussed steps needed to map out Belize’s priorities, plans, and timelines for implementing the Caribbean Firearms Roadmap. The development of a NAP is key to the successful implementation of the Roadmap, which requires both the concerted efforts of national authorities and the timely, targeted, and coordinated support of regional and international partners and donors. The Roadmap has pre-defined goals, targets and actions as well as recommended performance indicators, serving as a base document for Belize in the elaboration of its National Action Plan (NAP).
UNLIREC and CARICOM IMPACS, as the main implementing partners, are lending technical assistance in elaborating the NAPs and in their successive implementation. The Executive Seminar was part of the first set of activities in the context of the aforementioned assistance. The governments of Canada, Germany, United States of America, and the United Kingdom are supporting the implementation of the Caribbean Firearms Roadmap.
UNLIREC, as the regional organ of the UN Office for Disarmament, seeks to advance the cause of practical disarmament in Latin America and the Caribbean as part of its commitment to support Member States in their implementation of international disarmament and non-proliferation instruments, in particular, the 2001 UN Programme of Action on Small Arms.

Title: PAHO/WHO and the Government of Canada donate six High-Flow Nasal Cannula Systems and two Patient Monitors for COVID-19 response to the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
21 June 2021
As part of the country’s ongoing COVID-19 response, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and the Government of Canada donated six (6) High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) systems and two (2) advanced Patient Monitors with carbon dioxide (CO2) and invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring, including accessories and consumables to the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital (KHMH).
As the KHMH continues to be the national referral hospital for patients with COVID-19, the much-needed donated equipment will allow the critical care unit of the KHMH to save lives by providing timely and appropriate oxygen therapy support and continuous monitoring of persons with COVID-19. High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) Treatment is a non-invasive respiratory support therapy that delivers warm, humidified, oxygen-enriched air to patients, usually using a nasal tube called a cannula. It will provide respiratory support for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and prevent subsequent intubation when used correctly to enhance patient comfort.
“One of the main objectives in managing COVID-19 is providing optimal care for all patients. Part of case management is the close monitoring of the patient’s oxygen levels so that oxygen therapy is immediately initiated among those suffering from hypoxemia or low blood oxygen levels,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize. “These High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) machines have been reported to be effective in improving oxygenation and avoiding intubation compared to other conventional oxygen devices.”
In thanking PAHO/WHO and the Canadian Government, Mr. Timothy Seguro, Acting Chief Executive Officer of the KHMH said, “the equipment which includes a range of appropriately sized nasal cannula is an important boost in our capacity to deliver high-flow oxygen therapy. Using this technology appropriately has the impact of delivering oxygen support to moderately ill patients and in many instances prevents the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.”
The donation of High-Flow Nasal Cannula machines came with the installation, commissioning and training on the use of the equipment, a two-year warranty and accessories that include adult and pediatric patient interfaces, prongs and heated breathing circuits.
The two (2) advanced monitors could be transported with the patients and provide continuous essential measurements of patients’ vital signs and CO2 levels.
"These two extra monitors will add to the previous ones that were donated to strengthen our critical care response," said Dr. Adrian Coye, Acting Director of Medical Services. "We are very pleased to have the ability to have this type of technology that will help us to refine how we treat our patients."

Title: PAHO/WHO donates computer equipment to strengthen the Immunization Information Systems of the Ministry of Health and Wellness’ COVID-19 Vaccine Response
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
17 June 2021
To strengthen the activities and capacities of Immunization Information Systems (IIS) for COVID-19 vaccination in the country, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) donated laptops, tablets, printers and wireless routers to the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW).
Immunization Information Systems (IIS) has quickly become a very important tool for the management of COVID-19 vaccinations. IIS is a confidential and computerized database that records all vaccination doses administered by the MoHW. With the support from this tool, the MoHW will be able to improve vaccination distribution, administration, and documentation.
The donated equipment will also strengthen the information system to provide fast, frequent and accurate reporting and measure the progress of COVID-19 vaccine uptake and coverage. This involves facilitating the registration of vaccines on the Belize Health Information System (BHIS) by providers at the vaccination sites, retrieving information for purposes of Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) surveillance, and conducting periodic administrative reporting of COVID-19 vaccination data.
“The IIS will assist the Ministry of Health and Wellness to identify populations at high risk for diseases that can be prevented through vaccinations such as COVID-19,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize. “The equipment will host essential data to support immunization surveillance and operations that can, in turn, improve the country’s overall vaccination rates.”
The donation included:
The Minister of Health and Wellness, Mr. Michel Chebat, expressed gratitude for the donations, “The Ministry of Health & Wellness, on behalf of the Government and people of Belize, expresses gratitude for the immense solidarity and the unwavering support we continue to receive from the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization towards the national COVID-19 response. These donations we have received today could not have come at a better time, a time when we continue to secure much-needed vaccines. This computer equipment will undoubtedly assist in strengthening the Immunization Information Systems (IIS) and will improve the registration of vaccines in the Belize Health Information System (BHIS). A vaccinated person brings us closer to stopping this COVID-19 pandemic. So, when it is your turn, go and get vaccinated. Love them, protect them, vaccinate them. Be COVID-19 safe! Get vaccinated, Belize.”
With a global pandemic like COVID-19, vaccination data plays a crucial role in an effective global response including reporting to in-country and international stakeholders and donors who support vaccination implementation and deployment. Strengthening Belize’s IIS can serve as a catalyst to introduce more efficient information systems that will improve the country’s overall health goals.

Title: Belize celebrates World Blood Donor Day to raise awareness of the need for safe blood, blood products for transfusion and of the critical contribution blood donors make to Belize’s health system
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
15 June 2021
Each year, on June 14, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) celebrates World Blood Donor Day to raise awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products for transfusion and the critical contribution voluntary, unpaid blood donors make to the health system. This year, the theme is “Give blood and keep the world beating” to highlight the need and essential contribution blood donors make to saving lives.
“Safe blood and blood products and their transfusion are a critical aspect of health,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize. “Blood donors save millions of lives globally and the need for blood is a universal one. To ensure that everyone who needs safe blood has access to it, countries like Belize need voluntary, unpaid donors who give blood regularly.”
A special focus of this year’s campaign is on the role young people have in ensuring a safe blood supply. Young people form a large sector of the population in many societies, and it is important to engage them to become life-long voluntary blood donors, and to be committed to living a healthy life so they can continue to carry out the role of being a blood donor.
“Blood is needed on a daily basis and we need to express our thanks to all the volunteer donors who, out of pure altruism, make the time and effort to donate blood,” said Dra. Gerhaldine Morazán, Director of Medical Laboratory Service of the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW). “For every person who donates blood, three lives are touched and changed. They receive the gift of love by receiving the donated blood that can make the difference between life or death.”
World Blood Donor Day is also a day that provides an opportunity to call to action governments and national health authorities to provide adequate resources and put into place systems and infrastructures to increase the collection of blood from voluntary, non-remunerated blood donors.

“Every person has the right to life and safe blood is life,” said Lily Bowman, Director General of the Belize Red Cross Society. “Building awareness of the importance and safety of donating blood contributes to efforts being made to promote a culture of donating blood. The Belize Red Cross advocates for this and wholeheartedly supports and joins the MoHW, PAHO/WHO, and other partners in observing World Blood Donor Day!”

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, despite limited mobility and other challenges, blood donors in many countries have continued to donate blood and plasma to patients who need a transfusion. This extraordinary effort during a time of unprecedented crisis highlights the crucial role of well-organized, committed voluntary, non-remunerated blood donors in ensuring a safe and sufficient blood supply during normal and emergency times. On World Blood Donor Day, we hail the heroism of these donors who generously give a part of themselves to save the lives of others.

From June 14 – June 18, there will be blood drives and other related activities in every public hospital, particularly in their blood collection centers, and in some private ones to promote voluntary blood donations. We honor and appreciate all voluntary blood donors not only today but each day.

Title: UNICEF, UNHCR, IOM Sign Joint Agreement to Support Refugee and Migrant Children
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
10 June 2021
Belmopan, Belize – The United Nation’s Children Fund (UNICEF), UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) convened to sign the first joint work plan for migrant and refugees in Belize. The work plan outlines strategic actions to protect the local population of migrants and refugees through advocacy and legal reform, and strengthening of data systems, technical capacities to improve response and provision of services to support their integration into Belizean society. The plan also includes the development of minimum acceptable standards for service delivery in migrant and refugee hosting communities and protocols to protect against statelessness.
The joint work plan, signed on June 10th, 2021, seeks to build the capacity of government institutions to enhance birth registration, child protection, and to provide support with integration services. The Agencies will also continue community engagement through mobile hubs where asylum seeking, refugee and migrant families have access to services such as health and birth registration as well as information on asylum and migration procedures.
Birgit Gerstenberg, UN Resident Coordinator for Belize states, “The development of this Joint Work Plan illustrates the much-needed collaboration and coordination among agencies that will continue to be required in the design and implementation of new Multi-Country Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (MSDCF) 2022 - 2026. This comes at an excellent time as it is recognized that the agenda for human mobility management will be a priority that requires partnership and collaboration between development partners, government, CSO and the UN entities at both the regional and national levels.”
Alison Parker, Representative for UNICEF Belize, spoke of UNICEF’s commitment to protecting and empowering children and their families to contribute to our national development. “UNICEF’s position is unchangeable. In any country - A child is a child, no matter why they leave home, where they come from, where they are, or how they got there. Every child deserves protection, care and all the support and services they need to thrive and become productive members of our society.”
Belize is home to 2,394 registered and an estimated 3,400 more unregistered asylum seekers and refugees, all of whom have the right to register the birth of their children in the country. Yet geographical and knowledge barriers are often obstacles for many.
“Statelessness affects millions of people around the world, including many children,” said Yolanda Zapata, UNHCR’s Head of Office in Belize. “While lack of documentation does not render someone stateless, birth registration of refugee and asylum-seeking children is a key element in preventing and mitigating the risk of not having a nationality.”
Diana Locke, IOM’s Head of Office stated that “IOM recognizes the need for migrants and especially those in vulnerable positions to have access to accurate information and services enabling them to navigate the migration process. It is our hope to partner with Government and Stakeholders to ensure a safe, orderly and dignified migration process.”
Through coordinated efforts by our three UN agencies, we will help to strengthen the assistance to these persons, working together with the government and local agencies enabling a comprehensive approach to refugee and migrant integration into Belizean society.
The joint UN Agencies calls for seven actions to protect all refugee and migrant children:

Title: Belize receives second shipment of COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
12 May 2021
Today, Belize received its second shipment of 33,600 doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility, a global partnership between the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility was established by the World Health Organization to ensure fair allocation and equitable access to vaccines for all countries, especially those that may not have enough resources to secure initial access to vaccine supply. Through COVAX, countries are first given the opportunity to secure vaccines for at least 20 percent of their population. In the case of Belize, coverage for 30% of the population was negotiated. Once all participating countries have received enough vaccines to cover 20% of their population, further allocations may be made.
For Belize, an initial allocation of 100,800 was approved. Of this amount, Belize has now received a total of 67,200 doses since the first delivery of AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines, manufactured by SK Bioscience of South Korea, was arrived on March 31. PAHO’s Revolving Fund, which is responsible for procuring COVID-19 vaccines for countries of the Americas under the COVAX Mechanism, facilitated both shipments shipment.
Referencing the arrival of the second shipment, Hon Michel Chebat, Minister of Health and Wellness recognizes the effort of each of the 48,515 persons vaccinated up to May 10, 2021. “By getting vaccinated we are all contributing to contain the negative outcomes associated to COVID 19. This shipment has arrived two days before administering the last doses of the current stock.”
“The arrival of this new shipment of vaccines is reassuring because this means that those who have received their first doses can now receive their second dose without delays,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative of Belize. “Additionally, using a platform like COVAX ensures fair and equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccinations for countries like Belize to keep their population protected against Sars-CoV-2.”
This set of vaccines will enhance the Ministry of Health and Wellness’ efforts in delivering vaccines to those in the distribution phases while ensuring that Belize continues to maintain low levels of community transmission.
Until vaccination is widespread among the population, basic public health measures remain the basis of the pandemic response. For public health authorities, this means continuing to conduct screening, contact tracing, isolation, assisted quarantine, and quality care. And for people, it means continuing to practice physical distancing, hand hygiene, the use of masks, adequate ventilation of indoor environments, and avoidance of crowded spaces.
Alison Parker, UNICEF Representative for Belize stated, “the current situation in several parts of the world, underscores why we cannot grow lax in our approach to fighting this pandemic. We must remain vigilant and continue the important task of protection and prevention - vaccinating our population to increase immunity and protect the vulnerable among us, as grandmothers, parents and teachers are crucial to the safety, wellbeing, and protection of children. By staying the course, we can reduce the number of persons that contract COVID-19 and continue our steady and safe path to returning our citizenry, especially the children, to a state of normalcy.”
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organisations, vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others. In the Americas, the PAHO Revolving Fund is the recognized procurement agent for the COVAX facility.

Title: PAHO/WHO donates Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and Biomedical Equipment to support the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
10 May 2021
The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) through the PAHO Health Emergencies Department (PHE) is donating personal protective equipment (PPEs) and biomedical equipment to the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital’s COVID-19 Unit.
The donation of oxygen concentrators is part of PAHO’s ongoing technical support to enhance medical oxygen supply when demands increase; The donated hand-held and fingertip pulse oximeters facilitate monitoring of oxygenation status during clinical management of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The PPE kits are critical to minimizing exposure of health workers to SARS-Cov-2 as they provide care to patients hospitalized at the KHMH COVID-19 Critical Care Unit.
Dr. Edwin Bolastig, Health Systems and Services Advisor commented, “Healthcare workers are crucial to maintaining services during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the greatest risks to the healthcare system is the potentially high rate of infections due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among healthcare workers. This could subsequently lead to a lack of availability of trained personnel to guarantee an adequate local and/or national response to the pandemic. Therefore, the donation of PPEs ensures the safety of health workers while maintaining availability of essential health workers to be able to respond to the pandemic by enhancing their ability to adhere to infection, prevention and control (IPC) practices.”
The donated items include 5 oxygen concentrators, 2 portable handheld and 112 fingertip pulse oximeters, 300 respirator masks (KN95), 900 face shields, 7,500 surgical masks, 9,920 gowns and 5,000 gloves.
Mrs. Michelle Hoare, CEO of the KHMH thanked PAHO for the donations saying, "These donated items will provide the required medical support for ongoing management of persons confirmed with and suspected of having COVID-19. The donations will also better prepare hospital management as well as, the COVID-19 response team if Belize has to respond to a potential COVID-19 surge."
The KHMH is the only public facility in the country providing critical care services for COVID-19 patients. By enhancing infection prevention and control in the unit, the safety of healthcare staff working in the unit is protected and by assuring oxygen therapy and monitoring of oxygen status for the clinical management of moderate to severe cases of COVID-19, more lives are saved. Improving KHMH’s capacity will then allow the national referral facility for COVID-19 to be able to play a more effective role in the overall national health system response to the pandemic.
The Health Emergencies Department (PHE) of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) facilitated the donation. Its objective is to increase health sector resilience to emergencies and disasters. PHE assists Member States to strengthen the health sector’s capacities in prevention, risk reduction, preparedness, surveillance, response and early recovery for emergencies and disasters related to any hazards (natural, man-made, biological, chemical, radiological and others).  Additionally, when national capacities are overwhelmed, PHE leads and coordinates the international health response to contain disasters, including outbreaks, and to provide effective relief and recovery to affected populations, which includes the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
04 May 2021
With grant funding from the India-UN Partnership Fund, and support from UNDP the Support to Infrastructure for Human Development, Health and Sports Project was implemented by the Ministry of Human Development, Families & Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, the Environment, Sustainable Development and Immigration. The project supported infrastructural improvements through the upgrading facilities at the Youth Challenge Programme (YCP) and the construction of a multi-purpose facility in San Ignacio Town to address youth vulnerability to crime and enhance community health and well-being.
The India-UN Partnership Fund is a dedicated facility within the United Nations Fund for South-South Cooperation which supports initiatives to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through concrete initiatives in response to other developing countries' cooperation requests. The India-UN Development Partnership granted US$590,000.00 for the Support to Infrastructure for Human Development, Health and Sports Project which supported two outcomes.\
One of the elements was the upgrading of facilities for the Belize Youth Challenge (BYC) Campus which is located at twenty-one (21) miles west of Belize City will facilitate the implementation of the Youth Challenge Program and other programs for at-risk youth. This upgrade included the construction of a chain linked fence around the entire BYC campus, the renovation and expansion of the BYC’s Campus Dormitory and the purchase of a Toyota Hiace Van to transport the students. The element of the initiative was the construction of a multi-purpose sporting facility in San Ignacio Town. The Cayo North Sports Pavilion houses a Futsal Field, a gym and an adjacent earthen football field. This facility aims to transform the lives of over 4,000 community members by providing a multi-purpose sporting and health facility.
The outcomes of this project will assist Belize in its path to achieving accomplishments towards the SDGs 1,2,3,5, 10, and 12, relating to poverty reduction, health, gender equality, climate change, and safe cities.

Title: PAHO/WHO and the Federal Republic of Germany donate laptops, MiFi devices, and vaccination cards to support Belize's Ministry of Health and Wellness’ COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
30 April 2021
As part of its support to the implementation of the Belize National COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment plan, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and the Federal Republic of Germany are today donating to the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW).
The Ministry of Health and Wellness uses its electronic medical record, the Belize Health Information System (BHIS), in most public health facilities. However, some rural and remote health facilities where Internet may not be available, do not have access to the BHIS, presenting a challenge to real-time information on vaccine administration. Having the capability to conduct data entry improves the monitoring and evaluation capacity at all levels of the health system, which is especially important for COVID-19 vaccine deployment.
“The equipment we are donating today allows personnel of the Ministry of Health and Wellness to electronically track and record the vaccines that have been administered into the information for health system,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative of Belize. “This allows the Ministry to report on and monitor the number of vaccines given, record information including vaccine type and batch number and, most importantly, conduct post surveillance for any adverse effects.”
The donated items included:
“Because of the improvements by our Information Technology Unit, we are now able to have better access to Belize’s Health Information System (BHIS),” said Dr. Deysi Mendez, Chief Executive Officer of the MoHW. “However, we still face challenges with the additional necessary equipment to conduct data entry and access the BHIS. We are grateful for this donation from PAHO/WHO and the Federal Republic of Germany that will allow prompt access to gather and record individual data for reporting and documenting any adverse events following immunizations and respond timely.”
As we keep up the fight against the pandemic, PAHO/WHO continues to work and collaborate with partners like the Federal Republic of Germany to support the ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Health and Wellness and the country of Belize.

Title: World Malaria Day April 25 - Maintaining the achievements of Zero Malaria cases in Belize and getting ready to be Malaria free in 2022!
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
22 April 2021
As we celebrate World Malaria Day, the disease remains an important public health concern globally. In the Region of the Americas, Belize is one of the countries reporting zero malaria cases since 2019. Despite this achievement, urgent action is still required to keep the country on track to eliminating the disease and being certified as a malaria-free Belize by 2022.
The Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030 (GTS) adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015 sets ambitious but attainable global targets for 2030. These include reducing malaria case incidence and mortality rates by at least 90%, eliminating malaria in at least 35 countries and preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free.
Since 1954, the countries in the Americas made the important decision of adopting malaria eradication as a program with the Pan American Sanitary Bureau as the coordinating unit. Some years later the Global Program for Malaria Eradication was created and became the coordinating unit for malaria in the world. Although the disease was eliminated in many countries, challenges such as social determinants contributed to the reemergence of Malaria in some of these territories including Belize.
In the 2000s, due to reinforced global and regional commitments, the number of malaria cases decreased considerably, and the progress made in preventing deaths has been even more encouraging. The significant malaria reduction observed in the region prompted unprecedented political and financial commitment from malaria-endemic countries to eliminate the disease. Thereafter growing number of countries embarked on the national elimination goals, and regional networks were formed to facilitate collaboration.
Some of the key investments in malaria in the Americas include the Amazon Malaria Initiative which started in 2001 with funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Global Fund-supported Elimination of Malaria in Mesoamerica and the Island of Hispaniola (EMMIE) Initiative. The latter initiative included the seven (7) Central American countries and the two countries of the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic).
More recently, after the end of the EMMIE project, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and other partners announced the Regional Malaria Elimination Initiative (RMEI) which invested $83.6 million to support the EMMIE participating countries in taking the final steps to eliminate malaria in their territories. PAHO/WHO, as the main technical partner of the project, has been working together with the National Authorities in Belize to strengthen continuous capacity building for prompt and accurate diagnosis including the use of Rapid Diagnostics Test, the surveillance and case investigation, appropriate management of cases and Risk Assessment to identify areas with a higher risk of malaria transmission.
Between 2010 and 2020, Belize achieved a 100% reduction in local malaria cases (150 cases to zero cases), with its last case reported in December 2018, placing the country one step away from malaria elimination. In the midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the focus is now on the prevention of the reintroduction of the disease through early detection, prompt treatment and good coverage of preventive measures such as mosquito nets distribution and Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) to maintain zero local cases.
Remember, Zero Malaria starts with me and with you. Together we can beat Malaria for good and reach the historic goal of becoming a Malaria-free Belize.

Title: Belize receives the first COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
01 April 2021
Belize today received 33,600 doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility, a global effort between the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi, UNICEF, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
The arrival marks a historic step toward ensuring the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, in the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history. This delivery is part of the first phase of deliveries for Belize, and more vaccines are expected to arrive successively during 2021. According to the first round of COVAX allocations, Belize is expected to continue receiving doses until it reaches 100,800, the amount specified by COVAX.
PAHO’s Revolving Fund, which is responsible for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines for the countries of the Americas under the COVAX Mechanism, sent 33,600 doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, manufactured by SK Bioscience of South Korea. The vaccines arrived today at the Phillip Goldson International Airport.
“The arrival of the vaccines through COVAX is very encouraging as it means that more people will now be able to be protected from COVID-19,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative in Belize. “We will continue to work with the Ministry of Health and Wellness and the country to support vaccination along with the known public health and social measures that can help stop the spread of COVID-19, protect health services, and save lives.”
These first vaccines will serve to protect priority groups and those most at risk, such as health workers, older adults, persons with special conditions (cancer, HIV & requiring dialysis), as well as persons in the other vaccine distribution phases in Belize.
Hon. Michel Chebat, Minister of the Ministry of Health and Wellness expressed how grateful he was for this delivery that will add to the vaccines that we already have.
“We extend appreciation for the team effort coordinated through our partners, PAHO/WHO, UNICEF and IDB for negotiating, purchasing, and handling the shipment logistics on behalf of Belize and the other 36 countries participating in COVAX,” said Minister Chebat. “This was our only hope for a long time to ensure that the people of Belize get vaccines and now we can celebrate the arrival today.”
Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in 2020, the country has recorded 12,452 cases and 317 deaths as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (as of 30 March 2021).
“Today’s arrival of the first COVAX shipment marks another milestone for the children of Belize who have been the silent victims of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Alison Parker, Representative for UNICEF Belize. “The past year has plunged Belize into a humanitarian and socio-economic crisis upending the lives of societies, communities and families, especially children. As over 108,000 children prepare to return to the classrooms in the upcoming months, the arrival of the vaccines advances us one step closer to creating a post-COVID environment that is safe for children to return to schools and regain a sense of security and normalcy. It is also a signal of the commitment of the Government and partners like the COVAX, inclusive of UNICEF, to prioritize mobilizing required resources to afford Belizeans optimal health care and protection in response to this crisis. Accelerating vaccination coverage is critical to stabilizing the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and rebuilding Belize, and UNICEF is proud to be part of this national effort in the interest of Belize’s children.”
COVAX seeks to provide vaccines for at least 20% of the population of each participating country during 2021. In this first round of vaccine allocation, all COVAX participating countries will receive doses to vaccinate between 2.2 and 2.6% of their population. The only exceptions are small island developing States, which will receive an allocation of vaccines to cover between 16 and 20% of their population, due to the high logistical cost of delivering small quantities of vaccines.
“Expanding access to vaccines is vital for overcoming the pandemic and its detrimental effects on the life of people and the economy,” said Birgit Gerstenberg, Resident Coordinator of United Nations Belize. “Its progress is crucial in order to get back to the path of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular, poverty reduction, food security for all, universal health coverage, decent work and so much more. Thanks to science and technology, the newly developed COVID-19 vaccines are made available in record time and poised to be a powerful tool in the control of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. The public’s confidence in, and willingness to receive the vaccines will determine the outcome of this mass-scale public health intervention. The United Nations Country Team has been working tirelessly this past year to provide as much support to the Government of Belize in facing the consequences of the pandemic and helping those most at-risk. Let us continue to confront the pandemic and take all measures of mitigation at our reach. Stay at home when you are sick, wear a mask when among others, practice social distancing and when eligible, receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Consider it a measure that may save lives as only together, we will build back better.”
Until vaccination is widespread among the population, basic public health measures remain the basis of the pandemic response. For public health authorities, this means continuing to conduct screening, contact tracing, isolation, assisted quarantine, and quality care. And for people, it means continuing to practice physical distancing, hand hygiene, the use of masks, adequate ventilation of indoor environments, and avoidance of crowded spaces.
“Today is a bright day in the year-ling fight against COVID-19, said Nicolaus Hansmann, Team Leader of the European Union Technical Office in Belize. “With the arrival of these vaccines under the multi-actor global collaboration, COVAX, we are getting closer to the goal of bringing the virus under control. As one of the lead partners of COVAX, contributing over 2.2 billion Euros, the European Union and its Member States are proud of its role in ensuring equitable access to vaccines for people everywhere.”
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organisations, vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others. In the Americas, the PAHO Revolving Fund is the recognized procurement agent for the COVAX facility.

Title: PAHO/WHO Belize and the Government of Canada donate computer equipment to strengthen public health surveillance at Belize’s land borders
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
29 March 2021
Although Belize’s land borders remain closed, it is key for the country’s points of entry to be prepared to prevent, control and provide proper public health response for when the land borders reopen. Through funding from the Government of Canada, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) donated computer equipment with supplies to strengthen national public surveillance capacity at the Western and Northern land borders of Belize.
“This is part of an overall grant from the Government of Canada to PAHO/WHO aimed at supporting countries in the Americas to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative of Belize. “Ground crossings such as Belize’s land borders play an important role in controlling public health risks such as the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Cross-border movement not only affects travelers but also affects communities of people living and working around these border areas. Without the proper equipment to implement health measures such as planning and surveillance and risk monitoring, the ability to efficiently prevent, detect, and respond to health risks and emergencies at land borders may be difficult to achieve.
“The COVID-19 pandemic knows no borders and strategic alliances are key to fight this global pandemic,” said High Commissioner of Canada to Belize H.E. Rita Rudaitis-Renaud. “That is why I am pleased that this support of the Government of Canada will contribute to meet the ongoing health sector needs in Belize. Canada will continue to support and build on the Health Sector Resilience project in the Caribbean.”
To enhance these public health measures and assist in ensuring land borders are prepared for current and future health risks, the donated equipment included:
“The Government of Belize and the Ministry of Health & Wellness are grateful to the Government of Canada; the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) for the donations of computer and related devices that will contribute to further strengthen the national surveillance at the Western and Northern land borders of Belize,” said Chief Executive Officer of the Ministry of Health and Wellness, Dr. Deysi Mendez. “This timely donation strengthens our goal of safeguarding the health and wellbeing of the people and allows us to prepare for any future health threats as we strategically plan to reopen the land borders.”
Along with this donation, PAHO/WHO also handed over 70,000 surgical masks and 10,000 KN95 masks to the Ministry of Health and Wellness to support the National COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment.

Title: PAHO/WHO Belize and the European Union facilitate site visits for prospective contractors to three of Belize’s hospitals
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
19 March 2021
As part of the European Union (EU) funded Health Sector Support Programme, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) facilitated site visits for prospective contractors for the retrofitting of the Punta Gorda and Corozal Community Hospitals and Southern Regional Hospital in Dangriga.
The 6.8 million Euro project will strengthen and improve Belize’s health system to achieve universal health care for all as well as develop climate-friendly and disaster-resilient health facilities in the country. The Punta Gorda and Corozal Community Hospitals and Southern Regional Hospital are three of the six health facilities to be retrofitted under this project including Northern Regional Hospital, Western Regional Hospital and Central Medical Laboratory.
“As COVID-19 has shown us, the capability to respond and deliver care safely during emergencies including disaster-related situations is key in becoming a ‘smart’ health facility,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative of Belize. “Through this partnership with the European Union, we will be able to reduce vulnerability in six of Belize’s health care facilities while strengthening structural and non-structural aspects including increasing operational savings.”
The site visit allowed prospective contractors to do a walk-through of the facility to understand and identify areas of the facility to be retrofitted. It also provided the opportunity for Acting Regional Manager, Mrs. Floridalia Quiroz, and Design and Inspection Consultant, Mr. Ariel Mitchell to answer any queries the contractors may have regarding the scope of works. Also, in attendance was Mr. Nicolaus Hansmann, Team Leader of the European Union in Belize, who was also briefed on the different areas of the facility being retrofitted.
Mr. Hansmann expressed satisfaction about the high number of Belizean constructing companies participating in the site visits. He underlined that the grant funds from the European Union will facilitate that health facilities in Belize are more efficient, storm resilient and environmentally friendly.
Site visits will also be conducted at Western Regional Hospital and the other facilities in the upcoming weeks.
About the Belize Health Sector Support Programme
Under the 11th European Development Fund (EDF) agreement between Belize and the European Union (EU), this is a five-year project aimed at "achieving a better quality of life, for all Belizeans, living now and in the future." The Health Sector Support Programme is funded by the European Union (EU) and implemented by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Wellness. These partners work collaboratively to improve Belize’s health sector and develop climate-friendly and disaster-resilient health facilities.

18 March 2021
As part of the Smart Health Care Facilities in the Caribbean Project, PAHO/WHO Belize and the British High Commissioner, Her Excellency, Claire Evans, visited the San Ignacio Community Hospital, one of five health facilities in Belize being retrofitted to become safer, greener, and more resilient to natural disasters and climate change.
“Belize is one of the countries of the Caribbean region prone to a wide variety of natural hazards and high-risk to disasters,” said Dr. Noreen Jack, PAHO/WHO Representative of Belize. “Therefore, it is crucial for the hospitals and health facilities to be able to deliver care and protect its staff and patients during these conditions. Through this partnership with the UK Government, we can strengthen structural aspects and generate operational savings in an environmentally friendly and resilient health facilities.”
The £43.8m Strengthening Health Facilities in the Caribbean (Smart Hospital) project is currently implemented in 7 countries: Dominica, St. Lucia, Grenada, Saint Vincent and The Grenadines, Belize, Guyana and Jamaica. The project is funded by UKaid and implemented by PAHO/WHO in close collaboration with the Ministries of Health. Along with San Ignacio Community Hospital, the other health facilities to be retrofitted under this project includes Independence Polyclinic, Palm Center Nursing Home, Isabel Palma Polyclinic, and Cleopatra White Polyclinic. Matron Roberts Polyclinic was designed under this project though retrofit will be done by Ministry of Health and Wellness.
“I am delighted to be here and see for myself the progress of works at this critical health facility - one of five facilities selected for SMART retrofitting,” said H.E. Claire Evans. “This project, funded by the UK, will be instrumental in supporting Belize’s efforts to reduce disaster vulnerability of vital public buildings, boost its climate resilience while also generating operational savings. The UK is grateful for the partnership and support of PAHO and the Government of Belize. Our thanks to Minister Chebat for also joining us today.”
The goal of the San Ignacio Community Hospital site visit was to understand the progress of the retrofitting works being carried to transform the hospital into a ‘smart’ facility. Current work being done with the assistance of Maheias United Ltd includes installation of solar panel and rainwater harvesting system, improvement of water storage, fire protection and sewer systems. The electrical system is also being upgraded to enable the hospital to be more energy-efficient, and the HVAC system will be overhauled to improve air quality and thermal environment for both patients and medical staff.
“The Government of Belize, its people, and the Ministry of Health & Wellness remain forever grateful to the UK Government for this assistance through the UKaid grant programme and to the PAHO/WHO team who have given technical support and oversight of the project implementation,” said Hon. Michel Chebat, Minister of the Ministry of Health and Wellness. “It is a great honor to be a part of this transformation and for Belize to be one of the 7 Caribbean countries to benefit from this project.”
The upgrade of the San Ignacio Community Hospital is expected to finish in July 2021.

Title: UN launches new campaign, Only Together, to support global vaccine equity call
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
11 March 2021
The United Nations today launched a new global campaign, Only Together to support its call for fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines around the world.
The campaign stresses the need for coordinated global action to ensure vaccines are accessible in all countries, starting with health-care workers and the most vulnerable.
"Over the past year, we’ve all missed out on doing the things we love to do with others—eating, hugging, and going to school and work,” said UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed.
“Millions of us have lost someone we love or had our livelihoods taken away. An unprecedented global scientific effort for vaccines has given us hope to defeat the virus — but only if we work together to ensure everyone, everywhere has access to COVID-19 vaccines. Only together can we end the pandemic and transform a new era of hope.”
More than 2.5 million people around the world have died from COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 vaccines will stop people from dying, prevent new variants from emerging, reignite economies and offer the best hope to end the pandemic.
The biggest vaccine roll out in history is now underway with millions of doses being delivered around the world, including to some of the world’s poorest countries, through the efforts of COVAX, the global vaccine equity mechanism.
But these doses will initially only cover a small segment of the populations — healthcare workers and the most vulnerable. By the end of 2021, COVAX aims to offer vaccines to nearly 30 per cent of each participating country’s population. But that progress pales compared to ten rich countries who possess nearly 80 per cent of all COVID-19 vaccines, with some planning to vaccinate their entire population within the next few months.
COVAX, which is led by the World Health Organization, GAVI and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and in partnership with UNICEF, has 190 participating countries. It needs more than US$2 billion to fully meet its goal to vaccinate those most in need by the end of the year.
Pledging new funding for COVAX is critical, but more can be done to scale up vaccine access by sharing excess vaccines, transferring technology, offering voluntary licensing or even waiving intellectual property rights.
“If the world’s scientists were able to develop safe and effective vaccines in just seven months, the aims of world’s leaders must be equally record-breaking — to provide enough funding and to ramp up manufacturing to enable everyone on earth to be vaccinated,” said UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications Melissa Fleming.

-
CITY OF BELMOPAN, FEBRUARY 25, 2021 — The inauguration of the National Multistakeholder Steering Committee marked a significant milestone for the Spotlight Initiative as it is the highest level of coordination that stipulates national-level strategic policy direction and mobilizes resources for eliminating violence against women and girls (VAWG). During the meeting, key results for 2020 were discussed as well as steps forward for 2021 which lead to the unanimous approval by all members of the Annual Work Plan 2021.
The Inaugural Meeting was co-chaired by Hon. Dolores Balderamos-Garcia, Minister of Human Development, Families & Indigenous Peoples’, and Ms Birgit Gerstenberg, UN Resident Coordinator to Belize and El Salvador who extended their appreciation to the committee and their commitment to the initiative. Her Excellency, Marianne Van Steen, Head of the EU Delegation to Jamaica, Belize, Turks and Caicos Islands, Bahamas, and the Cayman Islands gave the opening remarks where she highlighted the European Union’s support for multilateralism and partnership with all who contribute to the initiative. The Special Envoy for the Development of Families and Children, Mrs Rosanna Briceno was present and extended her gratitude for collaboration. Members from the Civil Society National Reference Group, who support advocacy for CSOs and women’s rights groups, were also in attendance. The Government of Belize representatives on the committee included Chief Executive Officers from the Ministry of Human Development, Families and Indigenous Peoples Affairs’, Ministry of Finance, Economic Development & Investment, Ministry of Education, Culture & Technology, Ministry of Youth, Sports and E-Governance, Ministry of Home Affairs & New
Growth Industries, Ministry of Rural Transformation, Community Development, Labour & Local Government, and Ministry of Health & Wellness.
The Spotlight Initiative is a global, multi-year initiative focused on eliminating all forms of family violence and VAWG embarked by the European Union and the United Nations. This Initiative is so named as it brings focused attention to this issue, moving it into the spotlight and placing it at the centre of efforts to achieve gender equity and equality and women's empowerment, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These efforts began in Belize in January 2020 and have included implementing activities that strengthen policy and legislation to increase the protection of women and girls, build the capacity of state and non-state actors to respond to family violence, expand the range of services available, and address social norms and behaviours that promote violence against women and girls. The modality for the delivery in Belize is with the support of the Government of Belize, EU, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), and Recipient United Nations Organizations (RUNOs) – UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF – with the support of UN Associate Agencies – UN Women, ILO, PAHO/WHO, UNHCR, and OCHCR.

Title: UN Agencies Coordinate Mobile Centers for Rural Communities in Belize, host Migrant and Asylum-Seeking Families
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
19 February 2021
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the United Nation’s Children Fund (UNICEF), and International Organization for Migration (IOM) will be launching a series of Mobile Centers for asylum seekers and migrant communities in southern and western Belize.
This outreach is a part of an inter-agency plan which seeks to coordinate the development and implementation of strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 10 to reduce inequalities within and among countries. It requires countries to “facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of peoples.” Belize is currently home to an estimated 51,000 migrant persons and in 2010, 14.8% of the total population of Belize accounted for the foreign-born population. In addition, Belize hosts 2,394 registered and an estimated 3,400 more unregistered asylum seekers and refugees that have come to the country seeking safe haven and protection, mostly from nearby El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. The mobile clinics will allow for agencies to coordinate humanitarian assistance and support to respond to the emerging issues of migrants, refugees and residents of their host communities.
“Migration is an important force in development and a high-priority issue where almost half of all migrants are women, and most are of reproductive age”, says Tisa Grant, Liaison Officer for UNFPA Belize. “They all have specific needs and human rights concerns, including increased susceptibility to gender based violence which includes physical, psychological, socio-economic and sexual violence.”
Grant further explains, “The legal support to be received by the migrant community is part of a broader initiative by the EU and UN to end violence against women and girls under the Spotlight Initiative, to help ensure that essential services reach and empower those who are most vulnerable and furthest behind such as migrant women.”
“When the most vulnerable populations, including refugees, asylum seekers and their host communities, do not have access to basic services like health and protection, everyone suffers” says Yolanda Zapata, UNHCR’s Head of Office in Belize. “Facilitating access to legal services, birth registration, psychosocial services, and to information on the asylum procedures are key to developing comprehensive responses to address the needs of all populations living in the rural areas of Belize. This joint effort supports the fight against statelessness, the access to basic human rights and helps pave a more certain road towards greater inclusion.”
Michel Guinand, Social Policy Specialist for UNICEF Belize, specifies that children affected by migration are particularly vulnerable and should benefit from special protection measures. Guinand explains that the mobile centers will assist UNICEF in extending its national birth registration advocacy to migrant families in these communities. It is also an opportunity to respond to the often-invisible children of migrant families and provide integrated services to address their inherent vulnerabilities.
Guinand emphasizes that, “additional investments in health, education and social protection is needed to address the risks, exclusion and discrimination faced by children and adolescents from migrant families. These mobile centers take the requisite services to the spaces where they are most needed to improve the lives of children in these vulnerable populations.”
There remains a need for persons in vulnerable position such as migrants in a regular or irregular status, to access much needed services offered by the state or other local agencies. IOM Belize will offer support for the sustainable social economic integration of migrants and returnees in Belize by sharing information to migrants in the community on the application process for nationality, permanent residence, visas, and work permit.
The mobile centers will expand coverage through the provision of services to community members who cannot access established centralized service locations due to limited mobility, distance, insecurity or other obstacles. It will be conducted in three phases in communities where migrant and asylum-seeking families reside. The events begin at 9:00 am and the schedule is as follows:
Beneficiaries will be able to access a comprehensive menu of critical health, legal and social services.  These include consultations to facilitate onsite registration of births and other procedural queries. Families who require legal support will also be able to access free one-on-one legal advice and assistance on family law, inheritance, property matters, and immigration and asylum system procedures.  They will also be able to access sexual and reproductive health services, inclusive of cervical cancer screening, HIV testing and manual breast exams.
This initiative is part of a national joint strategy between the Government of Belize and the UN Inter-Agency Response team to improve migration management, mitigate challenges and preserve the dignity and to guarantee the same value to all, as human rights are inalienable and universal. There will be strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols with an appointment system in place to manage flow and movement among persons.

Title: District Health Educators to receive laptops and projectors to properly facilitate the training of Community Health Workers during COVID-19
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
18 February 2021
Last year, the European Union (EU) and the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) reallocated funds from the existing ‘Health Sector Support Programme Belize Project’ to assist in the country’s response to COVID-19. Through this funding, nine (9) District Health Educators from the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) will receive laptops with cases and eight (8) projectors to strengthen the ability to train health workers in basic healthcare services related to blood pressure and blood sugar monitoring at the community level.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought on new challenges and changes to healthcare systems including disruptions in the delivery of healthcare services. This also includes the disruption in the continued training and education of healthcare professionals, especially at the community level.
As COVID-19 has accurately shown, it is important for healthcare workers to stay skilled and trained in the services they provide. With the limitations, many countries are now living in, due to COVID-19, technology has become a major factor in ensuring the capacity of continued healthcare services including the training of health workers.
The District Health Educators, who receive the laptops and projectors, are all Senior Officers of the Health Education and Community Participation Bureau (HECOPAB). The donation of these items will enhance their skills and capacity to facilitate the training of the Community Health Workers (CHWs) in all six districts of Belize, with a focus on the areas of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension and diabetes and COVID-19 prevention and control.
“They will complement the capacity of our District Health Educators in their interaction with Community Health Workers,” said Dr. Melissa Diaz-Musa, Acting Director of Health Services of the MoHW. “Now more than ever, there is the need to sensitize and train CHWs to be able to promptly know what to do when they encounter persons who may be vulnerable to COVID-19. Chronic diseases are important risk factors. We shall ensure that the motivation of our CHWs is maintained.”
PAHO/WHO Non-Communicable Diseases Technical Advisor, Dr. Jorge Polanco, handed over the donated items to Dr. Javier Zuniga and Ms. Kathleen Cho, who were grateful to receive them on behalf of Dr. Diaz-Musa and the Ministry of Health and Wellness.
Through the ‘Health Sector Support Programme Belize Project’ reoriented funds, the EU and PAHO/WHO has been supporting Belize and the Ministry of Health and Wellness by enhancing national laboratory diagnostic capacity through purchasing of test kits, equipment and supplies, enhancing infection prevention and control, and improving healthcare and community engagement at the community level.

The new European Union (EU) Ambassador to Belize, Her Excellency, Marianne Van Steen, met with the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Representative to Belize, Dr. Noreen Jack, to discuss the ongoing partnership with the EU-funded Health Sector Support Programme Project, jointly implemented with the Ministry of Health and Wellness.
Signed in December 2018, the ‘Health Sector Support Programme Project’ is a five-year project that aims to strengthen Belize’s health sector. Firstly, through improving the health system and management towards achieving universal health care for all, and secondly, through developing climate-friendly, energy-efficient, and disaster-resilient health facilities.
Accompanied by Mr. Nicolaus Hansmann, Team Leader of the EU Technical Office in Belize, H.E. Van Steen, was briefed on the overall progress of the project by the PAHO/WHO team: Dr. Edwin Bolastig, Health Systems and Services Advisor, Ms. Lealou Reballos, Health Emergencies Technical Officer, and Ms. Ruby Dominguez, Administrator. This also included updating the Ambassador on the 500,000 Euros that were reoriented from the project last year to assist with the COVID-19 response in the country.
“We thank the European Union for the reorientation of these funds to support the Ministry of Health and Wellness response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Jack. “One of the critical areas supported was the expansion and decentralization of COVID-19 testing to make COVID-19 testing more available in Belize.”
With the goals of enhancing national laboratory network diagnostic capacity for early detection of COVID-19, enhancing infection prevention and control, and improving integrated healthcare at the community level through outreach services, H.E. Van Steen was grateful to hear that through this partnership the European Union has been able to assist Belize in the fight against this global pandemic.
“I’m very happy to hear part [of the funds from the Health Sector Support Programme Project] has been reoriented towards COVID-19,” said H.E. Van Steen. “For me, I really think this is a priority.”
With such a strong partnership between PAHO/WHO and the EU, one of Belize’s most significant partners, both parties are committed to improving the quality of life, for all Belizeans, living now and in the future particularly Belizeans living in the rural areas of the country.

Title: PAHO/WHO donates Patient Monitor with Accessories to the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital Authority (KHMHA) for the COVID-19 Response
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
21 January 2021
The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) donated a patient monitor, including accessories to the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital Authority (KHMHA) that will aid in monitoring and evaluating patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
As countries continue the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, patient monitors are essential monitoring systems for the management and care of patients. This particular monitor, however, comes with advanced features that include invasive blood pressure (IBP), 3/5-lead ECG, respiratory rate, pulse rate, oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring.
Specifically, the carbon dioxide monitoring plays an important factor in managing COVID-19 patients. It is common practice to monitor CO2 when medications to relieve pain or induce sleep are given, when oxygen is administered, or whenever a patient is intubated or outfitted with an artificial airway in order to assess if the patient is properly breathing.
“In critical cases of COVID-19, patient monitoring is necessary to observe and evaluate a patient’s care and physiological functions such as heart and respiratory rate,” said PAHO/WHO Representative Dr. Noreen Jack. “For these patients, it is crucial to have constant monitoring of their oxygen and CO2 levels, and this patient monitor allows for that and more.”
Additionally, this special monitor also has communication capabilities that include the ability to be connected to a Local Area Network (LAN), built-in Wi-Fi, and Nurse Call. More importantly, it is compliant with Health Level Seven (HL7) standards; international standards that allow for the exchange and transfer of data between multiple healthcare providers. Thus, these features make it easy for the monitor to communicate and co-work with the hospital information system and other hospital units.
Dr. Jack along with PAHO/WHO’s Health Systems and Services Advisor, Dr. Edwin Bolastig, handed over the monitor to the Chief Executive Officer of the KHMHA, Mrs. Michelle Hoare, and Dr. Adrian Coye, Acting Director of Medical Services at the KHMHA, who expressed their gratitude for the high-grade equipment on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Wellness and the KHMHA.
“This is going to strengthen our response to COVID-19, especially for patients we operate on who are positive for SARS-CoV-2,” said Dr. Coye. “The key to this donation is that the monitor has invasive monitoring and entitled CO2 which is an extra step up from the usual patient monitors.”
As cases are still rising globally and locally, healthcare systems must remain prepared and equipped. PAHO/WHO Belize, working together with partners, will continue to procure materials and equipment and provide technical guidance and capacity building to the Ministry of Health and Wellness and the country.

Through the reorientation of funds from the “Health Sector Support Programme Belize” project, the European Union (EU) and the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) donated consumables and reagents to the Central Medical Laboratory, Ministry of Health and Wellness.
These consumables aim at enhancing the laboratory’s capacity to continue the screening and testing for COVID-19 nationwide. The donation included items needed for the safe and efficient management of SARS-COV-2:
With the reorientation of funds, the continued donations from the EU and PAHO/WHO contribute to the project’s initial objective of strengthening Belize’s health systems towards achieving universal health.
PAHO/WHO’s, Health Emergencies Technical Officer, Ms. Lealou Reballos, handed over the consumables and reagents to the Central Medical Laboratory, Senior Medical Technologist, Mr. Aldo Sosa, who accepted these essential items on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Wellness and the Central Medical laboratory.
“The donation of these items greatly enhances our turnaround time in reporting RT-PCR results for SARSCOV2,” said Mr. Sosa. “And, further contributing to the national goal of alerting patients of their status as quickly as possible.”
As the country continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, PAHO/WHO continues to work in partnership with the European Union in strengthening the health services sector of Belize.

Title: PAHO/WHO Belize donates 30,000 Nasopharyngeal Swabs to Central Medical Laboratory
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
06 January 2021
As part of the continued efforts to support the molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Belize, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) made a donation of 30,000 nasopharyngeal swabs to the Central Medical Laboratory.
The nasopharyngeal swab is a narrow stick with absorbing material used for collecting nasal secretions from the nose and the throat. Once collected, the samples are then placed within the PCR machine for testing. As the PCR remains the gold standard test for SARS-CoV-2, the nasopharyngeal swabs are a crucial component for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. With this donation, the ability to continue molecular testing capabilities at Central Medical Lab will be enhanced.
PAHO/WHO Malaria and other Vector-borne Diseases Specialist, Dr. Job Joseph, handed over the swabs to Senior Medical Technologist Mr. Aldo Sosa who was grateful to accept the items on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Wellness and the laboratory.
“This donation supports and strengthens our national effort in providing quality testing for SARS-COV-2,” said Mr. Sosa.
The donation of these swabs would complement recent donations from PAHO/WHO of an additional 2 Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) analyzers, 7 controls and 94,975 COVID-19 rapid antigen tests for decentralized testing. There are also more laboratory reagents and consumables that are expected to arrive in the country soon.
Senior Medical Technologist Mr. Juvencio Chan also commented: “I am grateful for the continued support and donations PAHO provides Central Medical Laboratory for the people of Belize in the fight against COVID-19."
As cases continue to rise globally and nationally, it is key for the country to keep up its testing standards and enhancing its lab capacity, including ensuring a sustained adequate supply of its laboratory resources. PAHO/WHO Belize, along with partners, maintains working with the ministry and the country to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: PAHO/WHO Belize donates 94,975 Antigen Tests with Antigen Controls and Rapid Diagnostic Test Analyzers to increase the lab capacity efforts for COVID-19 Testing in Belize
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
05 January 2021
To support the ongoing efforts in expanding SARS-COV-2 testing strategies in Belize, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) donated 49,975 SD Standard F COVID-19 Antigen FIA test kits, 45,000 SD Standard Q COVID-19 Antigen test kits along with seven (7) units of SD Standard COVID-19 Antigen Control, and two (2) units of Rapid Diagnostic Test Analyzers (RDT) to the Ministry of Health and Wellness.
The importance of timely and accurate testing is crucial to the prevention, control and management of COVID-19. Thus, the use of rapid antigen tests can beneficially contribute to enhancing the overall COVID-19 testing capacity in the country. It provides a shorter time to receive a result (15-30 minutes), is cost-effective and allows for early detection of cases to enable the rapid start of contact tracing, isolation and quarantine measures contributing to the control of the pandemic.
“The rapid antigen tests, controls and the analyzers will enhance not just the laboratory capacity but the over-all health system responsiveness,” said PAHO/WHO Health Systems and Services Technical Advisor, Dr. Edwin Bolastig, who represented PAHO/WHO on behalf of PWR Dr. Noreen Jack. “Especially in the context of patient triaging and contact tracing, receiving timely results is critical. With these rapid antigen tests, early diagnosis of cases can ensure timely and effective response by the healthcare workers and the healthcare system itself.”
Apart from the timeliness and performance of the rapid antigen tests, the simplicity of use will prove a major advantage when conducting tests in rural and remote areas of the country. However, rapid antigen tests do not replace the PCR testing but complement the overall testing capacity. PAHO/WHO still recommends the PCR as the gold standard test for SARS-COV-2. The rapid antigen use is recommended for the testing of persons with symptoms of COVID-19 and contacts of confirmed cases.
PAHO/WHO Malaria and other Vector-borne Diseases Specialist, Dr. Job Joseph, joined Dr. Bolastig in handing over the items to the Minister of Health and Wellness Hon. Michel Chebat, Chief Executive Officer Dr. Deysi Mendez, Acting Director of Health Services Dr. Melissa Diaz, and Medical Officer Dr. Julio Sabido of the Ministry of Health and Wellness.
“The Ministry of Health and Wellness extends its most earnest appreciativeness to PAHO/WHO for the generous donation of Rapid Test,” said Dr. Diaz. “Rapid testing will significantly continue to assist our country to swiftly detect, isolate and manage COVID-19 cases. These rapid tests will be distributed to all the regions as we continue in the fight against COVID-19. Once again, many thanks to PAHO/WHO for the continued collaboration and response.”
In working together with the Ministry of Health and Wellness and other partners, PAHO/WHO Belize starts the year continuing to support the country in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by procuring tests, equipment and supplies, providing technical guidance to the ministry and the country of Belize.

We state our concern and condemnation of the incident and express our solidarity and deepest sympathies to Marisela´s family and loved ones. We stand in solidarity with all victims and survivors of GBV as we continue to work together with our partners in the country on eliminating violence against women and girls. Femicide is the most extreme form of violence against women and girls and data over the last decade has shown a steady increase in the number of cases in Belize.
In August of this year, the United Nations, the Government of Belize, civil society partners, and the European Union launched the Spotlight Initiative aimed at addressing legislative and policy gaps, the strengthening of institutions, and the provision of quality services for survivors of GBV and family violence, as well as the promotion of gender-equitable attitudes and reparation arrangements for victims of GBV and their families. It is our commitment that the overall programme will encourage men and boys, women and girls across all sectors to strive and achieve gender equality in Belize. We all have the responsibility to speak up and act against violence to realize a society where all can achieve their potential and live a life free of fear.

02 July 2020
Since the World Health Organization, WHO, declared the coronavirus a global pandemic, countries around the world continue to race against time to implement life-saving measures. To help address this challenge, on April 3rd the Secretary General launched the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Multi-Partner Trust Fund (COVID-19 MPTF) as a UN inter-agency finance mechanism to support low- and middle- income countries in overcoming the health and development crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Fund’s assistance targets those most vulnerable to economic hardship and social disruption.
Against this backdrop, the United Nations in Belize has vowed to support national efforts to address the impact on the most vulnerable populations. In addition to ongoing efforts by all UN agencies, funds and programs, the United Nations will support the government of Belize through the Joint program “COVID-19 response to vulnerable populations and frontline workers in Belize”, granting USD 300,000 for its implementation. The program aims to stop transmission in rural areas and reduce the impact of COVID-19 on human lives, by facilitating access of vulnerable populations including refugees and migrants to health services; ensuring essential and medical care for pre-existing conditions.
The program will support the National Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Strategy in the fight against COVID– 19 implemented by the Ministry of Health. It will also strengthen and expand access to essential health-care services in the Western and Central Health Regions, which had the most cases of COVID-19 to date, by providing personal protective equipment (PPEs) and medical equipment. Support  to assist in caring for moderately symptomatic COVID patients in areas of high concentration of persons of concern will also be included. The project will also provide testing kits for exclusive use on pregnant women and support the continued delivery of remote ante and prenatal care.
In support to the Ministry of Labour, and in close coordination with private sector and unions, the program will also facilitate continued capacity development and support Occupational Safety and Health measures among front line workers and those resuming business activity to prevent any community transmission of COVID-19.
The oversight of the program will be under the leadership of the Resident Coordinator, Birgit Gerstenberg, along with representatives of the Recipient United Nations Organizations (RUNOs) from UNFPA, UNHCR, WHO and ILO to ensure permanent coordination at multiple levels.

The Conference “The Future of Work We Want: Workers’ Perspectives from the Caribbean”   will bring together trade union leaders and voices from UN agencies, academia, governments and employers from across the sub-region to discuss the profound transformations and challenges in the present and future world of work.

“This Conference is part of set of activities that ACTRAV is promoting in the different regions across the world to stress the importance for workers’ organizations to be part in the discussions on the Future of Work.

Title: IOM Opens Migration Information Centre, Launches MigrantApp in Belize
Content: Pledge to Keep the Promise! Click here for more information.
20 April 2018
The Migration Information Centre – a collaboration with the Child Development Foundation (CDF) – will provide information and referral services to migrants on a variety of migratory procedures and raise awareness in key communities about the risks of irregular migration and trafficking in persons. The information hub is located at the CDF offices at 13th Garbutt Creek Street, Belmopan, Belize.
This is the 27th information centre opened by IOM in the Mesoamerica region.
The latest data on migration indicates that emigrants as a percentage of the Belizean population stands at 15 per cent, with the United States as the main destination, while immigrants represent 15.3 per cent of the total population in country, mainly coming from Central America.
However, lack of accurate and updated information about the demographics of the population and reasons for migration remains a challenge. One solution will be the Migration Survey supported by IOM that will take place as a preamble to the development of a National Migration Policy.
“Having an information centre in Belmopan where migrants can readily access information will promote smoother and more effective procedures. The information centre will also raise awareness in key migration communities through mobile hubs, for example, the first one in Benque Viejo Town, in May,” said Rene Chuc, Head of Office of IOM Belize.
IOM has provided extensive training to CDF staff in areas such as interview techniques, profiling migrants with special needs, identification and referral mechanism, trafficking in persons, migrants smuggling, among others.
This ongoing training is complemented with courses hosted at IOM’s Virtual Learning Platform on Migration (https://www.ecampus.iom.int/) and meetings with Belizean institutions including the Labour Department, the Immigration Department, the Refugees Department and UNHCR.
“The sessions have been informative and well delivered. The information shared gave the staff a better understanding of the specific terminologies and basic concepts underpinning migration and role play exercises have allowed staff to understand how to interview migrants in situations of risk to best determine where to refer them to and what information they will need to address their migration concern,” said Diana Shaw, Director the Child Development Foundation.
Shaw added, “CDF is pleased to be a part of this initiative and is grateful for the capacity building by IOM which will go a long way to complement the services we currently provide.”
The event also served as a launch pad for the MigrantApp in Belize. The application is free of charge and provides information on services for migrants such as health centres, embassies and consulates, entry requirements for more than 40 nationalities, and has allowed IOM to send emergency alerts regarding natural or epidemic hazards.
"Together, both initiatives contribute to the promotion of regular and safe migration by making reliable information accessible to migrants. Through the establishment of a coordination mechanism between the Information Centre and key institutions, as well as by mapping key service providers in the MigrantApp, IOM seeks to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve migration management in Belize," said Justin Scharf, IOM Project Assistant for the Mesoamerica Program.
These activities are part of the Mesoamerica Program, which seeks to contribute to the development and implementation of strategies for regular, orderly, and safe migration. The Mesoamerica Program is funded by the US State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM).
