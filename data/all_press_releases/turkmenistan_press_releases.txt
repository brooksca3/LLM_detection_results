Title: Interdepartmental Working Group for monitoring implementation of GCM discusses institutional and practical aspects of systemic integration and application of gender-sensitive approaches in migration management
Content: 04 June 2024
Ashgabat, June 3-4, 2024. Representatives of national organizations comprising the Interdepartmental Working Group for monitoring the implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) and public associations of Turkmenistan discussed issues relating to systemic integration and application of gender-sensitive approaches in migration management at a two-day workshop in Ashgabat organized within the framework of the regional project of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) “Protection of Vulnerable Migrants with Special Emphasis on Empowerment of Women in the Context of Migration in Central Asia”.
As part of the workshop facilitated by an international expert, participants explored opportunities to enhance the systemic integration of gender perspectives in public policies and national action plans on migration, reviewed relevant methodologies, monitoring and reporting tools for gender and human rights mainstreaming, and discussed gender stereotypes and overcoming gender bias.
As was noted during the workshop, gender mainstreaming is one of the cross-cutting and interdependent guiding principles embedded in all the objectives of the GCM, the first ever UN intergovernmental agreement on a common approach to managing international migration, which was endorsed by UN Member States, including Turkmenistan in 2018 in accordance with the UNGA resolution. The GCM mainstreams a gender perspective and promotes gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, recognizing their independence, agency and leadership in order to move away from addressing migrant women primarily through a lens of victimhood.
In this context, the workshop participants discussed the importance of collection and use of data to formulate gender-sensitive public policies and programs on migration, ensuring a gender-sensitive approach to regulating labor migration, labor-related violence against women in migration, vulnerabilities and needs of children affected by migration, integration of gender perspectives in ensuring safe migration, reintegration of female migrants, protection measures for regular and irregular migrants in receiving and sending countries.
Following the discussions, the workshop participants agreed on a roadmap for application of the newly gained knowledge and skills in their work.
***
The IOM regional project “Protection of Vulnerable Migrants with Special Emphasis on Empowerment of Women in the Context of Migration in Central Asia” aims to strengthen the resilience of migrants, especially women in vulnerable situations in the context of migration through their economic integration, promoting gender-equitable attitudes and behaviors towards women in the context of migration, and strengthening national responses to the vulnerability of migrants through coordination platforms and cooperation among all stakeholders. Under this project, IOM in partnership with civil society organizations supports a “shelter” for vulnerable populations affected by migration, two “hotlines” in the cities of Ashgabat and Turkmenabat and gender-sensitive reintegration assistance for voluntary returning migrants, including, among others, small grants for income-generating activities for persons in vulnerable situations.

Work is being done to integrate persons with disabilities into society, including collecting data on people with disabilities and developing legal, vocational, and computer skills.
So, in December 2022, for the first time in several cycles of the national population census, questions about disability were included in the questionnaire, which made it possible to obtain verified statistical data on people with disabilities. The use of such disaggregated data will help develop national programs that take into account the needs of persons with disabilities.
With the assistance of the UN, an assessment of national legislation was carried out, and as a result, recommendations were presented to national partners on promoting vocational education and employment for persons with disabilities. An inclusive education strategy was also developed, and a national system of early intervention and early child development was created. Together, Turkmenistan launched a speech synthesizer in the Turkmen language for people with visual impairments, allowing them to access texts in the Turkmen language using text-to-speech technology.
Technical support was provided to the manufacturing enterprise of the Turkmen Society of the Blind and Deaf to install high-tech equipment for the production of paper products, and the Yenme Public Association was provided with assistance in establishing a vocational skills center for vulnerable youth, where young people are trained in various vocational skills. All these initiatives contribute to the realization of the rights and empowerment of persons with disabilities for their full integration into the socio-economic and public life of the country.
UN agencies have been successfully cooperating with the National Red Crescent Society of Turkmenistan (NRCS) for many years. One example is the provision of psychosocial support to patients with tuberculosis, which ensures adherence to treatment and good results of tuberculosis treatment. Support through innovative and digital technologies is planned and the UN system is grateful to partners for their openness and willingness to innovate.
At the end of her speech, Ms. Sahakyan once again emphasized the readiness of the UN system to deepen cooperation with the Government and civil society of Turkmenistan on promoting the rights and interests of persons with disabilities, including children and youth.

Title: The Climate Crisis is an Education Crisis
Content: 05 December 2023
In the lead up to the COP28 Climate Talks in Dubai, Education Cannot Wait Calls on Donors to Urgently Mobilize More Resources to Scale Up Life-Saving Access to Quality Education for Crisis-Impacted Children.
By The Rt. Hon. Gordon Brown and Yasmine Sherif
“The one international language the world understands” wrote Eglantyne Jebb, founder of Save the Children, “is the cry of a child,” and the evidence is accumulating that children are not only the innocent victims of conflict whose pleas need to be heard, but also the most vulnerable victims of climate change.
The climate crisis is an education crisis. Right here, right now, climate change is robbing millions of children and adolescents of their right to learn, their right to play and their right to feel safe and secure.
In Pakistan deadly floods destroyed or damaged over 26,000 schools last year. This exposed over 600,000 adolescent girls to higher risks of school dropout, gender-based violence, and child marriage. In Ethiopia, girls like Mellion are going hungry and risk dropping out of school forever as a result of the ongoing drought.
While the climate crisis threatens the rights of every person on the planet, those who are enduring the brunt of its impact are the most vulnerable girls and boys already living in protracted crises settings due to armed conflicts, forced displacement and other crises. For them and their communities, climate change is already a daunting reality that can mean the difference between life and death, between war and peace, between the chance to learn or not.
Today, there are more than 224 million crisis-impacted children worldwide who urgently need education support. New analysis by Education Cannot Wait (ECW), the global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises, hosted by UNICEF, has found that 62 million of these children have been impacted by climate hazards such as droughts, floods, cyclones and other extreme weather events since 2020. That’s close to the total populations of several G7 nations such as the United Kingdom, France or Italy.
While these children have contributed least to the issue of climate change, they have the most to lose. Furthermore, over the last ten years, 31 million school-aged children have been displaced by the climate crisis, with 13 million in the last three years alone.
The climate crisis poses a real and present threat to global security, economic prosperity and the very fabric of our societies. Climate impacts could cost the world economy US$7.9 trillion by 2050, according to the World Bank, and could force up to 216 million people to move within their own countries by 2050.
Cyclones, typhoons, floods and droughts are increasing in severity and intensity. The number of disasters driven, in part, by climate change has increased five-fold in the past 50 years. Climate hazards are driving displacement directly, but also driving competition over scarce resources and threatening fragile peace in many parts of the world. Over 70% of refugees and internally displaced people on the move due to conflict and violence originally came from climate change hotspots.
Taken together, these intersecting crises of climate change, displacement and conflict are having a profound effect on education opportunities for millions of children and adolescents around the world.
As we look toward this year’s Climate Talks in Dubai (COP28) and the Global Refugee Forum in Geneva, we must connect the dots between climate action and education action. It’s our investment in our people, our planet and our future.
To rise to this challenge, ECW is calling on donors, the private sector and other key partners to urgently mobilize US$150 million in additional resources. This is an important contribution towards ECW’s overall resource mobilization target of US$1.5 billion toward the Fund’s 2023-2026 strategic plan.
We all know that education has a sound return on investment. Long-term investments in human capital – including education, skills training and overall health and well-being – offer 10 times more return on investment than investments in physical capital. By investing in education today, we are investing in economic and social prosperity tomorrow, we are investing in an end to displacement and hunger, we are investing in a better world and children’s futures.
The climate crisis threatens to end human civilization as we know it today. Now is our time to address this issue head on, and education plays a key role. By ensuring learning continuity for the most vulnerable children – and connecting quality education with climate action – we can equip an entire generation of climate stewards with the skills to adapt to the changing environment and pave the way to a better future.
In the eye of the storm, we are calling on new and existing donors to stand with us. We are appealing to you to act: right here, right now. Will you take up this challenge?

Title: Joint Results Groups under the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework discussed results for 2023
Content: 28 November 2023
Ashgabat, 27 November 2023 - Members of the UN-Government Results Groups (RGs) gathered today to summarize results of the implementation of the UN-Turkmenistan Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) in 2023.
The five Joint UN-Government RGs convened in UN House were:
RG 1. People-centered Governance and Rule of Law
RG 2. Sustainable economic diversification, competitive private and financial sectors, enhanced trade and promotion
RG 3. Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate change adaptation and increased resilience
RG 4. Quality, inclusive affordable health and social protection services

The participants of each Joint Results Group representing the UN Agencies and line ministries under UNSDCF reported on the progress made in implementation of the Joint Work Plans (JWPs) for 2023. They also discussed the challenges faced in the implementation of JWPs and further cooperation opportunities.
During the meeting, the meeting participants were briefed about the key findings and recommendations from the Mid-term review (MTR) on the implementation of the UNSDCF. The Government counterparts and UN agencies agreed to take into consideration the results of the MTR when developing further JWPs and formulation of the next cycle of UNSDCF for 2026-2030.
Also, in the course of the meeting, the analysis of the UNSDCF implementation focusing on progress towards Sustainable Development Goals and outcome indicators for 2023 was presented.
The members of the UN-Government Results Groups discussed the findings of the Common Country Analysis update. The analysis has demonstrated the relevance of joint UN programmes’ proposals submitted to the government aimed at increasing the likelihood of achieving UNSDCF results in the areas of strategic planning, budgeting and SDG financing, including the development of human capital, increasing the efficiency of employment services and labor market regulation, especially in relation to youth. The participants agreed that further joint efforts are needed to strengthen capacity of civil servants, improve data availability and use for policy making, develop and implement industrial policy, including in the area of green energy transition. The discussed priorities are fully aligned with Turkmenistan’s Strategies and Programmes and the National Commitments to SDG Transformation presented at the SDG summit.
The Joint UN-Turkmenistan Results Groups meeting represents a crucial step in the collaborative efforts towards achieving sustainable development goals, fostering partnerships, and ensuring the well-being and prosperity of the Turkmenistan population.

Title: New WHO campaign highlights tobacco industry tactics to influence public health policies
Content: 23 November 2023
[Geneva, 16 November] – The World Health Organization (WHO), today, officially launches the "Stop the lies" campaign as a vital initiative to protect young people from the tobacco industry and their deadly products, by calling for an end to tobacco industry interference in health policy.
This campaign is supported by new evidence from “The Global Tobacco Industry Interference Index 2023”, published by STOP and the Global Center for Good Governance in Tobacco Control, which shows that efforts to protect health policy from increased tobacco industry interference have deteriorated around the world.
​​WHO’s campaign aims to amplify youth voices, expose tobacco industry tactics and increase public awareness on the need to defend health policies and protect the health of future generations.
Youth groups around the world called on countries to “...adopt decisions that shield us from the manipulative practices of tobacco and related industries.”
“WHO stands with young people globally who have demanded governments protect them against a deadly industry that targets them with new harmful products while outright lying about the health impacts. We call on all countries to safeguard health policies from this deadly industry by not letting them have a seat at the policy-making table,” said Dr Ruediger Krech, Director of Health Promotion, WHO.
The tobacco industry tries to interfere with countries’ right to protect people’s health by taking governments to court, or offering financial and in-kind incentives to be able to influence tobacco control policies, even at the upcoming WHO FCTC Conference of Parties. WHO supports countries in defending evidenced based tobacco control measures in the face of industry interference.
The tobacco industry continues to lie to the public, using different ways to spread misinformation, including through:
Recognizing the tobacco industry’s relentless efforts to market its products to vulnerable groups, especially young people, WHO is committed to expose the industry's attempts to weaken health policies and call on policy makers to stand firm against tobacco industry influence. There are 183 Parties to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control that have committed to do this under the global health treaty.
The tobacco industry has a long history of lying to the public, even insisting that smoking does not cause lung cancer. Today we know that tobacco causes 25% of all cancers and kills over 8 million people each year, but the industry persists with marketing what they call ‘new’ and ‘safer’ products that we know are harmful to health, while still producing trillions of cigarettes each year.
With half of smokers dying prematurely because of tobacco smoking, the maintenance of the tobacco and nicotine market relies heavily on recruiting new, young users, and tobacco companies employ multiple tactics to gain the trust and interest of young people at an early age.
Menthol and flavoured cigarettes and candy-flavored e-cigarettes with eye-catching designs have further contributed to the popularization of these products among the young generation, all while leaving many consumers largely unaware of the negative effects on their health.
The tobacco industry invests enormous amounts of money in lobbying against tobacco control policies and funds organizations that promote its interests.
These tobacco tactics, when left unchecked, inflict immeasurable harm on public health. Moreover, the production and use of tobacco and nicotine products have a cascading damaging effect on other critical issues such as the environment, mental health, and child labor.\

Title: Control antibiotic misuse or the drugs won’t work, warn WHO experts
Content: 23 November 2023
New data reveals a third of the population in 14 countries of the European Region consumes antibiotics without a medical prescription.
Copenhagen, 23 November 2023 - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the ten major global public health threats, with an estimated 5 million deaths annually associated with bacterial AMR worldwide, of which more than half a million occur in the WHO European Region, comprising 53 Member States in Europe and Central Asia.
AMR occurs when microorganisms develop the ability to resist the antimicrobial drugs that are typically used to kill them and treat infections.  There are different types of antimicrobials, such as antibiotics for bacteria, antivirals for viruses, and antifungals for fungi, each targeting specific types of microorganisms. While AMR is a natural phenomenon, the development and spread of superbugs is being accelerated by the misuse of antimicrobials, rendering infections more challenging to treat effectively.
The alarming reality is that, without immediate intervention, AMR could result in up to 10 million deaths a year by 2050. Moreover, this burden falls disproportionately on low- and middle-income countries, exacerbating global health inequalities.
New data
WHO/Europe has conducted a standardized survey across more than a dozen countries of the WHO European Region, namely in the Western Balkans, the Caucasus, and Central Asia (including Türkiye), shedding light on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours surrounding antibiotic use and AMR. The survey is the first of its kind to be conducted in these countries, all of whom gave the research their full support. The results have been published in the journal Frontiers. The survey used the same methodology and questions as an established survey that is periodically carried out in the EU. Conducting surveys in this way, in close collaboration with the European Commission, enables WHO to achieve its goal of having a pan-European overview. Having a clear picture of the current situation makes it possible to monitor progress and evaluate interventions in the future.
The survey involved 8,221 participants from 14 countries, half of whom reported taking oral antibiotics in the past 12 months. Medical practitioners prescribed or directly administered the majority (67%) of the antibiotics. The reasons cited for taking the antibiotics included colds (24%), flu-like symptoms (16%), sore throat (21%) and cough (18%). This gives cause for concern because these symptoms are often caused by viruses against which antibiotics are not effective. Medical expertise is essential to make a correct diagnosis to determine whether antibiotics are the correct course of treatment.
The survey further highlighted a lack of enforcement around the use of a medical prescription for every course of antibiotics. Across the 14 countries, a third (33%) of respondents consumed antibiotics without a medical prescription. In some countries more than 40% of the antibiotics were obtained without medical advice. In contrast, the equivalent survey conducted across the EU in 2022 revealed that only 8% of respondents consumed antibiotics without a prescription.
WHO/Europe’s survey also highlights gaps in people’s knowledge. Just 16% of respondents were able to respond correctly to all of four awareness questions, which could indicate that people are taking antibiotics for the wrong reasons without realizing it. A majority of respondents (67%) were aware that unnecessary use of antibiotics can make them less effective, however nearly half of the respondents (43%) incorrectly said antibiotics are effective against viruses (they are not).
Equally worrisome is the fact that only 37% (and just 23% in the EU research) reported receiving any information about the importance of avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use in the past year, highlighting the urgent need for clearer and more targeted public health communication.
“This research clearly shows the need for education and awareness raising,” said Robb Butler, WHO/Europe’s Director for Communicable Diseases, Environment and Health. “All countries in our Region have regulations in place to protect precious antibiotics from misuse, for example preventing over the counter sales without prescription.  Enforcing these regulations would solve most antibiotic misuse among humans. Other drivers of AMR have their roots in the social and cultural norms learned in communities, for example not completing a course of antibiotics in order to save some for the next time you fall ill or share with a sick relative or neighbour. This learned behaviour can take time to change and it’s imperative that behavioural and cultural insights are used to the full when planning interventions.”
Behavioural and cultural insights
As global efforts to control AMR intensify, social and behavioural sciences are emerging as crucial, yet underutilized areas of knowledge and expertise that can guide interventions in AMR control, radically increasing impact.
“The use of antimicrobial medicines is intrinsically tied to human behaviour and deeply entrenched in social and cultural contexts, shaped by our attitudes, policies, and available choices,” commented Dr Danilo Lo Fo Wong, Regional Adviser for the control of antimicrobial resistance. “Conserving the effectiveness of antimicrobial medicines requires interventions at many levels, such as timely vaccination, improving hygiene or reducing inappropriate prescribing. Behavioural science and cultural context analysis have a pivotal role to play in understanding and addressing all these behaviours. They can provide critical insights into the barriers and drivers of behaviour, aiding in the development of effective interventions. We encourage and support countries to design and conducting targeted behavioural interventions, using the guidance provided in our ‘Tailoring antimicrobial resistance programme’.”

Title: IOM presents gender- and age-sensitive assessment of national legal framework  on countering human trafficking to national partners
Content: 23 November 2023
Ashgabat, 22 November 2023: The International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Turkmenistan presented members of the Interdepartmental Working Group on development and implementation ofthe National Action Plan on countering human trafficking with preliminary findings of a gender- and age-sensitive assessment of the relevant national legal framework which was conducted as part of the IOM project “Strengthening the legal framework on trafficking in persons in Turkmenistan to better address the needs of youth and women through a survivor-centered approach” funded by the IOM Development Fund (IDF).
Based on the assessment findings, members of the Interdepartmental Working Group reviewed IOM’s recommendations for improvement of the national legal framework on countering human trafficking in compliance with the international standards and best practices. The recommendations specifically covered the areas relating to criminalization of trafficking in persons and related offenses, investigation and prosecution, victim identification, status and access to support services, as well as prevention of human trafficking through safe migration and socio-economic empowerment of women and youth.
The presentation of recommendations also featured examples of best practices on countering human trafficking from Asia and Europe that focus on survivor-centered approach in identification, referral, prosecution, protection and rehabilitation of trafficking survivors. According to IOM’s international expert Ms. Irina Urumova, who conducted the assessment, “Turkmenistan has key legal provisions in place on countering human trafficking, yet there is still a room for further improvement to ensure that the relevant legal framework is enforceable, which requires strong supporting regulations.”
The presentation participants also reviewed issues relating to interagency cooperation and promoting the greater engagement of civil society stakeholders in combatting human trafficking. The event was a good opportunity to gain valuable insights into the capacity building needs of relevant government agencies and civil society stakeholders that will inform the design of capacity building activities for relevant national partners and stakeholders.
The assessment findings will also inform the ongoing work on development of the new National Action Plan on countering human trafficking with the support of IOM in Turkmenistan.
………………………..
The International Organization for Migration has been working in Turkmenistan since 1997. IOM is one of the key partners of Turkmenistan in combatting trafficking in persons. Two previous National Action Plans of Turkmenistan on Combatting Trafficking in Persons (2016-2018, 2020- 2022) were developed and implemented with the support of IOM in Turkmenistan.

Title: WHO acknowledges Turkmenistan’s achievement of regional hepatitis B control targets
Content: 06 November 2023
Hepatitis B is a significant public health challenge in the WHO European Region.
In 2019, 14 million people were estimated to be infected with HBV.  Hepatitis B is an infectious disease that attacks the liver and is a leading cause of liver cancer.
WHO is working with countries to eliminate viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030. WHO Europe provides guidance and technical support to countries to strengthen their hepatitis B immunization programmes by implementing the Regional Action plan strategies, and monitors progress towards hepatitis B targets. With the support of WHO Turkmenistan developed “Strategic Plan on Strengthening Control Measures for Viral Hepatitis in Turkmenistan for the Period of 2019-2030” based on the goals and objectives set out in the WHO documents: “Global health sector strategy for viral hepatitis for 2016-2021” and “Health sector Action plan anti-viral hepatitis in the WHO European Region”.
Turkmenistan has implemented universal newborn vaccination against hepatitis B since 2002 and consistently reported high hepatitis B vaccination coverage. In addition, the country provides vaccination of risk groups and health care workers. In 2022, Turkmenistan conducted a nation-wide hepatitis B serosurvey, which demonstrated that the vaccination programme was successful in eliminating chronic hepatitis B in children born after universal vaccination: the prevalence of hepatitis B virus surface antigen in children aged 10 to 11 years was 0.1%.
To mark this significant milestone, on November 6, WHO Representative in Turkmenistan Dr. Egor Zaitsev handed a certificate validating the achievement of hepatitis B control targets in Turkmenistan to the Minister of Health Mr. Atageldi Germanov in presence of Mr. Nurmuhammet Ammanepesov, Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan. The handover ceremony took place at the Turkmen State Medical University named after M. Garryev. The event brought together the high-level officials of the healthcare system of Turkmenistan, the heads of the UN Agencies in Turkmenistan and students of the Turkmen State Medical University.
“Turkmenistan's experience in successful implementation of a vaccination programme against hepatitis B virus and assessment of its impact is very important for other countries. The World Health Organization will continue to support the Government of Turkmenistan in maintaining high vaccination coverage and ensuring effective prevention of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B in the future.” – said Dr. Egor Zaitsev, WHO Representative in Turkmenistan.
The achievement clearly highlights Turkmenistan’s significant contribution to eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat in the WHO European Region and the global goal to end viral hepatitis until 2030.

Title: Global Gateway Forum: EU-ITC sign an agreement to promote Turkmenistan’s participation in trade
Content: 27 October 2023
(Brussels/Geneva) – Turkmenistan is set to play a stronger role in global trade with the signing of an agreement by the European Union (EU) and the International Trade Centre (ITC) on 25 October on the sidelines of the Global Gateway Forum.
The agreement marks the launch of a project – to be implemented by ITC and funded by the EU – to support the Government of Turkmenistan in acceding to the World Trade Organization and in becoming a member of the multilateral trading system. The project will support Turkmenistan’s efforts to promote economic development and decent work in the country by improving the national business climate and the competitiveness of its small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Deputy Director General for international Partnerships Myriam Ferran and ITC Executive Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton signed the agreement of €6 million under the bilateral Cooperation Facility (€11 million for 2021-2024), in the presence of the Turkmenistan Minister of Finance and Economy, Serdar Jorayev.
Signing a multifaceted agreement
The agreement places a particular focus on supporting women-led businesses to integrate into regional and global value chains and more broadly, promoting a gender-inclusive environment by supporting women policymakers.
This agreement will also initiate trade facilitation reforms, increasing the country’s investment attractiveness and creating a conducive e-commerce environment. It will promote Turkmenistan’s international economic engagement and participation in regional and global trade.
Strengthening cooperation
European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilianen said: ‘Sustainable connections are key for the Central Asian countries. Through Global Gateway, the EU is supporting Turkmenistan’s integration into global trade. This is how we contribute to economic development and decent work in Turkmenistan, creating new opportunities for its people, youth and businesses and reinforcing multilateralism.’
ITC Executive Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton said: ‘We’ve been working closely with Turkmenistan and the EU for years, with the common goal of achieving economic growth and sustainable development through trade. We’ll continue to support Turkmenistan by providing access to timely trade data and support in key areas, such as accession negotiations, trade and investment facilitation, and value chain development.’
ITC through its EU-funded Ready4Trade Central Asia project has been offering comprehensive support to Turkmenistan since 2020, including assisting on the initial stages of the WTO accession process, enhancing cross-border regulatory transparency, empowering Turkmen businesses in particular women entrepreneurs to meet trade formalities and standards, as well as facilitating the entry of Turkmen artisans into online markets.
Notes for the Editor
About Turkmenistan – Turkmenistan is an upper-middle income country in Central Asia. Although it holds the world's fourth largest reserves of natural gas and its economy relies on the extractive industry, the country has shown in recent years increased interest in developing a greener and more diversified economy, by upscaling the domestic use of renewable energies and reducing methane emissions. The country has currently an overall trade openness rather low at 6% of GDP. Its strategic geographical location makes it an important logistical hub for EU-Asian trade.
In recent years, the EU and Turkmenistan have been increasingly looking to upscale their cooperation in areas of mutual interest, such as the green economy, improvement of the business climate and accession to the World Trade Organization. Turkmenistan was granted the status of acceding country to the World Trade Organization in February 2022.
Bilateral relations between Turkmenistan and the EU are governed by the 2010 Interim Trade Agreement. Within this framework, the EU and Turkmenistan discuss implementation of the EU Strategy on Central Asia, trade and economy, political developments and key aspects of EU cooperation programmes, rule of law, education, health, and support to civil society.
About Global Gateway – The Global Gateway Forum brings together for the first time an assembly of government representatives from the European Union and across the globe, alongside key stakeholders from the private sector, civil society, leaders, financial institutions, and international organisations to promote global investment in transformative infrastructure – hard and soft - to deliver on SDGs.
Global Gateway is the EU’s positive offer to reduce the worldwide investment gap and boost smart, clean and secure connections in digital, energy and transport sectors, and to strengthen health, education and research systems.
The Global Gateway strategy embodies a Team Europe approach that brings together the European Union, EU Member States, and European development finance institutions. Together, it aims to mobilise up to €300 billion in public and private investments from 2021 to 2027, creating essential links rather than dependencies, and closing the global investment gap.

Title: UNECE and Resident Coordinator’s Office organized the SDG policy dialogue on Green Energy Transition in Turkmenistan
Content: 26 October 2023
October 25, 2023, Ashgabat, Turkmenistan – On the sides of the 28th International Conference and Expo “Oil and Gas of Turkmenistan” (OGT-2023), the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office in Turkmenistan and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) organized the SDG Policy Dialogue “Green Energy Transition in Turkmenistan: Tools and Innovative Solutions”.
The dialogue brought together representatives of the government and private sector with experience in decarbonization (Topsoe, Itochu and Çalık Enerji among others), international financial institutions (IMF and ADB) and consulting firms as well as representatives of diplomatic community, academia and civil society organizations.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Dario Liguti, UNECE Director of Sustainable Energy Division, stressed the importance of the green energy transition for Turkmenistan: “The green energy transition is essential for Turkmenistan to achieve its social, environmental and economic goals”. He noted that the country has significant renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind power, which could be used to create a more sustainable and resilient energy system.
Mr. Liguti also highlighted the need for a just transition, ensuring that no one is left behind in the process of moving to a clean energy economy. This means creating new jobs and opportunities in the renewable energy sector, while also providing support to those who may be impacted by the decline of fossil fuel industries.
UNRCO Economist Uladzimir Valetka, UNECE Economic Affairs Officers Branko Milicevic and Nadejda Khamrakulova and other participants made interventions on a range of topics, including the importance of developing of carbon neutrality road map, methane reduction, hydrogen ecosystem, the role of natural gas infrastructure in a low-carbon future, the need for carbon pricing and transition finance. The discussion was supported with a dedicated policy brief prepared as part of the UN Common Country Analysis.
To accelerate the green energy transition in Turkmenistan, it was suggested to support the UN joint program focused on two interlinked areas: reducing methane emissions, including through implementation of the dedicated Roadmap for 2023-2024, and developing Turkmenistan’s carbon neutrality roadmap until 2052. The joint programme is fully aligned with Turkmenistan’s Strategies and Programmes and the National Commitments to SDG Transformation submitted at the SDG summit.
The UNECE and UNRCO continued policy discussions in bilateral meetings with the State Concern “Turkmengas”, the Ministries of Energy, Finance and Economy, Environmental Protection, and Foreign Affairs. During the meeting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the parties discussed cooperation between Turkmenistan and the UNECE in the field of green energy, reduction of methane emissions and the prospects for UNECE expert support in the field of solar and wind energy. The possibility of holding the International Forum on Sustainable Energy in Turkmenistan in 2025 was also discussed at the meeting.
Timely actions on Turkmenistan’s energy transition will allow paving the way to a low-carbon future helping to create new jobs, stimulate growth and bring social and health benefits supporting achievement of the SDGs and diversification of the national economy.

Title: Resident Coordinator’s Office in Turkmenistan organized policy dialogues and training on Public-Private Partnerships for SDGs for state authorities and private business
Content: 23 October 2023
Ashgabat, 20 October 2023 – United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office in Turkmenistan, jointly with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MoFE) of Turkmenistan hosted a training on Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for SDGs for state authorities and private businesses. The training was combined with policy dialogue both in joint and bilateral meetings with the MoFE, Transport Agency, Arkadag City authorities, Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and EBRD. The joint discussions and leading expert presentations were designed to help participants understand the benefits of PPPs for developing infrastructure projects that support achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The strategic importance of developing PPPs for implementing the SDGs in Turkmenistan was stressed by Mr. Serdar Jorayew, the Minister of Finance and Economy of Turkmenistan, during the presentation of the 2nd Voluntary National Review of SDG at HLPF in New York.
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are contractual arrangements between the public and private sectors, where the private sector provides a public service or infrastructure asset under a long-term contract. PPPs can be used to finance and deliver a wide range of infrastructure projects, including roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, and energy projects. UNECE is the leading international organization in the field of PPPs that provides technical assistance to governments and private sector partners to develop and implement successful PPP projects. UNECE also works to promote international best practices in PPPs and to develop standards and guidelines for PPP projects.
During the dialogue at the Ministry of Finance and Economy Mr. Atajan Atajev, Director of Strategy and Sustainable Development Department, highlighted the importance of PPPs in supporting the country's economic development and achieving the SDGs. He noted that the new PPP law of Turkmenistan, adopted in 2021, creates a favorable environment for PPP development. In turn, Mr. Tony Bonnici, Chief of the UNECE Public-Private Partnerships Section, emphasized the role of PPPs in supporting countries to achieve the SDGs. He noted that PPPs can be used to finance and deliver a wide range of infrastructure projects, including renewable energy, transport, and education. The Ministry of Finance and Economy welcomed the UNECE support in reviewing the secondary legislation and developing guidelines on PPP projects for the line ministries.
The follow up training was organized in a hybrid format and led by Mr. Tony Bonnici with leading UNECE experts in economic and social infrastructure projects for 20 representatives of the ministry of finance and economy, Transport Agency, Arkadag City administration and representatives of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan.
The core of training focused on PPP cases in the sectors of renewable energy, smart cities and digital services (including smart transport and energy/waste/water management, telemedicine, and electric car charging stations), transport sector (highways and corridors), IT-technologies, digital infrastructure and e-commerce, housing and communal services and education services. The UNECE and other international organizations included Mr Arthur Smith, United States, Mr Ulan Danilbekov, PPP Center of the Kyrgyz Republic, Ms Petra Ferk, Institute for PPP, Slovenia, Mr Nasser Massoud, Managing Director, Concept Realisation, UAE, Mr Dragutin Nenezić, Expert in PPPs and Concessions, Serbia, Ms Stacy Sinclair, Partner at Fenwick Elliott LLP, UK, and Ms Sedef Yavuz-Noyan, Head, PPP Department, Presidency of Turkish Republic, Strategy and Budget Office, Türkiye.
The presentation by the Ministry of Finance and Economy featured the main elements of the PPP law of 2021 and the current work on secondary legislation.
Mr Vladimir Valetka, UN RCO Economist, stressed that all discussed Turkmenistan’s sectors prioritizing PPPs have multiplier effects and need to be costed as part of the SDG Financing Strategy linked to the integrated national financing framework (INFF) enabling SDG financing. In that case public finances magnified with investments from private sector, both national and international, should sustain financing the SDGs in Turkmenistan. UNECE’s methodology of PPP and Infrastructure Evaluation and Rating System (PIERS) [1] is a very useful tool to attest to the overall sustainability of PPP and infrastructure projects.
The participants also had the opportunity to discuss and share their experiences with PPPs. In conclusion, a panel discussion was held on the priority steps for enabling PPPs in Turkmenistan. The participants have reached a consensus that PPPs are critical to support the country's socio-economic development and the UN Joint Programme would be a right step to pilot PPPs for achieving the SDGs in the country. The Joint Programme combining expertise of UN agencies could focus on continuation of capacity development, including study tours, for civil servants from the prioritized sectors, using of international legal best practices in developing secondary legislation and implementation guides for public officials. The programme could support practical implementation of a PPP pilot in Arkadag City launching electric car charging stations integrating solar panels.
The seminar was a valuable opportunity for participants to learn about PPPs and to share their experiences. The knowledge and insights gained from the seminar will help Turkmenistan to develop and implement effective PPPs in support of the SDGs, and the 17th SDG “Partnership for Goals” in particular.

Title: Central Asia gateway wins ‘Best Trade Information Portal’ Award at World Investment Forum
Content: 23 October 2023
The online trade information hub Central Asia Gateway – InfoTradeCentralAsia.org – received the 'Best Trade Information Portal’ award at the World Investment Forum, a biennial gathering of heads of state, CEOs, ministers and heads of international organizations held from 16 to 20 October 2023 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
The platform was developed under the Ready4Trade Central Asia Project, which is funded by the European Union and implemented by the International Trade Centre (ITC) and with technical support of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
The Central Asia Gateway is an ITC solution developed in close collaboration with partners in all five Central Asia countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
The platform combines these countries’ National Trade Facilitation Portals (TFP) – also developed with ITC support under the Ready4Trade Central Asia Project – into a single online platform, providing users easy access to information on cross-border trade formalities in the region.
The Central Asia Gateway and its network covers 280 trade flows in Central Asia and has had 195,000 visitors since its launch in May 2023" should be replaced with "The Central Asia Gateway and its network cover 280 trade flows in Central Asia and have had 195,000 visitors.
The Central Asia Gateway provides a regional index to compare trade formalities and an overview of trade formalities along corridors in the region to foster dialogue among policymakers and private sector operators, facilitating the benchmarking of procedural requirements and assisting in the design and implementation of roadmaps to reach trade facilitation goals.
The online platform enhances transparency throughout supply chains, reducing costs, time and effort required to access trade-related information, minimizing border shipment delays, improving efficiency along corridors and boosting regional trade integration.
'The Central Asia Gateway is an important step to enhancing trade cooperation among the five countries of the region. It makes Central Asia a bigger and more resilient market and a stronger international trade player. It enables intraregional trade go faster and smoother. It makes Central Asia an even more important partner of the European Union,’ said Kestutis Jankauskas, Ambassador of the European Union to the Republic of Kazakhstan.
ITC Executive Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton said: ‘This award is in recognition of Central Asian countries’ efforts to make trade faster, easier and less costly for businesses in the region, including small businesses. We’ll continue to work alongside policymakers and businesses to build on the progress that’s been made.’
Earlier this year, His Excellency President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan at the fifth Consultative Meeting of the Heads of State of Central Asia proposed the idea of expanding the Central Asia Gateway with the creation of a unified electronic database for commodity producers. This initiative would further drive trade and investment facilitation, especially in Kazakhstan, where ‘intraregional trade turnover in the country has increased by over 80% to $10.6 billion over the past five years’, he said.
Speaking on the margins of the award ceremony, Mr. Nurlan Kulbatyrov, Deputy Director General of the Center for Trade Policy Development (QazTrade), ITC’s partner in Kazakhstan, added: ‘Central Asian countries have set ambitious targets for increasing exports. For small and medium-sized businesses, the Central Asia Gateway is an excellent tool which offers opportunities to connect to new markets thanks to a door-to-door overview of cross-border formalities along Central Asian corridors. Through this one and only portal, traders can obtain information on the rules and procedures to import, export and transit, including all forms and documents required in Central Asian countries.’
This award underlines the progress achieved by Central Asian countries in enhancing trade facilitation in the region and connecting to international markets, in compliance with the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement.

Title: WHO/Europe engages young activists by launching new youth4health network to meet the health challenges of the future
Content: 26 September 2023
WHO/Europe asked youth activists and youth organizations from across Europe and Central Asia what they see as the most pressing public health challenges of their time. Many mentioned climate change and the sustainability of health systems, while others expressed concern over the scourge of non-communicable diseases and a rapidly ageing population.
“I believe the three greatest public health challenges of the next 25 years will be related to the changing climate and our destroying of ecosystems, increasing global and regional conflict, and avoidable health inequities and barriers to healthcare”, said Juliane Mirow, 22, from Germany.
“The greatest problem that humanity will face in the future is that which is posed by climate change and of course the health implications of that. Our greatest strength is technology and particularly its ability to connect people in order to solve humanity’s most pertinent issues,” said Nadhira Samsudeen, 22, from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and a member of the NGO Student MedAid London.
Simbiat Oladoja, 30, originally from Nigeria, now based in the Netherlands agrees: “The greatest public health challenge in the next 75 years will be climate change and its impact on the healthcare sector. Opportunity comes from creating climate-smart technology in the healthcare system and using advanced digital technologies.”
Responding to their concerns and to increase engagement with youth representatives on pressing public health challenges, WHO/Europe has today launched its first-ever youth network on health and well-being, the Youth4Health network. At the time of the launch, over 80 individual members and 18 youth organizations from 29 countries across Europe and Central Asia have already joined.
Admissions to the network are rolling. All youth organizations, organizations working in the youth space, Member State youth delegates, youth activists and youth parliamentarians are encouraged to apply, if they are
The Network is
“Are young people being heard? Are their needs respected? Do they have access to health systems that are inclusive and equitable? We need to engage with them to discuss how we can do better. That’s why we launched the Youth4Health network and that’s why this network will make a difference. Young people are the changemakers of tomorrow, and of today. They need a seat at the table to express their opinions and ideas, and it's our job to listen to them and deliver", explained Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
Juliane, Simbiat and Nadhira as part of Student MedAid London are among the first members. “I joined the Youth4Health network to be part of a young community that will drive change in the WHO European Region”, says Juliane. "I want to stand up for my beliefs and contribute to just, innovative and more sustainable health systems.”
Youth engagement at WHO/Europe
Since 2021, WHO/Europe has increased efforts to engage youth as equal partners in health and well-being decision-making. Youth representatives have influenced and led tangible changes across WHO/Europe’s work:
What’s next?
WHO/Europe will engage the Youth4Health network across all its workstreams and is planning youth events, such as a youth event on immunization in December, as well as ensuring youth representatives are engaged in events with high-level decision-makers. Together with the network, WHO/Europe also advocates for youth representatives to be included in delegations to the 73rd session of the Regional Committee in Astana, Kazakhstan in October.

During his remarks, Shlapachenko pointed to the active joint work being carried out with Turkmenistan within the framework of the Framework Program of Cooperation with the United Nations for 2021-2025.
Our many joint achievements make us proud on the international stage, he said.
Here are just some of the achievements of the UN agencies in Turkmenistan:
UNHCR - Turkmenistan is one of the few countries in the world that is on the right track to achieve the goal of the #IBelong campaign to eradicate statelessness in 2024.
IOM - With the participation of the UN, Turkmenistan has developed and implemented two National Action Plans to Combat Human Trafficking and supports the development of a new plan with a focus on women and girls in vulnerable situations. Comprehensive support has been provided to more than 420 Afghan migrants living in Turkmenistan.
UNFPA - A recent large-scale joint achievement is the conduct of a Continuous census of the population and housing stock in 2022. It is expected that the Government will soon provide disaggregated census data.
"The UN is ready to provide further expert support for analysis to implement national priorities, improve strategic planning, and evidence-based policy formation. As well as for monitoring the SDGs in accordance with the joint Action Plan to improve these SDGs," Shlapachenko stressed.
UNESCO - Within the framework of the Convention on the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, more than 1,000 historical and cultural sites have been discovered and registered on the territory of Turkmenistan to date.

In this regard, the Resident Coordinator expressed gratitude to the President of Turkmenistan, who at the UN General Assembly in New York announced a number of areas proposed for implementation through joint UN programs, including the creation of a Regional Center for Climate Change Technologies in Central Asia in Ashgabat, a Roadmap on methane emissions, initiatives on youth, peace and security, food security and others.
"I would like to affirm the readiness of the UN Country Team to continue working with relevant ministries on the preparation of program proposals for funding," he added.
The idea of a National Clean Climate Fund
In his speech, Dmitry Shlapachenko voiced the idea of creating a National Clean Climate Fund, which is also provided for by the National Strategy of Turkmenistan on Climate Change.
"Given Turkmenistan's steady progress towards achieving high-income country status, budget resources will remain the primary source of funding for the SDGs," he said.
Shlpachenko expressed readiness to support the creation of a multi-partner country SDG fund. In his opinion, piloting the fund is advisable in the area of joint climate change programs.
He believes that the creation of the fund will promote global awareness of the country's priorities, will attract additional funds from donors and the private sector, as well as develop innovative sources of funding, such as green bonds.
The Summit of the Future is ahead
Concluding his remarks, Dmitry Shlapachenko recalled that the world community will hold a Summit of the Future in 2024, building on the outcomes of the resent SDG Summit and aiming to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
He expressed confidence that Turkmenistan and the UN, working together to define the priorities of their joint work within the framework of the 2030 Agenda, can better focus on the well-being of the most vulnerable groups, enhance the effectiveness of their cooperation in achieving the SDGs, leaving no one behind.

Title: First WHO report details devastating impact of hypertension and ways to stop it
Content: 20 September 2023
NEW YORK, 19 SEPTEMBER 2023—The World Health Organization (WHO) released its first-ever report on the devastating global impact of high blood pressure, along with recommendations on the ways to win the race against this silent killer. The report shows approximately 4 out of every 5 people with hypertension are not adequately treated, but if countries can scale up coverage, 76 million deaths could be averted between 2023 and 2050.
Hypertension affects 1 in 3 adults worldwide. This common, deadly condition leads to stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney damage and many other health problems.
The number of people living with hypertension (blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher or taking medication for hypertension) doubled between 1990 and 2019, from 650 million to 1.3 billion. Nearly half of people with hypertension globally are currently unaware of their condition. More than three-quarters of adults with hypertension live in low- and middle-income countries.
Older age and genetics can increase the risk of having high blood pressure, but modifiable risk factors such as eating high-salt diet, not being physically active and drinking too much alcohol can also increase the risk of hypertension.
Lifestyle changes like eating a healthier diet, quitting tobacco and being more active can help lower blood pressure. Some people may need medicines that can control hypertension effectively and prevent related complications.
The prevention, early detection and effective management of hypertension are among the most cost- effective interventions in health care and should be prioritized by countries as part of their national health benefit package offered at a primary care level. The economic benefits of improved hypertension treatment programmes outweigh the costs by about 18 to 1.
“Hypertension can be controlled effectively with simple, low-cost medication regimens, and yet only about one in five people with hypertension have controlled it.” Said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Hypertension control programmes remain neglected, under-prioritized and vastly underfunded. Strengthening hypertension control must be part of every country’s journey towards universal health coverage, based on well-functioning, equitable and resilient health systems, built on a foundation of primary health care.”
The report is being launched during the 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly which addresses progress for the Sustainable Development Goals including health goals on pandemic preparedness and response, ending tuberculosis and attaining Universal Health Coverage. Better prevention and control of hypertension will be essential to progress in all of these.
An increase in the number of patients effectively treated for hypertension to levels observed in high-performing countries could prevent 76 million deaths, 120 million strokes, 79 million heart attacks, and 17 million cases of heart failure between now and 2050.
“Most heart attacks and strokes in the world today can be prevented with affordable, safe, accessible medicines and other interventions, such as sodium reduction,” said Michael R. Bloomberg, WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries. “Treating hypertension through primary health care will save lives, while also saving billions of dollars a year.”
Hypertension can easily be treated with safe, widely available, low-cost generic medications using programmes such as HEARTS. WHO's HEARTS technical package for cardiovascular disease management in primary health care and the Guideline for the pharmacological treatment of hypertension in adults provide proven and practical steps to deliver effective hypertension care in primary health care settings.
Effective community- and country-wide blood pressure management can be achieved in countries of all income levels. More than 40 low- and middle-income countries, including Bangladesh, Cuba, India and Sri Lanka, have strengthened their hypertension care with the HEARTS package, enrolling more than 17 million people into treatment programmes. Countries such as Canada and South Korea delivered comprehensive national hypertension treatment programmes, and both countries surpassed the 50% mark for blood pressure control in adults living with hypertension. Sustained, systematic national hypertension control programmes can succeed—and a high level of blood pressure control translates into fewer strokes and heart attacks, and longer, healthier lives.
The report underscores the importance of implementing WHO-recommended effective hypertension care to save lives, which include the following five components:
“Every hour, more than 1 000 people die from strokes and heart attacks. Most of these deaths are caused by high blood pressure, and most could have been prevented,” said Dr Tom Frieden, President & CEO, Resolve to Save Lives. “Good hypertension care is affordable, within reach, and strengthens primary health care. The challenge now is to go from “within reach” to “reached.” This will require commitment of governments around the world.”

Title: Responding to cascading global crises, SDG Summit launches new phase of accelerated action on the Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 20 September 2023
World leaders agree to take immediate action to unlock more and better financing for developing countries
New York, 18 September – Gathering at the SDG Summit on 18 to 19 September, world leaders agreed today to urgently step up their efforts to deliver  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), our global roadmap out of crises, by 2030.
World leaders made an historic global promise to secure the rights and well-being of everyone on a healthy, thriving planet when they agreed to the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs in 2015. However, at midpoint of SDG implementation, the SDGs are in peril. Tens of millions have fallen into poverty since 2020. Over 110 million people are forcibly displaced. Inequalities have worsened, strikingly so for women and girls. Many governments are forced to choose between debt payments and investing in healthcare and education. The climate emergency is wreaking havoc on lives and livelihoods. Developing countries and the world’s most vulnerable people continue to bear the brunt of these crises.
“The SDGs aren’t just a list of goals. They carry the hopes, dreams, rights and expectations of people everywhere,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. “Yet today, only 15 per cent of the targets are on track. Many are going in reverse. Instead of leaving no one behind, we risk leaving the SDGs behind.”

The Political Declaration
Leaders adopted a decisive, action-oriented political declaration at the Summit, highlighting their collective commitment to build a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous world by 2030.
With a strong focus on the means of implementation, and in particular, on financing for development, the declaration acknowledges that without a quantum leap in investments to enable just and equitable energy, food, digital transitions, and a transformation in education and robust social protection in developing countries, the goals simply will not be met.
Additionally, the Declaration urges immediate action to deliver an SDG Stimulus proposed by the UN Secretary-General, which calls for a massive increase in financing for the achievement of the SDGs to the tune of $500 billion each year. It also conveys strong support from all countries for a much-needed reform of the international financial architecture to better reflect today’s global economy.
“I am deeply encouraged by the detailed and wide-ranging draft political declaration under consideration here today — especially its commitment to improving developing countries’ access to the fuel required for SDG progress: finance. This can be a game-changer in accelerating SDG progress,” stated the Secretary-General.
Global and National Commitments
Over 100 Countries will present national commitments to SDG Transformation that include priority transitions and areas for investment, setting national benchmarks for reducing poverty and inequalities by 2027 and strengthening institutional frameworks to support SDG progress. In addition to these national commitments, developed countries and other countries who have the capacity, are expected to make individual global commitments drawing on the Secretary-General’s proposal for an SDG Stimulus and broader means of implementation, such as fulfilling ODA commitments, suspending debt payments and agreeing on innovative finance mechanisms.
SDG Action Weekend
The SDGs cannot be delivered by governments alone. The SDG Action Weekend on 16 to 17 September gave an opportunity for over 3000 people from all sectors of society to outline their commitments to accelerate progress on the SDGs. The SDG Mobilization Day on Saturday 16 September saw business, civil society, science, local authorities and young people making meaningful contributions to SDG implementation.
The SDG Acceleration Day on 17 September highlighted UN High-Impact Initiatives that show that transformation is possible and will help to drive momentum for action on the ground in the coming years. The initiatives focus on six major transitions that will drive progress across the SDGs: i) Social Protection; ii) Energy; iii.) Education; iv) Food Systems; v) Digital Transformation; vi) Biodiversity and Nature, underpinned by greater financing and other supports, as well as action to advance gender equality.
About the Summit
The opening of the Summit featured statements by the President of the General Assembly Dennis Francis, UN Secretary-General António Guterres and President of the Economic and Social Council Paula Narvaéz.
The 2-day Summit will feature a short plenary segment to hear the actions and commitments delivered on behalf of groups of States. Six Leaders' Dialogues will allow Heads of State and Government to report on progress and set out concrete national commitments to SDG transformation.
SDG Media Zone, 18-22 September, 10:30 am – 4:30 pm
The SDG Media Zone is a key feature of the UN General Assembly’s High-Level Week, bringing together world leaders, influencers, activists, experts, content creators and media partners to highlight actions and solutions in support of the SDGs. Organized by the UN Department of Global Communications, in collaboration with the PVBLIC Foundation, the Zone takes the conversation on advancing the 2030 Agenda into the public discourse through impactful in-depth interviews and conversations on global issues that matter to people everywhere. All sessions will livestream on UN WebTV.
SDG Pavilion, 15-22 September
The SDG Pavilion is a beacon for the Sustainable Development Goals. It was created to mark the halfway point of the Goals. To use a sporting analogy, we are down at halftime.
However, the good news is that any given match is won in the second half. Organized by the UN Office for Partnerships, in collaboration with Project Everyone, the SDG Pavilion will host a series of Halftime Talks and a high level gathering of women leaders to mobilize the world to keep the promise of the SDGs. Sessions will be livestreamed on UN WebTV.

Title: WHO and USAID organized a Partners meeting to present achievements
Content: 19 September 2023
On 14 September 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) organized a Partners meeting to present achievements and discuss the way forward after completion of the WHO-USAID Project “Ending Drug-resistant Tuberculosis in Central Asia” implemented in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan during 2019-2023.
Tuberculosis (TB) and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) still poses significant public health threat to many countries in the WHO European Region, specifically in Central Asia comprising Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, with more than 34,000 TB and 8,000 patients with DR-TB notified annually. New TB action plan for the WHO European Region recently endorsed by Member States of the Region is setting up ambitious milestones by 2025 and targets in decreasing the burden of TB and DR-TB in the Region by 2030.
Through implementation of the Project, WHO provided comprehensive technical assistance to Ministries of Health of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in aligning national policies and regulations on TB in accordance with the latest WHO recommendations on TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and people-centered care, invested in building national capacity on programmatic management of DR-TB and research, contributed to implementation of regional operational research initiatives on DR-TB at country level, and facilitated introduction of innovations and scale up of digital adherence solutions for TB and DR-TB.
With universal access to health care, almost everyone who develops TB in Central Asia can be successfully treated and preventive treatment can be offered to those most at risk. Multisectoral action is needed to eliminate the economic distress, vulnerability, marginalization, stigma and discrimination often faced by those affected by TB. Such cooperation would effectively drive down the number of people developing TB infection and disease by addressing social determinants such as poverty, undernutrition, the prevalence of HIV infection, diabetes, mental health and smoking. Programmatic breakthroughs, such as TB preventive treatment for TB infection and shorter regimens for DR-TB, are needed to rapidly reduce the burden of disease in Central Asia to exceed the levels already achieved and significantly reduce the reservoir of infection. Building on commitments, Ministries of Health of Central Asian countries have a unique opportunity to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on national responses to TB and DR-TB, and rapidly accelerate progress towards the goals and targets set up by the TB action plan for the WHO European Region 2023-2030. Responding raising countries’ demand, WHO and USAID will continue providing tailored country support to Central Asian countries tackle and eliminate TB and DR-TB in the Region.

Ashgabat, 30 - 31 May 2023
The International Organization for Migration and the UnitedNations Development Programme in Turkmenistan raised awareness of national partners involved in national climate change adaptation planning of institutional and practical aspects of climate change adaptation at different government levels, including best practices on integration of humanmobility issuesinto national adaptation plans and the role ofmigration in climate-resilient development at a two-day workshop organized with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection of Turkmenistan.
Representatives from different ministries and agencies including the Mejlis, Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection, State Committee for Water Management, Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, State Statistics Committee, General Directorate of Civil Defense and Rescue Operations of the Ministry of Defense, State Migration Service of Turkmenistan, Institute of the Caspian Sea and Women Union took part in the workshop. The workshop participants discussed topics related to various options for the interaction of key institutional structures and policy instruments for adaptation and adaptation planning at the global and regional levels, relevant aspects of coordinating the adaptation agenda between existing government institutions and otherstakeholders. The UNDP project specialist and an invited speaker from the UNDP Moldova office spoke about modern practices for data collection, monitoring, reporting and assessment (MRV) on climate and adaptation measures with reference to the experience of other countries. The workshop participants also reviewed aspects of engagement of different stakeholders from the private sector, civil society organizations and local authorities in the planning and implementation of adaptation measures.
In particular, an international UNDP expert from Sweden noted that adaptation to climate change is a cyclical process that, along with planning and implementing measures, includes regular assessment and monitoring of progress, as well asrevision and adaptation of goals and measures taken in response to current climate indicators, the current socio-economic situation and other data. The national adaptation planning is a long-term and strategic process. Establishment of an institutional structure and coordination of actions between stakeholders are the key aspects for the successful implementation of the full cycle of adaptation.
Other than theoretical knowledge, the workshop participants were able to practice the introduction of the adaptation agenda into the decision-making process in the course of an interactive game, when decisions were made through a dialogue on the distribution of investments in country development programs, taking into account long-term climate risks.
Inclusion of the relationship between migration, environment and climate change in national plans related to climate change was a separate topic of discussion. The IOM regional expert and a representative of the University of Vienna, collaborating with IOM on the impact of climate change on population mobility, presented the workshop participants with the Supplement to the UNFCCC Technical Guidelines for National Adaptation Planning Process on integration of population mobility issues. The participants of the workshop were also briefed on best international practices for inclusion of population mobility issues in national coordination mechanisms, evidence and knowledge base on climate change and adaptation, implementation strategy and reporting system for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of NAPs.
As was noted by international experts, population mobility issues related to environmental factors and climate change have long been at the core of IOM's operational, research, policy and information activities. In this regard, IOM seeks to place human mobility at the center of international, regional and national discussions on climate change in cooperation with its Member States, observers and partners.
This workshop is the third in a series on climate change risk adaptation and best practices in climate change adaptation planning held under the UNDP/ GCF project "Development of national adaptation planning in Turkmenistan" and the IOM project “Mainstreaming migration, environment and climate change nexus climate related national planning process” in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection of Turkmenistan.

Title: ESCAP successfully conducted Technical R training for LNOB Analysis in Turkmenistan
Content: 28 April 2023
On 26-27 April, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) with support of Resident Coordinator Office in Turkmenistan successfully conducted Technical R training for LNOB Analysis in Turkmenistan. The two-day training was attended by statisticians and specialists from ministries and national institutions, as well as UN agencies.
As a result, training participants got acquainted with the inner workings of LNOB platform and had hands-on exercises on using the statistical R code that prepares, analyzes and produces evidence on 16 SDG indicators based on the Turkmenistan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) from 2019.
In addition, participants learned how to operationalize the LNOB methodology on indicators other than 16 SDG indicators currently available on the platform. Equipped with this knowledge, participants can then analyze other nationally representative household surveys.
Speaking on the success of the training, Social Affairs Officer Selsah Pasali, said, “ESCAP is committed to supporting its member countries in achieving the SDGs. We are pleased to have conducted this training in Turkmenistan, which will enhance the capacity of national statisticians in the country to conduct LNOB analysis using statistical R code.”
Leaving no one behind (LNOB) is the central, transformative promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). LNOB means moving beyond assessing average and aggregate progress, towards ensuring progress for all population groups at a disaggregated level.

Title: Trade Information Portal to support Turkmenistan’s accession to the WTO
Content: 04 April 2023
A new Trade Facilitation Portal in Turkmenistan will reduce the time and costs for trade across borders. The Portal guides businesses through import, export, and transit requirements; gives access to agreements, laws, regulations, forms, and documents; as well as shares international trade statistics covering more than 25 product groups, with a focus on the agrifood sector.
The Ready4Trade Central Asia project, funded by the European Union (EU) and implemented by the International Trade Centre (ITC), initiated the development of the Portal.
The Ministry of Trade and Foreign Economic Relations of Turkmenistan (MTFER) is the main implementing partner of this initiative. The project worked closely with the MTFER to set up a team that will administer the platform in full autonomy.
To develop the Portal and ensure the accuracy of its information, the team collaborated with more than 20 government agencies.
The official launch of the Portal took place on 4 April 2023, during a three-day trade exhibition that gathered 600 trade-related stakeholders. The launch ceremony was attended by high-level representatives of the Ministry of Trade and Foreign Economic Relations of Turkmenistan, H.E. Diego Ruiz Alonso, EU Ambassador to Turkmenistan and Mohammad Saeed, Chief, Trade Facilitation and Policy for Business at ITC.
With the launch of the Portal in Turkmenistan, all five Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) have now access to transparent cross-border trade procedures.
The online platform, which was developed in collaboration with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is used in around 30 countries around the world. It contributes to the compliance with Article 1.2 of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and achieving the overarching goal of trade facilitation embedded the Agreement.
Quotes
“The implementation of the Trade Information Portal in Turkmenistan is a major achievement, as it will help to enhance the country's ability to comply with the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and reduce barriers to trade. The portal can serve as a one-stop-shop for all relevant trade-related information, procedures, and requirements, making it easier for businesses to navigate the regulatory landscape”, said H.E. Diego Ruiz Alonso, EU Ambassador to Turkmenistan.
"Our team has devoted significant time and effort to gather, analyze, and validate data, culminating in the creation of this portal. We have collaborated closely with all the regulatory agencies governing cross-border trade operations to construct a trustworthy portal that small and medium-sized enterprises can rely on for their day-to-day operations. We express our gratitude to the ITC team for their invaluable support in the successful implementation of this initiative", said Seyitmurad Geldiyev, representative of the Ministry of Trade and Foreign Economic Relations.
‘With the implementation of similar portals in all Central Asian countries, ITC and partners are closing the information gap on cross-border trade formalities. The portals provide a vital stimulus to small businesses and a boost to the regions’ integration into international markets.’ Timothee Bruneteau, Trade Facilitation Expert, ITC.

Title: UNDP and partners promote youth empowerment for building resilience to violent extremism
Content: 31 March 2023
The Turkmenistan Country Component of the Strive Asia Global Project, launched in 2021, aimed at strengthening the resilience of local communities by supporting public PVE initiatives and supporting government and public organizations in achieving goals related to preventing violent extremism. The specific goal was to ensure that key government agencies and civil society organizations are better prepared to participate in achieving PVE goals. The Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population of Turkmenistan acted as a key national partner in the project implementation.
“UNDP recognizes that youth can play a crucial role in our joint efforts towards accelerating sustainable development,” – said Mr. Rovshen Nurmuhammedov, UNDP Assistant Resident Representative in Turkmenistan. “Within the country component of the Strive Asia project we focused on the provision of socio-economic support to vulnerable youth to empower and strengthen their resilience to violent extremism”.
The event gathered representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population of Turkmenistan, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat Hiakimlik, the Youth Organization of Turkmenistan, the Women’s Union of Turkmenistan, the CSOs, the private sector of the country and young SDG Ambassadors of Turkmenistan. The participants discussed project achievements, which included the national partners capacity building on consequences of stigmatization, dissemination of anti-stigma messages, and other PVE programmes, providing counselling and mentorship support to vulnerable youth and creating a platform for youth empowerment and resilience to violent extremism and radicalization.
Last year, within the STRIVE Asia project country component, funded by the EU, the UNDP Office in Turkmenistan in partnership with the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population of Turkmenistan established the Education-Information Centers to support youth empowerment and employment in six pilot cities of Turkmenistan. The Centers serve as a partnership platform for interested partners to conduct job skills trainings and trainings on psychological and legal support for youth and by empowering youth help tackling the root causes behind violent extremism.
The participants also shared their experiences in the development of digital and interpersonal skills of young people, empowering youth through non-formal learning and innovative projects.
The representatives of “Yenme” public organization and the NGO “Eco Durmush” presented the results of the activities implemented within grant projects in Ashgabat, Dashoguz and Tedjen. “The main idea behind these important projects on preventing violent extremism was to ensure the principles of inclusiveness, equality and include active engagement by all, leaving no one behind,” - said Ms. Gulya Choreklieva, Director of “Yenme” Public Organization.
In Turkmenistan, the project succeeded to strengthen the resilience of local communities by supporting activities aimed at preventing and countering violent extremism among vulnerable population in target areas of the country. Guided by the human-rights based approach, UNDP worked closely with the government, development partners, civil society partners, private sector and youth to prevent violent extremism and enhance opportunities for youth development, paying particular attention to the engagement of women and girls.

Title: Early Warnings For All Initiative scaled up into action on the ground
Content: 21 March 2023
People least responsible for climate change suffer most from extreme weather
Early warnings are efficient and cost-effective form of climate adaptation
New York, 21 March 2023. A global initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected by early warnings by 2027 is being fast-tracked into action on the ground. A recent record-breaking tropical cyclone in Southeast Africa once again shows the paramount importance of these services to save lives and livelihoods from increasingly extreme weather and climate events.
To aid this work, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has convened an Advisory Panel of leaders of UN agencies, multilateral development banks, humanitarian organizations, civil society, insurance and IT companies on 21 March. The aim is to inject more political, technological and financial clout to ensure that Early Warnings for All becomes a reality for everyone, everywhere.
The months ahead will see stepped up coordinated action, initially in 30 particularly at-risk countries, including Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries. Additional countries are expected to be added as this vital work with partners gathers pace, scale and resourcing.
At the same time, the UN’s existing actions and initiatives to save lives and livelihoods, and build resilience across a wide range of other countries will continue and be reinforced, ensuring the Early Warnings for All campaign turns its pledges into life-saving reality on the ground for millions of the most vulnerable people. The aim is not to re-invent the wheel, but rather promote collaboration and synergies and to harness the power of mobile phones and mass communications.
“Now it is time for us to deliver results. Millions of lives are hanging in the balance, It is unacceptable that the countries and peoples that have contributed the least to creating the crisis are paying the heaviest prices,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
“People in Africa, South Asia, South and Central America, and small island states are 15 times more likely to die from climate disasters. These deaths are preventable. The evidence is clear: early warning systems are one of the most effective risk reduction and climate adaptation measures to reduce disaster mortality and economic losses,” said Mr Guterres.
The need is urgent.
Preventable deaths
Half of countries globally do not have adequate early warning systems and even fewer have regulatory frameworks to link early warnings to emergency plans.
“The unprecedented flooding in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar from Tropical Cyclone Freddy highlights once again that our weather and precipitation is becoming more extreme and that water-related hazards are on the rise,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. “The worst affected areas have received months’ worth of rainfall in a matter of days and the socio-economic impacts are catastrophic.”
“Accurate early warnings combined with coordinated disaster management on the ground prevented the casualty toll from rising even higher. But we can do even better and that is why the Early Warnings for All initiative is the top priority for WMO. Besides avoiding damages the weather, climate and hydrological services are economically beneficial for agriculture, air, marine and ground transportation, energy, health, tourism and various businesses,” he said.
WMO and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) are spearheading the Early Warnings for All initiative, along with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).
“The operationalization of this initiative is a clear example of how the UN System and partners can work together to save lives and protect livelihoods from disasters. Inclusive and multi-hazard early warning systems that close the ‘last mile’ are among the best risk reduction methods in the face of climate-related hazards and geophysical hazards such as tsunamis. Achieving this is not only a clear target in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction but a moral imperative as well,” said Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and Head of UNDRR.
Climate Change Adaptation
Early warning systems are widely regarded as the “low-hanging fruit” for climate change adaptation because they are a relatively cheap and effective way of protecting people and assets from hazards, including storms, floods, heatwaves and tsunamis to name a few.
“When disaster strikes, people and communities can turn to technology as a lifeline,” said ITU Secretary-General Doreen Bogdan-Martin. “By leading the work of the UN Early Warnings for All initiative on ‘Warning Dissemination and Communication,’ ITU is helping ensure that those at risk can act in time to our increasingly climate-vulnerable world.”
Alerts can be sent via radio and television channels, by social media, and with sirens. ITU recommends an inclusive, people-centered approach using the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), a standardized data format for public warnings, to keep messages coherent across different channels.
“Early warnings that translate into preparedness and response save lives. As climate-related disasters are becoming more frequent, more intense and more deadly, they are essential for everyone, but one in three people globally are still not covered. Early warning systems are the most effective and dignified way to prevent an extreme weather event from creating a humanitarian crisis - especially for the most vulnerable and remote communities who bear the brunt of it. No lives should be lost in a predictable disaster,” said IFRC Secretary-General Jagan Chapagain.
Advisory Panel
The Early Warnings for All initiative calls for initial new targeted investments between 2023 and 2027 of US$ 3.1 billion – a sum which would be dwarfed by the benefits. This is a small fraction (about 6 per cent) of the requested US$ 50 billion in adaptation financing. It would cover strengthening disaster risk knowledge, observations and forecasting, preparedness and response, and communication of early warnings.
A range of new and pre-existing innovative financing solutions are required to implement the plan to protect every person on Earth. These include a scaling up of the Climate Risk Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Initiative, the Systematic Observations Financing Facility (SOFF), and accelerated investment programmes of climate funds, such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Adaptation Fund, and key Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), as well as other innovative new financial instruments across all stakeholders of the early warning value chain.
The Advisory Panel meeting will consider advancing the four key Multi-Hazard Early Warning System (MHEWS) pillars:
Notes for Editors :
Background to the initiative
The Early Warnings For All Initiative (EW4All) was formally launched by the UN Secretary-General in November 2022 at the COP27 meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh.
The Initiative calls for the whole world to be covered by an early warning system by the end of 2027.
Early Warnings for All is co-led by WMO and UNDRR and supported by pillar leads ITU and IFRC. Implementing partners are: FAO, OCHA, UNDP, UNEP, UNESCO, REAP, and WFP.
The Advisory Panel will monitor and report on the progress against the achievement of the goal to the UN Secretary-General, and has the following objectives:
(1) Assess progress of the Early Warnings for All initiative against its goals and targets
(2) Build political and overall momentum and support for the Early Warnings for All initiative
(3) Provide overall recommendations for the mobilization of resources, and
(4) Monitor scientific and technical development related to early warning systems

Title: UNDP and the British Embassy in Ashgabat convene the fifth coordination meeting of the Climate Group of Development Partners
Content: 16 March 2023
The meeting served as a platform for discussing development partners’ interventions on the climate agenda in the country, including an update on post-COP27 activities and discussing preparations for the upcoming COP28 Climate Summit to be held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in November 2023. The participants were informed on the process of preparation of the First Biennial Report (BUR1) and the Fourth National Communication (NC4) of Turkmenistan on climate change, which will help strengthen the existing institutional structure and ensure compliance of Turkmenistan’s climate reports with the requirements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Mr. Magtymguly Akmuradov, Ambassador and Adviser to the International Organizations Department, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan participated in the meeting and informed the participants about the results of the international conference "Partnership in the Field of Food Security in the Context of Climate Change", and also highlighted the key outcomes from Turkmenistan’s participation at the COP27 Climate Summit held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in November 2022.
“There is no country in the world where the impact of climate change is not felt, and Turkmenistan is not an exception,” – noted Ms. Narine Sahakyan, UNDP Resident Representative in Turkmenistan. “Last year, we supported Turkmenistan in developing and submitting the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to the UNFCCC. UNDP stands ready to support Turkmenistan in implementing its new NDC and will continue this important dialogue to accelerate joint efforts to support Turkmenistan in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and implementing its obligation under the Paris Agreement.
The development of an updated Nationally Determined Contributions of Turkmenistan was actively supported by the UNDP’s global Climate Promise Initiative, announced at the 2019 UN Climate Summit, to assist countries in achieving their climate goals. Working with over 120 countries and territories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change, the Climate Promise represents UNDP’s strong commitment to supporting countries in enhancing their ambitions in line with their obligations under the Paris Agreement.
“Following our COP26 Presidency and COP27, the UK remains committed to addressing the challenges of climate change as our most important international priority.  It is crucial that we all join our efforts to tackle the existential threat of climate change and biodiversity loss, and to seize the opportunities from the global transition to clean energy,” - said Ms. Lucia Wilde, British Ambassador to Turkmenistan. “Consolidating our COP legacy, the British Embassy will continue our excellent cooperation with key partners to support the Government of Turkmenistan in delivering on COP26 and COP27 commitments and maintaining a high level of ambition in the lead-up to COP28.”
“Climate change creates significant challenges for the humanity”- said Mr. Dmitry Shlapachenko, UN Resident coordinator in Turkmenistan. “We need to take action now and support the Government in implementation of its NDCs and in raising ambitions to reduce CO2 emissions in the years to come through mitigation and adaptation policies that benefit all. In doing so, we also need to promote regional cooperation in Central Asia, as climate change recognizes no borders”.
During the meeting, the development partners provided updates on their current activities and planned projects to support Turkmenistan in achieving its climate goals.
The Coordination Meeting of the Climate Group of Development Partners is convened regularly and serves as a strong coordination mechanism for developing and providing valuable support to Turkmenistan’s efforts on climate action and building resilience.

Title: Women at the forefront of the climate action
Content: 07 March 2023
The event, which was held at the UN House on March 7, gathered inspiring women and girls – supporters of environmental sustainability, young eco-activists, national partners, students from the Turkmen Agricultural University named after S.A. Niyazov and the Turkmen State University named after Magtymguly and representatives of the Nature Protection Society of Turkmenistan.
“Women’s leadership is the key to successful action in tackling climate change. Without their leadership, knowledge and engagement in the implementation of climate-resilient development paths, it is unlikely that solutions for creating a sustainable and healthy planet will be implemented,” – said Mr. Tomica Paovic, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative in Turkmenistan.
The event served as an excellent opportunity to interact and learn about the latest ideas and good practices in combating climate change and achieving green growth, raise awareness of youth about how gender and climate intersect and discuss issues of gender equality and women’s empowerment in the context of climate change.
“Every year there is more and more evidence that gender equality is key to tackling the growing risks posed by climate change,” – said Mr. Stanislav Kim, Regional Team Leader on Climate Change and Disaster Resilience, Regional Disaster Risk Reduction Advisor of the UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub. “Despite all the challenges and in some cases the presence of gender-based legislative barriers, women and girls are leaders and agents of change, mobilizing action for climate change mitigation and adaptation. In this context, the UNDP Gender Equality Strategy 2022-2025 calls to provide the necessary conditions for the participation of women and girls in responding to climate change”.
Interactive discussions shed light on the uneven impact of climate change on women, youth and vulnerable groups, as well as demonstrated the first-hand experience of women entrepreneurs, who make their own contribution to global climate action.
In an effort to empower young change-makers and stimulate innovative women entrepreneurs, recognize outstanding activists in climate action and green growth, UNDP has announced the following winners of the “Women in Sustainability Leadership Award”:
“Our future depends on our actions today. We all play a role in building our tomorrow, we all need to act to protect our world from destruction and pollution,”- said Leyli Yagshyyeva, a nominee of the UNDP Climate Activism Award. “I will do my best to continue to be at the forefront of action to combat climate change.”
The event was organized within the framework of the following UNDP projects implemented jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection of Turkmenistan:
As the leading United Nations agency for international development, UNDP works in 170 countries and territories to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality. We help countries to develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities, and build resilience to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
UNDP is committed to translate gender equality, which is a basic human right and a necessity for sustainable world, into reality. Women's empowerment and gender equality are vital to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which envisions a world “of universal respect for human rights and human dignity” in which “every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality and all legal, social and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed.”

Title: On International Women’s Day UN and partners call for empowering women and girls in Turkmenistan
Content: 06 March 2023
The open dialogue served as a platform for women and girls from different spheres of life of Turkmenistan to spotlight their accomplishments, share challenges and drawbacks and the ways to tackle them. They also brought forward women and girls’ rights, encouraged other women and girls to be more proactive, and highlighted the role of women in innovation, technology, and digital education. The dialogue underscored the importance of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls so that they are not left behind.
The event started with the exhibition at which prominent Turkmen designers, women from the Blind and Deaf Society of Turkmenistan, public organization Yenme, and businesswomen presented Turkmen modern dresses, scarves, handmade toys and crafts, handmade floral jewelries, organic handmade baths, creams and other artwork.
The conversation included statements by the Deputy Foreign Minister Ms. Myahri Bashimova, heads of the UN agencies, women and girls in the field of technology and innovation, diplomacy, business, mass media, students, community activists, SDG Ambassadors and volunteers.
“You can do and achieve anything you want, just believe in your dreams, work hard and never give up” – these words were told by every speaker, and served as inspiration to the girls and women in the audience.
The event concluded with an interactive game about international and local significant women: leaders, advocates for gender equality, child rights, diplomats, business women.
The joint initiative was carried out with support from UNICEF, IOM, OHCHR and UNFPA under the leadership of the UN Coordination Office.

Title: UN to build strategic partnership with private sector in Turkmenistan
Content: 27 February 2023
The signing ceremony took place at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan and was attended by the heads and representatives of the UN agencies in Turkmenistan, Ministers and representatives of the line ministries and national entities, as well as public and civil society organizations of the country.
Among the signed 26 documents in such areas as economy, healthcare, education, mass media, climate change, environmental protection, there was a Memorandum of Understanding between the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan and the United Nations in Turkmenistan on Cooperation in Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals in Turkmenistan, signed by the Chairman of the Union and the UN Resident Coordinator.
Given the private sector’s 70% share in the “Non-carbon GDP” in Turkmenistan, as well as its 50.5% of jobs in the country’s labor market, private businesses play a key role in the country’s economy and the their potential can become a significant factor in realizing the ambition of the 2030 Agenda. While actively supporting the government, the UNCT sees the involvement of the business community and engagement with the private sector as a crucial component of success towards achieving the SDGs during the Decade of Action, proclaimed by the UN Secretary General in 2020.

Title: UNDP and the Government of Turkmenistan expand cooperation to create sustainable health systems
Content: 27 February 2023
“We are happy to note the increased collaboration between UNDP and the Government of Turkmenistan on strengthening health system of the country, which demonstrates a growing trust in UNDP as a strategic partner to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, by ensuring no one is left behind,”- said Ms. Narine Sahakyan, UNDP Resident Representative in Turkmenistan.
More specifically, UNDP launched the following new joint projects to support the national efforts to strengthen the country’s health system:
The project “Provision of medicines necessary for prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases and for maternal and child health in Turkmenistan in 2023-2024”, which is aimed at strengthening the national health systems capacities to control the noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), rare diseases, and improve maternal and newborn health in Turkmenistan. The project will ensure access to free, good quality, available, affordable medicines across the country through the provision of medicines for treatment of NCDs and other diseases.  This project will continue providing quality and affordable medicines initiated by the first NCD project between UNDP and MoHMI for 2020-2021. Notably, the project includes: i) the provision of medicines for rare and orphan diseases which are very costly, making the patients with the rare and orphan diseases most vulnerable to financial hardships; ii) provision of essential medicines for NCD patients, including the most vulnerable people; iii) contribute to women’s health by providing medicines for pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal period;
The project “Strengthening clinical laboratory services in Turkmenistan in 2023-2024” will focus on strengthening the national health system’s capacity for clinical laboratory diagnostics of diseases. The project will support health services to ensure availability, accessibility, reliability, and most-up-to-date laboratory investigations for accurate and timely diagnosis of the most common diseases, such as common infectious, non-infectious diseases, surgery, emergency cases, maternal and child health, and other. Important to note that the project will support laboratories of primary health care which serve most of the population. The availability of lab services at the PHC level in close proximity to the place of residence, reduces gender-related barriers and ensures equal access to a full range of lab investigations for women and girls, including lab investigations during pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal period. The project will particularly help vulnerable people with access to lab services by reducing the cost of the services and the cost of transportation if such services are not available at PHC.
It is expected that both projects, fully funded by the Government of Turkmenistan with a total budget of around 78 million US dollars, will help Turkmenistan to contribute significantly to the achievement of the universal health coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals.
“Ensuring Universal Health Coverage in the country and enhancing the resilience of the national health system to pandemics and acute diseases is one of the main areas of our cooperation with indeed impressive results. The volume of our past and ongoing cooperation only on health totals approximately $150 million, with the vast contribution coming from the government of Turkmenistan,” – said Ms. Sahakyan. “The remarkable achievements and outstanding collaboration between UNDP and Turkmenistan on public health have been reflected in the letters of recognition and appreciation from the UNDP Administrator and the Global Fund Executive Director addressed to His Excellency President of Turkmenistan, demonstrating readiness of UNDP and our partners to further improve national health system, leaving no one behind”.

Title: UNIDO, Turkmenistan implement major project within international agreement
Content: 25 February 2023
According to him, this project is the implementation of Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) Phase-Out Management Plan, which will lead to the phasing out of a large number of potentially ozone-depleting chemicals and will help Turkmenistan achieve the target of reducing basic HCFC consumption by 67.5 percent by 2025.
Charles Arthur noted that in September 2020 Turkmenistan became the first Central Asian country to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, and also added that this amendment is an international agreement on the gradual reduction of consumption and production of Hydrochlorofluorocarbons.
"HFCs do not contain chlorine, so they do not cause ozone depletion, and therefore have been replacing HCFCs under the Montreal Protocol. However, hydrofluorocarbons are powerful greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, so this amendment adds HFCs to the list of chemicals that countries promise to phase down. Turkmenistan is required to freeze HFC production and use in 2024, with an 80 percent reduction in use by 2045," the representative of UNIDO said.
The Kigali Amendment is the fifth amendment to the Montreal Protocol adopted to reduce the consumption of hydrofluorocarbons, which were often used as a substitute for ozone-depleting substances.
More than 140 countries have ratified the Kigali Amendment so far. It is estimated that the global implementation of the amendment will prevent emissions of up to 80 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2050.

Title: Center for Support of People with Disabilities of Turkmenistan begins implementation of youth project "Innovative education – a path towards inclusive society"
Content: 06 February 2023
The youth project is aimed at equipping twenty people with disabilities with professional skills for employment opportunities, be it distance working, freelance or start-ups. Specialists in the field of C# programming, user interface, graphic design, integrated development environment, soft skills and marketing were invited to conduct the training. The training methodology was adapted to allow the training participants to gain basic knowledge to continue their education on their own, taking into account the continuous development of the IT market. This will enable them to further adjust to the industry needs and be competitive in the market. Trainings are held at the premises of Public Associative "Yenme".
“A game designer is a storyteller, but he tells a story through graphics, gameplay, music, sounds, dialogue, and more. When I was writing this project, I caught myself thinking that every person is a treasure of stories that will resonate with many if they are told through the right tools. People with disabilities go through hard work and struggle with themselves for the sake of sometimes seemingly regular things. I decided that by teaching them the tools that I have, they will be able to convey their experiences, aspirations and ideas to everyone. Now, I see that the project participants are full of enthusiasm and desire to learn. Given their perseverance, I am sure that at the end of the project we will see that disability is not a diagnosis, but just a conditional clause on the path to success,” project leader Kemran Kadyrov emphasized.
By the end of training, participants will learn the basics of programming skills, application and game development tools, IT market analysis, resume writing and job search techniques, will become more socially adapted and will be able to actively use the acquired skills in employment.
“I am interested in learning computer programming, and I want to grow professionally in this area. At the first lesson, the trainer presented the material in a very accessible way. I am sure that I will be able to master all the new material and achieve success,” training participant Ilkhan Orazmetov noted.
“I want to gain knowledge and a profession. I think that new skills will be useful for me not only in getting a job, but also in other spheres of my life. I will try to find a job after completing the course,” another training participant Karina Mamedova shared her hopes.
The grant program to support youth leadership is carried out under the project “Building youth resilience through community engagement”, implemented by IOM in partnership with the Eurasia Foundation (EF) within the framework of the Social Innovations in Central Asia (SICA) program with the financial support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Strengthening the capacity of young people in development and improvement of well-being of local communities is one of the goals of the project.

Title: Youth project “Blindness is not a sentence” kicks off in Ashgabat
Content: 31 January 2023
The youth project “Blindness is not a sentence” was initiated by young leader Shabibi Osmanova, Chairwoman of the Youth Committee at BDST, which successfully passed the selection process. The project aims to help late-blinded people overcome emotional and psychological barriers and develop their skills for adaptation and integration into society.
The project “Blindness is not a sentence” will involve 50 late-blinded people who find it difficult to adapt to the social environment, need psychological assistance, social adaptation and integration into society. In this regard, the project will organize trainings for target groups in the cities of Ashgabat, Dashoguz and Balkanabat. Trainings participants will review specific methods for overcoming domestic problems, get acquainted with the methods of orientation and finding direction in space and mobility, learn the types and methods of relaxation, and also dig deeper into the information technology. The uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the trainers themselves are late-blinded people, and training materials will be presented using the peer-to-peer method.
By the end of the project, the training participants will be able to work independently on removing emotional and psychological barriers, overcoming their phobias, reconsidering their prejudices regarding the use of a cane for blind people, not be ashamed of their current condition, learn the basic computer skills adapted for a blind person.
This project is one of the nine Youth Leadership Grant projects aimed at building capacity of young people through strengthening their leadership qualities and involving young people in social projects supported by public associations together with young leaders that contribute to social, economic and environmental development in communities.
The project “Building youth resilience through community engagement” is implemented by IOM in partnership with the Eurasia Foundation (EF) within the framework of the Social Innovations in Central Asia (SICA) program with the financial support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Strengthening the capacity of young people to participate in local community projects is one of the goals of the project to develop and improve the well-being of local communities.

Title: Remembering the Holocaust victims in Turkmenistan
Content: 30 January 2023
Speakers representing the Diplomatic and Jewish communities in the country noted that such events provide opportunities to develop a deeper appreciation of the victims and survivors. They stressed  “placing the victims and survivors in the centre of historical research, and that learning and remembrance illuminates the humanity of victims of atrocities today, and the impact of antisemitism fueled by disinformation and the distortion of history. Focusing on the humanity of victims prompts us to remember our humanity, and our responsibility to combat hate speech, combat antisemitism and prejudice - to do all we can to prevent genocide”.
Following the panel discussion and music interlude the participants explored the photo exhibition “The Butterfly project: remembering the children of the Holocaust” that outlined the impact of the Holocaust on children, and showcases an educational initiative called "The Butterfly Project" developed by Holocaust Museum Houston to teach this history to young people, encourage them to remember the 1.5 million children who perished and to stand up against hatred and prejudice.
“Remembering, discussing and learning about the Holocaust is important not only because it helps us gain a better understanding of the past, but because it also raises awareness about contemporary forms of antisemitism, xenophobia and other forms of hatred. It illustrates how these can create the preconditions for genocide”, noted Dmitry Shlapachenko, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan during his welcoming remarks.

Title: Confluence of multiple crises unleashes one of the lowest global economic outputs in recent decades, according to UN flagship report
Content: 25 January 2023
A series of severe and mutually reinforcing shocks — the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and resulting food and energy crises, surging inflation, debt tightening, as well as the climate emergency — battered the world economy in 2022. Against this backdrop, world output growth is projected to decelerate from an estimated 3.0 per cent in 2022 to 1.9 per cent in 2023, marking one of the lowest growth rates in recent decades, according to the United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2023, launched today.
The report presents a gloomy and uncertain economic outlook for the near term. Global growth is forecast to moderately pick up to 2.7 per cent in 2024 as some of the headwinds will begin to subside. However, this is highly dependent on the pace and sequence of further monetary tightening, the course and consequences of the war in Ukraine, and the possibility of further supply-chain disruptions.
The tepid global economic prospects also threaten the achievement of the  the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), when the 2023 SDG Summit in September marks the mid-point of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
“This is not the time for short-term thinking or knee-jerk fiscal austerity that exacerbates inequality, increases suffering and could put the SDGs farther out of reach. These unprecedented times demand unprecedented action,” said António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General. “This action includes a transformative SDG stimulus package, generated through the collective and concerted efforts of all stakeholders,” he added.
Gloomy economic outlook for both developed and developing economies
Amid high inflation, aggressive monetary tightening and heightened uncertainties, the current downturn has slowed the pace of economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, threatening several countries — both developed and developing — with the prospects of recession in 2023. Growth momentum significantly weakened in the United States, the European Union and other developed economies in 2022, adversely impacting the rest of the global economy through a number of channels.
Tightening global financial conditions coupled with a strong dollar exacerbated fiscal and debt vulnerabilities in developing countries. Over 85 per cent of central banks worldwide tightened monetary policy and raised interest rates in quick succession since late 2021, to tame inflationary pressures and avoid a recession. Global inflation which reached a multi-decade high of about 9 per cent in 2022 is projected to ease but remain elevated at 6.5 per cent in 2023.
Weaker job recovery and rising poverty
Most developing countries have seen a slower job recovery in 2022 and continue to face considerable employment slack. Disproportionate losses in women’s employment during the initial phase of the pandemic have not been fully reversed, with improvements mainly arising from a recovery in informal jobs.
According to the report, slower growth, coupled with elevated inflation and mounting debt vulnerabilities, threatens to further set back hard-won achievements in sustainable development, deepening the already negative effects of the current crises. Already in 2022, the number of people facing acute food insecurity had more than doubled compared to 2019, reaching almost 350 million. A prolonged period of economic weakness and slow income growth would not only hamper poverty eradication, but also constrain countries’ ability to invest in the SDGs more broadly.
“The current crises are hitting the most vulnerable the hardest — often through no fault of their own. The global community needs to step up joint efforts to avert human suffering and support an inclusive and sustainable future for all,” said Li Junhua, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs.
Stronger international cooperation is imperative
The report calls for Governments to avoid fiscal austerity which would stifle growth and disproportionately affect the most vulnerable groups, affect progress in gender equality and stymie development prospects across generations. It recommends reallocation and reprioritization of public expenditures through direct policy interventions that will create jobs and reinvigorate growth. This will require strengthening of social protection systems, ensuring continued support through targeted and temporary subsidies, cash transfers, and discounts on utility bills, which can be complemented with reductions in consumption taxes or custom duties.
Strategic public investments in education, health, digital infrastructure, new technologies and climate change mitigation and adaptation can offer large social returns, accelerate productivity growth, and strengthen resilience to economic, social and environmental shocks.
Additional SDG financing needs in developing countries vary by source, but are estimated to amount to a few  trillion dollars per year. Stronger international commitment is urgently needed to expand access to emergency financial assistance; to restructure and reduce debt burdens across developing countries; and scale up SDG financing.

Title: UNODC global report on trafficking in persons: crises shift trafficking patterns and hinder victim identification
Content: 24 January 2023
The number of victims detected globally fell by 11 per cent in 2020 from the previous year, driven by fewer detections in low- and medium-income countries. The pandemic, in addition to reducing opportunities for traffickers to operate, may have weakened law enforcement capacities to detect victims.
“This latest report shows how the pandemic has increased vulnerabilities to trafficking in persons, further undercutting capacities to rescue victims and bring criminals to justice,” said UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly. “We cannot allow crises to compound exploitation. The UN and the donor community need to support national authorities, most of all in developing countries, to respond totrafficking threats, and to identify and protect victims especially in states of emergency.”
Globally, the number of convictions for trafficking offences also fell by 27 per cent in 2020 from the previous year – with sharper decreases registered in South Asia (56 per cent), Central America and the Caribbean (54 per cent) and South America (46 per cent) – accelerating a longer-term trend registered by UNODC since 2017.
The report also details how war and conflict offer opportunities for traffickers to exploit. It shows that the war in Ukraine is elevating trafficking risks for the displaced population. Most victims resulting from conflicts originate in and are trafficked to countries in Africa and the Middle East.
The seventh UNODC Global Report on Trafficking in Persons covers 141 countries and provides an overview of patterns and flows of trafficking in persons at global, regional and national levels, based on trafficking cases detected between 2017 and 2021. The findings are further informed by analysis of 800 court case summaries and accompanied by detailed suggestions to policy makers to help formulate effective responses.
Fewer cases of trafficking for sexual exploitation were detected during the pandemic as public spaces were closed and related restrictions may have pushed this form of trafficking into more concealed and less safe locations, making it harder to identify victims.
Court case analysis featured in the report further shows that trafficking victims, when they are identified, escape from traffickers on their own and are in effect ‘self-rescued’ – there are more cases of victims escaping and reporting to authorities of their own initiative (41 per cent) than cases where victims were located by law enforcement (28 per cent), members of the community and civil society (11 per cent). This is especially alarming considering many victims of trafficking may not identify themselves as victims or may be too afraid of their exploiters to attempt escaping.
Breaking down trafficking in persons statistics by region, the report shows higher levels of impunity in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Countries in these regions convict fewer traffickers and detect fewer victims than the rest of the world. At the same time, victims from these regions are identified in a wider range of destination countries than victims from other regions.
The 2022 Global Report on Trafficking in Persons also examines court cases showing that female victims are subject to physical or extreme violence at hands of traffickers at a rate three times higher than males, and children almost twice as often as adults.
At the same time, women investigated for trafficking in persons are also significantly more likely to be convicted than men. This suggests that the justice system may discriminate against women, and/or that the role of women in trafficking networks may increase the likelihood that they are convicted for the crime.
***
The UNODC Global Report on Trafficking in Persons has been published since 2009. Mandated by the UN General Assembly to inform an effective response to this crime and place it within the context of the UN Sustainable Development Agenda, the Report draws upon the largest existing dataset on trafficking in persons, with information on the more than 450,000 victims and 300,000 (suspected)offenders detected worldwide between 2003 and 2021.

Title: UN Turkmenistan facilitates UNEP training for Turkmen officials on harnessing methane opportunity
Content: 23 January 2023
The event brought together managers, specialists, regulators and employees from the national oil and gas industry of Turkmenistan and enabled the learners to generate a better understanding of the need to pursue strategic actions in methane management and the ways to mitigate methane emissions in the country.
“We are delighted to offer this training today on harnessing the methane opportunity in Turkmenistan because Turkmenistan has one of the greatest potentials for low-cost methane reduction. It has, therefore, a pivotal role to play to rein in climate change.” - noted UN Resident Coordinator Dmitry Shlapachenko during the opening remarks of the meeting.
The training started by the presentation of Marci Baranski, PhD, Programme Management Officer at UNEP. She talked about the role of the International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO), a UNEP initiative that drives action on methane. She highlighted the importance of methane reduction to close the emissions gap and the urgent need for better data to target strategic mitigation actions and identify science-based policy options to cut methane at the pace needed to achieve the Paris Agreement. Dr. Baranski also discussed the role of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0), UNEP’s flagship oil and gas reporting and mitigation programme.
During the meeting, Olga Gasan-zade, Senior Advisor of Carbon Limits company and Expert with a focus on climate change mitigation, presented the best practices and experiences in reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas industry, as well as methods of methane emissions detection, measurement techniques and quantification. The expert mentioned that methane’s warming potential is more than 80 times higher than of carbon dioxide for the 20-year period. At the same time investments to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas are much lower than in agriculture.
Vladimir Valetka, RCO Economist, reiterated the International Energy Agency Methane Tracker’s estimation that over half of methane emissions in Turkmenistan could be reduced at no net cost. The estimated volume of the country’s methane emissions amounting to around 5 million metric tonnes in 2021 could be transformed into 77 billion kilowatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. At a price of Turkmenistan’s electricity export the lost potential monetary benefit is over US $ 2,1 billion which is equivalent to 3.4% of the country’s GDP in 2021.
In the second half of the event, Meghan Demeter, Consultant at UNEP,  introduced the participants to IMEO’s Methane Alert and Response System (MARS). MARS is the first global system connecting satellite methane detection to transparent notification processes that promotes on-the-ground emissions mitigation efforts. MARS harnesses state-of-the-art satellite data to identify major emissions events, activate its partners to notify relevant stakeholders, and support and track progress towards mitigation.
At the end of the meeting, the participants had an opportunity to take part at Q&A session to gain more knowledge from the experts and to inform on the actions taken by the Government of Turkmenistan in the area of methane mitigation in the country. The potential next steps were brainstormed, including on informing international community on Turkmenistan’s current efforts in reducing methane emissions and expanding the training to bring together technical specialists from the sector, economists and environmentalists.
Following the training consultations, the UNEP experts expressed their willingness to collaborate with the Government of Turkmenistan through the  International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO), to bring forward complementary initiatives to curb methane emissions in the country and address the challenges faced in the way forward through innovative solutions and priority areas in the future.

Title: Deadly malicious attacks continue in 2022 against United Nations peacekeeping and associated personnel
Content: 20 January 2023
- At least 32 Killed in 2022 according to United Nations Staff Union
- Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo prove deadly for peacekeepers
- Abductions, detentions and expulsions of United Nations personnel continued
- Legal consequences needed says United Nations Staff Union President
At least 32 United Nations peacekeeping personnel—28 military and 4 police, including 1 woman police officer—were killed in deliberate attacks in 2022, the United Nations Staff Union said today.
For the ninth year in a row, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) was the deadliest for peacekeepers with 14 fatalities, followed by 13 fatalities in the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), 4 fatalities in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and 1 fatality in United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
“Peacekeepers and the civilian personnel who work side by side with them are on the front lines of the United Nations work in the world’s most challenging environments. We honor the memory of our 32 colleagues whose lives were taken in 2022,” said the United Nations Staff Union President, Aitor Arauz. “Each malicious attack against UN personnel is a blow to peacekeeping, one of the pillars of the multilateral edifice. It is a collective responsibility of the international community to put in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure accountability for these heinous acts, which may constitute war crimes under international law. To this end, we were encouraged by the launch in 2022 of the Group of Friends to promote accountability for crimes against peacekeepers. We look forward to seeing Member States’ strong commitment on this issue lead to tangible outcomes on the ground”.
By nationality, the peacekeepers who died in 2022 were from Bangladesh (3), Chad (4), Egypt (7), Guinea (1), India (2), Ireland (1), Jordan (1), Morocco (1), Nepal (1), Nigeria (2), Pakistan (7), Russian Federation (1) and Serbia (1).
This brings the death toll to at least 494 United Nations and associated personnel who were killed in deliberate attacks in the past 12 years from improvised explosive devices, rocket-propelled grenades, artillery fire, mortar rounds, landmines, armed and successive ambushes, convoy attacks, suicide attacks and targeted assassinations.
Fatality Trend

On 3 August 2022, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo expelled the spokesperson of MONUSCO. According to media reports, the spokesperson, in a 13 July 2022 interview on the sidelines of the weekly MONUSCO press conference in Kinshasa, said that the deployment of a large part of the resources of the Mission and the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the fight against M23 rebels had “negative implications” on other regions where other armed groups operated.
Finally, on 29 January 2022 a military court in the Democratic Republic of the Congo sentenced 51 people to death for the killing of Zaida Catalán and Michael Sharp, members of the United Nations Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and their local interpreter, Betu Tshintela. Ms. Catalán, of Sweden, and Mr. Sharp, of the United States, were investigating reports of mass atrocities in the Kasai region surrounding fighting between Government forces and armed militia, when they were abducted on 12 March 2017. Their bodies were found by United Nations peacekeepers two weeks later outside the city of Kananga. The verdict, which might be appealed, resulted in the conviction of Colonel Jean de Dieu Mambweni, Thomas Nkashama, Jean Bosco Mukanda and others associated with them. Noting that there was a de facto moratorium on the imposition of the death penalty in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations urged the country’s authorities to maintain the moratorium on the death penalty and to consider abolishing it in law.

Title: Amidst escalating pension and healthcare costs, new UN report calls for concrete measures to support an ageing world
Content: 12 January 2023
The number of people aged 65 years or older worldwide is projected to more than double, rising from 761 million in 2021 to 1.6 billion in 2050. As the world continues to address multiple crises, including the rising cost of living, the rights and well- being of older persons must be at the centre of collective efforts to achieve a sustainable future, according to the World Social Report 2023, released today.
Longer and healthier lives bring development opportunities
The World Social Report: Leaving no one behind in an ageing world states that population ageing is a defining global trend of our time. Globally, a baby born in 2021 could expect to live, on average, almost 25 years more than a newborn from 1950, reaching 71 years, with women outliving men by an average of five years. Northern Africa, Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are expected to experience the fastest growth in the number of older people over the next three decades, while Europe and Northern America combined now have the highest share of older persons. According to the report, improvements in health and medical therapies, greater access to education and reductions in fertility have driven this transformation.
Inequality in the ageing world
“Together, we can address today’s inequalities for the benefit of tomorrow’s generations, managing the challenges and capitalizing on the opportunities that population ageing brings,” said Mr. Li Junhua, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs.
Not everyone has benefited equally from the improvements in health and education that have driven population ageing. While many older persons are in excellent health or economically active, others live with ailments or in poverty. In more developed regions, public transfer systems, including pensions and health care, provide over two thirds of the consumption by older persons. However, in less developed regions, older persons tend to work longer and rely more on accumulated assets or family assistance. Additionally, public spending in most countries has not been sufficient to cover the growing demand for long-term care.
As the report shows, life expectancy is strongly influenced by income, education, gender, ethnicity and place of residence, among many other factors. Some combinations of these factors have too often led to systemic disadvantage that begins early in life.
Without policies to prevent them, systemic disadvantages reinforce one another throughout peoples’ lives, leading to gaping disparities at older ages, with dire consequences for progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 10 on Reducing Inequalities.
The way forward
This demographic shift must be met with a rethink of long-held policies and practices associated with livelihoods and work. In his report on Our Common Agenda, UN Secretary- General António Guterres called for long-term initiatives that promote access to quality education, health care and decent work throughout the life course for all.
Many countries are already introducing opportunities for life-long learning, strengthening and taking full advantage of intergenerational workforces, and introducing flexible retirement ages to accommodate a broad range of personal situations and preferences.
Governments can balance budgets while reducing inequality
Rethinking social protection systems, including pension schemes, is necessary. One major challenge is maintaining the fiscal sustainability of public pension systems while ensuring income security for all older persons, including workers in informal employment.
Expanding decent work opportunities for women and other groups traditionally excluded from the formal labour market, while also recognizing the considerable contribution of the largely informal care sector to the formal economy, are additional crucial elements to ensure sustainable and inclusive economic growth in an ageing world.
About the World Social Report 2023
The World Social Report 2023, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, including its analysis and review of policy options to address population ageing, is intended to provide world leaders with information and policy guidance as they chart a path forward and renew commitments to achieving the SDGs at the upcoming SDG Summit in September: https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/world-social-report.html

Content: 15 December 2022
The “Brain Ring” contest was organized in the form of quiz, where participants’ knowledge was tested in relatation to COVID-19 prevention. The winners received prizes, while all participants were acknowledged for their participation by being awarded with certificates.
During the opening remarks the specialists of the UNDP/World Bank project “Turkmenistan COVID-19 Response” familiarized students and teachers with the project objectives, aiming at strengthening the medical systems and ensuring timely response of the country to the challenges of the pandemic. UNDP, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry of Turkmenistan, UNICEF and WHO in Turkmenistan, implements activities towards building national capacity in the area of laboratory research, medical care, professional development of medical personnel, purchasing reagents, medical equipment and medicines, elimination of health risks and promotion of the use of digital technologies for effective control and monitoring of infectious diseases.
Particular emphasis was placed on Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), which serve as effective tools not only in identifying, assessing and managing social and environmental risks, but also in increasing the involvement of all stakeholders in the process of discussing and improving project mechanisms.
Raising awareness of COVID-19 prevention measures, as well as lessons learned during the current pandemic, will help the public cope with the challenges arising from the pandemic and be more effective in adopting preventive measures for personal protection.

Title: Measures to fight against human trafficking were held in two regions of Turkmenistan
Content: 05 December 2022
The events were organized by the International Organization for Migration within the framework of the "Youth Awareness and Engagement Program to mitigate multidimensional risks and threats associated with the Global Pandemic" jointly implemented by the Government of Turkmenistan and the UN, funded by the UN Trust Fund for Human Security.
The issues of unregulated migration and combating human trafficking are one of the urgent problems in the modern world. The joint program is an example of active interaction between government agencies, civil society and international organizations in the implementation of the tasks of combating human trafficking, as well as raising public awareness on human security issues.
All participants of the events received knowledge about internal and external communication tools to promote issues in the field of fighting against human trafficking and noted the importance of conducting information campaigns.
Campaign “Study. Take action. Share” served as a channel for disseminating information about getting advisory assistance on social, legal and psychological issues.
Jumaniyazova Govher, an events participant noted:
“The problem of human trafficking is unacceptable and incompatible with the fundamental values ​​of our state. Therefore, information campaigns help unite the efforts of the Government and civil society to solve key tasks aimed at preventing and fighting against human trafficking.”
Imam Khudaiberdiev Jorakul:
“It is great to see representatives of all ages participating in information campaigns, from youth to elders. This generational continuity is very important. The youth received knowledge that they will share with the population. As an elderly person, I would like to note the great role of our state, which is taking all measures to reduce the risks of falling into a situation of human trafficking, so there is a need to continue to conduct information campaigns to raise public awareness in this area.”

Disability inclusion is an essential condition to upholding human rights, sustainable development, and peace and security. It is also central to the promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals to ‘leave no one behind’. The commitment to realizing the rights of persons with disabilities is not only a matter of justice; it is an investment in a common future. To mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, UNODC underlines the need to prioritize the inclusion of persons with disabilities.
On 3 December, 2022, within the framework of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, UNODC and ‘Enme’ Public Organization of Turkmenistan with the support of the Ministry of Trade and Social Protection of Turkmenistan, the Embassy of Türkiye in Turkmenistan and USAID joined their efforts and hosted the social event ‘We are strong, we are equal’ at the Ashgabat Turkish Center in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.
Chary Atayev, UNODC Head of Office in Turkmenistan in his welcoming remarks highlighted: “People with disabilities want to be a part of the society, just like everyone else. We should all be the masters of our own life. For persons with disabilities, it can be difficult to find a new job. They are constantly confronted with barriers that sometimes are simply insurmountable. It should not be so. Persons with disabilities have the right to have good conditions in the workplace, to live independently, have equal opportunities to participate fully in the life of their community. Everyone has a right to live a life without barriers. And it is our obligation, as a community, to ensure their full participation in social life on an equal basis with others.”
About 100 people with disabilities, members of vulnerable families, activists and volunteers demonstrated their talents and creative skills through participating in competitions, quizzes, reading poetry, dancing, and singing songs in several languages.
“Often people with disabilities are excluded from social life. This social event gives them a chance to demonstrate that they are equal, strong, and talented along with the other people, it makes them to be visible and socially integrated,” - said Gulya Chorekliyeva, Head of ‘Enme‘  Public Organization.
The social event was also attended by the representatives of the embassies of US and Türkiye, diplomatic missions in Turkmenistan, public organizations, private sector, volunteers, and the people of Ashgabat city.
The annual observance of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) on 3 December was proclaimed in 1992 by the United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/3.The theme this year is “Transformative solutions for inclusive development: the role of innovation in fueling an accessible and equitable world“.

Title: UNODC-WCO Global Container Control Programme conducts a cross-border exercise among Port Control Units in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan
Content: 28 November 2022
The joint practical training aimed at enhancing the PCUs' practical knowledge on risk analysis, profiling and inspecting high-risk consignments, detecting illicit shipments, and enhancing the expertise of the two PCUs in cooperative work and real-time information sharing under the Inter-Regional Network of Customs Authorities and Port Control Units (IREN), as well as improving the practices related to the facilitation of the legitimate trade flows.
Customs post infrastructure at both sites were demonstrated to the participants, where they have learned the routine Customs procedures and information systems in place and conducted the practical work with documents and selective physical inspections of the inbound and outbound cargo on both sides of the border. The training exercise provided to the members of both PCUs an excellent opportunity to look at their own posts’ operations as a joint team from different perspectives.
As an added value of the joint practical exercise, both parties mentioned during the training that it has contributed to better identifying the challenges and obstacles for the smooth cargo and transport flow through this border segment. This has encouraged them to agree upon further mutual steps towards synchronizing their Customs control efforts in line with the bilateral Protocol on the exchange of cargo pre-arrival information, signed by the Heads of Customs services of the two countries on 05 October 2021 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
The participants expressed their appreciation to UNODC-WCO Global Container Control Programme for its strategic approach and the relevance of its interventions in the region, highly beneficial for the countries, as well as for the role of a reliable interlocutor for the countries in their efforts to build and enhance mutual relations and practical cooperation.
The CCP Regional Segment for Central Asia is funded by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and the Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) Programme.

Title: Celebrating the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (IDDRR) 2022 in Turkmenistan, with the support from the European Union
Content: 26 October 2022
The need to systematically reduce the increased impact of disasters is gaining recognition and commitment due to COVID-19 pandemic crisis and climate change impacts, which have made it clear that there is a need for accelerating actions on disaster risk reduction and resilience.
In keeping with the IDDRR’s focus on the impact that disasters have on people’s lives and well-being, this year’s theme highlighted the importance of early-warning systems. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction set improving multi-hazard early warning systems as one of its seven global targets, in 2022 the focus is on Target G: “Substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to people by 2030.” The urgency to achieve this target was strengthened in March 2022 by the announcement made by the UN Secretary-General António Guterres that “the United Nations will spearhead new action to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years.”
The event gathered Heads of emergency authorities, stakeholders, international organizations, public organizations, as well as young people to demonstrate Turkmenistan’s achievements and country’s emergency preparedness as well as disaster risk reduction progress. Performances were held in memory of the victims of the tragic Ashkhabad earthquake of 1948, as well as to highlight the importance of the early warning systems. The event concluded with songs performed by the participants of the “Sing for resilience” contest.
Mr. Dovran Durdyev, Deputy Defence Minister, Chief of Civil Defence and Rescue Operations Directorate, Ministry of Defence of Turkmenistan, underlined: “in Turkmenistan, the State Programme includes specific measures to improve the legislative framework, strengthen the forces and means of civil defence, the early warning systems, and better prepare the population for emergencies.”
“This event is about the people-centered early warning systems and preparedness enabling early action to minimize the harm to people, assets and livelihoods” highlighted Mr. Mohammad Fayyazi, a.i. United Nations Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan / UNICEF Representative.
Ms. Renata Wrobel, in the capacity as Deputy Head of the EU Delegation to Turkmenistan pointed that “International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is the right moment to highlight the importance of disaster reduction for sustainable, equitable growth, and a call for the support to the communities most at risk. The EU believes that a robust understanding of disaster risks is the first step towards addressing the risks effectively by framing risk management”
Background information
About the IDDRR
The United Nations General Assembly has designated 13 October as the IDDRR to promote a global culture of disaster risk reduction. It is an opportunity to acknowledge the progress being made toward reducing disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Japan in March 2015.
The Sendai Framework has seven global targets and 38 indicators for measuring progress on reducing disaster risk and losses. These indicators align the implementation of the Sendai Framework with the Paris Agreement on climate change towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
In 2016, the UN Secretary-General launched “The Sendai Seven Campaign” to promote each of the seven targets over seven years. In 2022, the International Day will focus on Target G of the Sendai Framework: “Substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to people by 2030.”
To raise awareness and mobilize action around these calls, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) is using the 2022 IDDRR, to call for greater investment in expanding early warning and early action for all.
People-centered early warning and preparedness systems can enable early action to minimize damage to people, property, and livelihoods. Early warning systems should ensure that populations and sectors at risk can receive a warning, understand it and, most importantly, take action. Hence, early warning should initiate early action that is well prepared and tested.
Background information about the project

Title: UN Commission has found an array of war crimes, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in Ukraine
Content: 18 October 2022
Given the gravity of the identified violations, there is an undeniable need for accountability, the Commission said on the day of submitting a detailed written report to the UN General Assembly.
“The impact of these violations on the civilian population in Ukraine is immense. The loss of lives is in the thousands. The destruction of infrastructure is devastating,” said Chair of the Commission Erik Møse.
The Commission documented attacks where explosive weapons were used indiscriminately in populated areas that were under attack by Russian armed forces. The Commission also found that Russian armed forces attacked civilians attempting to flee.
There are also examples of both parties to the armed conflict, although to different degrees, failing to protect civilians or civilian objects against the effects of attacks, by locating military objects and forces within or near densely populated areas.
Russian armed forces are responsible for the vast majority of the violations identified, including war crimes. Ukrainian forces have also committed international humanitarian law violations in some cases, including two incidents that qualify as war crimes.
The Commission documented patterns of summary executions, unlawful confinement, torture, ill-treatment, rape and other sexual violence committed in areas occupied by Russian armed forces across the four regions on which it focused. People have been detained, some have been unlawfully deported to the Russian Federation, and many are still reported missing. Sexual violence has affected victims of all ages. Family members, including children, were sometimes forced to witness the crimes.
These violations continue to have a devastating effect on civilians. Significantly, victims emphasised the essential role of justice and accountability. Family members who lost loved ones have expressed a strong need for justice to be done.
A stepfather whose son was killed in Bucha told the Commission: “I used to want to find those who were responsible and kill them. But now I want the guilty to be put on trial and I want the truth to come out.”
In this regard, the Commission recommends enhanced coordination of international and national accountability efforts to improve effectiveness and prevent harm to victims and witnesses. The Commission, consistent with its mandate, will seek to contribute to the identification of those responsible.
The Commission visited 27 towns and settlements and has interviewed 191 victims and witnesses. Its investigators inspected sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture, as well as weapon remnants, and consulted a large number of documents and reports.
Having paid particular attention to violations committed in the four regions specified in the May resolution - Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy - the Commission will gradually devote more of its resources to the broader time scope, wider geographical and thematic framework as tasked by the March resolution.
Issues of interest will include possible violations in filtration camps, alleged forced transfers of people, conditions under which expedited adoptions of children are allegedly taking place, as well as changes in local administration and so-called referenda, the consequences of which are becoming clearer given recent events.

Title: Regional forum on disaster risk reduction:  Strengthening the resilience of Central Asia
Content: 06 October 2022
This high-level annual meeting has brought together heads of emergency situations authorities and other government officials from all five Central Asian countries, as well as international development institutions, experts and representatives of academic and research institutions in the area of natural hazards and disaster risk management.  Participants discussed measures to enhance regional cooperation and strengthen the resilience of Central Asian countries, as well as prospects for a regional early warning system and implementation of information and communication technologies for disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the region.
In her opening remarks, Ms. Terhi Hakala, EU Special Representative for Central Asia underlined: “From the EU perspective, Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia cuts across many sectors, including water, agriculture, climate change, energy, security, health. Currently the EU finances nine major projects worth almost EUR 40 million that help strengthen DRR systems and build climate resilience. We value our cooperation in this area with our Central Asian partners, UN agencies, the OSCE, World Bank, EBRD and International Science and Technology Center, and the Center for Emergency Situations and Disaster Risk Reduction in Almaty.”
In his opening remarks, Mr. Octavian Bivol, Chief, UNDRR Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia said: “This Forum is a chance to strengthen regional cooperation around disaster risk reduction, so climate and disaster risks no longer threaten Central Asia’s future. The region has an agreed Strategy and Roadmap, so we must now accelerate implementation to meet the goals of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk.”
“The World Bank highly appreciates the role of this Regional Forum as an effective platform to enhance cooperation among the five countries in disaster risk preparedness. It has become a stage where heads of emergency situations agencies and international development institutions can collectively discuss measures to strengthen the region’s resilience to natural disasters”, said Ms. Chyi-Yun Huang, Senior Urban Development and Disaster Risk Management Specialist at the World Bank.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The meeting has been hosted by the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan and supported by the Center for Emergency Situations and Disaster Risk Reduction (CESDRR), which acts as a secretariat of the Regional Forum. This event has been financially supported by theEuropean Union (EU), with the technical support and coordination of the World Bank, Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), and UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR).
Delegates jointly reviewed and made recommendations on the next steps for the Action Plan (Roadmap) to take forward the regional ‘Strategy of Cooperation in Central Asia for Disaster Risk Reduction for 2022 – 2030, which had been adopted at the last Regional Forum held in Tashkent in 2021.
The EU supports Central Asian countries in strengthening their disaster resilience and accelerating risk reduction through a two-tiered regional initiative, which started its implementation in 2019. The initiative has two results areas, whereby UNDRR supports strengthening regional, national and local coordination, governance systems and strategies in DRR, disaster data collection mechanisms, and monitoring progress in the achievement of the goals set in the Sendai Framework 2015-2030. The second result area is implemented by the World Bank under the management of GFDRR and focused on strengthening the evidence and capacity for financial resilience and risk reduction at national and regional levels in Central Asia. Both result areas are implemented in close collaboration with the Almaty-based CESDRR.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On October 4, an extended meeting of the Regional Scientific and Technical Council (RSTC) took place where the findings of the new regional risk assessment for Central Asia and selected country reports with a focus on strengthening resilience of the social protection systems were presented. Furthermore, roundtables were held where participants discussed prospects for emergency preparedness and response through disaster risk financing and the role of the RSTC in supporting disaster risk management agenda in the region. In addition, the participants learnt about additional models for disaster risk assessment in the region from other development partner initiatives (ADB).
On October 5, delegates reviewed the implementation of the Action Plan (Roadmap) for the Strategy for Development of Cooperation of Central Asian countries in DRR for 2022-2030 and analyzed cross-border cooperation on man-made risks such as industrial/technological accidents. In addition, participants were presented with the approach of disaster risk financing in the region based on the example of Tajikistan.
On the final day representatives of the emergency authorities of the Central Asian countries together with experts from the international development organizations and scientific institutions reviewed and approved several proposed programs and initiatives to further strengthen regional cooperation on DRR, climate change adaptation, and emergency situations.

Title: Implementation of the Youth Policy – new opportunities and perspectives
Content: 05 October 2022
The main goal of the round table was to create a platform for discussing the new version of the law of Turkmenistan "On State Youth Policy" dated September 1, 2022. This law defines the main directions of the state youth policy, "and is also aimed at increasing state support in ensuring the rights and freedoms of young people and formation of their complete personality." Changes in the law create favorable conditions for comprehensive support for the development of youth and at the same time provide new directions and tasks for state institutions, as well as for the society and international organizations.
In addition to the law "On State Youth Policy", during the round table were discussed such topics as: the main directions and principles of organizing work with youth; achievements in the implementation of the youth policy and the State program in the field of the state youth policy of Turkmenistan for 2021–2025; youth with disabilities in sports.
During the plenary discussion, the participants of the event made the following proposals: organization of preferential short-term training courses for farmers; proposals for improving career guidance activities for schoolchildren; opportunities for training and production practice in public organizations and the private sector; inter-sectoral interaction to implement youth policy.
“Turkmenistan pays special attention to the development of youth, and the State Program for 2021–2025 is evidence of the state's concern for young people. The national youth policy is being improved and the country's actions to involve young people in various activities are highly respected. An example of joint work was the adoption of a new version of the law of Turkmenistan “On State Youth Policy” dated September 1, 2022, which defines the main directions of youth policy.” - said Gurtgeldi Garyagdyyev from the Ministry of Sports and Youth Policy of Turkmenistan.
"The youth of Turkmenistan is currently making an active contribution to the sustainable and rapid development of the country, strengthening the national economy and improving the living conditions of the people, and the successful implementation of the state program," said Merjen Muhamedova, a representative of the Youth Union named after Magtymguly.
“It's great that different sectors state, public, international met at the round table with young people. Informative speeches gave impulse to new ideas and proposals from the active youth. Representatives of public organizations also made interesting and effective proposals. We are very glad that we were heard,” Yekaterina Geldimuradova, a representative of active youth, spoke about the round table.
“The benefits of the round table are enormous! There was good interaction and discussion of important issues. For example, it was noted that the organization of internships for young professionals not only in state organizations, but also in public organizations is a mutually beneficial partnership, from which both the public organization and young people benefit. We had experience in attracting interns, they made a great contribution to the development of children with special needs, vulnerable youth, the elderly and for a public organization - this is a great support” - spoke out in support of the development of opportunities for internships in public organizations - Gulya Choreklieva, director of the NGO "Yenme".
In three thematic groups on the implementation of youth policy, the participants focused the discussion on the issues of inclusion and empowerment for young people with disabilities, young people from vulnerable groups, girls through involvement in physical education; support of youth sports and physical culture and formation of a healthy lifestyle among the population; social opportunities and social support for youth.
The results of the discussions turned to a number of proposals, such as: creating a platform for discussion and coordination of youth issues by representatives of state structures, public organizations and young leaders; creating a virtual platform where relevant information for young people will be collected, as well as an opportunity for young people to provide important information or receive consultation will be given. In order to increase the effectiveness of the implementation of youth policy and the involvement of young people, a proposal was made to create a council or committee for youth affairs, the need to develop professional personnel, develop a regulatory framework that will ensure the successful implementation of the youth policy and attract all the necessary funds for this. Many proposals were received to involve young people in leading a healthy lifestyle. All proposals will be summarized and provided to the Ministry of Education of Turkmenistan, as well as to the participants of the event for further work.

Title: UNDP runs the Students Competition to mark the World Cities Day
Content: 03 October 2022
The submitted research works demonstrated creative and innovative approaches to the production of goods from recycled materials (plastic, glass, paper, wood, etc.) with ideas on its application in everyday life.
Upon completion of the evaluation the jury consisting of the representatives of the Ministry of Education of Turkmenistan and the UNDP in Turkmenistan announced the winners of the competition.
The 1st place was awarded to a fourth-year student studying ecology and environmental management at the Oguz Han Engineering and Technology University of Turkmenistan, Ms. Ogulshirin Tacheva for the development of a waste-free production of products using recycled plastic waste. The 2nd place was awarded to Ms. Merdzhen Esenova, a third-year student of the Turkmen State University named after Magtymguly for her research work on the topic: "Production of bricks from plastic". Mr. Dzhemshit Begkhanov, a third-year student studying environmental engineering at the Turkmen Engineering and Technology University, was awarded the 3rd place for his research work "Technology for obtaining table salt from halite waste of the Garlyk mining and processing plant."
The jury awarded a special prize to Mr. Atajan Shamuradov, a student of the Turkmen State University named after Magtymguly for the development of a "Smart Container". It is proposed to apply this proposal at the pilot site of the UNDP project, which is planned to be implemented in the end of the year on the territory of the university dormitory and to test this gadget on recycling bins and waste containers.
The jury also especially noted two more works that shared the 4th place in the competition:
- The research work of a student at the Turkmen Agricultural University named after S. A. Niyazov, Mr. Yaran Khudayberdiev, who proposed a very simple and low-cost method of recycling water that is not contaminated with chemicals by installing a simple switch lever that will allow redirecting conditionally clean effluents to an additional reservoir, while transferring polluted water into the public sewer.
- The research work of Mr. Sover Serdarov, a third-year student of the Oguz Han Engineering and Technology University of Turkmenistan on the production of edible bioplastic from organic waste.
In addition, the jury noted the work of Ms. Gulshat Hydyrova, a student of the Oguz Han Engineering and Technology University of Turkmenistan, on the methods of production of organic fertilizer from waste and processing of licorice root. Due to the growing production and interest in the use of licorice root for medicinal purposes, the amount of waste production is increasing. In this regard, the participant of the competition proposed an effective method for producing a bio-humus, a liquid organic fertilizer.
All participants of the competition were awarded certificates and all winners received memorable prizes from the UNDP.
“The Student Research Competition aimed at involving youth in the initiatives that promote the sustainable use of natural resources, rational consumption and waste minimization, as well as to prepare future ecologists to start thinking in a creative and innovative way while dealing with the issues of rational waste management,” – noted Ms. Narine Sahakyan, UNDP Resident Representative in Turkmenistan.
The Student Research Competition was organized by the UNDP/GEF project "Sustainable Cities in Turkmenistan: Integrated Green Urban Development in Ashgabat and Avaza”, which is focused on reducing the negative impacts of urban growth in the country, such as air pollution, increase in energy consumption and household waste, while also supporting the achievement of social and economic development goals.  The project provides technical assistance, institutional and policy support, and promotes behavioral change in relation to rational consumption and waste management covering Ashgabat and the National Touristic Zone “Avaza”, while also creating a basis for replication of results in other cities of the country.

Title: State Statistics Committee and UNICEF release the Survey results of Children and Adults with Disabilities
Content: 03 October 2022
The survey was conducted across the country, in both rural and urban areas, and included 4352 households with members receiving state disability benefit or pension on disability. The sample was drawn from the administrative database of persons receiving social protection benefits provided by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.
The release of the survey results was timely as it contributed to the preparation of the combined second and third State Party periodic report of Turkmenistan to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Turkmenistan will submit in October 2022.
The survey provides a wealth of statistically sound data essential for developing evidence-based policies and programmes, and for monitoring progress towards national goals and global commitments. It is particularly valuable for understanding the barriers and bottlenecks in accessing quality and inclusive services for people with disability and facilitates the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).
Protecting the rights of children with disabilities is an integral part of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is the ﬁrst international treaty Turkmenistan ratified (in 1993) and which explicitly recognizes the rights of children with disabilities. Turkmenistan was also one of the ﬁrst countries to join the UN CRPD in 2008.
Support to people with disabilities is a long-standing priority of the Government of Turkmenistan. In line with the 2015 recommendations for Turkmenistan of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and as a lead UN agency on disability, UNICEF has been supporting the Government to align the national legislation with the CRPD, to strengthen early intervention and inclusive support services for children with disabilities and their families, develop an inclusive education system, and conduct data collection among people with disabilities. The latest survey comes to fulfill an important data need about children and adults with disabilities living in Turkmenistan.
Survey results are available upon request from State Statistics Committee and UNICEF.

Title: FAO brings together cotton experts from Türkiye and Turkmenistan
Content: 26 September 2022
Cotton production plays an important role in the economies of both Türkiye and Turkmenistan. Providing the basic input for the textile industry, cotton contributes to the export revenue of the country and the improvement in livelihoods of thousands of farmers and workers engaged in the cotton value chain.
In order to facilitate dialogue and explore potential collaborations between Türkiye and Turkmenistan, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) facilitated a visit for Turkish cotton experts to Turkmenistan, and in this context, organized a workshop on “Improvement of cotton production and mechanized harvesting in Turkmenistan” in Ashgabat on 8 September 2022.
The workshop took place at the premises of the Turkmen Agricultural University named after S.A. Niyazov and was preceded by technical visits to nearby cotton-related facilities including a machinery park (in Akbugday district), a ginning factory (in Gokdepe district), a textile factory (in Ashgabat) and the Institute of Deserts, Flora and Fauna under the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection of Turkmenistan.
The participants of the workshop included officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection, as well as Merdan Piriyev, Vice-rector for Scientific Work at Turkmen Agricultural University named after S.A. Niyazow, academics, representatives of relevant public institutions, experts from the General Directorate of Agricultural Research and Policies of Türkiye, and experts from FAO.
At the opening of the workshop, academics from the university explained that Turkmenistan now harvests almost all of its cotton by machine, noting that the government procured 1 000 modern harvesters for this purpose from abroad and distributed them to machine parks in 38 districts across the five regions of the country – Ahal, Balkan, Dashoguz, Lebap and Mary. They also stressed that, since 2017, the expansion of mechanized harvesting, with government-trained operators, has provided producers with harvesting services similar to other services such as sowing, fertilization, weeding and pesticide spraying.
Observations from the Turkish delegation
Tijen Ozudogru of the Agricultural Economics and Policy development  Institute in Türkiye stated that “overall planning and support services provided by the government constitute the main reason for the relatively faster introduction of mechanization for harvesting in Turkmenistan”.
Mehmet Demirtas, a cotton expert from the Cotton Research Institute located in Nazilli, Türkiye, indicated that “the number of harvesters cited by the Ministry would be sufficient for machine harvesting in the country, as long as these are used efficiently”.
Serife Balci, cotton breeder at the Cotton Research Institute, explained that harvest mechanization in Türkiye has developed significantly over the last two decades, in the process accumulating significant experience.” Balci further added that “the Cotton institute is willing to share this experience to further improve the efficiency of machine harvesting in Turkmenistan and other countries” in the region.
Huseyin Erdikli, another expert from the same institute, stressed that “there is enormous potential for collaboration particularly on the development of cotton varieties that are more productive and suitable for mechanized harvesting”.
At the closing of the workshop, FAO Agriculture Office Fazil Dusunceli stated that “FAO is very pleased to facilitate this collaboration between the two countries and recognizes that there are numerous areas where further collaboration can be developed not only on cotton improvement and mechanization but also in other areas of agriculture”.
Dusunceli also acknowledged the willingness and enthusiasm shown by both parties to further improve this dialogue and develop future collaborations. He concluded the workshop by thanking the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection of Turkmenistan for hosting the visit and the workshop, and the Turkish delegation for sharing their experience.
The discussions during the visits and the workshop showed that Turkmenistan has made significant progress in recent years in improving cotton production through the transition to machinery harvesting, and in developing its textile industry. It is evident that the country has acquired significant experience in this sector which can benefit other countries. At the same, there is a great scope for further improvement of cotton productivity and efficiency of harvesting by machine harvesters, particularly through improvement in crop production techniques, training and the development of varieties more suitable for harvesting by machinery. In this respect, experts from both Turkmenistan and Türkiye expressed their willingness to collaborate on such areas and invited FAO to facilitate this cooperation.

Title: Over 130 countries heed call to reboot education systems, offering new hope to world’s children for a better future
Content: 19 September 2022
UN Secretary-General issues call to action and vision for way forward at UN Summit
New York, 19 September – With COVID-19 exposing the fault-lines of education systems globally, more than 130 countries committed today to rebooting their education systems and accelerating action to end the learning crisis, at the UN Transforming Education Summit.
The Summit deals with a crisis in education that has seen some 147 million students missing over half of their in-person instruction, since 2020.  In 2021, 244 million children and young people were out of school. The pandemic has harmed the learning of more than 90 % of the world’s children – the largest disruption in history – with half of all countries cutting their education budgets, further deepening the crisis.
It is now estimated that 64.3 % of 10-year-olds are unable to read and understand a simple story. This means that, in a few years, 1 out of 3 persons will be unable to understand this very text, while 840 million young people will leave school in their teens with no qualifications for the workplace of the future. Yet less than half of countries have strategies to help children catch up. If that fails to happen, these students stand to lose $10 trillion in earnings over their working lives.
“Instead of being the great enabler, education is fast becoming the great divider,” stated the UN Secretary-General António Guterres. “The rich have access to the best resources, schools and universities, leading to the best jobs while the poor – especially girls – face huge obstacles to getting the qualifications that could change their lives.”
130 countries commit to prioritize education
The commitments came after 115 national consultations that brought together leaders, teachers, students, civil society and other partners to gather collective recommendations on the most urgent asks.
Nearly half of the countries prioritized measures to address ​learning loss, while a third of countries committed to supporting the psycho-social well-being of both students and teachers.​ Two in three countries ​also referenced measures to offset the direct and indirect costs of education for​ economically vulnerable communities, and 75% of countries underlined the importance of ​gender-sensitive education policies in their commitments.
These statements underscored the role of education in achieving all the Sustainable Development Goals and linkages with the climate crises, conflict and poverty. Measures addressed COVID-19 recovery and getting back on track on the SDGs, while emphasizing the need for innovations in education to prepare the learners of today for a rapidly changing world.
Key initiatives established, including biggest-ever investment in education
The Secretary-General and Gordon Brown, the UN Special Envoy for Global Education, together announced the International Financing Facility for Education (IFFEd), the first-of-its-kind finance facility developed in partnership with the Governments of Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands as well as the Asian and African Development Banks. The IFFEd will provide an initial $2 billion in additional affordable funding for education programs to be disbursed starting in 2023 and could unlock an extra $10 billion of additional financing for education and skills by 2030.
UNESCO and UNICEF launched Gateways to Public Digital Learning, a global multi-partner initiative to create and strengthen inclusive digital learning platforms and content.
A Commitment to Action on Education in Crisis Situations was also revealed, as a commitment by member states and partners to transform education systems to better prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from crises.
Calls to action were also announced on addressing the learning crisis by boosting foundational learning, advancing gender equality through and in education, and a Greening Education Partnership developed in response to the Secretary-General’s call that the climate crisis is ‘a battle for our lives’.
Youth Declaration urges global leaders to act now
On the opening day of the 3-day Summit, youth advocates shared a Youth Declaration with the Secretary-General, laying out their collective recommendations to policymakers on the transformation they want to see, along with their commitments for action on education.
The Youth Declaration is a culmination of a months-long process of consultations, reflecting contributions from almost half a million young people. The Declaration states that “in order to redeem and remake the state of the world, we must first transform the state of education.” The Declaration demands that decision-makers include youth in education-related policy design and implementation, as partners and not just beneficiaries. It also demands investment in youth leadership and in gender-transformative education.
Speaking at the launch, the Secretary-General underscored that if there was one seed to prevent climate change, violent conflict or poverty, it was education.
During the Summit, the Secretary-General was also handed an open call to leaders to expand the right to free education for all children. The call was facilitated by Avaaz and endorsed by UN Messenger of Peace and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Malala Yousafzai, UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and climate activist Vanessa Nakate, and human rights champions.
Secretary-General sets out education vision, paving way to Summit of the Future
The Secretary-General’s Vision Statement released at the Summit lays out a path for education in the 21st century. It serves as an input to negotiations in preparation of the Summit of the Future which will be held at the UN General Assembly in 2024.
The statement insists on continued global mobilization after the success of the Summit, and on Member States and partners keeping the flame of transformation burning. “We must push forward together, with a focus on tangible actions where it matters most: on the ground, in the classroom, and in the experience of teachers and learners alike.”
The SDG 4 High-Level Steering Committee will be responsible for the follow-up process to further shape the future of education and meet 2030 SDG Education targets. The Committee will continue to monitor progress, promote and facilitate knowledge and practice exchange, engage youth, and champion cross-sector and multilateral cooperation.

Title: UN host the National consultations on findings of the Readiness Assessment for Cross-border Paperless Trade in Turkmenistan
Content: 19 September 2022
It was shared that according to ESCAP 2020 study, despite the progress achieved in the recent years in North and Central Asia, the subregion continues to suffer from high transport costs and low transport connectivity levels, shortages in the transport infrastructure coverage and operational weakness in freight transport operations.
The presenters also informed that the relatively low level of digitalization and facilitation of cross-border transport and trade operations add up to existing challenges. Benefits from the successful implementation of cross- border paperless trade are large. In this respect, the Framework Agreement on facilitation of cross-border paperless trade provides promising avenues for the parties to progress together.
“Based on this evidence UN Resident Coordinator’s Office facilitated a transport policy dialogue with the Government experts promoting digitalization of trade as one of the solutions. I am happy to acknowledge high level of evidence uptake for decision-making – in April 2022, the country adopted the Law on joining the Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific”, noted Dmitry Shlapachenko, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
“…It would not be an exaggeration to say that almost all international trade today is facilitated and enabled by digital and communication technologies. In this sense, almost all international trade today is digitalized. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the urgency for governments and businesses to ramp up digitalization to better facilitate trade and to ensure smoother movement of goods, especially essential and critical goods. In this regard, accelerating the implementation of trade facilitation measures and digitalizing procedures is more crucial than ever to make trade more resilient and inclusive” noted Rupa Chanda, Director, Trade, Investment and Innovation Division, ESCAP.
Participants of the national consultation agreed to further exchange ideas of how to better implement the recommendations of the Readiness Assessment for Cross-border Paperless Trade in Turkmenistan report according to the proposed Action Plan.

Title: UNODC and partners organized a three-day foundation course on investigations of the terrorism financing in Turkmenistan
Content: 13 September 2022
“Turkmenistan successfully solves the security issues, in accordance with the  recommendations of Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED) received by the government of the country on the implementation of measures aimed at strengthening the response of law enforcement agencies and other government structures related to countering the threats of terrorism and extremism. Thus, actively supporting the efforts of the world community in the fight against international terrorism, Turkmenistan has become a party to the relevant international conventions and protocols and is taking all necessary measures to implement the resolutions of the UN Security Council. These measures are set out in the national strategy of Turkmenistan on preventing violent extremism and countering terrorism for 2020-2024, as well as the National Action Plan for 2021-2024, aimed at implementing the above strategy. In this regard, I would like to thank our partners for the fruitful cooperation in the field of CFT, as well as in contributing to the implementation of the national policies and strategies in this area”,- emphasized Mr. Nurmammed Seyitliev, representative from the Ministry of Finance and Economy of Turkmenistan.
The event aimed at supporting Turkmenistan in strengthening its countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) framework and the capacities of the national practitioners working in this field. Terrorist financing encompasses the means and methods used by terrorist organizations to finance their activities. This money can come from both legitimate and illicit sources. Therefore, CFT is a highly complex endeavor that involves many different actors.
The training course brought together over 16 representatives of the Financial Intelligence Service, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of National Security, Ministry of Finance and Economy, and the Prosecutor General's Office of Turkmenistan.
The main goal of the training was to support enhancing the participants’ knowledge and professional skills to improve the efficiency of interagency cooperation in Turkmenistan in accordance with international best practices, as well as improve the country’s national capacity to counter the financing of terrorism and implement the recommendations of the Eurasian group on combating money laundering and financing of terrorism (EAG) mutual assessment for compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards, in accordance with UN instruments and international norms.
Mr. Aliaksandr Vadziany, UNODC Regional Advisor on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism, noted: “We have developed a unique course on the investigation of terrorist financing cases based on the needs of our national partners and this integrated approach shall be most effective in the current context. Of course, during the training we will not only  talk about the activities of the financial intelligence units, but also discuss proper interaction and joint activities between financial intelligence, law enforcement and judiciary agencies to counter financing of terrorism .”
“Countering the financing of terrorism is one of the key priorities for UNOCT, not only at the international but also at the regional and national level. We work on providing comprehensive and coordinated support together with our partners, to each country in Central Asia, including Turkmenistan, in this matter,” – said Ms. Karina Timsina, UNOCT Regional Coordination Officer.
At the end of the training course, the participants got acquainted with alternated theoretical presentations on such topics as the role of financial intelligence units and the importance of suspicious transaction reports, and practical exercises that proposed the realization of short financial investigations or the analysis of case studies that required active participation and the sharing of experiences and opinions of the representatives of the various state bodies, as well as working in groups.

Title: TikTok influencers from Central Asia call for the elimination of gender stereotypes in the society
Content: 08 September 2022
The videos were created within the Regional Program “Spotlight Initiative” with support of IDEA Central Asia.
The aim of the Regional Program “Spotlight Initiative” is to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls. In their videos, popular tiktokers draw attention to the most pressing issues related to gender stereotyping and violence common to the entire region. Influencers encourage their audience not to remain indifferent to violence and combat with discrimination. All videos are available on pages of tiktokers.
“I wanted to support this initiative, as problem of gender-based violence is very relevant in our region. I have about 4 million followers on Tik Tok and I think it's very responsible to be able to speak to such a large audience. Social networks are important tool in our time, and a great platform from which one can and should talk about such things. It's great that the Spotlight Initiative and IDEA Central Asia are finding such creative ways to draw attention to the issue of harassment,” said Alan Dyusheev (@stengiee), a blogger from Kyrgyzstan.
Every day, the videos of tiktokers are gaining more and more views and stir discussions among users in the comments, which indicates the urgency of the problem in the Central Asian region.
“Response to and prevention of gender-based violence are one of the most important components in UNFPA mandate. Violence against women and girls is one of the most prevalent human rights violations in the world, and it knows no social, economic or national boundaries. We believe that the videos that were prepared by influencers from Central Asia will not only raise awareness and stir discussion on these important issues but also have their contribution to the change of social norms,”  said Ronnie Lindstrom, UNFPA Representative in Kazakhstan and Country Director for Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan.
The impact of violence on women and girls ranges from immediate to long-term effects on physical, sexual and mental health. As a result it provokes huge personal, social and economic costs around the world, from increased health care and legal costs to reduced productivity and impact on the well-being of the next generation. Gender equality and the empowerment of women are central to achieving full human potential and sustainable development, and the elimination of violence against women is an essential component.
Info note:
The Spotlight Initiative is a global initiative of the United Nations which has received generous support from the European Union. Its aim is to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls.
The Spotlight Initiative Regional Programme for Central Asia and Afghanistan is fostering legal reforms, strengthening capacities of the respective institutions and women’s movements, promoting gender-equitable attitudes, and enhancing systems for collecting data on violence against women and girls.
The Spotlight Regional Programme partners with a broad range of actors, including civil society, donors, practitioners, academia, and media, to facilitate the elimination of harmful practices and advocate further gender transformation in the region.

Content: 06 September 2022
The meeting served as a forum to provide an update on post-COP26 activities and discuss preparations for the upcoming COP27 Climate Summit to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt in November 2022.
“The importance of this series of meetings cannot be underestimated. Overcoming the climate crisis requires strong partnerships and consolidated actions,” – noted Ms. Narine Sahakyan, UNDP Resident Representative in Turkmenistan. “Many countries, including Turkmenistan, are increasingly including adaptation priorities in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to demonstrate their commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement. UNDP stands ready to join hands with other development partners to support the country in addressing climate change issues and achieving its climate goals.”
“It is so important that we all work together to tackle the causes and effects of climate change and this group is a way of bringing all of us together to do just that – Government, Embassies, the UN and implementers,” - said Ms. Lucia Wilde, British Ambassador to Turkmenistan. “We discussed preparations for COP27, the Government of Turkmenistan’s new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and methane emissions among other subjects. I look forward to continuing our excellent cooperation in the lead-up to COP27”.
“UN agencies support the implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy and the Aral Sea Action Plan and continue to raise public awareness of the climate change emergency,” – said Mr. Dmitry Shlapachenko, UN Resident coordinator in Turkmenistan during the meeting. “Many UN agencies are involved in enhancing climate education, as this will be critical for the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of national climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.”

Title: Turkmenistan releases first-ever national survey on health and status of a woman in the family
Content: 26 August 2022
“I congratulate the Government of Turkmenistan on the release of the survey,” said Dmitry Shlapachenko, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
“Reliable and accessible data and statistics on gender equality are key for fully implementing and monitoring progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. Evidence suggests that unless we end gender-based violence, many of the Sustainable Development Goals will not be achievable.”
The Health and Status of a Woman in the Family Survey measured physical, sexual, emotional and economic violence, as well as controlling behavior within family relations. The findings revealed that one in six women in the country, or 16 per cent, have experienced some form of abuse by an intimate partner, and one in eight, or 12 per cent, have been exposed to physical or sexual violence.
The survey also explores the impact of violence on women’s health and children’s well-being, showing that the experience of abuse in a woman’s life is correlated with an increased prevalence of specific health problems and negative reproductive health outcomes.
It also found that women who experience domestic violence rarely reach out for help, confirming the 2019 Turkmenistan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey finding that a majority of women (58%) accept and justify intimate partner violence.
The survey data is expected to be used to monitor and accelerate national progress on Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality and to identify strategies for the prevention of, and response to, gender-based violence at various levels, in line with the National Action Plan on Gender Equality for 2021-2025.
Turkmenistan serves as a member of the Commission on the Status of Women this year, and recently submitted its sixth periodic report to the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Finalizing and releasing the survey data was one of the key recommendations included in the Committee’s Concluding Observations.
The Government of Turkmenistan is expected to develop a roadmap on the prevention of, and response to, gender-based violence. including plans for legislation and for implementing the remaining CEDAW Committee recommendations.
“UNFPA stands ready to continue its support to the Government to ensure that every woman and every girl in Turkmenistan can live a life free of violence, in line with the global development agenda and the commitment made by Turkmenistan at the 2019 Nairobi Summit,” said Ayna Seyitliyeva, UNFPA Head of Office in Turkmenistan.
“We will prioritize support for introducing a multisectoral response system to gender-based violence, improving legislation, and promoting enabling gender norms with local communities in partnership with the UN Country Team and international development partners.”
The survey was funded by the Government and conducted with the support of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, as well as support from the European Union and the British Embassy in Turkmenistan.

Education needs mobilization of all government and non-government agencies contributing to the achievement of SDG 4 and coordination of their work by the Government to accelerate the implementation of the SDG 4 agenda” noted Dmitry Shlapachenko, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
The Summit will be an integral part and critical milestone in the roadmap of the renewed Global Cooperation Mechanism (GCM) for education.

Title: World set to reach 8 billion people on 15 November 2022
Content: 10 July 2022
The global population is projected to reach 8 billion on 15 November 2022, according to the World Population Prospects 2022, released today by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Reaching this milestone is both a cause for celebration and a clarion call for humanity to find solutions to the challenges we face.
For the first time in history, we are seeing extreme diversity in the mean age of countries and the fertility rates of populations. While the populations of a growing number of countries are ageing and about 60 per cent of the world’s population live in countries with low fertility, other countries have huge youth populations and keep growing apace.
Such diversity in population dynamics requires much more granular data for better and smarter policies. But focus should be on people, not population. In today’s world, the strength of a country is not measured in numbers, but in the education, skills and talents of its population.
In light of this, Turkmenistan is well positioned to seize the momentum of obtaining the comprehensive population data as the country prepares to hold the Population and Housing Census from 17 to 27 December 2022.  The upcoming census will provide a unique opportunity for Turkmenistan to generate, disseminate and use disaggregated data for domestic strategic planning and policy development.
Detailed census data will allow the Government to better assess the needs of various population groups, act on the demographic shifts, analyze their impact and develop a comprehensive population and social policies aimed at ensuring prosperity and well-being for all.
UNFPA is offering technical and advisory support to Turkmenistan and all countries in the region in their efforts to tackle the effects of shifting demographics through a regional Demographic Resilience programme.  Last year the member states in Eastern Europe and Central Asia launched a Decade of Demographic Resilience at a Ministerial Conference in Sofia in December 2021 to galvanize action for enabling countries to thrive in a world of shifting demographics.
Within the Decade of Demographic Resilience and as we approach November 2022, UNFPA will work with our partners and communities to harness the power of 8 billion as part of our mission to achieve the goals set out in the ICPD Programme of Action back in 1994. By protecting the rights and choices of all people to live healthy, empowered lives, humanity holds the key to unleashing the unlimited potential of people around the world to address the challenges threatening their societies and the global problems imperiling us all.
“This is a success story, not a doomsday scenario. Our world, despite its challenges, is one where higher shares of people are educated and live healthier lives than at any previous point in history,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem about the world of 8 billion. “Focusing exclusively on population totals and growth rates misses the point – and often leads to coercive and counter-productive measures and the erosion of human rights. In fact, people are the solution, not the problem. Experience shows that investing in people, in their rights and choices, is the path to peaceful, prosperous and sustainable societies.”
This moment calls for both vision and action. Governments can pursue people-centered population policies with sexual and reproductive health and rights at their core. The private sector can develop creative solutions, harnessing the power of innovation and technology for the global good. Artists and creative people around the world can apply their ingenuity and talent to inspire us and help us imagine the promise that a world of 8 billion people offers.
Collectively, we represent infinite possibilities for action, growth and change. Creating a more just and sustainable world requires urging the world forward towards equal rights and opportunities for one - and for all.

Title: Promoting youth empowerment and accountability through upstreaming community-based initiatives
Content: 04 July 2022
More than 80 youth volunteers proposed projects that potentially could help reduce vulnerabilities and alleviate community, health, personal and environmental insecurities in their velayats. Four youth-led projects will promote solidarity with older persons and advocate for the intergenerational dialogue; healthy lifestyle using the “peer-to-peer” approach among the at-risk youth; awareness raising campaigns among the potential migrants and their families; and promote environmental awareness among the teachers and schoolchildren.  The projects will kick-off in August and will be run by youth volunteers with the support of the local authorities until the end of the year.
Volunteers were nominated by the Ministry of Sport and Youth Policy, Ministry of Education, Youth Organization, Red Crescent, CSO “Beyik Eyam” and others. During the two-day workshop, youth leaders were provided with a set of project management tools to develop community-based initiatives according to the Human Security and Results-Based Management approaches (e.g., SMART criteria, root cause analysis, vision statement and etc.)
Recognizing the importance of fostering the dialogue between the youth and local authorities for building trust and creating environment promoting sustainable development, the workshop concluded with volunteers presenting their community-based initiatives to the Local Committee members. Received feedback and ideas will be further incorporated to ensure long-term progress of the results gained under the Joint Programme.

It also helps establish approaches focused on comprehensive support for and maintaining the integrity of the family, as presented in the new Law on Social Services.
Finally, the participants discussed the next steps to ensure the sustainability of the Joint Programme. The following suggestions were discussed for consideration:
• to open the position of a social worker in each etrap of the country in order to increase the efficiency of the work of social workers at the etrap level;
• the gradual deployment of primary and specialized social services in all regions of the country that will help strengthen the social protection system by providing targeted support to persons with disabilities, large families, single elderly people, children left without parental care, women exposed to gender violence, young people at risk and other vulnerable groups;
• to involve non-government social service providers and to consider the introduction of the state social contracting mechanism to meet the needs of all those in need of specialized services at the regional and local levels,
• to launch a new specialty in the area of social work at the undergraduate level, as well as short-term courses for continuous professional development of social work specialists.
The Joint Programme “Improving the system of social protection through the introduction of inclusive quality community-based social services”, funded by the Joint SDG Fund, is being implemented by the partnering UN agencies, namely, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, and UNODC and Government of Turkmenistan.

Title: Progress in SDG implementation is reviewed in Turkmenistan
Content: 23 June 2022
The participants at the level of Deputy Ministers and experts of line ministries were introduced to Turkmenistan’s ranking in the international SDG data bases and to the results of the 2022 national SDG midterm review, including the gap analysis and recommendations. These were presented by Mr. Marjan Petreski, an international consultant, who highlighted that Turkmenistan could easily be ranked higher if data on indicators were openly available. There is still a lot of work to do to ensure availability of baselines and targets, more active reporting to global databases, and increase the capacity of ministries and departments for high-quality reporting on the SDGs.
“Only reliable and, most importantly, accessible data can effectively track progress towards the achievement of the SDGs. The availability of reliable data is an important prerequisite for understanding the impact of external shocks, including the global pandemic, military conflict in Eastern Europe, on the macroeconomic situation, as well as on various population groups. It will also help understand the causes of existing vulnerabilities so that targeted measures are taken to ensure that no one is left behind,” noted the Dmitry Shlapachenko, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
The State Statistics Committee of Turkmenistan reported on the stages of operationalization of the National SDG database, including gradual transition to the online version. The national SDG database functions as a convenient tool for collecting and monitoring data and evaluating results for planning and tracking progress towards the achievement of the SDGs.
The Ministry of Finance and Economy presented the Annual Report of the Joint UN-Government Expert Group on SDG Financing 2021 and also the changes to the national SDG matrix. He also noted the country's commitment to improving SDG financing and the successful work of the Joint UN-Government Expert Group on SDG Financing towards establishment of the Integrated National Financing Framework. One of the steps in this process will be the Development Finance Assessment, being currently carried out with support of UNDP experts, the Joint Experts Group and the Office of the Resident Coordinator.
In the course of the meeting, the members of the national SDG Working Group supported the proposal to create a National Action Plan for the development of nationalized SDG indicators, for which Turkmenistan does not submit reporting to global databases. This Plan should outline specific activities for each national indicator, as well as indicate the responsible national departments. It can be implemented within 1-3 years depending on the complexity of the indicator methodology.

Title: Turkmenistan makes another step forward in global climate action
Content: 16 May 2022
The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) of Turkmenistan demonstrates the country's ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the commitments under the Paris Agreement and in support of global efforts to tackle climate change.
This strategic national document in the field of climate change, developed by the Government of Turkmenistan in close collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), sets out a plan to prevent dangerous climate change, with the long-term goal of keeping average global temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and attempting to limit the temperature increase to 1.5° to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
The planned reduction of emissions in the new NDC is a confirmation of the ambitious goal of Turkmenistan, which intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2030. This goal remains the highest of all possible ambitions that Turkmenistan can achieve by implementing measures to reduce GHG emissions in such sectors as energy, transport, agriculture, industrial processes, and product use (IPPU), waste, as well as by using co-mitigation benefits from adaptation measures to climate change.
The UNDP Country Office supported the development of updated NDC and will make its efforts  to achieve the goals set out in the presented NDC and its national priorities for the implementation of integrated low-carbon and climate-resilient solutions to join the global efforts on saving the planet.
“The adoption of the Nationally Determined Contributions by Turkmenistan demonstrates country's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement,” – noted Ms. Narine Sahakyan, UNDP Resident Representative in Turkmenistan. “UNDP stands ready to continue providing global expertise and technical support to ensure effective implementation of country’s NDCs to address the challenges of climate change”.
***
NDC stands for Nationally Determined Contributions and represent the targets that each country has set to join the global efforts in tackling climate change, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and plans to adapt to the challenges of a changing climate.
These targets were established following the Paris Agreement on Climate Change - the first legally binding international treaty on climate change, which was signed by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris on 12 December, 2015 and entered into force on 4 November, 2016.
Every five years, countries submit new and more ambitious targets, playing their part in helping the world achieve global goals.
The first NDC of Turkmenistan was submitted to the UNFCCC in October 2016.
Turkmenistan ratified the UNFCCC in 1995 and the Paris Agreement in 2016 and actively takes part in international efforts to combat climate change.

Title: The Central Asian Regional Consultation on Human Rights and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Integration of Human Rights Recommendations into SDG Implementation Mechanisms in Central Asia
Content: 25 April 2022
Members of the Working Group of the Interdepartmental Commission on Ensuring the Implementation of Turkmenistan’s International Obligations on Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law and the Working Group on the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Turkmenistan took part in this event and shared experience and best practices with partners from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the format of a teleconference. The event brought together over 70 representatives from various Government agencies and civil society from five Central Asian countries representing national institutions responsible for monitoring and reporting on SDGs and human rights and collecting and analyzing SDG and human rights data. In addition, the international human rights experts from UNDP, OHCHR and the Danish Institute for Human Rights also participated in the event.
The goal of the consultations was to provide a platform for all Central Asian participants to share experiences in linking human rights recommendations to the SDGs and their implementation practices in national monitoring, implementation, and oversight processes towards the achievement of the SDGs. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda are transformative frameworks for development because they are based on human rights. More than 90 percent of the SDGs and targets are aligned with human rights commitments.
The international expert, Thomas Baranovas, conducted an Analysis “Mapping of Integrating Human Rights into the SDG Planning & Reporting Processes in Central Asian Countries”, and presented this analysis to the participants of the event for further discussions in the country groups. Mr. Baranovas noted that the next step is a closer relationship between these two processes on the basis of mutual benefit. A good example of this is the inclusion of a separate section on Sustainable Development Goals into the National Action Plan for Human Rights in Turkmenistan for 2021-2025.
The participants were also introduced to the online tools of OHCHR and the Danish Institute for Human Rights that assist countries in establishing the links between human rights and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and enabling rapid examination of recommendations by international human rights monitoring bodies concerning the implementation of the SDGs in specific countries. The meeting participants expressed their interest in the continued regional exchange through this platform, providing know-how and capacity building to respective institutions working on integrating human rights into national SDG mechanisms in Central Asian countries.

Title: UN-Turkmenistan Joint Programme on “Empowering and Engaging the Youth to Mitigate the Multi-Dimensional Threats of the Global Pandemic” enhances the skills of professionals working with young people and their families
Content: 25 April 2022
In the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by a massive 25%, according to a scientific brief released by the WHO on 2 March 2022. One major explanation for the increase is the unprecedented stress caused by the social isolation resulting from the pandemic. Linked to this were constraints on people’s ability to work, seek support and engage in their communities. Loneliness, fear of infection, suffering and death for oneself and for loved ones, grief after bereavement and financial worries have also all been cited as stressors leading to anxiety and depression. Among youth, exhaustion has been a major trigger for suicidal thinking.
In the context of a pandemic, mental health disorders are considered as a consequence of long-term isolation, disconnection, destruction of habitual ties, loss of educational and labor possibilities, travel limitation, leading to a threat to personal and public safety.
In this regard, the Program Office of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Turkmenistan, under the overall guidance of the UNODC Headquarters (Vienna), decided to address the low accessibility of psychological services in the country and to implement the evidence-based "Strong Family" Programme within the framework of the HSTF Joint Programme (JP) on "Empowering and engaging the youth to mitigate multidimensional threats of the global pandemic” and has organized an overview workshop in the programme pilot sites (Dashoguz and Lebap velayats) for 20 young activists, selected by the Ministry of Sports and Youth Policy of Turkmenistan, from April 25 to 27, 2022.
The aim of the workshop was to advance the understanding of the human security concept and its multi-dimensional treats by promoting life-skills, positive thinking, and strengthening the ability of the workshop participants to promote the programme in their community, as well as in developing a community initiative for the further program implementation.
The participants learned about the basic principles of family communication and behaviour, and stress management. They were convinced of the importance of a good mental state and mood, positive emotions and a strong bond with family and friends to help them find the strength to overcome all the adversities and difficulties associated with COVID-19 prevention measures.
The overview workshop was conducted by previously trained facilitators with experience of working under the Strong Families Programme within the Joint Programme on Social Services in 2021-2022.
It is expected that, the participants will further contribute to piloting of the "Strong Family" programme at the local level targeting young people at risk and vulnerable families with problematic substance users, as well as for juveniles with a history of conflict with the law, assist in selection of families and co-facilitation of activities.
UNODC, as a partner of the Joint Programme, develops and implements initiatives to apply a human security approach to community development in the areas of personal, community and health security.
The overview workshop has been conducted with financial support of the USAID Governance support programme.

Title: UNHCR commends efforts of Turkmenistan and other Central Asian states to end statelessness
Content: 02 March 2022
“The UN Refugee Agency appreciates the tremendous efforts made by the Governments, authorities, civil society, and people of Central Asia in addressing problems of statelessness. This constitutes tangible progress towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - leaving no one behind. The prevention of statelessness and the protection of stateless persons greatly contribute to international peace, security, development, and the prevention of forced displacement,” said Mr. Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia.
Turkmenistan enacted Statelessness Determination Procedures (SDPs) which allow stateless persons to obtain legal status and thus access to basic human rights. Through enaction of SDPs Turkmenistan fulfilled one of the pledges formulated at the High-Level Segment on Statelessness in 2019.
In 2021, Uzbekistan, the country with the largest known statelessness population in Central Asia, reduced statelessness almost by half, granting or confirming citizenship to 33,000 out of 70,000 registered stateless person. This became possible thanks to provisions of  the new Citizenship Law adopted in 2020, and further amendments to it, enacted in 2021.
As a result of activities implemented by Tajikistan in 2021 to reduce statelessness, over 4,000 persons received identity documents. Additionally, almost 4,000 stateless persons were identified to be provided with legal assistance.
Since the autumn of 2020, Kazakhstan has been running a national statelessness identification campaign aimed at mapping and resolving cases of statelessness. By end 2021, as a result of this campaign, close to 7,300 persons  with undetermined nationality were identified, of whom more than 4,100 were assisted to confirm the nationality of Kazakhstan, while close to 2,000 were documented as de jure stateless.
UNHCR continues supporting Government of Kyrgyzstan efforts to implement the four pledges it contributed to the 2019 High Level Segment, consolidating the success of the Kyrgyz Republic in resolving all known cases of statelessness in 2019.
The UN Refugee Agency also supports the considerations of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to join Turkmenistan and a gowing number of states world-wide in becoming parties to both Statelessness Conventions.
Since 2014, when the #IBelong campaign to eradicate statelessness globally by 2024 was launched, more than 163,000 cases of statelessness have been resolved in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. As of 31 December 2021, over 56,000 stateless persons are known in Central Asia, still requiring a nationality, though the actual extent of statelessness is believed to be higher.

The participants, including the Deputy Ministers of the national entities comprising the Interagency Working Group, heads of UN entities – members of the UN Country Team in Turkmenistan, the Deputy Representative of the EU delegation in Turkmenistan, national experts and UN specialists on DRR issues, discussed the role and functions of the Interagency Working Group, functioning as the National Platform for DRR, in facilitating the exchange of information, creating synergies between national and international actors in DRR, implementing the State Program, and rationalizing resources required to mainstream DRR into development policies, planning and programmes.
The UN Country Team expressed its support to the National Platform, and stressed the importance of collaboration under its thematic pillars, which were proposed by the UNDRR Central Asia Initiative, supported by the European Union:
Mr. Dovran Durdyev, Deputy Minister of Defence and Head of the Main Directorate of Civil Defence and Rescue Operations, highlighted that “the Interagency Working Group for Disaster Risk Reduction will contribute to the creation of solid foundation for the coordinated cooperation on matters of disaster risk reduction, preparedness and emergency response”.
“The UN in Turkmenistan highly appreciates the commitment of the Government to improve the system of disaster risk management, which is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of common efforts in this area”, emphasized Mr. Dmytro Shlapachenko, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
Deputy Head of Mission of the EU Delegation to Turkmenistan, Ms. Renata Wrobel, said: “The EU believes that a robust understanding of disaster risks is the first step towards addressing risks effectively and framing risk management. The EU Delegation stands ready to support the newly established Interagency Working Group for disaster risk reduction through the Central Asia Programme.”
Chief of UNDRR Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia, Mr. Octavian Bivol underlined that “National Platforms for DRR are a crucial mechanism for effective coordination and coherent implementation of DRR strategies, plans and actions across national and regional levels”.
The participants also reviewed the interlinkages between the principles of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, activities of the National Programme for Realization of the State Policy in Civil Defence and Rescue Operations and the provisions of the Memoranda of Understanding between the Government of Turkmenistan and the United Nations on cooperation in emergency preparedness and response, and the climate change mitigation and adaptation signed in 2019 and 2021 respectively.
The meeting agreed that the UN-Government experts would discuss specific issues of the National Sendai Platform rollout and inter-sectoral coordination during the UNDRR-led workshop on 23 February 2022.
Background information
The EU-funded project “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”, implemented by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), aims to support countries in the region to implement the Sendai Framework priorities. The project supports strengthening regional coordination, development of a regional DRR strategy, national disaster loss accounting systems, and community level disaster risk reduction. At the local level, the project supports development of disaster resilience strategies for capital cities. The EU has committed EUR 3,750,000 for the three-year implementation of this project.
The National Platform for DRR is a multi-stakeholder national mechanism that will coordinate actions on risk reduction. The Platform is based on a set of principles, including national ownership and leadership of the DRR process. The collaboration between UNDRR and the Government of Turkmenistan is guided by the State Programme for implementation of primary areas of state policy in the field of civil defence for 2019–2030 (approved by the Decree of the President of Turkmenistan #1156, dated 1 March 2019, and recognized as the National Strategy on Disaster Risk Reduction) The Action Plan for the implementation of the State Programme includes disaster preparedness, response, mitigation and prevention activities.

Title: Central Asian governments discuss the integration of gender equality into climate change policies
Content: 15 February 2022
This year the sixty-sixth session of the CSW will take up the theme “Achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the context of climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes”.
During the online consultations, participants discussed climate change issues and its impact on women and girls in the region; exchanged best practices in the implementation of women-led projects that mitigate climate impacts and developed recommendations for concrete action on climate change, the environment and disaster risk reduction, which factor in gender equality and women’s active leadership and participation.
The consultations brought together representatives of national gender machineries, environmental management and disaster risk reduction institutions, members of parliaments, civil society organizations and youth representatives, gender experts, UNFCCC national coordinators, as well as research and analytical centers. The consultations were also attended by regional bodies and mechanisms - the Central Asian Women's Dialogue, the Center for Emergency Situations and Disaster Risk Reduction for Central Asia.
Climate change has a huge impact on Central Asia, a region highly vulnerable to natural disasters such as droughts, floods, earthquakes and landslides. According to the World Bank, natural disasters cost Central Asia $10 billion a year, affecting 3 million people in the region every year.[1]
As natural disasters continue to disrupt and threaten people's lives and well-being and undermine regional economic gains, it is clear that these risks disproportionately affect women and girls, who are the main providers of food, water and energy. “Central Asia cannot afford to miss out on the potential of women and girls in shaping solutions to the global climate change crisis. We need to recognize, value, support and fund their engagement and participation at all levels,” said Alia El-Yassir, UN Women Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia.
Gender norms and power structures play a critical role in how the challenges of climate change affect women and men differently. Women should be an integral part of the process of developing solutions aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change. Thus, empowering women to speak up, act and take leadership roles is a prerequisite for resilience, sustainable development and the achievement of gender equality and respect for human rights.
Gender issues and sex-disaggregated data on the impacts of climate change are missing from national policies on the environment, climate change and disaster risk reduction, including in countries prone to disasters.
Due to existing inequalities, as well as gendered roles and expectations, women and girls in the region have fewer resources to adapt to changing conditions:
The event aims to support Central Asian countries in preparing for the consultations of the sixty-sixth session of the CSW and discuss recommendations for life-changing actions on climate change, the environment and disaster risk reduction.
As a result, the UN Women Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia will develop a short summary of the discussions.

Title: The Annual Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust
Content: 27 January 2022
The event gathered representatives of the diplomatic corps, UN Agencies, regional organizations, representative of Jewish families in Turkmenistan, and the general public. It aimed at instilling the memory of the tragedy of the Holocaust in future generations to prevent genocide from occurring again.
“Holocaust commemoration and education is a global imperative in the third decade of the 21st century. The writing of history and the act of remembering brings dignity and justice to those whom the perpetrators of the Holocaust intended to obliterate”, noted Mr. Dmitry Shlapachenko, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
“The memory of descendants about that terrible war, about life and death, about mass graves is indestructible in the hearts of mankind, and these are not simple words that burn my heart”, shared Ms. Nelli Azriel, a representative of Jewish Families in Turkmenistan.
The discussion was led by Ms. Sharon Buenos, Global Director of Zikaron BaSalon - Memories in the Living Room” Initiative.
The attending guests noted that such activities draw attention to the actions taken by Holocaust survivors in the immediate years following the devastation and brutality of the Holocaust, to reclaim their history, their cultural heritage and traditions, and their dignity.
“We have a duty to all victims and survivors to never forget. At a time when Antisemitism is on the rise and Holocaust denial rampant, on 20 January 2022, Israel and Germany led the successful adoption of a UN Resolution on Holocaust Denial and Distortion. It is our responsibility to preserve and protect the historical facts of the Holocaust” added Ms. Beth-Eden Kite, Ambassador Designate of Israel to Turkmenistan concluding the meeting.

Title: Training on collection of gender-disaggregated data for trade policy was held in Ashgabat
Content: 27 December 2021
In this regard, on 21-22 December the EU-funded project Ready4Trade Central Asia conducted a two-day training on collection of gender-disaggregated data for trade policy for representatives of government organizations and private sector. In total, 24 participants were in attendance, including representatives from Ministry of Finance and Economy, Ministry of Trade and Foreign Economic Relations, Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population, State Customs Service, State Statistics Committee, and the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.
The main objectives of the training included the role and influence of women on international trade, understanding how trade tariffs affect the increase in imports, and the significance of statistics for determining strategic decisions regarding the improvement of the terms of trade, in particular for women. The training program was composed of four modules and enriched with group exercises, examples, and discussions.
Ms. Renata Wrobel, Deputy Head of the Delegation of the EU to Turkmenistan: “Understanding the gender-based challenges that women face in trade are particularly important to ensure equal access to markets, fair competition and healthy business environment. Based on the gender mainstreaming concept, this is relevant not only to women, there are issues that men face as well, and it will also be part of promotion of the gender equality in trade. This approach in policy making helps to avoid the creation or reinforcement of inequalities. Since trade and business have no face, it is vital to ensure that the newly adopted policies create equal opportunities for all. Access to data and the ability to use it are essential for innovation and growth. Data-driven innovation can bring major and concrete benefits, such as better policymaking and upgrading public services”.
During the training, the participants discussed the most important issues, and also shared their experience. The ITC representatives talked about the trade facilitation and trade-related infrastructure for women, the economic contribution of women, indicators for defining and collecting gender statistics as well as talked about the institutions and organizations that should be involved in the collection of gender-disaggregated data and possible distribution of roles and responsibilities and the creation of multi-stakeholder coordination platforms.
The ITC experts noted that globally, the number of barriers to business for women has decreased, which has contributed to the growth of companies owned by women. A business led by women tends to start with a smaller volume, so it grows faster while, at the same time, most of the companies headed by women employ fewer than 10 people. It was also noted that the correct gender distribution of skills is very important, and may help to significantly increase labor efficiency.
The Ready4Trade Central Asia project is a joint initiative of the European Union and the International Trade Centre. Its aim is to contribute to the overall sustainable and inclusive economic development of Central Asia by boosting intra-regional and international trade in the region. Beneficiaries of the Ready4Trade Central Asia project include governments, small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular women-led enterprises, and Business Support Organizations. The project operates in 5 countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

A series of technical consultations involving airlines and other partners were also held in the country, which strengthened national capacities to plan and implement the API implementation process. Two groups of specialists from the intergovernmental agencies had study tours to a number of European countries to study the international experience of API implementation process. The most significant is the fact that during the project implementation, a group of experts was created, which formed the basis of the National Working Group on the implementation of the API”, - Z. Hajiyev stressed during his speech.
This round table is a concluding event implemented in the framework of the API regional project. The deputies of the relevant ministries who took part in the round table also expressed their interests and recommendations on further cooperation in the implementation of the API system in Turkmenistan.
Deputy Chairman of the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan, Mr. Sahy Imamberdiev, noted the importance of continuing cooperation with IOM in the implementation of API in Turkmenistan in such areas as studying the experience of developing roadmaps for the implementation of API.
Azat Atajanov, Head of IOM office in Turkmenistan, noted that: “Within the framework of this project, sufficient national capacity has been created in Turkmenistan to initiate the concrete plans in the API implementation process. API project can be considered as a potential candidate for co-financing project with the Government of Turkmenistan.

Title: Turkmenistan joins the world to commemorate 75 years of UNICEF
Content: 12 December 2021
Around the world, presidents, ministers, government officials, and UNICEF representatives united with children and young people to commemorate the 75th anniversary. UNICEF Turkmenistan took part in celebrations by conducting various activities and joining a series of global initiatives with the participation of the Government, general population, former and current UNICEF team members, and youth.
On December 11th, right on its birthday and on the eve of International Neutrality Day, UNICEF has signed thirteen workplans and one Memorandum of Understanding with fourteen national partners for 2022. Under the signed workplans UNICEF will expand the scope of cooperation with the Government of Turkmenistan to achieve better results for children and families, taking into consideration the expected results of the Country Programme for the period of 2021-2025.
UNICEF signed workplans with the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population, Mejlis Milli Gengesh, Institute of State, Law and Democracy, Ombudsperson’s Office, State Statistics Committee, Ministry of Adalat, State Committee for Television, Radio Broadcasting and Cinematography, Women’s Union, Ministry of Finance and Economy, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Sport and Youth Policy, and General Prosecutor’s Office, and Memorandum of Understanding with Ministry of Health and medical industry.
“It is no coincidence that we signed the workplans on the 75th birthday of UNICEF and on the eve of International Neutrality Day. UNICEF was one of the first UN agencies to work in newly Independent Turkmenistan, and thirty years later we remain committed to working together to ensure that children in Turkmenistan enjoy their rights and have the best future,” says Mohammad Fayyazi, UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan.
As a part of the celebration of UNICEF 75th Anniversary Turkmenistan also joined the global #GoBlue campaign by illuminating “Berkarar” shopping and entertainment center in blue, alongside many landmarks around the world such as Eiffel Tower in Paris, Victoria Falls bridge in Zimbabwe, Empire State Building in New York and many more. In addition, residents of Ashgabat and velayats were able to feel the celebratory spirit by seeing the UNICEF anniversary logo projected on big screens across the country. This initiative aimed at marking UNICEF’s 75 years of unstoppable work for every child in the world and showcasing the support of the Government of Turkmenistan to the noble mandate of UNICEF.

Masisi, the Minister for International Development Cooperation of Sweden Matilda Elisabeth Ernkrans, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and education advocate Muzoon Almellehan, representatives of more than 200 organizations across businesses, philanthropy, civil society, and children and young people.
Being one of the first UN agencies to operate in the country, UNICEF in Turkmenistan has almost thirty years of great accomplishments and results. To look back at this exciting journey, UNICEF Country Office launched a social media campaign “UNICEF in the retrospective” and relived the history of UNICEF’s work in Turkmenistan since 1994. Until the end of this year, social media accounts of UNICEF Turkmenistan will post quotes and stories from current and former staff, country Representatives, and Deputy Representatives as well as national partners, to share the wishes and aspirations of people who work to build a better world for children.

Title: UN stresses importance of mulitlateralism and dialogue to promote culture of peace and trust
Content: 12 December 2021
The event is devoted to the International Day of Neutrality and is part of marking the International Day of Peace and Trust. The Conference, which started with the high-level plenary session opened by the President of Turkmenistan, has gathered the high-level speakers representing from the United Nations, European Union, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and diplomatic missions in the country.
“Peace and Trust are the fundamental principles enshrined in the UN Charter and subsequent agreements adopted over many decades.

Title: To diversify the country’s economy, FAO offers support for Turkmenistan’s agrifood sector
Content: 11 December 2021
Today, as an important milestone, the two parties signed the Country Programming Framework – a document framing their partnership for the period 2021–2025.
Being one of the Central Asian countries with territory predominantly covered by desert, Turkmenistan’s economy strongly relies on sectors other than agriculture, which provides only 10 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP). Still, developing the agrifood sector – the largest employer in the country – has great potential for diversifying exports and providing better chances for rural populations.
Transforming food systems also offers an opportunity for the country to adapt to climate change and meet global sustainability commitments.
Having these in mind, FAO is ready to support Turkmenistan in three areas: collecting and analyzing data related, among others, to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); contributing to a more productive, effective, and digital agriculture sector with an increased export potential; and helping disaster prevention and response, as well as sustainable management of natural resources.
The framework document was signed by Allanur Altyev, Turkmenistan’s Minister of Agriculture and Environmental Protection, and Viorel Gutu, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Central Asia.
“A comprehensive development of agriculture can bring about an increased quality of life and reduced inequalities in rural areas, and even better nutrition for the whole population,” commented Viorel Gutu. “Among agrifood products, cotton textiles, fruits, vegetables, and cattle breeding have growth potential and FAO stands ready to apply expertise in realizing this in a sustainable manner.”
The priorities and expected outcomes of the Country Programming Framework are consistent with the government priorities of Turkmenistan and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.
Joint priorities until 2025
More specifically, FAO will support the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection and other related ministries and state agencies in strengthening institutional capacity on statistical data collection and reporting on agricultural development, production, and trade.
Digitalization is an important element of agricultural development. Through knowledge sharing and other means, FAO will thus help the Ministry and other relevant partners develop and use digital technologies and tools for improved rural livelihoods and agribusinesses and enhanced agricultural productivity and efficiency.
Turkmenistan can rely on FAO expertise in analyzing the potential of agrifood export markets and value chains, as well as recommendations to strengthen the export potential of the agro-industrial complex.
Under the third priority, FAO will support the country’s climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. In this context, the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection can benefit from help in locust-control operations and the management of wheat rust diseases, as well as assessing disaster needs in agriculture and developing mitigation strategies for disaster risk. Greater access to innovative approaches, digital technologies, and environmentally friendly solutions will lead to an efficient and sustainable use of energy, water, land, and other natural resources.

Title: Regional Meeting of Civil Society Organizations of Central Asia
Content: 10 December 2021
The event coincided with World Human Rights Day, celebrated annually on 10 December.
The event was held with direct connection from Ashgabat, Bishkek, Osh, Dushanbe, Tashkent, , and brought together representatives of the OHCHR in Central Asia, EU Delegations in Central Asia, civil society organizations and experts in the field of human rights.
This year, the Human Rights Day was dedicated to reducing inequality and was based on Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."
The principles of equality and non-discrimination are at the core of human rights. In the face of the pandemic, these issues have become even more important around the world. The civil society meeting held on 10 December sought solutions to deep-rooted forms of discrimination that affect the most vulnerable segments of society.
Participants shared their experiences and developed a shared vision of how to address inequality and discrimination both in Central Asia and at the regional level.

Title: WHO/Europe’s high level expert mission completes in Turkmenistan to strengthen health systems preparedness
Content: 29 November 2021
Dr. Dorit Nitzan, Regional Emergency Director for WHO/Europe, who led the mission commented: “During our visit, we were keen to highlight the evolving nature of the pandemic throughout the Region due to the spread of the delta variant. We also drew attention to the emergence of new variants and the spread seen globally, even in countries with high vaccination coverage”.
Focus on key areas of health system strengthening
The mission was decided during Dr. Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe visit to Turkmenistan, with  priorities identified in discussion with the Minister of Health and Medical Industry and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. These included health diplomacy, emergency preparedness, epidemiology and surveillance capacity, digitalization and innovation, as well as regional health initiatives, such as the development of a health roadmap for central Asian countries.
The team combined expertise in emergency preparedness and response, noncommunicable diseases, environment and One Health, epidemiology and surveillance, health data and information systems, digital health and innovation. Working together with Turkmen experts, they were able to make made recommendations, based on sound data, scientific evidence and the experience of other countries in the European Region.
Timely COVID-19 detection at the core of effective response
An important highlight of the mission was discussing with teams from the Ministers of Health and Medical Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection strengthening sub-regional capacities in bacteriology and virology, based on the One Health Principles.  In addition, the mission looked at how virus genetic sequencing capacities could be set up to help with the detection of COVID-19.
Speaking at the end of their visit, Dr. Dorit Nitzan commented: “The mission has highlighted the need to strengthen efforts to detect COVID-19. Reporting cases in a timely manner is a must, as it enables the activation of additional arms of the response: contact tracing; quarantine; provision of adequate care and appropriate case management; tailoring of measures to the epidemiological situation; surveillance and testing. All require community engagement and are rooted in transparency”.
As well as supporting Turkmenistan preparing for COVID-19, WHO experts had the opportunity to visit several medical facilities to provide advice in other areas including non-communicable diseases, tobacco control, and health information systems.

Title: UN, Government launch mid-term review of national Sustainable Development Goals in Turkmenistan
Content: 22 November 2021
Given that six years have passed since the adoption of the national SDG framework in 2016, it was agreed to organize the review of the national SDG monitoring matrix in a participatory and consultative mode, involving relevant government ministries and departments, private sector, civil society organizations and UN agencies. Every SDG Goal, its targets and indicators have been reviewed separately during which availability of baseline and target indicators as well as capacity development needs on methodological aspects were also clarified.
The purpose of the proposed national SDG mid-term review in Turkmenistan was to take stock of the SDG implementation progress in the country, identify good practices and analyze possible gaps to ensure timely policy measures, as well as to ensure that the country firmly continues on the path to achievement SDGs.  The principle of SDGs on leaving no one behind guided the mid-term review to ensure due analysis of SDG progress for vulnerable groups.
The participants of these meetings reviewed targets and indicators adopted by Turkmenistan for 17 SDGs comparing with global changes. They had also discussed the plans for their implementation within the national programmes and plans. To ensure quality analysis, a tool for tracking national SDG progress proposed by the ESCAP will be utilized when significant datasets are collected.
The national Working Group on implementation of SDGs is responsible for soliciting and consolidating the relevant data, analyzing the achievements and possible gaps, organizing consultations across sectors, regions etc., and drafting the SDG mid-term review report.
As an outcome of the national SDG mid-term review, the following results are expected:

Title: Updated climate commitments ahead of COP26 summit fall far short, but net-zero pledges provide hope
Content: 26 October 2021
New and updated climate commitments fall far short of what is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, leaving the world on track for a global temperature rise of at least 2.7°C this century, according to the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) latest Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On.
The report, now in its 12th year, finds that countries’ updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – and other commitments made for 2030 but not yet submitted in an updated NDC – only take an additional 7.5 per cent off predicted annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2030, compared to the previous round of commitments. Reductions of 30 per cent are needed to stay on the least-cost pathway for 2°C and 55 per cent for 1.5°C.
Released ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), the latest round of climate talks taking place in Glasgow, the report finds that net-zero pledges could make a big difference. If fully implemented, these pledges could bring the predicted global temperature rise to 2.2°C, providing hope that further action could still head off the most-catastrophic impacts of climate change. However, net-zero pledges are still vague, incomplete in many cases, and inconsistent with most 2030 NDCs.
“Climate change is no longer a future problem. It is a now problem,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, we have eight years to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions: eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts. The clock is ticking loudly.”
As of 30 September 2021, 120 countries, representing just over half of global greenhouse gas emissions, had communicated new or updated NDCs. In addition, three G20 members have announced other new mitigation pledges for 2030.
To have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, the world has eight years to take an additional 28 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) off annual emissions, over and above what is promised in the updated NDCs and other 2030 commitments. To put this number into perspective, carbon dioxide emissions alone are expected to reach 33 gigatonnes in 2021. When all other greenhouse gases are taken into account, annual emissions are close to 60 GtCO2e. So, to have a chance of reaching the 1.5°C target, we need to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions. For the 2°C target, the additional need is lower: a drop in annual emissions of 13 GtCO2e by 2030.
Alok Sharma, incoming COP26 President, said the report underlined why countries need to show ambitious climate action at COP26: “As this report makes clear, if countries deliver on their 2030 NDCs and net zero commitments which have been announced by the end of September, we will be heading towards average global temperature rises of just above 2C. Complementary analyses suggest that the commitments made in Paris would have capped the rise in temperature to below 4°C.
“So there has been progress, but not enough,” he added.” That is why we especially need the biggest emitters, the G20 nations, to come forward with stronger commitments to 2030 if we are to keep 1.5c in reach over this critical decade.”
Zeroing in on net-zero
Net-zero pledges – and their effective execution – could make a big difference, the authors find, but current plans are vague and not reflected in NDCs. A total of 49 countries plus the EU have pledged a net-zero target. This covers over half of global domestic greenhouse gas emissions, over half of GDP and a third of the global population. Eleven targets are enshrined in law, covering 12 per cent of global emissions.
If made robust and implemented fully, net-zero targets could shave an extra 0.5°C off global warming, bringing the predicted temperature rise down to 2.2°C. However, many of the national climate plans delay action until after 2030, raising doubts over whether net-zero pledges can be delivered. Twelve G20 members have pledged a net-zero target, but they are still highly ambiguous. Action also needs to be frontloaded to make it in line with 2030 goals.
“The world has to wake up to the imminent peril we face as a species,” Andersen added. “Nations need to put in place the policies to meet their new commitments, and start implementing them within months. They need to make their net-zero pledges more concrete, ensuring these commitments are included in NDCs, and action brought forward. They then need to get the policies in place to back this raised ambition and, again, start implementing them urgently.
“It is also essential to deliver financial and technological support to developing nations – so that they can both adapt to the impacts of climate change already here and set out on a low-emissions growth path.”
The potential of methane and market mechanisms
Every year, the Emissions Gap Report looks at the potential of specific sectors. This year, it focuses on methane and market mechanisms. Reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors can contribute to closing the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term.
Methane emissions are the second largest contributor to global warming. The gas has a global warming potential over 80 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year horizon; it also has a shorter lifetime in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide – only twelve years, compared to up to hundreds for CO2 – so cuts to methane will limit temperature increase faster than cuts to carbon dioxide.
Available no- or low-cost technical measures alone could reduce anthropogenic methane emissions by around 20 per cent per year. Implementation of all measures, along with broader structural and behavioural measures, could reduce anthropogenic methane emissions by approximately 45 per cent.
Carbon markets, meanwhile, have the potential to reduce costs and thereby encourage more ambitious reduction pledges, but only if rules are clearly defined, are designed to ensure that transactions reflect actual reductions in emissions, and are supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency.
Revenues earned through these markets could fund mitigation and adaptation solutions domestically and in vulnerable nations where the burdens of climate change are greatest.
COVID-19 recovery opportunity largely missed
Finally, the report finds that the opportunity to use COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery spending to stimulate the economy while backing climate action has been missed in most countries.
The COVID-19 pandemic led to a drop in global CO2 emissions of 5.4 per cent in 2020. However, CO2 and non-CO2 emissions in 2021 are expected to rise again to a level only slightly lower than the record high in 2019.
Only around 20 per cent of total recovery investments up to May 2021 are likely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Of this spending, almost 90 per cent is accounted for by six G20 members and one permanent guest.
COVID-19 spending has been far lower in low-income economies (USD 60 per person) than advanced economies (USD 11,800 per person). Gaps in finance are likely to exacerbate gaps in vulnerable nations on climate resilience and mitigation measures.

Title: World Migratory Bird Day 2021: Join the global celebration of birds and nature on 9 Oct 2021!
Content: 09 October 2021
This year the campaign will focus on the phenomena of “bird song” and “bird flight” as a way to inspire and connect people of all ages around the world in their shared desire to celebrate migratory birds and to unite in a common, global effort to protect birds and the habitats they need to survive.
 
The 2021 World Migratory Bird Day theme is an invitation to people everywhere to connect and re-connect with nature by actively listening to - and watching birds - wherever they are. At the same time the theme appeals to people around the world to use their own voices and creativity to express their shared appreciation of birds and nature.
 
Birds can be found everywhere: in cities and in the countryside; in parks and backyards, in forests and mountains, and in wetlands and along the shores. They connect all these habitats and they connect us, reminding us of our own connection to the planet, the environment, wildlife and each other. Through their seasonal movements, migratory birds are also regularly reminding us of nature’s cycles.
 
As global ambassadors of nature, migratory birds not only connect different places across the planet, they also re-connect people to nature and to themselves like no other animals on the planet.
  
In fact, billions of migratory birds have continued to sing, fly and soar between their breeding and non-breeding sites. During the pandemic, which slowed down many activities by limiting our movements, people across the world have been listening to and watching birds like never before. For many people around the world, bird song has also been a source of comfort and joy during the pandemic, connecting people to each other and to nature as they remain in place.
 
Scientists around the world have also been studying the impact the pandemic is having on birds and other wildlife, looking at how “the anthropause” – the so-called global shutdown in human activity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic – has effected birds and other wildlife around the world. At the same time, scientists have also been looking at the positive health benefits of birds and nature on humans.
 
Clearly, the pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge for humankind. At the same time, it has also brought a whole new level of awareness and appreciation of birds and the importance of nature for our own well-being.
 
World Migratory Bird Day 2021 is therefore not only a celebration of birds, it is also an important moment to reflect on our own global relationship with nature and to highlight our collective desire to do more to protect birds and nature in a post-pandemic world.
 
World Migratory Bird Day is organized by a collaborative partnership among two UN treaties -the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) -and the non-profit organization, Environment for the Americas (EFTA). The 2021 campaign is also actively being supported by the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership (EAAFP) Secretariat and a growing number of other dedicated organisations.
 
Celebrated across the world on two peak days each year – on the second Saturday in May and second Saturday in October – World Migratory Bird Day is the only international awareness-raising and education program that celebrates the migration of bird species along all the major flyways of the world.
Key Message in 2021
“Migratory birds connect us with their unique songs and flights, and remind us of the importance of working together, across borders, to protect them.”
Please visit the Resources page for further materials and to learn more about the 2021 Theme: “Sing, Fly, Soar – Like a Bird!”.
Activities around the world
Below are some of the planned World Migratory Bird Day 2021 activities we are already aware of and we will be adding new activities to the website on a continual basis. We would also be delighted to hear about your plans and would like to encourage all event organizers to register their event on the WMBD website so that it appears on the global event map.
Events marking World Migratory Bird Day 2021 will generally be ‘migrating’ online, as many countries are still heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many virtual talks and a wave of online interactions dedicated to migratory birds are expected to take place in many countries, with educational programmes being offered virtually by many organizations including schools, museums, parks, zoos, libraries, wildlife refuges and wetland centers.
Organize your own event and become part of the global celebration! Do you have something planned for World Migratory Bird Day 2021? Then please make sure to register the activity on the WMBD website. For major “flyway scale events” please send us a short descriptive text (max 400 words) and 1-2 images so we can help promote it via our channels.
How can you get involved?
Year after year, hundreds of events take place to celebrate World Migratory Bird Day in many countries across the world. Every event is unique in its own way, and as diverse and creative as the people and organizations involved. Below are a few things you can do to get involved:
Help Spread the Word!
Raise Your Voice for Bird Conservation
The theme this year is unique in that it directly appeals to people of all ages to express themselves, to use their own human voice and creativity to show their appreciation and support for birds and international bird conservation. We encourage all participants to use World Migratory Bird Day as an opportunity to express their support for bird conservation and to highlight what they are doing in support of migrator birds.
Be Creative!
Linking human song with the song of birds opens a huge spectrum of creative possibilities which can be universally applied across borders in many countries around the world. Ideas range from tapping into existing popular songs dedicated to birds from all corners of the world, to activating people in different countries to “speak up” and to actually sing for birds, i.e. to “sing like a bird - for migratory birds” in their own language.
SING and FLY #LikeABird!
In order for this to become a truly global “wave of human creativity and expression” for birds and nature, people should record and share their bird inspired songs (or other forms of creative expression!) on social media using the following hashtags #SingFlySoar #LikeABird.
Another possible activation path for the “#LikeABird campaign”, could be to invite nature photographers and film makers to share their best “birds in flight” videos and photos via social media using the hashtags #SingFlySoar #LikeABird.
Similar to the “act of singing” one could also go a step further and link bird flight with actual human flight, looking at everything from sky diving, hang gliding, paragliding and other activities which are associated with a form of aerial adventure.  Participants are encouraged to share their “in flight” photos and videos via social media using the hashtags #SingFlySoar #LikeABird.
Register an Event
United by a common theme and campaign, WMBD events take place in all corners of the world and involve and inspire thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds. While events are usually organized on one of the two peak days of World Migratory Bird Day (i.e. on the Second Saturday in May and in October) events can actually be linked to World Migratory Bird Day throughout the year.
There are really no limits on creativity! Past activities and awareness-raising events have included bird-watching tours, online educational workshops and exhibitions, webinars, festivals, and painting competitions, which have been organized at schools, parks, town halls, education centres and nature reserves.
Visit this page to be inspired by past events and once you know what you want to do – please make sure to register your activity
In the coming weeks we will continuously be updating the website with new materials and stories which you can share and use to promote your own activities linked to World Migratory Bird Day.

About World Migratory Bird Day
World Migratory Bird Day is celebrated on two peak days each year (the second Saturdays of May and October) to highlight the need for international collaboration to ensure the conservation of migratory birds and their habitats globally. Registered events to mark World Migratory Bird Day 2021 will include bird festivals, education programmes, media events, quizzes, competitions and film screenings.  First held in 2006 to promote the conservation of migratory birds and to counteract the negative publicity they were receiving across the world, due to concerns about their role as potential vectors of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus subtype H5N1 – now commonly referred to as bird flu.  Since then World Migratory Bird Day has gained in popularity with over 2,000 events organized in over 100 countries since the campaign’s inception.
The Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) — two intergovernmental wildlife treaties of the United Nations — organize the campaign in partnership with the Colorado-based non-profit organization, Environment for the Americas (EFTA).

Title: IOM organized an online workshop for national stakeholders on Gender responsive migration data for evidence-based planning
Content: 05 October 2021
Objective of the workshop was to enhance evidence-based policymaking, with a focus on the nexus between migration-development and gender. A gender-responsive policy approach to migration promotes the production, analysis and use of migration data to enhance the gender-responsiveness of policies and governance. Producing and collecting quality sex- and gender-disaggregated migration data which represent migrants of all genders and using such data to inform and improve migration policies, will not only enhance gender-responsiveness in migration data and policy (including legislative) processes, but also enable policy makers to capitalise on both genders for development. Such a dynamic relationship between gender-sensitive migration data and policy contribute to and accelerates positive development outcomes for all the concerned stakeholders. This objective would be achieved through supporting the government of Turkmenistan with enhanced gender-sensitive and responsive migration data collection and increased analysis capacity, while ensuring data security and upholding data protection principles.
The workshop brought together representatives from Ministries and departments of the Government of Turkmenistan which are collecting data on migration, including State Migration Service, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, State Committee on Statistics, Ministry of Education, Institute of State, Law and Democracy, and Parliament (Mejlis). The seminar featured presentations by Head of IOM mission in Ashgabat - Azat Atajanov, IOM Consultants on Gender and Migration -  Margarita Khegai and Dmitry Poletayev; IOM Regional Office in Vienna – Van Asch Lauranne Simon; IOM’s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC), Migration Data and Policy Officer - Elisa Mosler Vidal and Data Analyst – Guallar Arino Estefania; and IOM Migration Research Division (RES) - Rojas Coppari Pablo.
During the seminar the participants touched upon such topics as global key migration trends, data disaggregation and the sustainable development, discussed the aspects of gender and migration data, learned a guideline for evidence-based, gender responsive migration governance and IOM gender framework matrix, as well as studied gender and migration aspects in the Global Compact for Migration (GCM) and the 2030 Agenda. National stakeholders stressed the importance of this workshop and commented that gained knowledge and skills would be applied in migration policies to achieve national priorities and to fulfil international commitments including the 2030 Agenda and the GCM reporting. IOM Consultant -Margarita Khegai concluded that such kind of workshops could help to strengthen a national capacity to collect and analyse indicators and develop national strategies for migration in Turkmenistan, integrating gender sensitive and responsive migration data in development plans.

Title: UN Secretary-General calls for accelerated action on jobs and social protection to avoid an uneven global recovery and prevent future crises
Content: 27 September 2021
"Investing in job-rich growth, social protection and a just transition to a net-zero emissions future, particularly in low -and middle-income countries, could prevent a further deepening of the inequalities between developed and developing economies that have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic," - said UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, in a policy brief issued today.
At least US$982 billion in fiscal stimulus measures is needed to respond to the immediate labour market shocks of the crisis and to support a just transition, as well as US$ 1.2 trillion annually for social protection floors in low- and middle-income countries. No advanced economy has achieved economic and social progress without investing in social protection systems and quality public services that provide people with the necessary support to navigate the vicissitudes of their lives.
While the wealth of billionaires increased by over US$ 3.9 trillion between March and December 2020, the impact of the pandemic on the world of work, among other factors, increased the number of extremely poor by between 119 and 224 million people—the first increase in poverty in over 21 years.
The Secretary-General’s brief calls for urgent investments in a job-rich, sustainable and socially inclusive recovery. The public and private sectors should leverage finance to significantly ramp up such investments to get the world back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and to address ever increasing risks from climate change and environmental degradation that could jeopardize  1.2 billion jobs—equivalent to 40 percent of the global labour force.
A human-centred recovery from the pandemic needs employment and social protection policies to work in tandem, not only to improve people’s living standards, but also to help them navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing world of work and the transition towards the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Accelerating job creation
To achieve a job-rich recovery and a just transition to a sustainable and inclusive economy, the Secretary-General is calling for a Global Accelerator for Jobs and Social Protection that would create at least 400 million jobs and extend social protection to 4 billion women, men and children currently without coverage.
To achieve this Goal, the Policy Brief entitled “Investing in Jobs and Social Protection for Poverty Eradication and a Sustainable Recovery” recommends several actions:
High-level Event on Jobs and Social Protection for Poverty Eradication
The UN Secretary-General will present the brief at a virtual high-level meeting at the UN on 28 September 2021, 09.00 -12.00 ET (15.00-18.00 CEST). The meeting is convened jointly with the ILO.
Leaders from countries, along with the heads of major international organizations, multilateral banks and finance institutions, civil society, private sector and academia will discuss pathways
The High-Level Meeting on Jobs and Social Protection for Poverty Eradication will feature the UN Secretary-General delivering opening remarks, followed by Jamaican Prime Minister Mr. Andrew Holness as co-convener of the Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond Initiative (FfDI), and Mr. Guy Ryder, Director-General, International Labour Organization. After, a moderated discussion will take place with Heads of the International Financial Institutions, Heads of States and Government and international organizations.
The Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed will provide closing remarks.
The meeting is being organized under the aegis of the Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond Initiative (FfDI) with the support of ILO.

Title: The Representation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for Central Asia jointly with the Al-Farabi Kazakh National University and the Central Asian Network on Statelessness announces the Second Regional Statelessness Competition
Content: 21 September 2021
Millions of people around the world are denied a nationality and the legal rights endowed with it. They do not exist on paper and most often live on the fringes of society. Without citizenship, stateless people often do not have access to essential services, including healthcare. At such a critical time, in the middle of a global pandemic, they are at great risk of being left behind in the response. Stateless people may be precluded from or face obstacles in accessing coronavirus testing and treatment, others may refrain from accessing services for fear that their legal status can put them at risk of detention or deportation.
Without legal rights and access to services, statelessness leaves many politically and economically marginalized, discriminated against and vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. In many countries across the world, stateless people live in sub-standard and inadequate sanitary conditions which can compound the risk of outbreaks. Limited by their legal status, many work in informal sectors, which can also hamper adherence to public health protocols such as self- isolation and physical distancing.
Although it has long been understood that statelessness should be avoided and that this goal can only be achieved through international cooperation, many States have yet to take action to ensure that everyone enjoys the right to a nationality. Due to the differing approaches taken by States with regard to the acquisition and loss of nationality, some individuals continue to “fall through the cracks” and become stateless. Common rules are therefore essential to address such gaps. The 1961 Convention is the only universal instrument that elaborates clear, detailed and concrete safeguards to ensure a fair and appropriate response to the threat of statelessness.
2021 marks 60 years since the adoption of the 1961 Convention. To mark this date, UNHCR invites secondary school and university students share their essays and research papers on the impact of the 1961 Convention and its relevance today.
Objective of the Research Paper Competition
The main objective of the competition is to stimulate analytical thinking and research of school and university students on matters of nationality, statelessness and impact of the 1961 Statelessness Convention on the evolution of international law and continuing relevance.
Competition Task
Competition is open for two categories of participants:
Essay section: School students (7-11 grades of secondary schools): Participants in this category should provide an essay up to 1,000 words on the topic: “How the 1961 Statelessness Convention was developed and how it helps to resolve the problem of statelessness”.
Research paper section: University students (undergraduate and graduate): Participants in this category should provide a research paper of up to 6,000 words, on topics related to nationality and statelessness, its causes and consequences, the impact of the 1961 Statelessness Convention on the evolution of international law, and its continuing relevance, interconnected socio-economic rights, innovative solutions for streamlining the reduction and prevention of statelessness, protection of stateless persons and achieving the ultimate goal of statelessness eradication by 2024.

Title: The gap between air pollution pacesetters and laggards in Europe and Central Asia has widened, new report finds
Content: 03 September 2021
Efforts to tackle air pollution have stepped up in recent years and are bringing dividends in many European countries, but extreme hotspots remain in Central Asia and the Balkans, finds a new report issued today by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) together with the Swedish Environmental Research Institute.
Dangerous air quality levels continue to be recorded throughout Europe and Central Asia, and ammonia emissions are rising in all sub-regions, states the report, European and Central Asian Actions on Air Quality, issued ahead of the International Day of Clean Air for blue skies (7 September). Air pollution laggards are not yet catching up, it finds.
Twenty-nine countries in Europe and Central Asia took part in a questionnaire on actions taken and their results, feeding into the report. The survey was conducted by UNEP and IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute.
Air pollution is the world’s biggest environmental killer, responsible for around seven million premature deaths each year through diseases such as lung cancer, acute respiratory infections and heart disease. Meanwhile, the main sources of air pollution and greenhouse gases are often the same. Most actions to improve air quality also therefore help to fight climate change.
Actions can clear the haze
Between 2010 and 2017, emissions of most monitored air pollutants decreased in Western, Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe, the study finds.
For example, in Western and Central Europe, emissions linked to electricity, heat production and industry —a major source of air pollution —were found to have fallen by up to 20% in some countries. This is due to a greater uptake of renewable energy, improvements in energy efficiency and the use of environmental impact assessments.
Road transport emissions in Western and Central Europe were found to have fallen by 20-30% over the same period, partly due to enhanced efforts on vehicle inspections and the promotion of electric mobility. Meanwhile, stricter vehicle standards saw traffic emissions in South Eastern Europe plummet by 40%.
In Western and Central Europe, emissions linked to residential heating dropped by roughly 15%, thanks to an increased focus on energy efficiency and green technologies. Thirty-eight European countries now also ban the open burning of waste, up from 32 in 2016.
Such actions are being shown to benefit people’s health. For example, in 2018, around 417,000 people are estimated to have died prematurely in the European Union due to exposure to fine particles (directly emitted as particles or formed from gaseous pollutants in the atmosphere, PM2.5), which affects more people than any other air pollutant. By 2020, this figure had dropped to 240,000, and by 2030 the toll is expected to fall to 170,000.
However, PM2.5 levels still exceed World Health Organization guidelines at 70% of the stations located in all countries surveyed, the report underlines. Furthermore, unlike for much of Europe, emissions are found to be on the rise in Central Asian countries. For example, PM2.5 emissions increased by 21% between 2010 and 2017 in Kazakhstan, while carbon monoxide emissions in the country jumped 34%, and road traffic emissions rose by 20%.
Meanwhile, emissions of ammonia increased across Europe and Central Asia during 2010-2017, with the biggest increase recorded in South Eastern Europe. Once emitted, almost entirely from farming, much of the ammonia forms into PM2.5 and can cause respiratory diseases. The rise in emissions occurred despite 75% of countries promoting sustainable agricultural practices, according to the paper.
“We are not yet breathing air fit for human health, and are still counting the cost of lives lost and economic damage due to air pollution. Yet this report shows how big improvements can be made. As we build back greener from COVID-19, the COP26 climate talks offer a major chance to seize these solutions, which are often at low cost,” said Bruno Pozzi, Europe Director for the UN Environment Programme.
“It is problematic that countries outside the EU are lagging behind, not least from an environmental justice perspective. In addition, these countries are lagging also in their efforts to reduce emissions, even if the air quality monitoring has improved, says Stefan Åström, co-author of the report and senior researcher at IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute.
Extreme hotspots remain
The air pollution challenge is seen to be growing in the Western Balkans, where more than 60% of people use solid fuels such as coal and firewood to heat their homes. As a result, during winter, cities such as Belgrade, Sarajevo, Skopje, and Sofia are among the worst polluted in the world. On average, city dwellers in the region lose up to 13–16 months of life to air pollution.
A separate recent study has meanwhile shown that 16 outdated coal power plants in the Western Balkan cost health systems and economies there between EUR 6.1 and 11.5 billion each year, the paper notes.
Nevertheless, solutions are being sought at local and national level. The Canton of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina has put in place a decarbonization strategy for 2021-2030 that envisages phasing out the use of coal in homes, businesses and government buildings, for example.
Several Central Asian cities are also frequently ranked among the most polluted in the world during winter, due to the burning of coal and low-quality fuel. Yet public awareness on the problem is seen to be improving in some cities. In Almaty, for example, a citizen-led network set up air quality monitors around the city, with data being made available in real time via an app. Air quality data is also displayed on LED screens across the city.
Poorer citizens still breathe dirtier air
Poor air quality continues to correlate with low Gross Domestic Product (GDP). For example, the GDP per capita of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia is less than half of the European median level, while both countries record 150% of the median annual average in PM2.5 emissions.
Despite this, in Eastern Europe, air quality assessment infrastructure is now almost on par with those in Central and Western Europe. Progress is also found to have been made on this in Central Asia.
Is change on the horizon?
According to the authors, the damage resulting from air pollution is generally much more costly than the actions to control it. ‘Low-hanging fruits’ exist where large gains can be made at low cost, the paper underlines. For example, improvements in residential heating can reduce emissions and cut bills. Yet 70% of countries responding to the survey have national programmes promoting clean energy for cooking and heating — the same figure as in 2016. The introduction of more bans on open waste burning could also be sped up. Meanwhile, the report stresses that all countries must reduce ammonia emissions on farms, which can be done through closed-roof manure storage and methane capture for energy use.
The report is launched in the run-up to the International Day of Clean Air for blue skies, which takes place on 7 September and aims to raise awareness on the importance of clean air for health, economy and the environment, as well as to bring about and promote solutions. The study feeds into a global report on air quality to be published by UNEP to mark the Day.

Title: One in three countries in the world lack any legally mandated standards for outdoor air quality
Content: 02 September 2021
Regulating Air Quality: The first global assessment of air pollution legislation, launched ahead of the International Day of Clean Air for blue skies, examines national air quality legislation in 194 States and the European Union. Exploring various dimensions of legal and institutional frameworks, the report assesses their effectiveness in ensuring the attainment of air quality standards. The report concludes with key elements for a robust model of air quality governance to be considered in national legislation and makes the case for considering a global treaty on ambient air quality standards.
Air pollution has been identified by WHO as the single largest environmental health risk, with 92% of the world’s population living in places where air pollution levels exceed safe limits, disproportionately affecting women, children and elderly people in low-income countries. Recent studies suggest possible correlations between COVID-19 health outcomes and air pollution.
WHO has presented guideline values for ambient air quality, but, as the report shows, there is no global alignment and common legal framework for applying them. In at least 34% of countries, ambient air quality is not yet legally protected. Even where legally adopted, standards are difficult to compare: 49% of the world’s countries define air pollution exclusively as an outdoor threat, geographic coverage of air quality standards varies, and over half of countries allow deviations from these standards.
Furthermore, institutional responsibility for attaining standards is weak globally – only 33% of countries impose obligations to meet legally mandated standards. Monitoring is critical to knowing if standards are being attained but is not legally required in at least 37% of countries. Finally, although air pollution knows no borders, only 31% of countries have legal mechanisms to address cross border air pollution.
“There will be no jab to prevent seven million premature deaths caused by air pollution each year, a number poised to grow by more than 50% by 2050,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “The air we breathe is a fundamental public good, and governments must do more to ensure it is clean and safe.”
The right to a healthy environment, including clean air, is a precursor to achieving Agenda 2030and Sustainable Development Goals on good health, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities, responsible production, and life on earth (SDGs 3, 7, 11, 12, and 15). At its first session, the 5th UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5) called on Member States to act across sectors to reduce all forms of air pollution.
The study demonstrates that “even the most admirable national air quality objectives must be supported with strong institutional frameworks, implementation capacity and well-coordinated laws, if they are to be effective,” says Professor Eloise Scotford, who co-authored the report.
The report calls on more countries to adopt robust air quality laws, which includes setting ambitious standards in law for both indoor and ambient air pollution, improving legal mechanisms for monitoring air quality, increasing transparency, significantly enhancing enforcement systems, and improving policy and regulatory coordination for national and transboundary air pollution alike.
Following this assessment, practical guidance is already being developed by UNEP under the Montevideo Environmental Law Programme to expand its assistance to countries in addressing the air pollution crisis. Direct technical support to countries, involving development and implementation of legal frameworks for air pollution, is also being planned, with complementary capacity-building for stakeholders, including judges, prosecutors and other enforcement officials.

During July-August 2021, for one month, Instagram followers of UNICEF Turkmenistan took an active part in a digital campaign to showcase the importance of parenting and ask questions, specifically about activities and games parents play with their children. The campaign was designed to support UNICEF efforts to motivate young parents to spend more quality time with their children by playing different games and building a healthy and friendly environment for child development during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Social media users were encouraged to upload photos and videos of their activities together with children to UNICEF’s Instagram page, which was a connecting hub for all participants. 65 social media users took part in the campaign from all over Turkmenistan. Fathers were also sharing posts and participating in the campaign that served as examples for other fathers to engage in early learning activities with children.
“I was happy to share a video with my daughters where we dance and spend our time together in joy. Also, it was very interesting for me to see how other parents are involved in their children’s development,” says one of the participants of the campaign, a young mother of triples – Jennet.
“Being a parent is one of the most important jobs in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic offered the opportunity to spend more time together with our children and engage in developmental activities. Devoting time to parenting is important to do regularly. We are happy and thankful to young parents and Instagram users across Turkmenistan for taking part in our campaign and opening doors to the magical world of children,” says Alexandru Nartea, Deputy Representative of UNICEF in Turkmenistan.
This is the first of such a large-scale social media campaign conducted by UNICEF in Turkmenistan. The campaign lasted 27 days and Instagram engagement reach during this period increased by 60% compared to the previous month, which is an illustration of the active interaction of young parents with their children in home environment and virtual space in Turkmenistan.

Title: United Nations urges strengthening of international transit systems to build resilience to future pandemics in Landlocked Developing Countries
Content: 16 August 2021
The report, “Impact of COVID-19 and responses in Landlocked Developing Countries”, written in collaboration with the International Think Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), demonstrates how Landlocked Developing Countries’ lack of territorial access to the sea and global markets expose them in unique ways to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“When the world locked down and borders closed throughout the globe, the LLDCs found themselves in a desperate situation with limited access to global markets, food and medical supplies and therefore were left behind in their efforts to fight the pandemic” said Mr. Courtenay Rattray, United Nations High-Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. “This cannot be allowed to happen again. This group of countries is in dire need of more efficient transit systems to ensure secure and uninterrupted flows of goods and services when needed most. They must be supported to respond and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The report calls for open cross-border transport networks for goods and services, expedited passage of medical supplies and coordinated safety measures at border crossings so that the world’s Landlocked Developing Countries can better face future crises.
Mr. Dulguun Damdin-Od, Director of Operations and Research Coordinator of the International Think Tank for LLDCs, added that “Borders are the Landlocked Developing Countries’ only gateway to the rest of the world and it must be ensured that those gates can be opened in times of crisis. LLDCs cannot be excluded in our global vision for a better, more sustainable future.”
Landlocked Developing Countries suffer debilitating hurdles in their efforts to import and export goods. The pandemic made this problem stark with LLDCs struggling to access tools necessary to prevent the spread of the coronavirus but also the near-impossible challenge of importing vaccines.
In fact, by June 2021, 1% of global COVID-19 vaccine doses had been distributed in LLDCs, in a group of countries home to 7% of the world’s population. Only by prioritising vaccinations – the report states - the world be able to accelerate the LLDCs’ economic recovery and rebuild what was teared down by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Landlocked Developing Countries rely heavily on their neighbours – known as transit countries - to access international trade. The global shutdown caused a spike in prices of food and medical supplies which was multiplied in the LLDCs, as they had no direct access to commodity sources.

Title: Expanding choices for women and girls will save $87mln for Turkmenistan, UNFPA study finds
Content: 09 July 2021
Following the commitments made in Nairobi, Turkmenistan initiated the study using a global methodology developed by UNFPA jointly with Johns Hopkins University, Victoria University, and the University of Washington and Avenir Health.
Making the case for expanding choices
“The Investment case presents three scenarios, and the results indicate financial and health gains in all of them,” said Mr. Mihai Horga, UNFPA International consultant who facilitated the study.
The most favorable scenario envisages expanding the coverage and the contraceptive choices for women and girls.  This means that more women will be eligible to receive free contraception, and the reproductive health rooms will offer additional contraceptive choices.  If this scenario is followed, the investments will avert more than 680,000 unintended pregnancies and 22,500 unsafe abortions, thus saving more than $87,500 for the national public budget till the end of 2030 in purely economic terms, in addition to supporting the well-being of so many.
Family planning is not only a matter of human rights. It boosts economic development and is a precondition for achieving Sustainable Development Goals.  When countries prioritize and invest in family planning, they promote healthier populations, more efficient health systems, and stronger economies.
Starting in 2017, Turkmenistan has taken over financial ownership to provide free-of-charge contraceptives for vulnerable women, previously supported by UNFPA.  This commitment contributes to maintaining progress on maternal health and ending preventable maternal deaths, which is currently one of the lowest in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. As the global pandemic threatens to reverse these positive achievements, it is crucial to continue investing in these areas.
Should the ongoing investments continue, the unmet need in family planning could continue to decrease in the country. However, there are still about 160,000 women aged 15-49 who would like to prevent or delay their pregnancy but are not using modern contraceptives.  The reasons are different for each woman ranging from lack of information on services to lack of support from their parents, husband or communities, to ability to decide or purchase contraceptives by themselves.
Amid the global pandemic, UNFPA supports the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry of Turkmenistan in ensuring that the 95 reproductive health rooms countrywide do not experience a stock-out of the contraceptives.  Despite the global supply chain disruptions, currently, all reproductive health rooms are equipped with at least four modern methods of contraceptives.
“UNFPA congratulates the Government of Turkmenistan for staying true to its Nairobi Commitments and conducting the Investment Case on Ending unmet need for family planning in Turkmenistan by 2030,” said Ms. Giulia Vallese, UNFPA Country Director for Turkmenistan.  “Evidence shows that every dollar invested in family planning will yield more than $7 in financial returns for the public health system over the next nine years, in addition to empowering women to lead healthier and more productive lives.”
“UNFPA will continue partnering with the Government to accelerate progress towards achieving universal access to reproductive health, where the family planning needs of all women and couples will be covered, including those furthest behind,” said Ms. Vallese.  “Within the framework of the Government/UNFPA Country Programme  for 2021-2025 and the newly adopted National Strategy “Healthy mother – Healthy child – Healthy future”, UNFPA will support the improvement of a health financing system to ensure increased and sustainable financing and rights and choices for all women and girls in Turkmenistan.”
Decision-making power and bodily autonomy
Family planning is also central to women’s empowerment. Together with the Launch of the Investment case, UNFPA presented key findings of the State of World Population 2021 report, which focuses on bodily autonomy.
Dr. Tamar Khomasuridze, UNFPA Eastern Europe and Central Asia Regional Advisor on Reproductive Health, reiterated that one of the reasons why women continue lacking access to quality reproductive health services is due to their limited ability to make choices about their own body without fear of violence or having someone else decide for them.
“According to the report, nearly half of all women worldwide are denied their bodily autonomy, measured through the power to make a decision about a women’s own body (SDG indicator 5.6.1) and analyzing the laws in different countries that support or constrain decision-making power of women (SDG indicator 5.6.2),” said UNFPA Regional Advisor.
In the countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the share of women not fully empowered to make choices over healthcare, contraception, and the ability to say yes or no to sex is still significant: 19 percent in Ukraine, 23 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 31 percent in Albania and 34 percent in Armenia.  In Turkmenistan, nearly 60 percent of women cannot make autonomous decisions on these fundamental issues.
Beyond the three dimensions captured in SDG indicator 5.6.1, there are other aspects of bodily autonomy that are firmly addressed through international law and that violate fundamental human rights.  They include child marriage, “honor” killings, marital rape, reproductive coercion, denial in reproductive health education and “virginity” testing, among many others.
“Our communities and countries will only be able to flourish when every individual will have the power to make decisions about their bodies and to chart their own future,” said Dr. Khomasuridze. “When women and girls can make the most fundamental choices about their bodies, they not only gain in terms of autonomy but also through advances in health and education, income, economic and employment opportunities and safety. These add up to a world of greater justice and human well-being, which benefits us all.”

Title: Social service providers completed training in Strong Families Programme as part of UN-Turkmenistan Joint Programme on social services
Content: 07 July 2021
The training was held in compliance with the Strong Families Programme and aimed at building capacity of social service providers to pilot three community-based social services led by the UNODC as part of UN-Turkmenistan Joint Programme, which are Social Services for Parents with Addictions, Social Services for Adolescents at Risk of Contact with Criminal Justice and Social Service for Families with Children in Difficult Life Situations. During the five-day intensive training, 20 people from 7 governmental and non-governmental social service providers enhanced their knowledge and improved their professional preparation to carry out group sessions with families in Ashgabat.
The Strong Families Programme, designed for challenged settings, provides an evidence-informed prevention response to substance use, youth violence and crime by building family skills. These skills help with healthy and safe development of children from both genders. The programme was adapted to local context to serve families in difficult life situations. The training aimed to prepare specialists to help parents in improving their confidence in family management skills, improving parenting skills, improving child behavior and increasing their capacity to cope with stress.
It is expected that social service providers in velayats will also have an opportunity to receive training according to the Strong Family Programme in August as UNODC aims to pilot new community-based social services with national partners in the cities of Turkmenabat and Mary as well.
The Joint Programme “Improving the system of social protection through the introduction of inclusive quality community-based social services”, funded by the Joint SDG Fund, is being implemented by the partnering UN agencies, namely, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, and UNODC and Government of Turkmenistan. The Joint Programme aims to introduce a new model of social services at the community level accompanied by relative legislative reviews and capacity building of national social service workforce. The lead national partner is the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population of Turkmenistan and the lead UN agency is UNICEF. Other key national partners include the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, and Ministry of Finance and Economy.
Implementation period: 2020-2022.

Title: Next 18 months seen as pivotal in global efforts to reverse punishing pandemic impacts and boost actions to achieve key goals
Content: 06 July 2021
The decisions and actions taken during the next 18 months will determine whether pandemic recovery plans will put the world on a course to reach the globally-agreed upon goals that aim to boost economic growth and social well-being while protecting the environment.
According to the report, which tracks global efforts to achieve the SDGs, COVID-19 has caused a major disruption to people’s lives and livelihoods. While progress to achieve the SDGs had been slow even before the pandemic struck, an additional 119-124 million people were pushed back into poverty in 2020. An equivalent of 255 million full-time jobs were lost, and the number of people suffering from hunger, which was already climbing before the pandemic, may have increased by 83-132 million.
The pandemic has exposed and intensified inequalities within and among countries. As of 17 June 2021, around 68 vaccines were administered for every 100 people in Europe and Northern America compared with fewer than 2 in sub-Saharan Africa. Up to 10 million more girls will be at risk of child marriage as a result of the pandemic over the next decade. The collapse of international tourism disproportionally affects Small Island Developing States.
The economic slowdown in 2020 had done little to slow the climate crisis. Concentrations of major greenhouse gases continued to increase, while the global average temperature was about 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels, dangerously close to the 1.5°C limit established in the Paris Agreement.
Global flows of foreign direct investment fell by 40% in 2020 compared to 2019. The pandemic has brought immense financial challenges, especially for developing countries – with a significant rise in debt distress.
The 2030 Agenda, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Goals, to improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.
According to the Report, to get the SDGs back on track, governments, cities, business and industries have to use the recovery to adopt low-carbon, resilient and inclusive development pathways that will reduce carbon emissions, conserve natural resources, create better jobs, advance gender equality and tackle growing inequities.
“We are at a critical juncture in human history. The decisions and actions we take today will have momentous consequences for future generations,” said Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General of the | United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. “Lessons learned from the pandemic will help us rise to current and future challenges. Let us seize the moment together to make this a decade of action, transformation and restoration to achieve the SDGs and make good on the Paris Climate Agreement.”
Efforts to confront the pandemic have also shown immense community resilience, decisive action from governments, a rapid expansion of social protection, an acceleration of digital transformation; and a unique collaboration to develop life-saving vaccines and treatments in record time. According to the Report, these are solid foundations to build on to accelerate progress on the SDGs.
Some additional key facts and figures:
The global extreme poverty rate rose for the first time since 1998, from 8.4% in 2019 to 9.5% in 2020.
Between 1 February and 31 December 2020, Governments around the world announced more than 1,600 social protection measures, mostly short-term, in response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Pandemic-related shocks are likely to trigger a rise in stunting, which already affects more than one in five children.
The pandemic has halted or reversed progress in health and poses major threats beyond the disease itself. About 90% of countries are still reporting one or more disruptions to essential health services.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on schooling is a ‘generational catastrophe.’ An additional 101 million children and youth fell below the minimum reading proficiency level, wiping out the education gains achieved over the last two decades.
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected progress towards gender equality: violence against women and girls has intensified; child marriage is expected to increase; and women have suffered a disproportionate share of job losses and increased care work at home.
759 million people remained without electricity and one third of the global population lacked clean cooking fuels and technologies in 2019.
An economic recovery is under way, led by China and the United States, but for many other countries, economic growth is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels before 2022 or 2023.
The world fell short on 2020 targets to halt biodiversity loss and 10 million hectares of forest being lost each year between 2015-2020.
While net official development assistance increased in 2020 to a total of $161 billion, this still falls well short of what is needed to respond to the COVID-19 crisis and to meet the long- established target of 0.7% of GNI.
• In 2020, 132 countries and territories reported that they were implementing a national statistical plan, with 84 having plans that were fully funded. Only 4 out of the 46 LDCs reported having fully funded national statistical plans.
According to the Report, the recovery effort will also depend on the availability of data to inform policy making. Ensuring sufficient funding is available for data collection, both through the mobilization of international and domestic resources, will be critical to these efforts.

Title: Countries hit by the pandemic look to Sustainable Development Goals to drive effective recovery
Content: 01 July 2021
They will share their lessons, successes, shortcomings and plans at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development from 6 to 15 July.
“The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development  will put the spotlight on how to respond to the crisis and embark on a sustainable, inclusive and resilient recovery that can put us back on track to build a better world,”  said UN ECOSOC President Munir Akram. “Countries will share and reflect on the actions they have been taking to overcome the pandemic, to address its impacts and to build back better. A core issue would be whether and how they are using the SDGs as the blueprint for their response to COVID-19,” he added.
This year, 43 countries will present their Voluntary National Reviews of actions they have taken to improve people’s standard of living within planetary boundaries despite the impact of the pandemic, starting on 12 July and continuing through 15 July. To date, 168 countries have presented their progress on the SDGs since the start of the Forum in 2016.
Convened by the UN Economic and Social Council, the Forum not only evaluates progress by countries to advance the SDGs in those difficult times but also identifies areas that need more attention and policies likely to have maximum impacts on the SDGs. Over 1000 participants — from governments to businesses and civil society organisations — will gather at the Forum to learn from each other on how to pursue the SDGs implementation while promoting the COVID-19 recovery so far.
The Forum – which will feature both in person and virtual meetings – takes place under the theme of sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Nine SDGs —  Goals 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 — will be the focus of conversations, laying the ground for the upcoming Food Systems Summit in September, the UN Climate Conference in November and other high-level events.
Progress has been slow since the SDGs were adopted six years ago. Rising inequalities, hunger, climate change, lack of access to education, growing unemployment, and extreme poverty were pervasive even before the emergence of COVID-19. The pandemic has erased years of progress on some SDGs, spotlighting structural fragilities and pushing countries to chart a recovery path that is people-centered and underpinned by economic reform, digital transformation, vaccine equity and climate action.
A Snapshot of the 2021 Voluntary National Reviews
Climate Action
Antigua and Barbuda, in partnership with the Caribbean Natural Resources Institute (CANARI), is implementing a US$ 1.3 million project to improve its civil society access to climate financing. For Norway, measures to combat climate change are woven into the national policies and strategies. Preliminary figures show that the total Norwegian emission of greenhouse gases in 2020 were 50 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents. This is the lowest level since 1993, 12 per cent below the peak level in 2007 and a reduction of 1.5 million tonnes since 1990.
Economic Reform
Responding to the pandemic, Angola has focused on key economic reforms, aimed at macroeconomic stabilization, privatization and diversification away from its dependence on oil. On its part, China will account for almost a third of the world’s growth in 2021 driven by stronger private consumption and investment - supported by an accelerating vaccine rollout - coupled with buoyant exports.
Leaving no one behind
For many countries, building back better has translated into investing in human capital, social protection systems and improved labour markets to help the most vulnerable populations.
Egypt launched the Decent Life initiative to improve the lives of millions of poor in rural areas while Denmark inaugurated its “Children First” project, which seeks to ensure better conditions for equal opportunities in childhood.
Namibia passed the Social Protection Policy in 2021 to enhance existing social protection programmes and Cyprus adopted a support package for employees, the self-employed, vulnerable groups and businesses, which in 2020 amounted to €2.6 bln or 12.5% of GDP.
SDG Acceleration Actions
The SDGs Acceleration Actions, initiatives by governments and non-state actors to achieve the SDGs and support the Decade of Action for Sustainable Development, have increased from 147 in 2020 to over 300 today. Some of the actions include the launch of a project “Closing gaps – making social protection work for women in Mexico”, a digital transformation of small and medium businesses in Qatar and easier access to the justice system for persons with disabilities in Poland.
Launch of the SDGs Report 2021
The annual Sustainable Development Goals Report provides an overview of the world’s efforts to implement the SDGs to date, highlighting areas of progress and spheres where more action needs to be taken to ensure no one is left behind. The 2021 SDGs report will be launched on 6 July.
Other Special Events:
In addition to over 300 side events, there will be several special events, including the SDG Learning, Training and Practice (6-12 July),  the SDG Acceleration Action event (8 July), the SDG Film Festival (12 July), the Local and Regional Governments Forum (12-13 July), the Chief Sustianability Officers Special Event (15 July).

Title: The missing piece of the puzzle: the opening of Shar Mountain National Park creates one of the largest transboundary protected areas in Europe
Content: 01 July 2021
The creation of Shar Mountain National Park in North Macedonia means the final puzzle piece for one of the largest transboundary protected areas in Europe is now in place. With the approval of the new 627.05 square-kilometre national park, a transboundary protected area has now been established totaling around 2,400 square kilometres.
Illegal logging has until now plagued the mountain range, resulting in an increased frequency of flash floods; the new park, declared soon after World Environment Day 2021 and the launch of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration on 5 June, places precious ecosystems and habitats under strict protection.
“Historic decisions such as the creation of Shar Mountain National Park can boost the health of nature that supports all life on Earth. Ecosystem restoration is also essential to slow or reverse species loss” said the United Nations Environment Programme’s Europe Director, Bruno Pozzi. “It has been a privilege for UNEP to be with North Macedonia on this journey. In the end, it is the citizens, through their representatives, who have agreed to protect one of their natural treasures.”
“This is Shara. This is our new national park. We’ve done it. We worked so hard. It has taken over 27 years. I’d like to say congratulations to everybody. This is going to create development, tourism, infrastructure. This is going to give us and the citizens living here an opportunity to come back to live here and work here. We’re proud of it. We want the world to know it,” said Naser Nuredini, Minister of Environment and Physical Planning of North Macedonia.
After years of national debate, the Nature Division of the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning of North Macedonia has completed a broad consultation process. Different sectors of society, including hunters and environmental organisations, stepped up their efforts to consider each other’s needs and views and pave the way for a final agreement. A majority of 66 Members of Parliament voted yesterday evening at the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia in favour of the proclamation of the Shar Mountain National Park, writing a new green page in the history of their country.
“Here we don’t have factories or anything like that - only mountains. If Shar Mountain becomes a National Park, we hope for a better future. For us, the tourists and everybody,” Reshit Reshiti — a sheep farmer in the village of Veshala — said ahead of the vote.
North Macedonia is a European biodiversity hotspot. Two-thirds [i]of the country’s plant species, including numerous endemic ones, are found in Shar Mountain. More than 70 species of medicinal plants alone are collected and used there. Barely fifty critically endangered Balkan lynx are estimated to remain in the country, but they are now among the animals that have the promise of a safer future.
“Shara is home to an abundant share of all the biodiversity in North Macedonia. Here we can find animals like wolves, bears, lynxes, and foxes,” said Metodi Čilimanov, a professional mountain guide working in Shar Mountain. “Thanks to the nature, we also have Shar Mountain’s tea and tulips, as well as the wonderful saffron that grows here,” added Metodi showing a tattoo of the colourful flowers on his arm.
Shar Mountain National Park is divided into four zones with different levels of environmental protection. Only scientific research, traditional grazing and hiking on marked trails will be permitted in the strictest zone, which contains glacial lakes and peatlands and makes up around 25% of the territory. Hunting, the use of motorized vehicles, camping and the building of new houses will be banned there. Meanwhile, in the active management zone, which covers almost half of the park’s area and includes the most important forest ecosystems, economic activity that does not negatively affect nature protection will be allowed. For example, wood and stone constructions for visitors and the building of new grazing shelters is to be permitted, while motorized vehicles used by the National Park management body will be allowed to circulate. A further ‘zone for sustainable use’ covers 22% of Shar Mountain and contains infrastructure and settlements. The construction of major new infrastructure, such as ski lifts or hydropower plants, will be banned in the zone, yet camping can take place in certain locations, and visitor information centres can be built. A ‘buffer zone’ will furthermore exist around Popova Sapka Ski Resort, where measures must be taken to mitigate the resort’s environmental impact. More details of what is to be allowed in the park’s zones will be defined in the coming months.
The area covered by the park includes 30 villages with a total of more than 26,000 inhabitants. A survey conducted in April 2021 found that 82% of people surveyed living in the Shar Mountains were in favour of the proclamation. The Park is expected to bring new opportunities in areas such as eco and ethno-tourism and cattle-breeding. Meanwhile, traditional products such as cheese, honey and tea, as well as musical folklore, could be further anchored in the mountains.
“By proclaiming Shar Mountain as a National Park, we should keep this freedom and be able to protect all the values and beauties Shar Mountain has,” said Dursim Rushani, a horse keeper in the village of Bozovce.
A UNEP project initiated in 2016 with the support of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has contributed to the establishment of the Shar Mountain National Park. Under the project, a series of meetings were organized between park stakeholders, as part of a challenging process to find compromises on key issues. Valorization and socio-economic studies were furthermore conducted to identify drivers of environmental threats to the area and the opportunities a national park could create. Future rangers are now being trained to manage the park, while land degradation will be closely monitored.
The Convention on Biological Diversity is due to hold its fifteenth Conference of the Parties meeting in October in Kunming, China. The landmark meeting aims to set in motion a global movement to help countries halt and reverse land degradation. A new global biodiversity framework will be set, and is likely to include fresh targets on the proportion of national land area that should be protected.
A United Nations General Assembly resolution issued in April called on Member States to maintain and enhance the connectivity of habitats, including through increasing transboundary protected areas. North Macedonia is the latest to have offered the world a new national park that will connect wildlife beyond its borders.

Title: New MIT study says United Nations Pause campaign slows spread of life-threatening misinformation
Content: 01 July 2021
A major part of that work is the UN’s Pause campaign, which encourages people to pause to check the validity of any information they share. Now, a new study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) says the Pause campaign can bring about the behavioural change needed to stop the spread of misinformation.
The MIT study, conducted in the UK and the US, found that the simple act of pausing to question the origin, credibility, relevance and accuracy of any information before sharing it on phones, computers and social media platforms, significantly reduced people’s propensity to share misinformation. In the study, participants who saw Pause campaign content were notably less likely to share fake headlines.
“The monumental task of tackling misinformation belongs to all of us. It is about how we can come together to drive social change, shifting behavioural norms and tapping into people’s sense of solidarity to keep each other safe,” said Melissa Fleming, the UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications. “The MIT study shows that pausing before sharing is not only possible but also the responsible thing to do, especially in an age where it has become hard to separate the truth from the lies.”
The Pause campaign, created in collaboration with Purpose, a social impact agency, is part of the wider Verified initiative launched by UN Secretary-General António Guterres in May 2020 to deliver trusted COVID-19-related medical and science information and advice, and stop the spread of misinformation. According to the World Health Organization, in the first three months of 2020 alone, nearly 6,000 people were hospitalized because of COVID-19 misinformation.
The Pause campaign, which reached nearly 1 billion people in 2020, is redoubling its efforts to empower more people to share information responsibly. The new phase of the campaign asks the world to take the #PledgetoPause and flood the Internet with the pause symbol.
Guided by research, the campaign is built on the premise that by interrupting, even for a few seconds, the impulse to share something we see -- an urge often fuelled by emotions such as excitement, anger, sadness, elation, and even altruism -- we allow ourselves time to think more critically. Better judgement prevails and fewer bogus claims are circulated.
In the words of the UN Secretary-General: “During the COVID-19 pandemic, the wrong information can be deadly. Take the pledge to pause and help stop the spread of misinformation.”
ABOUT VERIFIED
Verified is a United Nations initiative, in collaboration with Purpose, that aims to empower people around the world with science-based information during the Covid-19 response. Working with UN agencies, influencers, civil society, businesses, and social media platforms, Verified creates and distributes trusted, accurate information and encourages consumers to change their media consumption practices to reduce and stop the spread of misinformation online. Website: https://shareverified.com/en/
ABOUT PAUSE CAMPAIGN
Launched as a part of the UN Verified initiative, the Pause Campaign draws on research from psychologists, neuroscientists and behavioural scientists whose studies indicate that pausing to reflect before sharing can significantly help to reduce the spread of unverified and misleading information. The overall campaign, which was launched a year ago, challenges people to break the habit of sharing shocking or emotive content impulsively and without questioning its accuracy.

Title: UNDP Regional conference on Climate Change
Content: 01 July 2021
The objective of the event is to advance the climate education, awareness and engagement in Eastern Europe and Central Asia region building upon the outcomes of UNDP’s regional climate education initiative “Climate Box”. Virtual regional dialogue aims at providing background to and sharing knowledge among countries and stakeholders. The conference consisted of 3 sessions focused on the following topics:
The conference was attended by representatives of such renowned international organizations as UNESCO, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), the European Union, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, well-known scientists and researchers on climate change, and others who noted that young people also strive and have the rights to participate in the planning and implementation of climate change measures.
The conference was also attended by teachers, who shared their experiences of distributing the climate box in their schools, involving young people in discussions on climate change and lessons learned. Climate Box is a comprehensive learning toolkit developed for teachers and school children about the climate change, which includes information materials and teaching tools on climate change designed for primary and secondary school children. The toolkit was developed as part of the UNDP’s regional education initiative, which covered 8 countries in the region. In general, a positive result was highlighted from the introduction of the manual into the curriculum, since it contributed to a better perception, greater interest of students in the problem of climate change and other related subjects.
Turkmenistan was represented by the country’s education system experts: Durdyyev Sapargeldi, head of the department for advanced training of education workers of the National Institute of the Ministry of Education of Turkmenistan, Batyrova Maya and Rotaru Tatyana, teachers of secondary schools of Ashgabat. The active participation of the Turkmen delegation in discussions and dialogues, as well as organizations of statements was facilitated by the UNDP project "Supporting climate resilient livelihoods in agricultural communities in drought-prone areas of Turkmenistan" jointly implemented with the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection of Turkmenistan and the GEF Special Climate Fund. The project, together with other UNDP projects and partners, is undertaking measures to raise awareness of climate change issues in the country.
On the second day of the conference, statements by young advocates from “Climate Box” partner countries were presented, who spoke about their personal contribution and implementation of projects on climate issues.
On this session Turkmenistan was presented by Leyli Yagshiyeva - young ambassador of SDG 13 and Gaffurova Nurana - a student of the Ashgabat secondary school #27, who spoke about their contribution to measures in combating climate change, their opinion on the Climate Box introduction in the educational process and projects for the future.
It is worth to note that an adapted version of the Climate Box was published and distributed with the assistance of UNDP among educational schools and educational institutions of Turkmenistan.

Title: UN Food Systems Summit releases potential solutions for local, regional and global action
Content: 25 June 2021
The UN Food Systems Summit has revealed the 15 action areas with more than 50 solution clusters that will serve as a key element to underpin discussions at the Pre-Summit gathering in Rome, Italy from July 26-28.
Each action area, developed by more than 500 members of the Summit’s five Action Tracks, represents a cluster of game-changing propositions that aim to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by transforming entire food systems.
The solutions, published on the online Summit Community, are an extensive menu of possible actions expected to support Member States as they work through national pathways for food systems transformation. They will also help inspire new coalitions and commitments from governments and their partners in all constituencies to support delivery of these pathways around the world, many of which will be formalised and announced at the UN Food Systems Summit in September in New York.
The solutions were refined from more than 2,000 ideas proposed during 18 months of dialogues, surveys and open fora with Indigenous Peoples, youth, producers, researchers, NGOs and governments, and represent key areas to address some of the world’s most pressing issues, from hunger and poverty to climate change.
Among the game-changing solutions are initiatives to reimagine school meals programmes as well as proposals to include the cost of a healthy diet when calculating poverty lines.
A Global Food Safety Indicator to monitor and reduce foodborne illness will also be considered along with a Responsible Meat initiative to incorporate environmental performance, working conditions and animal welfare into production and consumption.
Initial ideas for new partnerships include an Indigenous Peoples Food Systems Trust, a Coalition for African Youth in Agriculture, and a Food and Land Net Zero Country Alliance, in which countries would commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from food and land use by 2050.
Other solutions include the development of deforestation-free supply chains, and subsidies redirected towards sustainable production and consumption.
Ends
Notes to editors
Join some of the experts who have helped shape these emerging solutions and hear first-hand about the innovations that will get the world back on track to deliver the SDGs through more resilient, inclusive and sustainable food systems.

Title: UNODC World Drug Report 2021: pandemic effects ramp up drug risks, as youth underestimate cannabis dangers
Content: 25 June 2021
The Report further noted that in the last 24 years cannabis potency had increased by as much as four times in parts of the world, even as the percentage of adolescents who perceived the drug as harmful fell by as much as 40 per cent, despite evidence that cannabis use is associated with a variety of health and other harms, especially among regular long-term users. It is estimated that there are more than 1,510,000 people in Central Asia and South Caucasus, who used cannabis at least once in the past year.
"Lower perception of drug use risks has been linked to higher rates of drug use, and the findings of UNODC’s 2021 World Drug Report highlight the need to close the gap between perception and reality to educate young people and safeguard public health,” said UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly.
“The theme of the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in 2021 is “Share facts on drugs. Save lives”, said Ms. Ashita Mittal, UNODC Regional Representative to Central Asia.
She emphasized the importance of strengthening the evidence base and raising public awareness, so that the international community, governments, civil society, families and youth can make informed decisions, better target efforts to prevent and treat drug use, and tackle world drug challenges.
Moreover, most countries have reported a rise in the use of cannabis during the pandemic. In surveys of health professionals across 77 countries, 42 per cent asserted that cannabis use had increased. A rise in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical drugs has also been observed in the same period.
Drug Use Rising, but Science-Based Treatment More Available
Between 2010-2019 the number of people using drugs increased by 22 per cent, owing in part to global population growth. Based on demographic changes alone, current projections suggest an 11 per cent rise in the number of people who use drugs globally by 2030 -- and a marked increase of 40 per cent in Africa, due to its rapidly growing and young population.
According to the latest global estimates, about 5.5 per cent of the population aged between 15 and 64 years have used drugs at least once in the past year, while 36.3 million people, or 13 per cent of the total number of persons who use drugs, suffer from drug use disorders.
Globally, over 11 million people are estimated to inject drugs, half of whom are living with Hepatitis C. Opioids continue to account for the largest burden of disease attributed to drug use.
The two pharmaceutical opioids most commonly used to treat people with opioid use disorders, methadone and buprenorphine, have become increasingly accessible over the past two decades. The amount available for medical use has increased six-fold since 1999, from 557 million daily doses to 3,317 million by 2019, indicating that science-based pharmacological treatment is more available now than in the past.
The Dark Web
Drug markets on the dark web only emerged a decade ago but major ones are now worth at least US$ 315 million in annual sales. Although this is just a fraction of overall drug sales, the trend is upwards with a fourfold increase between 2011 to mid-2017 and mid-2017 to 2020.
Rapid technological innovation, combined with the agility and adaptability of those using new platforms to sell drugs and other substances, is likely to usher in a globalized market where all drugs are more available and accessible everywhere. This, in turn, could trigger accelerated changes in patterns of drug use and entail public health implications, according to the Report.
Drug sale over the Dark Web in Central Asia is also increasing quite fast. In 2020, only in Kazakhstan 1,103 websites distributing drugs were blocked and over 5,000 graffiti drawings that advertise links to the Internet resources of distribution of drugs were removed.
The Drug Market Rebounds and Shifts
The new report shows that drug markets have swiftly resumed operations after the initial disruption at the onset of the pandemic; a burst that has triggered or accelerated certain pre-existing trafficking dynamics across the global drug market. Among these are: increasingly larger shipments of illicit drugs, a rise in the frequency of overland and water-way routes used for trafficking, greater use of private planes for the purpose of drug trafficking, and an upsurge in the use of contactless methods to deliver drugs to end-consumers.
The resilience of drug markets during the pandemic has demonstrated once again traffickers’ ability to adapt quickly to changed environments and circumstances.
The number of new psychoactive substances (NPS) emerging on the global market fell from 163 in 2013 to 71 in 2019. This reflects trends in North America, Europe and Asia. The findings suggest national and international control systems have succeeded in limiting the spread of NPS in high income countries, where NPS first emerged a decade ago. However, Central Asia is facing increase in NPS and synthetic drugs on illicit market, and 119 NPS were reported only until August 2020 in the sub-region.
COVID-19 pandemic has caused drug traffickers to adapt to the new situation and introduce other options of delivering drugs to consumers (postal parcels and contactless methods) in Central Asia, and due to introduced lock downs and other COVID-19 related restrictive measures, the drug trafficking rates temporarily declined in Central Asian countries.
Drug Risks, New Developments Spurred by Pandemic
COVID-19 has triggered innovation and adaptation in drug prevention and treatment services through more flexible models of service delivery. Many countries have introduced or expanded telemedicine services due to the pandemic, which for drug users means that healthcare workers can now offer counselling or initial assessments over the telephone and use electronic systems to prescribe controlled substances. According to national reports, there were 39,000 registered drug users in Central Asia in 2020 and women make 6 per cent of them.
While the impact of COVID-19 on drug challenges is not yet fully known, the analysis suggests that the pandemic has brought increasing economic hardship that is likely to make illicit drug cultivation more appealing to fragile rural communities. The social impact of the pandemic –driving a rise in inequality, poverty, and mental health conditions particularly among already vulnerable populations- represent factors that could push more people into drug use.

Title: New social work specialists complete full cycle of training in social work
Content: 25 June 2021
Following the completion of the last phase of 45-day long training, the new social work specialists were awarded certificates of completion confirming their professional development in social work. The certificates were issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population and the UN in Turkmenistan.
The certificates awarding ceremony was held in a hybrid format with social work specialists from velayats and their senior management joining online from the regional administrative centers and social work specialists from the city of Ashgabat and representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population of Turkmenistan gathering in person. Representatives of the participating UN agencies and national trainers also joined the ceremony online.
45 social work specialists contracted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Turkmenistan within the framework of the Joint Programme and deployed to 20 pilot etraps across the country were trained by national trainers, who in turn underwent online training by the Bulgarian Social Activities and Practice Institute and travelled to all regions of the country to hold on site trainings for new social work specialists.
The series of trainings were provided over a span of 8 months from November 2020 to July 2021, comprising foundational, advanced, and specialized training in social work. The new social work specialists learned the social work theory and practice and applied them in the field in between the rounds of trainings. In addition, they were provided a monthly supervision by international experts in social services.
In the last specialized training in social work, participants mostly focused on the specific aspects of social work that prepared them to participate in piloting of a new model of community-based social services for different groups of vulnerable populations. The specialized training covered   topics such as family group conference, practices of providing support in crisis situations, collaboration in social services for integration and social inclusion of target groups, monitoring of changes in lives of beneficiaries and many others.
The Joint Programme “Improving the system of social protection through the introduction of inclusive quality community-based social services”, funded by the Joint SDG Fund, is being implemented by the partnering UN agencies, namely, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, and UNODC and Government of Turkmenistan. The Joint Programme aims to introduce a new model of social services at the community level accompanied by relative legislative reviews and capacity building of national social service workforce. The lead national partner is the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population of Turkmenistan and the lead UN agency is UNICEF. Other key national partners include the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, and Ministry of Finance and Economy.

Title: Turkmenistan uses new treatment regimens for tuberculosis
Content: 21 June 2021
Experts from WHO/Europe and specialists from the Ministry met online to discuss progress in regional operational research on the introduction of fully oral mSTR for multidrug-resistant TB and rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB). The WHO Country Office in Turkmenistan organized the virtual event within the framework of the biennial collaborative agreement for 2020–2021 between the Ministry and WHO/Europe.
TB control remains a top priority for Turkmenistan. The country’s national TB control programme, supported by WHO and partners, has led to positive changes in the epidemiological situation. The annual rate of new cases has decreased by 6% on average since the introduction of the MDR-TB programme.
WHO/Europe’s regional initiative focuses on improving treatment success and clinical care through the introduction of mSTR for MDR/RR-TB. In the WHO European Region, 14 countries including Turkmenistan have joined the initiative, and almost 1200 patients have already started the new therapy.
“Despite the fact that therapy for drug-resistant TB still requires up to 20 months of treatment, there is the possibility of reducing this to 9 months for eligible patients under programmatic or operational research conditions,” explained Dr Askar Yedilbayev, WHO/Europe TB Team Lead. “We hope that this initiative will contribute significantly to the treatment of MDR/RR-TB in the Region and also generate evidence for further WHO recommendations on the treatment of drug-resistant TB,” he added.
WHO provides continuous support to Turkmenistan in the development of national guidelines for the treatment of TB. WHO’s involvement in these activities has helped to ensure sustainable, systematic changes with the introduction of new life-saving treatment protocols.

Title: On World Refugee Day, UNHCR acknowledges inclusion of refugees in health, education and sport in Turkmenistan
Content: 20 June 2021
As of the end of 2020 Central Asia hosts 7,386 refugees and asylum seekers, including 21 refugees in Turkmenistan. Most of them have access to medical care, including COVID-19 vaccination, and education. UNHCR will continue supporting authorities and other partners to ensure full inclusion of all refugees in healthcare, education, employment and social protection to enable them to fully contribute to the development of their host communities.
“In 2021, we mark World Refugee Day amid a continuing pandemic, which has put a strain on health care, schools and our communities. But the pandemic has also taught us that we are stronger when we stand together. Given the chance to study and work, refugees will continue to contribute to a stronger, safer and more vibrant world,” said Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia.
Despite the pandemic, the number of people fleeing wars, violence, persecution and human rights violations in 2020 rose to nearly 82.4 million people, according to UNHCR’s latest annual Global Trends report released on 18 June. This is a further four per cent increase on top of the already record-high 79.5 million at the end of 2019.
World Refugee Day is an opportunity to acknowledge the experiences of the millions of people forced to flee violence and persecution. But it is also a day to celebrate the fact that, with help from welcoming communities and kind neighbours, people can find the strength to heal, rebuild and even thrive.
This year, World Refugee Day is focused on the power of inclusion in health systems, education and sports. Health care because of importance of working together to recover from the pandemic. Education because of the millions of children whose education was interrupted by the pandemic. And sports because it transcends language and nationality to bring people together. In 2021, a team of 29 refugee athletes will join the Tokyo Games with the support of UNHCR and the International Olympic and Paralympic Committees.

Title: Export Management Coaching Initiative mid-term event held in Turkmenistan
Content: 11 June 2021
Representatives of the EU Delegation to Turkmenistan, the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan, local MSMEs as well as ITC’s Ready4Trade team in Turkmenistan, were in attendance.
The Export Management Coaching Initiative, launched in January 2021, has been offering practical and action-oriented advisory services to businesses through on-the-job coaching delivered by local experts with extensive experience in import/export, certification, freight forwarding and logistics. The event presented the methodology of the initiative to key local partners and reflected upon the initial lessons learned from the coaching missions delivered to 12 Turkmen MSMEs over the past 6 months.
“Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are the pillar of most national economies. To succeed, it is important they adhere to existing rules and regulations, while national legislations and sound governance support them. With the Export Management Coaching Initiative, local MSMEs in Central Asia learn how to export internationally or expand their sales beyond traditional markets to ensure maximum diversification of trade. Coaching allows not only to fill in the knowledge gaps, but also to provide a space for an open and active dialogue and experience sharing on various export issues”, said Ambassador Diego Ruiz Alonso, Head of the EU Delegation to Turkmenistan.
During the event, MSME were able to share their experiences with participants, reflecting upon the progress achieved in their export operations. At the end of the event, the beneficiary MSMEs were awarded certificates of completion for their training.
“With the support of the Ready4Trade Export Management Coaching Initiative, Turkmen MSMEs will learn how to comply with the international market standards and regulations and become more competitive globally”, noted Mr. Serdar Annanepesov, representative of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan.
Under the Initiative, 40 Turkmen MSMEs are expected to receive coaching services by the end of the year, with special attention to women-owned enterprises. The initiative will be celebrated by a final wrap-up event in December 2021, showcasing the overall lessons learned from all the missions delivered.
The Ready4Trade Central Asia project is a joint initiative of the European Union and the International Trade Centre. Its aim is to contribute to the overall sustainable and inclusive economic development of Central Asia by boosting intra-regional and international trade in the region. Beneficiaries of the Ready4Trade Central Asia project include governments, small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular women-led enterprises, and Business Support Organizations.

Title: UNDP promotes the use of “green” transport
Content: 05 June 2021
In one of the city’s secondary schools, UNDP, together with the Environment Protection Society of Turkmenistan, successfully implemented an activity on installation of bike racks and bought bicycles for children to promote “green” transport among the younger generation.
During another event, the specialists of the UNDP Project and the Environment Protection Society delivered an open-air lesson on environmental topics, using a quiz and questionnaire, and as a result it became clear how relevant and interesting these activities were and whether the children would be willing to switch from public transport to bicycles in order to contribute to protection of the environment of their hometown.
It should be noted that avoiding the use of vehicles by using bicycles instead and walking in a fresh air have a beneficial effect not only on the urban environment, but also on the health of the population, since transport is the main air pollutant in cities. Furthermore, it is also proven that daily walking has a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system. This kind of educational activities among schoolchildren allow to increase the number of green transport users, since bicycles can be used by the whole family.
The purpose of the project is reflected on its name - sustainability can only be achieved by informing all groups of the population about the importance of activities, which are in line with the policy of Turkmenistan on environment protection. The widespread installation of bike stations will help to reduce number of car users and decrease the negative impact of transport on the city's air quality, and the installation of bike racks at School №21 is a continuation of the country's environmental campaigns to reduce the use of vehicles and switch to alternative green transport.

Title: IOM, Eurasia Foundation and USAID conduct joint training for NGOs
Content: 01 June 2021
The training brought together representatives of public organizations from various professional fields and different regions of Turkmenistan. The list of participants includes representatives from the Youth Union, the Women’s Union, National Red Crescent Society, the Nature Conservation Society, the Blind and Deaf Society, public associations “Keyik Okara”, “Yenme”, “Mashagala”, mountaineering club “Agama” and many others.
For many years, IOM is actively cooperating with public organizations that play an important role in implementation of the National Action Plan on Combatting Trafficking in Persons and strengthening NGO’s institutional capacity is one of the key components for their successful work. Current training provides leading Turkmen NGOs with an opportunity to learn methods of self-assessment that can guide NGOs on the path of self-development.
The components of organizational development include strategic planning, a system of effective management and understanding the needs of target groups, the introduction of standards that improve quality of products and services for target groups, training and development of employees and volunteers and strengthening financial sustainability. Effective communication and strengthening of an image, building of partnerships with government agencies, partners and business are also considered important components of organizational capacity. After completion of the training, nonprofit organizations possessed with knowledge and tools of self-assessment, will be able to identify areas and plan activities for strengthening their organizations.
As underlined by the international expert in the field of organizational development Mr. Alexander Lyampert (Republic of Belorussia):
“Evaluation and capacity building of personnel is an integral part of managerial objectives of any organization which want quickly and efficiently achieve their goals. That is also very important for NGO managers, whose goals are always aimed at solving serious socially significant problems, as well as their activities should be as transparent and effective as possible. This training aimed to give NGO leaders an insight about organizational development, how and why the capacity building is needed for organization, methodology of institutional assessment, as well as discussion about practical aspects of self-assessment. Participants will discuss planning and different ways to enhance the functioning of public organizations. Conducting training in a hybrid format, when one facilitator and group of participants participate remotely, and another group is offline, is very unusual, and challenging at the same time. I would like to thank the organization team for their flexibility, courage, and expertise to conduct such kind of event and wish them success in their future work”.
Ms. Ayshirin Orazberdiyeva, Chief Specialist of the International Cooperation Department of the Central Council of the Youth Society said:
“The Youth Society of Turkmenistan actively implements the State Program of the State Youth Policy of Turkmenistan. The youth of our country actively works and cooperates with international organizations. Today, we are a friendly team of public organizations participating in the training "Strenthenning the organizational capacity of public organizations of Turkmenistan through self-assessment". The purpose of the training is to introduce international experience in conducting self-assessment of the organizational activities of public organizations. We will use the knowledge gained during the training in our organization. We hope that the three days of the training will be fruitful and useful for all of us.”
“Today, during the training we witnessed how much the participants were willing to share and discuss their experiences. That makes the training interactive and helps to keep lively dynamics. Obviously, there is a substantial interest and demand in further organizational development among Turkmenistan’s NGOs. This is the first such training that IOM organizes jointly with Eurasia Foundation and USAID and we hope that it grows into more strategic cooperation” – pointed out Mr. Azat ATAJANOV, IOM Head of Office in Turkmenistan.
The event takes place during June 1-3 in the conference hall of “Yyldyz” hotel.

Participating UN agencies in the Joint Programme, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population of Turkmenistan, Mejlis of Turkmenistan, and other national partners took active part in the meetings.
During the meetings, a team of national and international consultants contracted by the UNFPA as part of Joint Programme presented a package of draft amendments and  regulations to the current legislation related to social service provision, as well as  recommendations on further developing the national legislative framework and align it to the international standards.

Thus, a legal background is to be created for the system of social service provision so that it can leave the medical paradigm in providing social services and develop a new model of community-based social services focused on the individual needs of people and aims to improve their life quality. All proposed amendments and recommendations are person-centered and rights-based and focus on engaging with individuals to help them to identify and address the barriers in their lives preventing the realization of their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and other international rights frameworks to which the Government of Turkmenistan is signatory.

The online meetings organized by the UNICEF in close cooperation with the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Turkmenistan brought together 45 specialists from 20 pilot etraps to discuss the ongoing work related to case management and needs assessment of vulnerable populations at the community level, share experiences and lessons learnt, and jointly refine strategies of support for different groups of vulnerable families.
At the end of 2020, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population (MoLSP) hired a dedicated person, a coordinator of social work specialists, to coordinate the work of social work specialists in the field as the first step to the develop professional supervision practice. To introduce high quality professional supervision in social work, the coordinator joined social work specialists in acquiring theoretical and practical skills in the field.
An international company Partnership for Every Child (P4EC) contracted by the UNICEF, in their capacity of Chief Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) to the Joint Programme on community-based social services, conducted regular coaching sessions to the coordinator of social work specialists. In these sessions, they covered the guidance on needs assessment and strategies for analyzing the collected data by social work specialists. Regular monthly online meetings of social work specialists and their coordinator led by the CTAG have been established to discuss the most difficult cases arising from the individual needs’ assessments of vulnerable population groups in pilot etraps, case management tools, as well as the resource mobilization strategies and specific challenges arising from the introduction of this new profession in Turkmenistan. The sessions resulted in better understanding of inclusive and quality social services at community level and better use of case management tools such as the development of the individual support plans for the vulnerable people and their families with the focus of improving the well-being of the whole family.
Professional supervision has an important role in social work practice. It is especially decisive for Turkmen social work specialists as it is a newly emerging profession in the country. Professional supervision focuses on solving three main tasks related to the activities of professionals, namely, improving the quality of assistance provided to beneficiaries, efficient use of working time, and prevention of professional burnout.
The Joint Programme “Improving the system of social protection through the introduction of inclusive quality community-based social services”, funded by the Joint SDG Fund, is being implemented by the partnering UN agencies, namely, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, and UNODC and Government of Turkmenistan. The Joint Programme aims to introduce a new model of social services at the community level accompanied by relative legislative reviews and capacity building of national social service workforce. The lead national partner is the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population of Turkmenistan and the lead UN agency is UNICEF. Other key national partners include the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, and Ministry of Finance and Economy.
Implementation period: 2020-2022.

Title: Improving Turkmenistan’s business environment with Ready4Trade Central Asia
Content: 05 May 2021
With this project, the European Union (EU), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and national partner institutions have joined forces to provide Turkmenistan with a key thrust for an inclusive and sustainable economic development through an increased intra-regional and international trade. Ready4Trade aims to support Turkmenistan to further boost its economy by diversifying its markets through e-commerce, by simplifying some of its trade procedures and by alleviating the most stringent barriers to trade.
Ready4Trade’s plan of action has officially been endorsed by the Turkmen government. Over 20 government agencies and public organizations took part in this internal approval process.
High-level stocktaking exercise
During a high-level online event held on 5 May 2021, stakeholders reviewed the initial outcomes and planned next steps of the Ready4Trade project. Keynote speakers included Mr. Begench Gochmollayev, Deputy Minister of Trade and Foreign Economic Relations of Turkmenistan, H.E. Mr. Diego Ruiz Alonso, Ambassador, Head of the Delegation of the EU to Turkmenistan, and Ms. Pamela Coke-Hamilton, Executive Director of ITC and Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Ambassador, Head of the Delegation of the EU to Turkmenistan Diego Ruiz Alonso:
‘The European Union believes that private sector should be placed at the heart of any country’s development, a driver of positive transformation, a source of initiatives to lead society to the future. The European Union would like to promote those same values that we use inside our borders and share with our partners experiences and lessons learned throughout the process of building the European Union’.
Representative of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan Serdarnepes Annenepesov:
‘Beneficiary SMEs are happy with the project support, which positively impacts their business activity. Specifically export management coaches help companies solve real issues. SMEs are also thankful to ITC for the numerous trade information resources, including ITC market analysis tools’.
ITC Executive Director and United Nations Assistant Secretary-General Pamela Coke-Hamilton:
‘This ambitious project signals a renewed effort to boost trade-led growth in Central Asian countries. ITC is pleased to work with the government of Turkmenistan and the business community to support a more inclusive and sustainable approach to economic development. The project aligns with the development strategy defined by Turkmenistan, with a focus on modernizing strategic areas such as trade facilitation and e-commerce’.
During this stocktaking exercise, participants discussed:
Two areas of focus: trade facilitation and e-commerce
To reach its objectives, Ready4Trade will enhance transparency of cross-border requirements, strengthen business capacities to comply with trade formalities and standards, and improve cross-border e-commerce. Activities are organized around two key areas:
Trade facilitation:
Introducing trade-facilitation reform can have significant impact on the Turkmen economy by boosting the speed and efficiency of cross-border trade procedures while reducing costs. Ready4Trade supports the government of Turkmenistan in implementing a Trade Facilitation Portal to enhance the transparency of cross-border regulatory requirements. This online platform will serve as a one-stop shop providing clear, precise and up-to-date information on trade procedures that traders have to comply with when exporting or importing specific commodities. By bringing transparency to national rules and procedures, the Portal not only reduces the time and cost for traders to search for information on trade formalities, but creates a foundation to introduce further reforms towards an enabling border environment in Turkmenistan. The project will also strengthen the capacity of businesses to comply with trade formalities and standards and enhance women’s skills and confidence to engage in international trade.
E-commerce:
Digitally enabled trade drives economic growth and creates jobs for young people, women and poor communities. It can also help SMEs reach new target markets internationally. Ready4Trade supports SMEs to identify new markets and trade online nationally, regionally and internationally. Offline SMEs benefit from specific help to create a digital presence, while more digitally advanced SMEs receive support to increase visibility and improve their current offering. Members of business associations benefit from e-commerce training and awareness-raising activities.
Ready4Trade will also help Turkmen SMEs to be better equipped in addressing the challenges in the context of the global pandemic and adapt to the growing digitalization of economies. In the wake of these new realities, Ready4Trade’s action plan has become even more relevant.
In addition, Turkmenistan while enjoying an observer’s status in the WTO since July 2020, has recently adopted new Foreign Trade Strategy 2021-2030 which specifies collaboration with ITC and WTO. The Ready4Trade project stands ready to provide initial support to the Government in the preparation of Turkmenistan’s accession to the WTO.
Turkmenistan is one of the five beneficiary countries of the EU-funded Ready4Trade project implemented by ITC.

Title: EU-UN Spotlight Initiative allocated 15 Small Grants to Central Asian NGOs
Content: 05 May 2021
The grants are intended to finance a limited range of eligible activities to support the development and strengthening of a CSO’s institutional capacity, with a focus on prevention and elimination of gender-based violence within the context of COVID-19, including domestic violence and sexual harassment at the workplace.
Addressing the audience UN Resident Coordinator for Kazakhstan Michaela Friberg-Storey noted: “Civil society organizations, including women’s rights and small grassroots organizations, are essential development actors since they not only advance referral systems and linkages between communities and the institutional services across sectors, but also render comprehensive services themselves to persons subjected to all forms of violence and discrimination”.
The COVID-19 crisis is limiting access to justice for survivors as state institutions scale down operations. Health services for survivors are hampered as overwhelmed health systems shift focus. Movement restrictions are disrupting the ability of civil society organizations to support survivors, much less provide critical lifesaving services.
“Civil society continues to be on the frontline of the global response to violence against women during the pandemic. It is imperative that these organizations are appropriately funded to leave no women and girls behind. Grassroots women’s rights organizations are at the heart of the Spotlight Initiative. To attain this ambitious goal, a comprehensive approach and an effective co-operation and partnerships among all key actors are required. The success of the Spotlight Initiative will not be possible without the full engagement of the governments and civil society in Central Asia and Afghanistan”, - noted Johannes Stenbaek Madsen, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Kazakhstan.
The Spotlight Initiative is demonstrating that a significant, concerted and comprehensive investment in gender equality and ending violence can make a transformative difference in the lives of women and girls. It is important to note that 50% of the Initiative’s global funds have been budgeted for civil society organizations.
“15 selected grantees will be able to introduce and improve their organizational systems, tools, and processes to respond to domestic violence within the COVID-19 context. Their capacities will be strengthened through rendering comprehensive services, development of guidelines, manuals and other knowledge products on, among others, effective service provision and rehabilitation; conducting analysis, research and legal reviews pertaining to sexual and gender-based violence with further recommendations”, - emphasized UN Women Representative to Kazakhstan Maria Dotsenko.
The grants were awarded to 5 organizations from Kazakhstan: Kaysar Public Foundation, Doktor S.N. Public Foundation, Public Movement Against Violence “NeMolchi.kz” Public Foundation, Centr razvitiya i socialnoi pomoschi naseleniyu “Moi Dom” Public Association, Zhartas Kazakhstan Public Foundation;
3 organizations from Kyrgyzstan: Rehabilitation Center Kaniet Public Foundation, Pozitivnyi dialog Public Foundation, Tendesh Public Organization;
3 organizations from Tajikistan: Mumtoz Public Organization, Lojvar Public Organization, World of Law Public Organization
4 organizations from Uzbekistan: NIHOL Initiative’s Development and Supporting Center, Fergana Regional branch of the Centre of citizens’ initiatives support, Istiqbol Women's Center of the Khorezm region, Kalb Nuri Centre.

Background:
The Spotlight Initiative (SI) is a global, multi-year partnership between European Union and United Nations to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by 2030. In Central Asia and Afghanistan the Spotlight Initiative is addressing legislative and policy gaps, strengthening institutions, promoting gender-equitable attitudes, and providing quality services for survivors. Interventions are also strengthening systems for collecting data on violence against women and girls and women’s movements. The Initiative joins existing efforts and complements the work of regional institutions and diverse partners. Find out more on www.spotlightinitiative.org

Title: EU-UNDRR project strengthens state-society coordination in disaster risk reduction in Turkmenistan
Content: 22 April 2021
The participants met to establish a National Platform for DRR marking an important step forward in national coordination with an inclusive approach. The move comes at an important moment when the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and increasing climate change impacts have made clear the need for accelerating action on disaster resilience.
Nurly Dowletgeldiyev, Head of Department of Emergency Situations of the Ministry of Defense of Turkmenistan, said: “The implementation of Sendai Framework cannot be achieved through a sectoral approach, but through a comprehensive approach, that is, through the coordinated collaboration of the ministries and other governmental institutions of our country. In this regard, it is planned to establish the inter-agency working group on DRR in Turkmenistan for the further advancement of efficiency of measures taken on prevention of and response to emergencies, as well as reduction of their risks.”
“The cooperation between the European Union and Turkmenistan is now framed by the new realities. First, we have to build back better after the global pandemic situation caused by the COVID-19 resolves. Second, instead of reacting to the negative changes and harmful effects of the natural and man-made disasters, we are anticipating and addressing the challenges affecting socio-economic goals and security and enhancing ability to embrace innovations and modernization. This is what we call Resilience. The current project on DRR, among other directions of cooperation, will promote and intensify cooperation on implementing the Paris climate commitments and tackling trans-regional environmental challenges to turn them into opportunities. These priorities will remain in the future EU strategy for 2021-2027,” said Renata Wrobel, the representative of the EU Delegation in Turkmenistan.
Deputy Chief of UNDRR Regional Office for Europe, Mr. Sebastien Penzini said “Turkmenistan's initiative on establishing a National Platform marks an important commitment of the country to ensure an inclusive, all of society approach to disaster resilience and safety of its population. It will support the capacity building and mainstreaming DRR within Turkmenistan as well as contributing to the resilience of the Central Asia region.”
The Defense Ministry of Turkmenistan and UNDRR agreed on the further joint actions in building capacity for disaster risk reduction. This collaboration is part of the UN Cooperation Framework in Turkmenistan for 2021-2025.
The National Platform for DRR is a multi-stakeholder national mechanism that coordinates action on risk reduction across the government and society. The Platform is based on a set of principles, including national ownership and leadership of the DRR process. The collaboration between UNDRR and the Government of Turkmenistan is guided by the Objectives of Presidential Decree No 1156 and the Basic Principles of the implementation of the State Program adopted in 2019. The State Program was developed in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, 2015-2030, the major international agreement to reduce and prevent disaster risks across the globe. The Program also supports and guides the achievement of the targets set by the Sendai Framework.
Background information
The EU-funded project “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”, implemented by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), aims to support countries of the region in implementing the Sendai Framework priorities. The project supports strengthening regional coordination, development of regional DRR strategy, national disaster loss accounting systems, and community level disaster risk reduction. On the local level, the project supports development of disaster resilience strategies of capital cities. For this project, the EU committed EUR 3,750,000 for the three year implementation.

Title: Embracing equality in a digital era In Central Asia
Content: 22 April 2021
In an increasingly high-tech world, the role of ICT is taking center stage. It is already impossible to imagine a profession that does not involve information technology in one way or another, from an entrepreneur or farmer to an artist or a ballerina.
More than half of the jobs lost during the COVID-19 crisis globally belonged to women. At a time where women's jobs are being disproportionately threatened by both the pandemic and long-term trends like automation, investing in ICT-focused jobs is a critical part of supporting a successful COVID-19 economic recovery and keeping progress toward gender equality on track.
Access to technological skills must be provided as early as possible in childhood, as shown by a  recent UNDP study in Tajikistan illustrating the fact that gender segregation in the tech sector starts with education as young women shy away from technological professions. This is especially important for girls, who are currently underrepresented in ICT education across Central Asia. Women are less than 32 percent of ICT tertiary students in Kazakhstan, and only 17.8 percent of ICT tertiary graduates in Uzbekistan.

Title: UN-Turkmenistan Joint Programme on social services builds competencies of pilot site specialists working with youth and their families
Content: 20 April 2021
The purpose of the training was to train specialists of the pilot sites, where new specialized community-based social services will be piloted. Participants learnt basic principles of family therapy that are important in providing specialized social services to adolescents with behavioral disorders and their families considering the best world practices. They also covered key elements of Treatnet Family methodology that is based upon key elements of scientifically proven family psychotherapy methods that includes therapeutic techniques, such as positive rethinking the norms of behavior, intentions and interaction; relational thinking, rethinking situations and interventions, seeing the situation from the point of other people; identifying and using strengths of the family, mitigating opposition and denial, strengthening parental interaction and support; and systematic evaluations and taking measures depending on situation.
The training, organized in a hybrid format of an online and in-person participation, was led by representatives of the UNODC Headquarters (Vienna) and the Regional Representative of the UNODC from the city of Tashkent. About 15 participants from the city of Ashgabat joined the training at the Yyldyz Hotel for an in-person training, adhering to social distancing recommendations, while participants from the other velayats and international trainers joined the training sessions on an online format.
It is expected that participants will contribute to piloting specialized community-based social services to adolescents with behavioral disorders, parents who have problems of using psychoactive substances, as well as youth in conflict with law.
The Joint Programme “Improving the system of social protection through the introduction of inclusive quality community-based social services”, funded by the Joint SDG Fund, is being implemented by the partnering UN agencies, namely, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, and UNODC and Government of Turkmenistan. The Joint Programme aims to introduce a new model of social services at the community level accompanied by relative legislative reviews and capacity building of national social service workforce. The lead national partner is the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population of Turkmenistan and the lead UN agency is UNICEF. Other key national partners include the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, and Ministry of Finance and Economy.

Title: Experts from Turkmenistan trained on the “DesInventar-Sendai” software, with support from UNDRR and the EU
Content: 20 April 2021
The workshop was organized by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), in collaboration with CIMA Research Foundation and the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC), with the support of the European Union. The event takes place within the framework of the “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia” initiative, funded by the European Union.
Measuring disaster losses is an important element in managing disaster risk. The availability of current and historical information on losses caused by disasters, analysis of tendencies, scale, and impact will help in long-term development and investment planning, in adaptation to the climate change, preparing for new emerging hazards and risks. The system is adapted to the country’s hazard profile, and is based on the existing national mechanisms of disaster information.
As a main benefit, the “DesInventar Sendai” system supports a dialogue on risk management and disaster risk reduction planning between all stakeholders from the local to the regional level. This is especially important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic which has demonstrated the need to accelerate action on disaster risk reduction and to strengthen information management and exchange.
The two-day training included theoretical and practical exercises on the “DesInventar-Sendai” modules, and brought together specialists in data and information processing and analysis.
Background information
The implementation of the “DesInventar Sendai” system software has helped more than 90 countries worldwide to develop sustainable disaster information management systems aligned with the Sendai Framework monitoring process. The system allows to analyze disaster trends and impacts through a large range of sectoral and socio-economical dimensions. As a main benefit, the “DesInventar Sendai” system supports a dialogue on risk management and disaster risk reduction planning between all stakeholders from the local to the regional level.
The EU-funded project “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”, implemented by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), aims to support countries of the region in implementing the Sendai Framework priorities. The project supports strengthening regional coordination, development of regional DRR strategy, national disaster loss accounting systems, and community level disaster risk reduction. On the local level, the project supports development of disaster resilience strategies of capital cities. For this project, the EU committed EUR 3,750,000 for the three year implementation.

Title: UNODC strengthened workforce capacity on community-based social services for youth at risk and their families in Turkmenistan
Content: 12 April 2021
The event was held in a hybrid format in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan from 12-16 April 2021 and 27 local service providers working with youth and their families from drug treatment centres, juvenile facilities, and NGOs, participated. The training aimed to prepare social service providers to pilot community-based social services for youth at risk and their families. While the very focus of the training was to build capacity of social workers and disseminate evidence-based training materials to also benefit families in resource-limited settings, this initiative at the same time contributed towards the creation of societies more resilient to drugs and crime – starting at the community level.
Ms. Anja Busse, PTRS Programme Officer, at UNODC HQ stated at the opening of the event that “The teenage years are a critical window of vulnerability to substance use disorders, because the young person’s brain is still developing, and some brain areas are less mature than others. Many factors influence whether an adolescent tries drugs, including the availability of drugs within the neighbourhood, community, and school and whether the adolescent’s friends are using them. The family environment is also important: adverse childhood experiences such as violence, physical or emotional abuse, mental illness, or drug use in the household increase the likelihood an adolescent will use drugs.”
This activity was implemented under Sub-Programme 3: Prevention, Treatment, Reintegration and Prevention of HIV of the UNODC Program for Central Asia 2015-2021 with financial support from USAID and the Joint SDG Fund in Turkmenistan.
UNODC has originally developed the "Treatnet Family" training materials thanks to the support of the Government of Japan.

Title: Over 20,000 gather at the SDG Global Festival of Action,  calling for transformative change to turn things around for people and the planet
Content: 25 March 2021
The Deputy Secretary-General stated her support for an inter-generational transition, putting youth at the forefront to allow them to shape the SDG agenda, and encouraged countries to listen to its young people to ensure we don’t return to business as usual.
Convened over two days, from 25 to 26 March, under the theme ‘A Turning Point for People and Planet’, the Festival connected government and private sector leaders with changemakers, activists, creatives and more, hosting talks, performances, interactive workshops and exhibits to inspire and mobilize action. Because of the pandemic, the dynamic in-person event moved to a virtual platform, elevating its attendance to over 20,000 remote participants from 203 countries and territories, making it the largest and most geographically diverse Festival ever.
With the world still suffering from the effects of the pandemic and many countries still in lockdown, the year 2021 was framed as a critical year to accelerate progress on the SDGs, with climate, gender equality, poverty and inequalities, and sustainable financing firmly in focus. The Festival aimed to scale up both awareness and ambition ahead of important events such as the G20 meetings, The Generation Equality Forum, The Food Systems Summit and the important COP climate conferences in Italy and Scotland towards the end of the year. Over 300 speakers from 80+ countries represented the wide range of SDG stakeholders, came together to share their knowledge and experience on how to tackle the world’s ongoing challenges, present solutions and discuss what is at stake if we fail to meet the promises of the Sustainable Development Goals.
“It’s become clear that everyone has a role in advancing this transformation,’ said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “On the one hand, we need new policies that steer our societies in the right direction. On the other, each of us is an agent for change. Our individual behaviours will add up to make the difference - powerfully so.” Marina Ponti, Director of the SDG Action Campaign who organized the Festival, echoed the sense of optimism and called to seize the opportunities that came with the unprecedented global crisis we saw last year, noting that we should use what we’ve learned to shift the way we live, consume, earn and produce. “Together, we can dream big. We can act with shared heart and conviction. And we can generate a global turning point that resets our world for good.”
Other speakers during the opening day included SDG Advocate and disability activist Eddie Ndopu who talked about how the pandemic has caused pre-existing inequities to bubble up to the surface, including a crisis of inequality, the ecological breakdown of the planet, and systemic injustices - yet shared optimism in the fact that it has also compounded humanity’s capacity for creativity, genius and resilience. David Nabarro, Special Envoy of WHO on COVID-19, echoed Eddie’s statement in his talk highlighting that only by working together and supporting each other will humanity come through this pandemic with the strength it needs to help set the world on the right path.
Chairman of Japan SDGs Action Promotion Council, Norichika Kanie, was proud to represent Japan as they became the first country to host a local edition of the Festival - the SDG Global Festival of Action from Japan, an integral component of this year’s Global Festival. Sharing local solutions and setting an example of nationwide movement for action, the spin-off was curated by 12 UN agencies based in Japan and featured Goodwill Ambassadors Misako Konno (UNDP) and MIYAVI (UNHCR), popular comedian Yuriyan Retriever, and many other multi sectoral stakeholders. Dr. Kanie urged that we work together to combine our solutions for people and planet, to light the spark for action following the vision set out by the Sustainable Development Agenda.
Representing youth climate advocates, Mitzi Jonelle Tan from the Philippines joined with an impassioned plea to recognize and empower marginalized sectors of society, especially those from the global south, who are on the frontlines of the unequal impacts of climate change, and who are not always included in the conversations on how to confront the crisis.
To interact and engage the participants at the Festival, organizations and experts helped organize 27 workshops focusing on ideation, upskilling, campaign activation and well-being, creating a unique and personalized experience for the 10,000 participants that signed up to join just the workshops alone. Workshop hosts included civil society organisations such as Social Watch, Project Everyone, Humanity Lab Foundation and the World Organisation of the Scout Movement, with more lined up for Day 2.
The creative arts were also represented with musical contributions from global artist Yoko Ono with her ode to the planet ‘I love you Earth’, as well as performances from climate activists including Patti Smith, Bomba Estéreo, and Tenzin Choegyal scheduled for Day 2, The 20 exhibits that were available to participants throughout the program included exclusive pieces by La Triennale Di Milano, street art, photography and immersive media by Oculus, Lavazza, CANON, Google Arts & Culture Lab, and Terry Riley and Sasha Waltz.

Title: UNDP took part in environmental campaign dedicated to nationwide event on planting trees
Content: 18 March 2021
Project staff, Environment Protection Society of Turkmenistan, Heads and teachers of the schools as well as students of senior classes have participated in the event. During the event, seedlings and trees were planted as well open classes were held on ecology where lively talk took place regarding the importance of environment protection, safeguarding the nature and everyone’s involvement in nature protection activities in Turkmenistan.
As was noted by the UNDP project specialists, it is important to talk about environment protection activities with the growing generation, because at this period children begin to shape well-formed understanding of the environment and it is very important that this perception is formulated properly and timely. At present, ecological culture is vital in upbringing the children and holding of such activities contributes to personal growth of the person in safeguarding the environment and nature.
It is worth to note that during the event students have demonstrated keen interest and understanding of nature and environment protection, efficient use of water and energy, waste management, use of renewable energies according to climate features of the region, and in particular, willingness to assist as a volunteer for all organizations that are involved in this field. During the lively talk, students were recommended an opportunity to voluntarily participate and independently organize such events with UNDP’s assistance and support.
Moreover, UNDP’s activity timed with the nationwide activity on planting trees which makes this event more significant. Such activities generate good practices for all people of the country, after all, the more planted trees, the cleaner the air we breathe.

“The Government of Turkmenistan adopted the National Action Plan for Gender Equality (NAPGE) for 2021-2025,” said Mr. Nuryev, Director of the Institute of State, Law and Democracy. “The second NAPGE is a comprehensive policy document, which identifies national goals, objectives, and priorities to continue advancement in the realization of gender equality in all spheres of people’s lives at national and local levels.”
The National Action Plan was developed with the support of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund. It builds on the Concluding Observations of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, other international human rights obligations relating to gender equality, the assessment results of the first NAPGE for 2016-2020, and relevant SDG goals and targets linked to gender equality committed to by the Government.
“This year we are marking a year since the COVID-19 global pandemic, which unfortunately reversed many of the gains made in gender equality,” said. Ms. Christine Weigand, United Nations Resident Coordinator a.i. in Turkmenistan. “The National Action Plan on Gender Equality comes at an important time, and will help accelerate the progress in expanding the rights and opportunities of every woman and girl in the country, despite the challenges of the global crisis.”
“Gender equality is well mainstreamed into the Cooperation Framework and all outcomes will drive the transformative change for improving the lives of women and girls in all spheres of lives, with strong focus on women and girls with disabilities, single parents, migrants, adolescents and other vulnerable groups,” Ms. Weigand added.
The seven strategic areas of new NAPGE include further enhancement of the legislation, ensuring gender-responsive healthcare, fostering equal access to education, prevention and response to gender-based violence, economic empowerment of women and girls; advancing women’s participation on all levels, including the political and social dimensions. The new Plan takes into account the socio-economic impact of the global pandemic on women and girls and outlines the measures to ensure that no one is left behind, including young girls and women with disabilities.
The NAPGE for 2021-2025 will be implemented by state and local authorities with involvement of research institutions, civil society organizations, UN Agencies, other international organizations, as well as women and young people.
“UNFPA congratulates the Government of Turkmenistan on prioritizing gender equality in the national development agenda. Investments in gender equality will support the economic growth and sustainable development of Turkmenistan,” said Ms. Ayna Seyitlieva, UNFPA Head of the Office in Turkmenistan.  “UNFPA, together with other UN agencies and partners, stands ready to support the Government in the implementation of the NAPGE by ensuring reproductive rights, preventing and responding to gender-based violence, improving the legal framework in accordance with international standards, collecting and analyzing data from a gender perspective, and supporting programs aimed at improving the health of women and girls and expanding their choices in life.”
“Achieving gender equality is the prerequisite for realizing the Agenda 2030,” declared six Youth Ambassadors for Sustainable Development Goals at the meeting.  “We, the young people, invite you all to partner – the governments, international organizations, private sector and civil society, research institutions and mass media – only together we can accelerate the progress for the Agenda 2030.”
The UN Country Team in Turkmenistan will continue mobilizing broad partnerships for the key strategic areas of the National Action Plan on Gender Equality, as well as facilitating the exchange of knowledge and expertise both at the regional and global level.

Title: UNODC strengthens forensic services in Turkmenistan
Content: 17 March 2021
The training introduced Turkmen forensic experts to international requirements for forensic examinations and highlighted the significance and importance of co-operation between law enforcement and others engaged at the crime scene and forensic laboratories. The training also focused on analytical methods used to identify and quantify drugs, poisons and their metabolites in biological fluids or tissues. Unreliable results in the work of forensic laboratories may lead to false interpretations and conclusions and consequently mislead the investigation and damage the professional reputation of the laboratory. As a result of the training, experts strengthened their competency in crime scene and evidence management and were introduced to best practices in related forensic processes.
Forensic laboratories play a crucial role in the criminal justice system, providing invaluable information that aids the investigation and prosecution of crime and allowing to build cases based on the physical evidence rather than on confessions and testimony. With UNODC supports, Turkmenistan’s laboratories are currently preparing for international accreditation of forensic services in line with international standards.

Title: Sustainable Development Goals can guide North and Central Asia to build back better, says UN report
Content: 16 March 2021
The 2021 edition of the Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report shows that the region fell short of its 2020 milestones for the Goals, even before entering the global pandemic.  In the last decade, Asia and the Pacific has made extraordinary progress in good health and well-being (Goal 3), which may partly explain its relative success in reducing the health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its population. Yet despite these hard-won gains, the region faces many challenges, such as providing an adequate healthcare workforce, reducing premature deaths and improving mental health.
Despite good progress on several goals, North and Central Asian countries need to redouble efforts in reversing negative trends. The prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity in the subregion is approximately 17 per cent of the total population and has been increasing in recent years. North and Central Asia also needs to reverse current trends on inequality indices for education, gender parity in labour force participation and compliance with labour rights.
An alarming observation in the report is regressing climate action trends (Goal 13) and life below water (Goal 14). The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for more than half of the global greenhouse gas emissions and adverse impacts of natural disasters on people and economies increase year-by-year. As we find our way out of this pandemic, the report suggests we must focus efforts on more equitable and greener growth.
“Recovery measures are an excellent opportunity for us to rethink our options for development pathways that are inclusive, more resilient, and respect planetary boundaries,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and ESCAP Executive Secretary Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. “As we enter the Decade of Action to deliver the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we need to reinforce our collective commitment to the SDGs and let it provide our compass for building back together, better and greener.”
The report highlights the impact of mandatory lockdowns and social distancing measures on data collection activities, particularly from vulnerable groups. To build back better, Governments should renew their commitments to the SDGs’ monitoring framework so that recovery can accelerate a global transformation as promised by the 2030 Agenda.
As part of its commitment to support countries with national level follow-up and review of the SDGs, ESCAP has developed a “National SDG Tracker” tool for countries looking to replicate the progress assessment found in the report. National governments can use the tool to produce snapshots of progress towards the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda.

Title: The First Shipment of Vaccines for Routine Immunization Arrives in Turkmenistan
Content: 15 March 2021
The global COVID-19 pandemic affected the health care sector globally also through the challenges related to the delivery of supplies. While mitigating the risks of the pandemic, it is essential to keep protecting people from other existing diseases and to ensure the continuation of routine immunization to prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases among children.
The Government of Turkmenistan has proactively ensured the continuation of the routine vaccination programme since the onset of the pandemic and significantly increased the funding for immunization under its five-year procurement plan for 2021-2025 with UNICEF. This procurement plan was signed last year and is a continuation of the partnership under the Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry of Turkmenistan and UNICEF for procurement services.
“Immunization is a key element of primary health care and it’s also one of the best health investments money can buy. Vaccines are critical to the prevention and control of disease outbreaks and they support global health security.  As a result of considerable investments into immunization Turkmenistan has achieved universal coverage and it is important to continue sustaining this success during the time of global health crisis we face today”, says Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan.
The Government of Turkmenistan and UNICEF will continue working together to protect critical immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic, so that ground is not lost in the fight against vaccine-preventable diseases. In addition, UNICEF is also supporting the government of Turkmenistan together with WHO to develop a national rollout plan for COVID-19 vaccination and will support its implementation together with national and international partners.

Turkmenistan ratified the UNFCCC in 1995 and the Paris Agreement in 2016 and continuously takes relevant measures on addressing a wide range of tasks set forth in those documents.
From 1999 to 2015, the country has prepared and submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat three National Communications on Climate Change, which included in-detail measures taken by Turkmenistan to prevent global climate change and adaptation to climate change.
The Fourth National Communication, which is currently being developed is a logical continuation of the previous three National Communications.
During the workshop, the UNDP project specialists have pointed out that consistent efforts are being made at the national level in order to implement obligations under the UNFCCC, including strategic, legislative and institutional measures to mitigate climate change.  One of the key steps in this direction is the adoption of the updated National Strategy of Turkmenistan on Climate Change in September 2019, which was also developed with active support  of UNDP.
It was noted during the workshop that the participation of key ministries and agencies of Turkmenistan in developing the National Communication report, whose activities are related to the contribution to climate change will significantly add value to the preparation of a quality report and strengthen the sense of national ownership.
During the meeting, the content and specific features of the Fourth National Communication on Climate Change and Biennial Update Report of Turkmenistan to the UNFCCC have been presented in detail. These documents will be prepared taking into account results of previous studies and assessments following the new UNFCCC Guidelines. Moreover, the emphasis will be given to the development and strengthening national capacities and facilitating the process of integrating climate change issues into national environmental planning and strategies.
During the workshop, presentations were made by the project specialists on the main directions of the National Communication such as inventory of greenhouse gases, adaptation to climate change and mitigation (reduction of greenhouse gas emissions).
With regard to the inventory of greenhouse gases, a useful information was provided on the New Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which will be used in conducting the national inventory. The results of previous inventories will be recalculated for all categories and sectors based on new methodology and the inventory results will facilitate to determine priority areas for reducing emissions and increasing sinks of greenhouse gases, as well as attracting new technologies and investments in this area.
In the field of mitigation, information was provided on Policies and Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including an assessment of the key macroeconomic parameters, potential to reduce greenhouse gases and the cost of certain measures.
As for the adaptation to climate change, information on vulnerability assessment and measures to adapt to climate change was described in detail, including an assessment of risks associated with climate change and development of a list of specific adaptation measures with an aggregated assessment of costs and benefits of their implementation in various sectors of the economy of Turkmenistan.
The preparation of the Fourth National Communication will promote to:
Another important issue of the meeting was the presentation and discussion of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the development of which is a key element of the implementation of the commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement and will reflect Turkmenistan's efforts to reduce emissions at the national level and to adaptation to climate change. During the event the process of developing of NDC, which is based on the consideration of the types and amounts of possible national contributions corresponding to the plans of sustainable development of Turkmenistan in the future was looked at in some detail.

“Along with learning specifics of community-based social services, we also received a lot of useful information and knowledge that we can further use in our work, such as types of assessment in social work,” Sabu Ibragimova from Ashgabat-based “Keyik Okara” said.
Kurban Bugrayev, head of the Mary-based “Mashgala” noted that he was able to upgrade his knowledge in human resource management and resource mobilization in social service provision. He was also excited about upcoming pilots of new social services as part of the Joint Programme that will also open up opportunities for social contracting in provision of social services.

Title: New UNEP synthesis provides blueprint to urgently solve planetary emergencies and secure humanity’s future
Content: 18 February 2021
The report, Making Peace with Nature, lays out the gravity of these three environmental crises by drawing on global assessments, including those from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as well as UNEP’s Global Environment Outlook report, the UNEP International Resource Panel, and new findings on the emergence of zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19.
The authors assess the links between multiple environmental and development challenges, and explain how advances in science and bold policymaking can open a pathway towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and a carbon neutral world by 2050 while bending the curve on biodiversity loss and curbing pollution and waste. Taking that path means innovation and investment only in activities that protect both people and nature. Success will include restored ecosystems and healthier lives as well as a stable climate.
“By bringing together the latest scientific evidence showing the impacts and threats of the climate emergency, the biodiversity crisis and the pollution that kills millions of people every year, [this report] makes clear that our war on nature has left the planet broken,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in the report’s Foreword. “But it also guides us to a safer place by providing a peace plan and a post-war rebuilding programme.
“By transforming how we view nature, we can recognize its true value. By reflecting this value in policies, plans and economic systems, we can channel investments into activities that restore nature and are rewarded for it,” he added. “By recognizing nature as an indispensable ally, we can unleash human ingenuity in the service of sustainability and secure our own health and well-being alongside that of the planet.”
Amid a wave of investment to re-energize economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the blueprint communicates the opportunity and urgency for ambitious and immediate action. It also lays out the roles that everyone – from governments and businesses to communities and individuals – can and must play. 2021 is especially crucial, with upcoming climate and biodiversity convention meetings  - UNFCCC COP 26 and CBD COP 15 – where governments must come up with synergistic and ambitious targets to safeguard the planet by almost halving greenhouse gas emissions in this decade, and by conserving and restoring biodiversity.
Tackling three planetary threats together
Economic growth has brought uneven gains in prosperity to a fast-growing global population, leaving 1.3 billion people poor, while tripling the extraction of natural resources to damaging levels and creating a planetary emergency. Despite a temporary decline in emissions due to the pandemic, Earth is heading for at least 3°C of global warming this century; more than 1 million of the estimated 8 million plant and animal species are at substantially increased risk of extinction; and diseases caused by pollution are currently killing some 9 million people prematurely every year. Environmental degradation is impeding progress towards ending poverty and hunger, reducing inequalities and promoting sustainable economic growth, work for all and peaceful and inclusive societies.
The report shows how this trio of environmental emergencies interact and have common causes, and thus can only be effectively addressed together. Subsidies on fossil fuels, for instance, and prices that leave out environmental costs, are driving the wasteful production and consumption of energy and natural resources that are behind all three problems.
Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, said the report highlighted the importance of changing mindsets and values, and finding political and technical solutions that measure up to the Earth’s environmental crises.
“In showing how the health of people and nature are intertwined, the COVID-19 crisis has underlined the need for a step-change in how we view and value nature. By reflecting that value in decision-making – whether we are talking about economic policy or personal choices – we can bring about a rapid and lasting shift toward sustainability for both people and the environment,” she said. “‘Green recovery’ plans for pandemic-hit economies are an unmissable opportunity to accelerate the transformation.”
Released ahead of the fifth UN Environment Assembly, the report presents a strong case for why and how urgent action should be taken to protect and restore the planet and its climate in a holistic way.
It presents examples of what transformative change can look like, and how it can create prosperity, employment and greater equality. Far-reaching change involves recasting how we value and invest in nature, integrating that value into policies and decisions at all levels, overhauling subsidies and other elements of economic and financial systems, and fostering innovation in sustainable technologies and business models. Massive private investment in electric mobility and alternative fuels show how whole industries recognize the potential gains from shifting quickly.
The authors point out that ending environmental decline in all its forms is essential to advancing many of the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular poverty alleviation, food and water security and good health for all. An example is how intensifying agriculture and fishing in sustainable ways, allied with changes in diets and lower food waste, can help end global hunger and poverty and improve nutrition and health while sparing more land and ocean for nature.
Reinforcing the call for action, the report stresses the need for stakeholders at all levels of society to be involved in decision-making, and identifies dozens of key actions that governments, businesses, communities and individuals can and should undertake in order to bring about a sustainable world.
For instance:
A sustainable future also means learning from the COVID-19 crisis to reduce the threat of pandemic diseases. The report underlines how ecosystem degradation heightens the risk of pathogens making the jump from animals to humans, and the importance of a ‘One Health’ approach that considers human, animal and planetary health together.

Title: Share of children among trafficking victims increases, boys five times; COVID-19 seen worsening overall trend in human trafficking, says UNODC Report
Content: 02 February 2021
In 2018 about 50,000 human trafficking victims were detected and reported by 148 countries. However, given the hidden nature of this crime, the actual number of victims trafficked is far higher. The Report shows traffickers particularly target the most vulnerable, such as migrants and people without jobs. The COVID-19-induced recession is likely to expose more people to the risk of trafficking.
“Millions of women, children and men worldwide are out of work, out of school and without social support in the continuing COVID-19 crisis, leaving them at greater risk of human trafficking. We need targeted action to stop criminal traffickers from taking advantage of the pandemic to exploit the vulnerable,” said UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly.
“The UNODC Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2020, coupled with the technical assistance UNODC provides through its global programmes and field network, aims to inform governments’ anti-trafficking responses, end impunity, and support victims as part of integrated efforts to build forward from the pandemic.”
Profile of the Victims
Female victims continue to be the primary targets for trafficking in persons. For every 10 victims detected globally in 2018, about five were adult women and two were young girls. Around 20 per cent of human trafficking victims were adult men and 15 per cent were young boys.
Over the last 15 years, the number of detected victims has increased, while their profile has changed. The share of adult women among the detected victims fell from more than 70 per cent to less than 50 per cent in 2018, while the share of children detected has increased, from around 10 per cent to over 30 per cent. In the same period, the share of adult men has nearly doubled, from around 10 per cent to 20 per cent in 2018. Overall, 50 per cent of detected victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation, 38 per cent were exploited for forced labour, six per cent were subjected to forced criminal activity, while one per cent were coerced into begging and smaller numbers into forced marriages,
organ removal, and other purposes. Victims’ profiles differ according to the form of exploitation. In 2018, most women and girls detected were trafficked for sexual exploitation, whereas men and boys were mainly trafficked for forced labour.
The share of detected victims trafficked for forced labour has steadily increased for more than a decade. Victims are exploited across a wide range of economic sectors, particularly in those where work is undertaken in isolated circumstances including agriculture, construction, fishing, mining, and domestic work.
Profile of the Offenders
Globally, most persons prosecuted and convicted of trafficking in persons continue to be male, with around 64 and 62 per cent respectively. Offenders can be members of organized crime groups, which traffic the great majority of victims, to individuals operating on their own or in small groups on an opportunistic basis. Traffickers see their victims as commodities without regard for human dignity and rights. They sell fellow human beings for a price that can range from tens of US dollars to tens of thousands, with large criminal organizations making the highest incomes. Traffickers have integrated technology into their business model at every stage of the process, from recruiting to exploiting victims. Many children are approached by traffickers on social media and they are an easy target in their search for acceptance, attention, or friendship. UNODC has identified two types of strategies: “hunting” involving a trafficker actively pursuing a victim, typically on social media; and “fishing”, when perpetrators post job advertisements and wait for potential victims to respond. The internet allows traffickers to live stream the exploitation of their victims, which enables the simultaneous abuse of one victim by many consumers around the globe.
Trafficking Flows
Based on the data collected from 148 countries, UNODC was able to record 534 different trafficking flows around the globe although victims are typically trafficked within geographically close areas. A typical example involves girls recruited in a suburban area and exploited in nearby motels or bars. Globally, most victims are rescued in their own country of origin. For more details, please consult the attached table on regional trends of the Report.
***
The Global Report on Trafficking in Persons is produced by UNODC every two years, to inform an effective response to this crime and place it within the context of the UN Sustainable Development Agenda. The 2020 edition covers data from the world’s largest database on trafficking victims, compiling figures from official sources across 148 countries. It also analyses 489 court cases from 71 different countries, providing more qualitative information on the perpetrators and the characteristics of this crime.

Title: Developing the Joint Programme proposal to use human security approach for mitigation of multidimensional risks of the global health pandemic in Turkmenistan
Content: 02 February 2021
The Concept Note of the proposed Joint Programme was developed by the UN Country Team in consultation with national partners as part of national response measures to mitigate the negative socio-economic impact of the global pandemic and was submitted to the UN Human Security Trust Fund in September 2020. The Concept was approved by the Fund and as the next step the full programme proposal needs to be submitted.
“The endorsement of the Concept of the proposed Joint Programme by the UN Human Security Trust Fund is a sign of acknowledgement of strategic partnership between the UN and Government of Turkmenistan”, has noted Ms. Christine Weigand, UN Resident Coordinator a.i..
The proposed Joint Programme brings together four UN agencies: UNFPA, UNICEF, UNODC and IOM, whereby UNFPA acts as the lead agency.
Key objective of this 18-month joint programme is to use the human security concept, which offers comprehensive, context specific and preventive approach to mitigate the multidimensional risks of the global pandemic, as part of the implementation of Turkmenistan’s Immediate socio-economic response plan to acute infectious disease pandemic, which was adopted in July 2020.  The programme offers opportunity to engage the youth to the implementation of the socio-economic response plan at the level of local communities.

Title: Social work managers from governmental and non-governmental organizations build their capacities ahead of piloting new social services in Turkmenistan
Content: 01 February 2021
The training was organized by the United Nations Development Programme jointly with the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population of Turkmenistan within the framework of the UN-Turkmenistan Joint Programme on introduction of quality inclusive community-based social services in the country. This training is one in the series of trainings delivered to Turkmenistan’s social service workforce that aim to strengthen their social service provision capacity in the country ahead of piloting new social services in the pilot regions this year.
The training was conducted by national experts who had successfully completed the relevant interactive online training-of-trainers provided by the Bulgarian Social Activities and Practice Institute (SAPI). The challenge of the online training to local social work managers was that it implied using electronic versions of training materials and online interactive techniques of training.
Despite the fact that the training was conducted online, the short survey conducted by the end of training demonstrated that it has successfully achieved its learning objectives set by the Joint Programme’s capacity building component. 73 out of 102 participants took a voluntary online survey, indicating that participants enhanced their knowledge and understanding in 16 topics, including the foundational concept of social work and social services, understanding problems and needs of families with children, elderly people and people with disability and other vulnerable groups, a new model of social services to support vulnerable groups, social service quality standards and principles, elements of developing new social service, monitoring and evaluation in social services.
It should be noted that initially it was planned to train 60 social work managers. However, the online modality of training provided an opportunity for the Joint Programme to go beyond its targeted audience and include more national stakeholders both from governmental and non-governmental organizations that provide social services to vulnerable groups.
The Joint Programme on “Improving the system of social protection through the introduction of inclusive quality community-based social services”, funded by the Joint SDG Fund, is being implemented by the partnering UN agencies, namely, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, and UNODC and Government of Turkmenistan. The Joint Programme is aimed at introducing a new model of social services at the community level accompanied by relative legislative reviews and capacity building of national social service workforce. The Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population of Turkmenistan is a leading national partner. Other key national partners include the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, and Ministry of Finance and Economy.

Title: UNHCR welcomes Turkmenistan’s decision to grant citizenship to 2,580 stateless people
Content: 23 December 2020
Sixty per cent of those intended to benefit from the Decree are stateless women, representing 19 ethnic backgrounds.
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, warmly welcomes this measure, the latest in a series of steps taken by the Central Asian state to address statelessness.
Over the last 15 years, Turkmenistan has granted citizenship to 26,000 refugees and stateless people. These include some 13,000 stateless people who have been naturalized since the country acceded to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons in 2011.
In July this year, a new Law on Civil Status Acts helped to prevent childhood statelessness by ensuring that all children born in the country – including those with undocumented parents – have their births registered. The new law and the resolution of existing cases of statelessness follow on commitments Turkmenistan made at a high-level event on statelessness UNHCR convened in 2019.
In the framework of the global #IBelong Campaign to eradicate statelessness by 2024, UNHCR has been working closely with the Government of Turkmenistan on statelessness prevention and resolution efforts.
“Turkmenistan has once again shown its strong leadership when it comes to eradicating statelessness, ending a plight of invisibility for thousands of people. We are confident that it will follow through to resolve statelessness and integrate each and every stateless person on its territory in the coming years, hopefully by 2024,” said Mr. Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia.
Statelessness affects millions of people around the world, often denying them access to basic rights that citizens take for granted. Some 4.2 million stateless people appear in the statistical reporting of 79 countries, but UNHCR estimates the actual extent of statelessness to be much higher.

Title: UNDP launches its Human Development Report
Content: 15 December 2020
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) released its 30th anniversary Human Development Report for 2020 titled “The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene”.
According to the report the COVID-19 pandemic is the latest crisis facing the world, but unless humans release their grip on nature, it won’t be the last. The report includes a new experimental index on human progress that takes into account countries’ carbon dioxide emissions and material footprint.
“Humans wield more power over the planet than ever before. In the wake of COVID-19, record breaking temperatures and spiraling inequality, it is time to use that power to redefine what we mean by progress, where our carbon and consumption footprints are no longer hidden,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.  “As this report shows, no country in the world has yet achieved very high human development without putting immense strain on the planet. But we could be the first generation to right this wrong. That is the next frontier for human development.”
The report argues that as people and planet enter an entirely new geological epoch, the Anthropocene or the Age of Humans, it is time to for all countries to redesign their paths to progress by fully accounting for the dangerous pressure humans put on the planet, and dismantle the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that prevent change.
To illustrate the point, the report introduces an experimental new lens to its annual Human Development Index (HDI).  By adjusting the HDI, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standards of living, to include two more elements: a country’s carbon dioxide emissions and its material footprint, the  index shows how the global development landscape would change if both the wellbeing of people and also the planet were central to defining humanity’s progress.
With the resulting Planetary-Pressures Adjusted HDI – or PHDI - a new global picture emerges, painting a less rosy but clearer assessment of human progress. For example, more than 50 countries drop out of the very high human development group, reflecting their dependence on fossil fuels and material footprint. Despite these adjustments, countries like Costa Rica, Moldova, and Panama move upwards by at least 30 places, recognizing that lighter pressure on the planet is possible.
According to the report, the next frontier for human development will require working with and not against nature, while transforming social norms, values, and government and financial incentives, the report argues.
For example, new estimates project that by 2100 the poorest countries in the world could experience up to 100 more days of extreme weather due to climate change each year- a number that could be cut in half if the Paris Agreement on climate change is fully implemented. And yet fossil fuels are still being subsidized: the full cost to societies of publicly financed subsidies for fossil fuels - including indirect costs - is estimated at over US$5 trillion a year, or 6.5 percent of global GDP, according to International Monetary Fund figures cited in the report. Reforestation and taking better care of forests could alone account for roughly a quarter of the pre-2030 actions we must take to stop global warming from reaching two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
“While humanity has achieved incredible things, it is clear that we have taken our planet for granted,” said Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy Youth. “Across the world young people have spoken up, recognizing that these actions put our collective future at risk. As the 2020 Human Development Report makes clear, we need to transform our relationship with the planet — to make energy and material consumption sustainable, and to ensure every young person is educated and empowered to appreciate the wonders that a healthy world can provide.”
How people experience planetary pressures is tied to how societies work,
says Pedro Conceição, Director of UNDP’s Human Development Report Office and lead author of the report, and today, broken societies are putting people and planet on a collision course.

Title: National Action Plan on Gender Equality for 2021-2025 signed by the Government
Content: 09 December 2020
The second NAPGE is a comprehensive policy document, which identifies national goals, objectives, and priorities to continue advancement in the realization of gender equality in all spheres of people’s lives at national and local levels. The document was developed by the Working Group of the Interagency Commission to ensure the implementation of international obligations of Turkmenistan in the areas of human rights and international humanitarian law with support of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund.
The National Action Plan builds on the 2018 Concluding Observations of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, other international human rights obligations relating to gender equality, the assessment results of the first NAPGE for 2016-2020, and relevant SDG goals and targets linked to gender equality committed to by the Government.
The seven strategic areas of new NAPGE include further enhancement of the legislation, ensuring gender-responsive healthcare, fostering equal access to education, prevention and response to gender-based violence, economic empowerment of women and girls; advancing women’s participation on all levels, including the political and social dimensions. The new Plan takes into account the socio-economic impact of the global pandemic on women and girls and outlines the measures to ensure that no one is left behind, including young girls and women with disabilities.
The NAPGE for 2021-2025 will be implemented by state and local authorities with involvement of research institutions, civil society organizations, UN Agencies and other international organizations.
“UNFPA welcomes the approval of the second National Action Plan on Gender Equality,” said Ms. Ayna Seyitlieva, UNFPA Head of the Office in Turkmenistan. “We, at UNFPA, look forward that every girl and woman in the country, especially the most vulnerable ones will benefit from the realization of the Plan. To realize the goals set in the Plan, we will need to develop strong and well-coordinated partnerships between all actors, including the communities.”
UNFPA stands ready to provide support in realization of the NAPGE within the framework of the upcoming Country Programme of Cooperation for 2021-2025 focusing on prevention and response of the gender-based violence reaching those furthest behind, including women and girls with disabilities; development of education programme on gender equality for civil servants and post-graduates; and establishing a support platform for engaging men and boys to advance positive gender practices in the society.

Title: EU-UN flagship Spotlight Initiative launched in Central Asia and Afghanistan
Content: 08 December 2020
Funded with an initial approved budget of USD 4.3 million, this regional programme is part of a global initiative funded by the European Union in over 25 countries and regions addressing different forms of violence against women as well as harmful practices.
In Central Asia and Afghanistan the Programme is focused on strengthening efforts to end sexual and gender based-violence against women and girls and by symbolically shining a spotlight on barriers that hinder them from development.
Addressing the audience, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed noted that
“since the outbreak of COVID-19 gender-based and domestic violence has increased globally, and the countries in Central Asia and Afghanistan are no exception”.
The ultimate goal of the Spotlight Programme is to create an environment where there is zero tolerance for sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices, which the national stakeholders and an estimated 35 million women and girls in the five Central Asian countries and Afghanistan will contribute to and benefit from.
EU Ambassador to Kazakhstan Mr. Sven-Olov Carlsson noted:
“I am convinced that the Spotlight Initiative will benefit from the longstanding leadership and active support of governments, institutions and civil society organisations in this region. I am glad to acknowledge that governments and institutions have committed themselves to promoting gender equality. We are therefore looking forward to the robust implementation of relevant laws and policies”.
Working in partnership with key institutions and diverse partners, the Spotlight Initiative will focus on developing good practices as well as forging alliances in the region around areas such as legislative reform, institutional strengthening, tackling social norms and attitudes, strengthening civil society and women’s movements. The measures will also include digital literacy training and engaging key stakeholders to contribute to respecting and protecting women’s and girls’ rights. The Initiative is coordinated by the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office in Kazakhstan and is implemented through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UN Women.
In her address to partners and invited guests, the United Nations Resident Coordinator Designate for Kazakhstan, Michaela Friberg-Storey emphasized:
“The Spotlight Initiative will provide an important platform for the United Nations to support the countries as they tackle the pandemic of violence, one that threatens individual health and integrity, families, communities, and the global efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in this region”.
During the event participants spoke about their work and the challenges when addressing violence against women and girls. There was a collective agreement that all stakeholders, from the UN, EU, government, chiefs, women, men, girls and boys, need to be involved, and behaviours and mindsets need to be changed to combat any form of violence.
The Spotlight Initiative provides an opportunity for a multi-sectoral, coordinated and holistic approach in addressing violence against women and girls working through multiple stakeholders including governments, service providers, civil society and other key stakeholders. Being launched during a landmark year – celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the Spotlight initiative provides an opportunity to highlight the women’s right to a life free from violence.

Title: Reviewing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in Turkmenistan
Content: 24 November 2020
The members of the Working Group were introduced to the global mega trends that have direct impact on the implementation of SDGs. The keynote speaker, Mr. Elliot Harris, Assistant Secretary-General, Chief Economist of the United Nations, brought forward the main findings of the report - "Shaping the Trends of Our Time".
“Turkmenistan's response to the global pandemic has been characterized by a strong multisectoral approach, with strategic and operational coordination across government. This multisectoral approach to government-wide governance is required to respond to mega-trends and strategic recovery”, he noted.
Importance of sharing data for effective policy making and implementation was also raised. “The availability of reliable data is an important prerequisite for understanding the impact of the global pandemic in a country, including on the macroeconomic situation and on different population groups, as well as the causes of existing vulnerabilities, in order to ensure targeted measures aimed at leaving no one behind,” Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan emphasized during the meeting.
The question of financing for SDGs was also highlighted as it is an important factor in sustainable recovery from the global pandemic and the achievement of the SDGs.
The Ministry of Finance and Economy of Turkmenistan as the main coordinator of SDG implementation in Turkmenistan presented the report on the progress in achieving nationally adopted SDGs. The Ministry also stressed the need for establishment of SDG focal points from the line ministries for the coordinated SDG data collection and analysis for the national report.
It was also noted that Turkmenistan improved its reporting to the global databases thanks to the efforts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, State Statistics Committee, the Ministry of Finance and Economy and a number of other ministries. This work is very relevant to ensure an objective assessment of Turkmenistan progress in achieving the SDGs in various global indexes.
Accelerating joint work on establishment and operationalization of the national SDG Database was agreed to be of great importance as one of the prerequisites for improving data reporting to the global databases.
The participants learned about the findings of 2019 Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey which serves as a valuable source for measuring the achievement of the SDGs in Turkmenistan. MICS is an important tool not only for monitoring the National Plan of Action on Child Rights (2018-2022), but also SDGs and other planning frameworks for identification of vulnerabilities and informing the corresponding policy actions.

Content: 24 November 2020
The event covered the issues of migration which most countries of the world are facing today. Particularly, the topics were covered social vulnerability and criminalization as a cause of labor migration growth and increased risks for certain social groups.
Participants discussed current issues related to migration and human trafficking and the ways of cooperation to combat this. One of the effective mechanisms in combatting human trafficking mentioned during the seminar was the raising awareness activities for population especially among youth.

Title: Central Asian countries strengthen cooperation to support sustainable economic recovery post-COVID-19
Content: 18 November 2020
High-level officials at the SPECA Economic Forum, which opened today, also called for strengthened regional cooperation in the areas of trade, transport, and digital connectivity. Over the next two days, they will further identify potential opportunities for enhanced cooperation to support sustainable and inclusive socio-economic recovery efforts in the subregion.
“Overcoming the COVID-19-induced developmental setback provides a unique opportunity for SPECA member States to repurpose policy priorities in making economies more resilient to future pandemics and crises. In this context, harnessing regional cooperation, especially among SPECA member States and with its neighbours, must be focused to promote the SDGs and other internationally agreed development goals,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and
Executive Secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana in her opening remarks.
“ESCAP, in close collaboration with UNECE, is committed to move forward the recommendations of the Forum to build back better and advance the SDGs for SPECA member States and beyond.”
“The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact on our economies, with a particularly strong impact on the poor and the most vulnerable,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and UNECE Executive Secretary Olga Algayerova. “I strongly support the decisions of the Governing Council in recent years to turn SPECA into a platform for subregional cooperation to achieve the SDGs. UNECE stands ready, alongside ESCAP, to help with our numerous tools: conventions, standards and best practice recommendations, to recover from the crisis and get on track for the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement – including, crucially, by accelerating the shift to a circular economy.”
This year’s Forum will review complementarities between the implementation of short- to medium- term measures to support socioeconomic recovery and responding to the call for action to accelerate implementation of relevant international agendas such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Vienna Programme of Action.
“Kyrgyzstan will continue to pay great attention to the development of regional cooperation with the SPECA member countries,” underscored H.E. Mr. Sanjar Mukanbetov, Minister of Economy of the Kyrgyz Republic.
He also noted the importance of joining efforts to overcome the negative economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the exchange of experience and recommendations on taking effective measures to protect public health in the fight against COVID-19.
SPECA countries are expected to consider accession to relevant regional and international agreements to strengthen trade and transport connectivity such as the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement, Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross Border Paperless Trade, Asian Highway Network, Trans-Asian Railway Network and IA on Dry Ports. SPECA countries will also discuss innovative financing strategies for resource mobilization efforts, and the development of national policies and action plans to step up digitalization and innovation. Recommendations emerging from the 2020 SPECA Economic Forum will be submitted for adoption to the 15th session of the SPECA Governing Council on 20 November 2020.
SPECA was launched in 1998 to strengthen subregional cooperation in Central Asia and its integration into the world economy. It also provides a platform for cross-border cooperation for the achievement of the SDGs. The countries of SPECA are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. ESCAP and UNECE jointly provide support to SPECA.

Title: UN, Government are developing a draft State program on youth policy for 2021-2025
Content: 13 November 2020
The members of the joint Working Group representing thirty-five national entities, NGOs and UN agencies met to study international experience in the development of youth policy during the first round of online meetings, facilitated by the UNFPA international expert Dr. Kateryna Shalayeva. The joint Working Group serves as an effective mechanism for the implementation of youth policy in Turkmenistan.
The participants reviewed the key elements of youth policy development, such as data, guiding principles, key concepts, main objectives, priority areas, clusters and drivers of youth policy implementation. The development cycle of youth policy and its correlation with other sectors was also learnt. The participants focused on interconnections of youth policy - youth work - youth research - youth participation - non-formal learning - educational mobility of youth - contacts between youth.
“When countries invest in health and education of young people and create conditions and opportunities for them to realize their full potential, they thereby contribute to social progress and economic development of the state. This is why youth development and participation in society are intersecting themes of the Global Sustainable Development Goals”, noted Mr. Chary Nurmuhammedov, UN Strategic Planning and Coordination Specialist of the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office.
Dr. Katerina Shalaeva shared successful experiences in the world and the region in the field of youth policy and will assist the Working Group in developing an effective, scientifically grounded Youth State Programme.
The second round of online workshops will be devoted to practical elements of youth policy implementation and will be held on November 25-27, 2020.

The event is organized jointly with the Mejlis of Turkmenistan, the Ministry of Sports and Youth Policy of Turkmenistan, as well as UN agencies, in particular UNFPA, UNDP and UNICEF, and is part of agreed Roadmap agreed between UN and Government in 2019.

Title: UNHCR urges states to end limbo for stateless people by 2024
Content: 11 November 2020
Marking the sixth anniversary of UNHCR’s #IBelong Campaign, aimed at ending statelessness by 2024, Grandi called on world leaders to include and protect stateless populations and make bold and swift moves to eradicate statelessness.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has shown more than ever the need for inclusion and the urgency to resolve statelessness. A pandemic doesn’t discriminate between citizens and non-citizens. It is not in any state’s, society’s or community’s interest for people to be left stateless and living on the margins of society,’ Grandi said.

“We must redouble efforts to resolve this affront to humanity in the 21st century.”
Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan) have made significant progress in eradicating statelessness, resolving more than 78,000 cases of statelessness in 2014-2019. In 2020, Turkmenistan adopted the new Law on Civil Status Acts, which will ensure that all children born in the country – including those with undocumented parents – will have their births registered. The law, which entered into force on 1 July 2020, will prevent childhood statelessness in the country.
Lacking important legal rights and often unable to access essential services, many stateless people are politically and economically marginalized, discriminated against and vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. In many countries, stateless people, including stateless refugees, live in sub-standard and inadequate sanitary conditions which can increase the risk of disease.
Though global data is hard to obtain as stateless populations are not always accounted for or included in national censuses, some 4.2 million stateless people are reported by UNHCR in 76 countries. The actual number is believed, however, to be substantially higher.
While significant progress has been made in reducing statelessness worldwide since the launch of the campaign in November 2014, the coronavirus pandemic has now exacerbated many of the difficulties and injustices that stateless people face.
“Without citizenship, many stateless people do not have access to or are not included in essential public health services and social safety nets. They have been left extremely vulnerable in the face of this pandemic,” said Grandi.
Some countries have, however, shown leadership by including stateless people in their response to COVID-19, ensuring they have access to testing and treatment, food, clothing and masks.  Some governments have made birth registration and other forms of civil documentation an essential service, maintaining operations despite the pandemic, helping to prevent new cases of statelessness arising.
“Statelessness is an easily resolvable and preventable issue – a matter of political will to change a person’s status and life - yet the consequences of inaction especially during the middle of a pandemic can be life-threatening,” said Grandi.
“To protect and save lives, we urge governments to resolve statelessness and make sure that no one is left behind.”

Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator to Turkmenistan, mentioned in her welcoming speech:
“This is the first joint UN effort to offer a holistic approach to transforming the delivery of social services. With the introduction of inclusive community-based social services, this Joint Programme leads to complex changes in the social service provision system through social protection, education, health and employment sectors”.

These are “Yenme”, “Keyik Okara” and Deaf and Blind Society.
The importance of sustainability of the UN- Turkmenistan Joint Programme on social services in all its components, especially securing resources for the newly created social work positions from the state budget, close cooperation with national partners in human resources capacity building trainings for the social work specialists and allied workforce, working on the standard operating procedures, and curriculum building was highlighted by the Heads of participating UN Agencies: UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA and UNODC.

*Key findings of the global UN75 report include:
Priorities for action
• Across regions, ages and social groups, respondents were broadly united in their priorities for the future.
• Amid the current COVID-19 crisis, the immediate priority for most respondents is improved access to basic services – healthcare, safe water, sanitation and education, followed by greater international solidarity and increased support to those hardest hit. This includes tackling inequalities and rebuilding a more inclusive economy.
• Looking to the future, the overwhelming concerns are the climate crisis and the destruction of our natural environment. Other priorities include: ensuring greater respect for human rights, settling conflicts, tackling poverty and reducing corruption.
Perceptions of the UN
• Over 87% of respondents believe global cooperation is vital to deal with today’s challenges, and that the pandemic has made international cooperation more urgent.
• Seventy-five years after its founding, six in 10 respondents believe the UN has made the world a better place. Looking to the future, 74% see the UN as “essential” in tackling the challenges.
• However, respondents want the UN to change and innovate: to be more inclusive of the diversity of actors in the 21st century, and to become more transparent, accountable and effective.

Title: The International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction 2020
Content: 14 October 2020
#ItsAllAboutGovernance
#DRRday
The United Nations General Assembly has designated October 13th as the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction to promote a global culture of disaster risk reduction. It is an opportunity to acknowledge the progress being made toward reducing disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Japan in March 2015.
In 2016, the UN Secretary-General launched “The Sendai Seven Campaign” to promote each of the seven targets over seven years. The 2020 target is Target E: “Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”, which lays the foundation for the implementation of the Sendai Framework and is closely linked with Priority for Action 2: “Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk.”
In keeping with the Day’s focus on the impact that disasters have on people’s lives and well-being, this year’s theme is about conveying the message that many disasters can be avoided or prevented if there are disaster risk reduction strategies in place to manage and reduce existing levels of risk and to avoid the creation of new risk. What that amounts to is “good disaster risk governance.”
In dedication of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction, UNDRR announced a Creativity Contest in Central Asia. Everyone had an opportunity to show their talent and contribute to the safety of their community by raising awareness on disaster risk reduction by submitting their work. Participants of the Creativity Contest answered the following question: “How would you reduce disaster risks in your community?”
There were 300 entries across Central Asia. Winners of the Creativity Contest in Turkmenistan are:
Participants of the Creativity Contest highlighted clear actions that local community can take in order to improve management and reduction of disaster risks. On October 13th, the message of the day is – «We must act collectively. We must avoid creating new risk, and we must systematically reduce existing risk. We must strengthen the capacity of people, communities, countries and systems to anticipate, withstand and recover better from shocks and stresses and transform through crises».

Title: COVID-19: Exchange of experience and strategies regarding the response, transition and resilience
Content: 12 October 2020
Central Asian member states shared experience and challenges for COVID-19 response and resilience at the virtual dialogue in September, 2020. The platform for discussion was provided by the EU-funded Central Asia Initiative “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”. The event was co-organized and supported by the Regional Center for Emergency Situations and Disaster Risk Reduction (CESDRR) in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
During the dialogue, countries analyzed best practices learnt from the ongoing COVID-19 response, the potential for cascading effects including a potential second wave, and effective measures to recover and build back better. Participants discussed multi-hazard approaches to building resilience in the face of a broad spectrum of pandemic consequences.
“In the context of a global pandemic, when disasters can have far greater consequences and impacts, there is a need to increase resilience at all levels and sectors, and develop strategies that address a large range of hazards and socio-economic factors,” said Mr. Octavian Bivol Chief Regional Office for Europe, UNDRR.  “Today, this initiative and the collaboration between Member States and their partners carries a new urgency as we collectively work for ending this crisis and creating the conditions for being able to say “Never Again”.
“What we have been learning so far is that even countries with strong health systems and public health capacities have been facing unprecedent challenges in their CVID-19 response. Each of them is now focusing on strengthening their health system, engaging with their communities, and recovering from the socio-economic impact of the pandemic”, said Dr Dorit Nitzan, WHO Regional Emergency Director for Europe. “Today’s meeting is our opportunity to learn from each other to increase synergies for preparedness and resilience.”
The Member State dialogue brought together National Emergency Management Organizations, Ministries of Health, Sendai Focal Points, International Health Regulations Focal Points, emergency response and risk reduction entities, representatives of the European Union and UN system organizations.
Central Asian states expressed willingness to work together in order to better prepare for the cascading impacts of the pandemic and to reduce existing and future risks.
Background information

Title: UNICEF and Turkmenistan sign a new plan to procure vaccines for the next five years
Content: 07 October 2020
“I appreciate the Government of Turkmenistan’s efforts in sustaining nearly universal rates of vaccination, which is critical for children’s wellbeing and public health,” said Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan. “We are proud that the Government considers UNICEF as a partner of choice in procurement of quality vaccines and vaccine related equipment, and that we have been able to provide the government with continued support despite all the challenges in global delivery of supplies related to the pandemic,” said Ms.Weigand.
Since 2006, the procurement of vaccines and vaccine related supplies is fully financed by the Government, and UNICEF provides all related procurement services. UNICEF ensures that high-quality, low cost WHO-pre-qualified vaccines and safe injection and cold chain equipment are purchased and delivered to the country.
The total spending for vaccines and vaccination related supplies progressively grew since 2006 as the list of vaccines was extended and the related cold chain and logistics systems were upgraded. In 2019, three more vaccines were added to the national immunization plan to prevent pneumococcal disease, rotavirus and Hepatitis A, making the routine immunization calendar in Turkmenistan fully in line with WHO recommendations.
In many countries, immunization services have been disrupted significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, threatening the achievements in the eradication and elimination of major vaccine preventable diseases like polio and measles. In Turkmenistan, the government and UNICEF have been able to minimize the risk of disruption of routine immunization activities due to the current global pandemic and have ensured that the delivery of vaccines continued even under these difficult circumstances.
Currently Turkmenistan expressed its willingness to participate in the global COVAX facility. COVAX is a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries all around the world with equitable access to safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19, once they are licensed and approved.
Immunization and children’s health in general will remain one of the key components of the new country programme of cooperation between UNICEF and Turkmenistan for 2021-2025.

Title: UN and Governments call for strengthening transport connectivity in the SPECA region and beyond in the era of COVID-19
Content: 30 September 2020
The event brought together the representatives of ministries of transport, foreign affairs, economic development and railway authorities of countries that are part of the SPECA Programme, including Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and beyond including Georgia, as well as the UN structures, including regional economic commissions, UN country offices, and International Financial Institutions.  It was organized by the UNECE in collaboration with the UNESCAP, the UN Office of High Representative for least developed, landlocked and small island countries and the UN Development Coordination Office for Europe and Central Asia.
Ms. Olga Algayerova, Executive Secretary of UNECE,Ms. Fekitamoeloa ‘Utoikamanu, Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States,  HE Mr. Rashid Meredov, Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan, Ms. Gwi-Yeop Son, UN Development Coordination Office’s Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia and Mr. Pomoshchnikov, acting Head of UN ESCAP’s Sub-regional Office for North and Central spoke at the opening of the event.
Speakers of the event noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has negatively affected supply chains by increasing the cost and time of transportation of goods in all parts of the world, and in the SPECA countries, which are land locked.  Participants also welcomed the active collaboration among the countries of SPECA region and swift actions they have taken to simplify border procedures and introduce digital solutions to ensure smooth transportation of essential goods, including medical items and food at times of pandemic.
“Today’s dialogue presents an excellent platform to exchange experiences on transport and supply chain disruptions at the peak of recent lockdowns and the actions the countries have been taking to overcome these challenges. It also helps coordinate our actions towards a more sustainable recovery in SPECA countries, particularly on transport connectivity agenda to ultimately better serve the people,” noted Ms. Gwi-Yeop Son, DCO Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia.
Harmonization of transport standards by joining the UN transport conventions, enhancing the use of digital solutions in transport and transit procedures, development of intermodal transport as well as continued coordination of transport development initiatives were noted as some of the key elements of post-pandemic sustainable development of transport connectivity in the SPECA region.
The Regional Dialogue resulted in the adoption of the conclusions with recommendations on follow-up actions related to improving transport connectivity in the SPECA region, which among other things called on further enhancing cooperation on transport connectivity agenda building on existing platforms such as the Ashgabat initiative on reducing barriers to trade and transport using United Nations legal instruments, norms, standards and recommendations while bolstering connectivity in the SPECA region, Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024 and others.
The Regional dialogue is a consistent follow-up to global and regional initiatives on transport and connectivity, including those initiated by Turkmenistan, and is expected to contribute to the preparations of the LLDC ministerial conference on transport connectivity as well as the 2nd Global Conference on transport in 2021.

Title: 150 million additional children plunged into poverty due to COVID-19, UNICEF, Save the Children say
Content: 22 September 2020
NEW YORK/LONDON – The number of children living in multidimensional poverty has soared to approximately 1.2 billion due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new UNICEF and Save the Children analysis published today. This is a 15 per cent increase in the number of children living in deprivation in low- and middle-income countries, or an additional 150 million children since the pandemic hit earlier this year.
The multidimensional poverty analysis uses data on access to education, healthcare, housing, nutrition, sanitation and water from more than 70 countries. It highlights that around 45 per cent of children were severely deprived of at least one of these critical needs in the countries analyzed before the pandemic.
Although the analysis paints a dire picture already, UNICEF warns the situation will likely worsen in the months to come. Save the Children and UNICEF are committed to continue to monitor this evolving situation and work with governments and civil society to confront it.
“COVID-19 and the lockdown measures imposed to prevent its spread have pushed millions of children deeper into poverty,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “Families on the cusp of escaping poverty have been pulled back in, while others are experiencing levels of deprivation they have never seen before. Most concerningly, we are closer to the beginning of this crisis than its end.”
The report notes that child poverty is much more than a monetary value. Although measures of monetary poverty such as household income are important, they provide only a partial view of the plight of children living in poverty. To understand the full extent of child poverty, all potential deprivations must be analysed directly. This also points to the need to implement multi-sectoral policies addressing health, education, nutrition, water and sanitation and housing deprivations to end multidimensional poverty.
Social protection, inclusive fiscal policies, investments in social services, and employment and labor market interventions to support families are critical to lifting children out of poverty and preventing further devastation. This includes expanding access to quality health care and providing the tools and technology needed for children to continue their education remotely; and investing in family-friendly policies such as paid leave and child care.
“This pandemic has already caused the biggest global education emergency in history, and the increase in poverty will make it very hard for the most vulnerable children and their families to make up for the loss”, said Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children. “Children who lose out on education are more likely to be forced into child labour or early marriage and be trapped in a cycle of poverty for years to come. We cannot afford to let a whole generation of children become victims of this pandemic. National governments and the international community must step up to soften the blow.”
There are not only more children experiencing poverty than before, the poorest children are getting poorer as well, the report notes. Some children may suffer one or more deprivations and others experience none at all, therefore the average number of deprivations suffered per child can be used to assess how poor children are. Before the pandemic, the average number of severe deprivations per child was around 0.7. It is now estimated to have increased by 15 per cent to around 0.85.
“We must act now to prevent additional children from being deprived in basic life needs like school, medicine, food, water and shelter,” said Fore. “Governments must prioritize the most marginalized children and their families through rapid expansion of social protection systems including cash transfers and child benefits, remote learning opportunities, healthcare services and school feeding. Making these critical investments now can help countries to prepare for future shocks.”
###
Notes to editors:
To reach the number of deprivations children are experiencing before the pandemic and today, UNICEF and Save the Children looked at how many children were deprived of each indicator of multidimensional poverty and compared it with the child population in the countries analyzed.

Title: Top UN economists warn of crises of our own making if global “megatrends” left unchecked
Content: 17 September 2020
New York–Five human-made “megatrends” will continue to dominate and frustrate global efforts to put the world on a more sustainable and prosperous path, unless urgent policy interventions to influence them are taken now, the UN Economist Network warned today in a new report.
The chief economists in the United Nations system jointly identified climate change and nature degradation, inequalities, urbanization, rapid population changes and technological revolution as the five “megatrends” that will shape our world over the course of this century. Whether their impact is positive or negative overall will depend on the policies implemented today, the report authors say.
The report, “Shaping the Trends of Our Time,” finds that five years into implementation of the Sustainable Development Agenda, progress is already off-track and, in many instances may have even been reversed by the COVID-19 crisis. Policy commitments have not translated into policy actions. Sustainable finance is increasing, but neither fast enough nor at the necessary scale. “The change in our behaviour and mindsets does not yet match our ambitions for sustainable development.”
Issued on the eve of the 75th UN General Assembly, the UN Economist Network’s report calls for a new, holistic way of designing policies in the 75 years to come. It argues for greater cooperation across seemingly unrelated areas, such as digitalization, urban planning and energy production, traditionally too often approached in isolation. The current deficiencies – or outright failures – in policies, the report authors warn, will inevitably result in negative impacts of megatrends.
Without an overhaul of the current disjointed policymaking, the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the 15-year global objectives to improve the lives of people everywhere, is highly unlikely, according to the report.
“Decades in the making, these megatrends cannot be easily undone or changed in any significant way in the immediate term. But they are the result of human activity, and therefore they can be shaped over time by consistent policies,” said Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs that led the report preparation.
For example, decades of sustained and targeted policies have contributed to one of our lifetime’s biggest shifts in megatrends: the drastic changes in the world population. From a peak of 2% in the 1960s, average annual growth of the global population has slowed down to 1% at present and is expected to cease entirely by the end of the century.
The associated decrease in fertility rates can support greater gender equality, as women spend less of their lives in childbearing and childcare roles. On the other hand, rapid population ageing raises concerns about constraints on innovation, productivity and macroeconomic dynamism.
Such interlinkages, the new report argues, need to be carefully considered in policy design, not only within one megatrend, but across all of them. “Because each megatrend also affects the other megatrends, policy interventions in one area can generate positive and mutually reinforcing impacts in another,” said Liu Zhenmin.
For example, urbanization brings together all the factors necessary for technological innovation and productivity gains. And although urban centres generate most global greenhouse gas emissions and close to half of all waste, proper planning and control can overcome the damages to the environment and contribute to equity and sustainability. Managing these trade-offs is just as important as boosting co-benefits, the report argues.
Technological innovation and digitalization, for instance, have clearly accentuated income inequalities, especially in the time of online learning and remote work. And climate change can reinforce rural-urban migration by displacing hundreds of millions of people from coastal areas and from lands hit by drought.
The report stresses that international cooperation, and the United Nations, have a crucial role in framing the responses to the global megatrends, by encouraging domestic political consensus for sustained action. The UN can also assist in mobilizing the global support needed for individual countries, particularly those with fewer resources.
Additional quotes
Achim Steiner, Administrator of UNDP: “In 2020, as a result of COVID-19, global human development is set to decline for the first time since the measure began. But as this megatrends report highlights, the pandemic has also moved the frontier of what is possible. In the face of crisis, countries are making bold choices to rapidly expand social protection, invest in a green economy, and close the digital divide, so that we can build forward better. The report also issues a clear warning: recovery from crisis cannot be driven by a zero-sum game of economy versus environment. Rather, this is a once-in-a-generation chance to set things straight between people and the planet.”
Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director of UN-Habitat: “The Report makes a strong case for integrated policy making based on an understanding of megatrends and their linkages. Integrated policies on sustainable urbanization, for example, can at once improve cities, advance technological innovation, promote climate action, manage ageing populations, and reduce inequalities.” Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP): "Our continued destruction of ecosystems, biodiversity and wildlife has clear consequences on global economic development. The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most severe manifestations of these consequences in recent history. More than half of the 169 targets for the 17 Goals relate directly or indirectly to nature; understanding that the relationship between people and nature is fundamental to sustainable development - and building policies that take this relationship into consideration at every level - is the key to a more prosperous, just and healthy world."
Kunal Sen, Director of UNU-WIDER:
“It is clear that the megatrends outlined in this report represent a threat to humanity’s prospects, but it is equally clear that the effects of global megatrends on the outcomes that people most care about are, to a large degree, influenced by policy actions and can be managed through concerted and cooperative efforts. I think the call for greater collaboration across disciplines is exactly what is needed to ensure decisive policy founded on the best available evidence. There is no doubt that inequality outcomes depend not just on rates of economic growth, but also on the dedication shown to inclusive transformations in the development of states, societies, and economies around the world.”

Title: Turkmenistan media participate in briefing on messaging for parents during pandemic
Content: 17 September 2020
The briefing for reporters and editors-in-chief focused on disseminating messages for parents in the context of the pandemic, and specifically, on how to communicate with children and help them adjust to a new reality. Media representatives also learned about the recently issued UNICEF and WHO guidance on reopening of schools.
Based on international experience, media representatives were encouraged to report global COVID-19 related issues without using stigmatizing language and focusing on the positive stories of people recovering from the disease.
“Media play an important role in promoting health and hygiene messages to the population, parents and children. We’ve been partnering with media, and specifically, the State Committee for Television, Radio Broadcasting and Cinematography of Turkmenistan on developing video spots and animation series on hygiene. We look forward to expanding our partnership with national media to deliver important messages to ensure the health and wellbeing of Turkmenistan’s children during the pandemic and beyond,” said Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan.
Prior to the media briefing, UNICEF Representative had a meeting with the Deputy Chairperson of the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan responsible for culture and media and the Head of the State Committee for Television, Radio Broadcasting and Cinematography where both sides committed to collaboratively developing new programmes for children and parents on pandemic prevention, early childhood development and other priorities under the new country programme of cooperation between UNICEF and Turkmenistan for 2021-2025.

Title: Joint Statement of UN Country Team
Content: 16 September 2020
On October 24th, 2020 we will be marking the 75th anniversary of the United Nations under the global theme “The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism – confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action”.
We, the United Nations agencies working in and with Turkmenistan, come together to highlight the joint efforts to combat the global pandemic, mitigate its consequences, and build back better for the people of Turkmenistan. We would like to not only share the achievements so far and what we see as lying ahead but would also like to engage with all partners and the public on how we could strengthen our work.
The United Nations system in Turkmenistan is working closely with the national government, civil society and partners from the public and private sector since the onset of the global crisis. We supported the Government of Turkmenistan to develop a “National Plan for Preparedness and Response to Acute Infectious Diseases” and an “Immediate Socio-economic Response Plan to Acute Infectious Disease Pandemic”. Both plans were endorsed by the Government of Turkmenistan at the highest level, and the UN will continue to support Turkmenistan in the implementation of these plans which are aimed at preventing the spread of the pandemic in the country and mitigating its impact on the population of Turkmenistan.
The UN is particularly concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the vulnerable populations identified in the “Immediate Socio-economic Response Plan to Acute Infectious Disease Pandemic”: women, healthcare providers, elderly persons and those with pre-existing medical conditions, elderly persons living alone, persons living in overcrowded housing, young people, children, migrant workers, people with disabilities, people living in closed facilities, people living in remote locations, stateless persons, refugees and people living in difficult economic situations. As we know from global experience, these vulnerable populations require extra support measures.
We will recover from COVID-19 but we must use this opportunity to build back a more equal, inclusive, sustainable, safer and healthier planet. In the spirit of the Sustainable Development Goals and within the Decade of Actions launched by UN Secretary General we need to work together to ensure no group is left behind.
In the coming weeks leading up to UN Day on October 24th, we will share information on how UN Team in Turkmenistan provides coordinated support to the Government of Turkmenistan through our social media channels and websites and invite our partners and the people of Turkmenistan to engage with us. We are looking forward to continuing our joint work to shape our future together.

Title: Ministers back 5-year plan to put health in Europe on track
Content: 16 September 2020
Copenhagen, Denmark
“It is very encouraging to see Member States adopt this vision for health in our Region with such enthusiasm. I am gratified by their commitment to regional solidarity in the face of growing public health challenges, and their strong willingness to tackle pervasive inequalities,” he added.
The EPW, also known as “United Action for Better Health in Europe”, was discussed and agreed at the 70th session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe, the European Region’s health assembly, held virtually this year on 14–15 September 2020.
Under the EPW, European Member States will implement 3 core priorities:
These core priorities are anchored in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, and are aligned with the global vision set out in WHO’s General Programme of Work 2019–2023.
“COVID-19 has brought to light the weaknesses and strengths of European society. It has bluntly revealed the reality of our health systems. The most vulnerable, such as older people and people with mental health needs, often carry the heaviest burden in health emergencies; solidarity and trust between people and health authorities are under pressure; and the voices of health leaders and scientists need to be heard by politicians because health and the economy are inextricably linked. The pandemic has forced us to address these issues very quickly, but the EPW shows us how to address them in a way that generates trust, better health and ultimately builds back better societies,” concluded Dr Kluge.
Lessons learned from COVID-19
At the Regional Committee session, Dr Kluge also outlined worrying interruptions to health services in the Region during the COVID-19 pandemic:
The following 3 key lessons are highlighted in the intra-action review of the COVID-19 response and detailed in the report of the Regional Director.
Notes to editors
The European Programme of Work 2020–2025
The EPW sets down how WHO/Europe will help countries individually and collectively across the Region to meet citizens’ expectations for health. This work is built around 3 core regional priorities that together contribute to WHO’s global programme:
Underpinning these priorities is the principle of reducing health inequalities and leaving no one behind. This means investing in health and social care, working to reduce gender and social gaps in health outcomes within countries, paying attention to vulnerable people, and responding to migration-related challenges.
The EPW seeks to strengthen the leadership capabilities of health authorities, building their capacity to provide effective health leadership and to engage with other policy sectors.
Four flagship initiatives on cultural and behavioural insights, mental health, digital health, and immunization have been identified as accelerators of change to deliver the EPW. The flagships focus on critical issues that are high on Member States’ agendas and that offer opportunities for transformative change.
The result of an intensive consultative process with Member States, the European Commission, the Central European Initiative, United Nations agencies, civil society and WHO staff, the EPW also takes account of the seismic changes that have taken place globally and across the Region due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The WHO Regional Committee for Europe
The WHO Regional Committee for Europe is WHO’s decision-making body in the European Region. It comprises representatives of each Member State in the Region, and meets in September each year. This year’s session is the first Regional Committee under Dr Kluge, who was nominated by Member States as the new WHO Regional Director for Europe at last year’s session.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ministers, partner organizations and civil society are meeting virtually for a shortened programme. The session is webcast live in English and Russian, with proceedings covered on WHO/Europe’s social media channels using #RC70Europe.

Content: 16 September 2020
During the session, Mr. Chakib Zouaghi, Partnerships & Programme Officer for the Arab States, United Nations Regional Development Coordination Office (UN DCO), made a presentation on the Results-based Budgeting and its place in the UNSDCF cycle.
The Results-based budgeting approach is applied to develop costings of outputs and required budget projections according to the guidelines on the Funding Framework of the UNSDCF.
As an addition to the Results-based Management (RBM), the RBB approach is beyond the limitations of the traditional budgeting and allows to achieve more performance-based and results-driven outcomes.
“Well-developed RBM approach at the planning stage is the main precondition for using the RBB. As a time-consuming method, the RBB will take more time at the beginning of the programming/planning and will save a lot of time for the future monitoring and evaluation processes” noted Mr. Chakib Zouaghi.
The purpose of the session is an introduction to the RBB approach for the Results groups; agree on the prepared tool for the costing exercise as a part of the UNSDCF Funding Framework development process. The session was organized with support of the United Nations Regional Development Coordination Office for Europe and Central Asia.
On 14 March 2020, the Government of Turkmenistan and the United Nations System in Turkmenistan signed the 2021-2025 United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. To ensure effective implementation of the Cooperation Framework outcomes and to promote stronger linkages between program priorities and related Sustainable Development Goals, the Government and the UN agreed to establish the Outcome Results Groups.

Title: The International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction 2020, CREATIVITY CONTEST
Content: 14 September 2020
The United Nations General Assembly has designated October 13th as the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction to promote a global culture of disaster risk reduction. It is an opportunity to acknowledge the progress being made toward reducing disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Japan in March 2015.
In 2016, the UN Secretary-General launched “The Sendai Seven Campaign” to promote each of the seven targets over seven years. The 2020 target is Target E: “Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”, which lays the foundation for the implementation of the Sendai Framework and is closely linked with Priority for Action 2: “Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk.”
In keeping with the Day’s focus on the impact that disasters have on people’s lives and well-being, this year’s theme is about conveying the message that many disasters can be avoided or prevented if there are disaster risk reduction strategies in place to manage and reduce existing levels of risk and to avoid the creation of new risk.

Title: UN, Government discuss progress in implementation of preparedness and response plan of Turkmenistan to acute infectious disease
Content: 04 September 2020
The meeting brought together representatives of the national ministries and departments, the UN Agencies and Development partners accredited in Turkmenistan and provided an opportunity to review the process of CPRP implementation for better monitoring and coordination of joint efforts.
In her welcoming speech Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator stressed:
“The great amount of joint work done within the implementation of the Plan serves as an evidence of the high commitment of both the UN system and other partners to develop cooperation with Turkmenistan in the fight against the invisible common threat”.
In the course of the meeting, the national and international partners reported on the activities completed and the plans for the future. They have also shared the progress in implementation of the financial commitments under the Plan. Currently, procurement of supplies for the implementation of the Plan has exceeded 28.5 million USD including deliveries by UN, Government and other development partners.
The participants underlined the importance of strengthening cooperation between various parties for a more effective implementation of the National Plan at the times of pandemic.
“Given the increasing spread of the pandemic in the world and the associated risks of a second wave, I believe that even more efforts remain to be done to prevent its spread in Turkmenistan: - stated Ms. Panova during the meeting.
The CPRP was approved by the Decree of the President of Turkmenistan on 22 May 2020. It was prepared in response to the call of the UN Secretary General to develop coordinated actions at the country and global levels to counter coronavirus infection within the framework of uniform standards for such plans.
The plan defines the emergency response goals, strategies and actions, and also describes the response structure and distribution of responsibilities that will ensure the coordination and effectiveness of emergency actions. The plan also identifies measures to combat COVID-19 as a result of the country capacity and preparedness assessment.
The meeting participants agreed to hold another CPRP review meeting towards the end of the year to discuss joint approaches to the implementation of the National Plan in 2021.

Title: UNDP and Partners Support Most-affected by the Global Pandemic
Content: 04 September 2020
United Nations Development Programme together with the public organization “Yenme” (for Ashgabat and Ahal region) and the National Red Crescent Society of Turkmenistan (for Dashoguz and Lebap regions) have partnered to identify and support the most affected community members under the current pandemic situation. Under the Rapid Response Facility grant allocated to tackle consequences of the global pandemic, food and hygiene parcels have been purchased to help vulnerable people in these challenging times.
“Most of the highly-affected population are referred to the vulnerable groups of population and mainly those who require support from social services. Among those groups are low-income families, children with special needs, people with disabilities, single mothers of many children, lone elderly people,” explained Gulya Chorekliyeva, Chairperson of NGO “Yenme”. “As part of our joint work, we visit people affected by the pandemic situation to distribute food and hygiene parcels and try to encourage positive thinking by showing that they are not left out alone at this critical moment of the year”
The support provided to the identified group is planned to be expanded under the Immediate Socio-Economic Response Plan to Acute Infectious Disease Pandemic for Turkmenistan. The Plan was developed by the Government of Turkmenistan, with support of the UN Country Team (UNCT) and technical lead by the UN Development Programme (UNDP).
This Socio-Economic Response Plan comprises five areas of work that together constitute an integrated support package of measures to mitigate the negative impact of the global pandemic on the socio-economic situation in Turkmenistan, with particular focus on the most vulnerable groups in line with the principle of “leaving no one behind”.

Title: World's richest countries grappling with children’s reading and math skills, mental well-being and obesity
Content: 03 September 2020
FLORENCE/NEW YORK – Suicide, unhappiness, obesity and poor social and academic skills have become far-too-common features of childhood in high-income countries, according to the latest Report Card issued today by the UNICEF Office of Research – Innocenti.
UNICEF’s Report Card Series – now running for 20 years – uses comparable national data to rank EU and OECD countries on childhood. Worlds of Influence: Understanding what shapes child well-being in rich countries uses pre-COVID-19 data and features a league table according to children’s mental and physical health and academic and social skillset. Based on these indicators the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway rank as the top three places to be a child among wealthy countries.
“Many of the world’s richest countries – which have the resources they need to provide good childhoods for all – are failing children,” said Gunilla Olsson, Director of UNICEF Innocenti. “Unless governments take rapid and decisive action to protect child wellbeing as part of their pandemic responses, we can continue to expect soaring child poverty rates, deteriorating mental and physical health, and a deepening skill divide among children. COVID-19 related support for families and children are woefully inadequate. More must be done to provide children with a safe and happy childhood – now.”
Key findings from the Report Card
Mental health: In most countries, less than four-fifths of children report being satisfied with their lives. Turkey has the lowest rate of life satisfaction at 53 per cent, followed by Japan and the United Kingdom. Children who have less supportive families and those who are bullied have significantly poorer mental health.
Lithuania has the highest rate of adolescent suicide – a leading cause of death among 15-19-year olds in rich countries – followed by New Zealand and Estonia.
Physical health: Obesity and overweight rates among children have increased in recent years. Around 1 in 3 children across all countries are either obese or overweight, with rates in Southern Europe also sharply increasing. In more than a quarter of rich countries child mortality is still above 1 per 1,000.
Skills: On average 40 per cent of children across all OECD and EU countries do not have basic reading and mathematics skills by age 15. Children in Bulgaria, Romania and Chile are the least proficient in these skills. Estonia, Ireland and Finland the most proficient. In most countries, at least 1 in 5 children lack confidence in their social skills to make new friends. Children in Chile, Japan and Iceland are the least confident in this area.
The report also contains data on clear areas of progress in child well-being. On average, 95 per cent of pre-school aged children are now enrolled in organized learning programmes, and the number of young people aged 15-19 not in education, employment or training has declined in 30 out of 37 countries. Yet, these important gains are at risk of falling back due to the impact of COVID-19.
Countries are also ranked based on their policies that support child well-being and other factors including the economy, society and environment. Norway, Iceland and Finland have the highest-ranking policies and context to support child well-being. On average, countries spend less than 3 per cent of their GDP on family and child policies.
“In times of crisis and calm, families need supportive governments and workplaces in order to raise the next generation of happy and healthy citizens,” said Fayaz King, Deputy Executive Director at UNICEF. “An investment in children is a direct investment in our future.”
Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, in the first half of 2020 most of the countries covered in the report kept schools closed for more than 100 days while strict stay-at-home policies were also implemented[1]. The report notes that loss of family members and friends, anxiety, stay-at-home restrictions, lack of support, school closures, the balancing of work and family life, poor access to healthcare, combined with the economic loss caused by the pandemic are catastrophic for children’s wellbeing, affecting their mental and physical health, and their development.
Before the COVID-19 outbreak the average relative child poverty rate across the 41 countries was 20 per cent. With GDP expected to fall over a two-year period in almost all of these countries[2], unless governments take immediate remedial actions child poverty will rise.
“As the economic, educational and social fallout of the pandemic continues to take hold, without concerted effort, there will be a worsening, devastating impact on the well-being of today’s children, their families and the societies they live in,” said Olsson. “But these risks do not have to become the reality, if governments take decisive action now to protect children’s well-being.”
On the basis of the report and these recent developments UNICEF is calling for the following steps to protect and improve child wellbeing:

Title: IOM Turkmenistan organizes online training for NGOs in the field of anti-trafficking
Content: 02 September 2020
Today representatives of about 10 NGOs – partners of IOM – are participating in an one-day online training to develop their organizations’ capacity building strategies that can help them adapt their activities to the new operational realities that emerged as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The training will focus on changes that the NGOs have to introduce in their internal organizational processes, on new approaches to the provision of services to victims of trafficking and on new formats of conducting communication and advocacy activities to prevent human trafficking.
Among other things, the participants learnt how to organize remote work more effectively, which preventive measures they should take while working in the office, how they can use video conferencing to communicate with beneficiaries and partners, how to leverage communication and advocacy work, and which opportunities are there to introduce more information and communication technologies in their operations.
In the end of the training, each organization was introduced with a capacity building strategy that can help adapt activities to the new working conditions.
The training is organized in the framework of an IOM project supported by the Government of Norway.

Title: UN and Government of Turkmenistan hold the third meeting of the Joint Working Group on socio-economic impact of COVID-19
Content: 26 August 2020
During the meeting it was noted that the Plan was developed in line with the UN framework for the Immediate Socio- Economic Response to COVID-19 and is aligned with key national development programmes, such as the National Programme on Socio-Economic Development of Turkmenistan for 2019-2025 and others.

Title: Health professionals of Central Asia and international experts discuss child and adolescent health during COVID-19
Content: 20 August 2020
The conference attended by healthcare professionals of Central Asian countries as well as of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Germany, Russian Federation and UK aimed at sharing experiences and discussing the challenges of ensuring adequate health care for children during COVID-19 pandemic in Central Asia.
Health systems in Central Asia, as in many other regions, are being confronted with rapidly increasing demand generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although current evidence shows that children are not the most affected, they are likely to suffer largely from the indirect impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. Among the first containment measures taken in many countries globally were school closures, closures of childcare facilities and restrictions on social interactions. Some countries mandated a total lock-down.
“The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the world and challenges us to protect and save lives,” said Afshan Khan, UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia who opened the conference along with Chary Agamyradov, Deputy Minister of Health and Medical Industry of Turkmenistan and Martin Weber, WHO Regional Child and Adolescent Health Programme Manager. “Central Asia, like other parts of the region, have not been spared. UNICEF has worked and continues to work closely with governments across the sub-region to ensure the availability of critical supplies such as Personal Protective Equipment, oxygen concentrators, and the training of front-line health workers. We are also supporting the resumption of essential services and the development of tools to ensure that information and knowledge is made available for individuals to protect themselves and their families from the disease,” said Ms. Afshan Khan.
Dr. Martin Weber underlined that “health systems need to be prepared if children get sick.” “WHO has published guidelines on standard case management, which will form part of the Conference. A frightening new disease without specific treatment except for oxygen runs the risk to being treated with all sorts of non-evidence-based therapies. Adhering to standard treatment guidelines and using new treatments only in the context of clinical trials is important. WHO is coordinating several of those trials. For children and adults with more severe pneumonia, the availability of oxygen is crucial, and WHO has helped assess the adequacy of the systems,” said Dr.Weber.
During the conference, experts in the field of child and adolescent healthcare discussed global, regional and country experiences in providing adequate health care for children during COVID-19. They, in particular, focused on epidemiology and clinical management of children with COVID-19, continuity of essential services, including for children with chronic diseases, effects of lockdown on children and adolescents and transition back to normal health care services after the pandemic and addressing nutrition aspects in the context of COVID-19 in schools and health facilities.

Title: Donors to Joint SDG Fund are acquainted with UN-Turkmenistan Joint Programme on social services
Content: 20 August 2020
The meeting brought together the Permanent Representatives to UN and Ambassadors to Turkmenistan of the states and multilateral organizations financially contributing to the Global Joint SDG Fund, the members of the UN Country Team and the high-level officials of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population of Turkmenistan, a leading national partner in the Joint Programme.
Ms. Aksoltan Atayeva, Permanent Representative of Turkmenistan to the United Nations was invited to make a keynote statement at the event.
“As the UN in Turkmenistan, we are especially proud to have received the funding from the Joint SDG Fund within the first call for proposals launched last year and focused on integrated policy solutions for social protection and addressing the main principle of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - Leaving No One Behind.” – stressed Elena Panova, UN RC in Turkmenistan, while opening the meeting.
In the course of the meeting, the Heads of UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA and UNODC – the four agencies participating in the programme – presented the goals, objectives and results achieved to-date in implementation of the Joint Programme.
All speakers emphasized the importance of the joint program for the country and its vulnerable population, especially in the times of great challenge the world is facing now due to the evolving pandemic. They expressed appreciation to the SDG Fund’s donor countries for helping the UN member states realize their national development priorities within the framework of 2030 Agenda.
The Joint SDG Fund, established by the UN Secretary General, supports countries in accelerating progress towards SDGs by integrating economic, social and environmental policies and applying multi-dimensional and cross-sectoral approach to complex social challenges. It serves as an effective mechanism to leverage efforts of new generation UN Country Teams in their support to help countries deliver the SDGs.
In Turkmenistan, the Joint Programme aims to develop the system, in which cash benefits and residential care services will be complemented by inclusive community-based social services to empower vulnerable people to lead independent lives within their communities. It will further expand the significance of social work within the transformed system of social service delivery in the country that reaches out to the most vulnerable and addresses their specific needs.
“By advancing human rights and tackling inequalities, exclusion and vulnerability, the results of this Joint Programme will benefit those left furthest behind. And this is the end objective of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development” – said Ms. Panova concluding her statement.

Title: UNHCR welcomes Turkmenistan’s new law to ensure universal birth registration and prevent childhood statelessness
Content: 11 August 2020
The law, which entered into force on 1 July 2020, will prevent childhood statelessness in the country.
Commenting on the measure, Yasuko Oda, UNHCR’s Representative for Central Asia, said:
“Turkmenistan’s long-standing commitment to addressing statelessness merits international recognition. The new legal provisions will prevent children from becoming stateless in the future. Measuring prevention is not easy, but it is as important as reduction. We appreciate the vision at the highest level in Turkmenistan to eradicate statelessness by 2024.”
Even though the official birth registration rate in Turkmenistan stands at 99.6 per cent, children born to undocumented persons and people with undetermined nationality were previously at risk of not having their births registered.
Birth registration is an important measure to prevent statelessness. While the lack of birth registration itself does not make children stateless, the absence of birth registration and a birth certificate can hamper the ability of people to prove their kinship and place of birth and therefore their entitlement to the nationality of any state.
The new law is the latest of several significant steps which Turkmenistan has taken to prevent and reduce statelessness in the country. It fulfils a commitment made by Turkmenistan at the High-Level Segment on Statelessness in October 2019, which brought together United Nations member states, civil society and other organizations.
In the last 15 years, approximately 23,000 refugees and stateless persons have been granted Turkmen nationality. They include some 10,000 stateless persons who have been naturalized since the country’s accession in 2011 to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons.
In the framework of UNHCR’s Global #IBelong Campaign to End Statelessness by 2024, the Office has been working in close collaboration with the Government of Turkmenistan and other Central Asian states to address statelessness and prevent new cases from occurring.
Two Regional Conferences on Legal Identity and Prevention of Childhood Statelessness were organized by UNHCR for Central Asian countries in 2018 and 2019. These high-level meetings explored how birth registration could contribute to the prevention of statelessness in ensuring that no child is born stateless in Central Asia.
Statelessness affects millions of people around the world, often denying them access to basic rights and the official recognition that most people take for granted. According to available data, there are some 4.2 million stateless people in 76 countries around the world, though UNHCR estimates the actual extent of statelessness to be much higher.

Title: Central Asia plans to implement the “DesInventar-Sendai” system software for disaster risk reduction
Content: 07 August 2020
Representatives of UNDRR, experts from the CIMA Research Foundation and ADPC presented the project “National Disaster Loss Databases implementation in Central Asia” that has been developed under the UNDRR office aegis. The goal of the project is to support the use of the “DesInventar-Sendai” software for the systematic collection, documentation and analysis of data related to disaster losses and to facilitate national reporting on the targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
The Sendai National Focal Points, experts from national emergency management organizations and national statistical offices of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan took part in the regional workshop. The participants discussed and reviewed national systems for collecting and analyzing data on disaster losses, their strengths, and areas for improvement. They stressed on the importance of improving data collection and analysis systems for national reports on the implementation of Sendai Framework and Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030. Cooperation in implementing the project and achieving its goals will continue in the countries of the region, in coordination and in collaboration with national emergency management organizations and national statistical offices.
The implementation of the “DesInventar Sendai” system software has helped more than 90 countries worldwide to develop a sustainable disaster information management system aligned with the Sendai Framework monitoring process. The system allows to analyze disaster trends and impacts through a large range of sectoral and socio-economical dimensions. As a main benefit, the “DesInventar Sendai” system supports a dialogue on risk management and disaster risk reduction planning between all stakeholders from the local to the regional level.

Title: Turkmenistan media participate in UNICEF and WHO organized briefing on risk communication
Content: 29 July 2020
Organized online by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization (WHO), and facilitated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the briefing aimed at raising awareness of reporters and editors on the effective ways of communicating messages on pandemic prevention and healthy behaviours to the general public. During the event participants also learned about UNICEF’s best practices on messaging and reporting, such as airing on the national TV of the videos and animation series on hygiene promotion developed in partnership with Turkmenistan’s State Committee on Radio and Television Broadcasting and Cinematography.
Opening the event Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan stated that “…one of the key challenges for communicating risk effectively is to be able to identify the different target audiences and the specific ways of communication and types of messages which would help people to be more conscious of the risks of infection and to adopt the right preventive behaviours.”
UNICEF Representative invited media representatives to share views and ideas on how to increase the reach of important health promotion messages and what additional content UNICEF and media could develop to keep children and families safe and healthy.
WHO’s Head of the Office Paulina Karwowska also shared opening remarks. The WHO national expert briefed reporters on the origins of COVID-19, global statistics on pandemic and WHO’s response actions and support to the Government of Turkmenistan on pandemic prevention.
UNICEF and WHO plan to hold information and capacity building sessions for media on a regular basis as part of the Country Preparedness and Response Plan of Turkmenistan.

Title: Turkmenistan promotes hygiene practices with popular actor children’s show anchor Ashir Dade
Content: 17 July 2020
The videos are aired regularly throughout the day on Yashlyk and other national TV channels of Turkmenistan, thus, increasing the viewership and engagement of children and parents. Simultaneously, the video messages are posted on UNICEF Turkmenistan’s Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/unicef.turkmenistan/) and Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/unicef_turkmenistan/?hl=en) pages, UNICEF’s  IMO account available (+993 64 718712) and the State TV Committee’s website (https://turkmentv.gov.tm/page/13?page=2).
“I am honoured to partner with UNICEF and share life-saving messages with our younger audiences and their parents,” said Ashir Dade.
Engagement with Ashir Dade started a year ago when UNICEF partnered with the State TV Committee to deliver child rights messages in the children’s show “For you, kids!” (Siziň üçin, körpeler!) anchored by Ashir Dade. “Since then, our partnership continues to grow and has resulted in producing more child-friendly content for children of Turkmenistan,” shared Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan.
Inspired by the video messages that were well accepted by the population, the State TV Committee and UNICEF embarked on another initiative to prevent the pandemic in the country. This time, children will enjoy a series of animated videos featuring young girl Merjen and boy Mergen who invite peers to follow the hygiene rules. The series will include five animated videos, one already being broadcast on the national TV.
We invite you to watch the videos featuring Ashir Dade, as well as the animated videos and share them widely with children and parents.

Title: Putting the brakes on COVID-19: safeguarding the health and rights of women and girls
Content: 11 July 2020
Today, 11 July, is World Population Day, a moment to raise awareness of the reproductive health needs of people around the world. This year, UNFPA is calling attention to the needs and vulnerabilities of women and girls amid the global pandemic, and the efforts needed to secure their health and human rights.
“No organization or country can do this alone,” said Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPA’s Executive Director, in a statement.
Heightened risks to women
Around the world, women face a variety of heightened risks due to the pandemic.
Front-line health workers – the majority of whom are women – face a direct risk of illness from COVID-19, for instance. But even women and girls outside the health sector can face risks. Those requiring reproductive health services can face anxiety about exposure to the virus while seeking care, or they may forgo care entirely. Other women are not able to receive care at all due to movement restrictions and curbed health services.
Many hospitals and health centres have reported a decline in the number of women and girls receiving critical reproductive health services, including antenatal services, safe delivery services and family planning care.
UNFPA and partners estimate that six months of significant health service disruptions could result in 47 million women in low- and middle-income countries going without contraceptives, leading to an additional 7 million unintended pregnancies. The number of maternal deaths is expected to increase.
UNFPA is working to sustain continued access to reproductive health services and supplies.
In Turkmenistan, UNFPA supports the Government within the framework of the Joint UN and Government Socio-Economic Recovery Plan  and the National Preparedness and Response Plan of Turkmenistan for Acute Infectious Disease.
UNFPA provides a technical assistance to the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry in updating the policy regulations on COVID-19 preparedness, including sanitation, personal protection, COVID-19 case management among women, specifically on principles of safe care during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding.
UNFPA also supports the health sector in procurement of the medical and sanitation supplies, as well as ensuring that the 95 reproductive health rooms countrywide do not experience a stock-out of the contraceptives. In March this year, UNFPA procured 8,000 vials of modern injectable contraceptives Sayana Press to meet the family planning needs of the most vulnerable women of reproductive age across the country.
http://www.Yashlyk.info website, operated by UNFPA Turkmenistan has been a reliable source of information for young people and their parents in Turkmen language. The site features a rubric on COVID-19 and offers World Health Organization’s recommendations on promoting healthy behavior at schools, home and community, sharing the correct information to promote prevention, as well as staying safe and positive.
Gender-based violence
Rising household tensions, exacerbated by economic pressures and movement restrictions, are sparking violence around the world. Women sheltering at home with their abusers often have nowhere to turn. And new forms of violence may be increasing, including cyber violence.
UNFPA estimates that six months of lockdowns could lead to 31 million additional cases of gender-based violence, and an additional 15 million more cases for every three months the lockdown continues.
To make matters worse, access to shelters and in-person counselling has been limited by the pandemic. UNFPA and partners are working to continue services for survivors wherever possible, and to increase remote operations.
UNFPA continues to support the Government of Turkmenistan in establishing a multi-sectoral response to gender-based violence and works closely with the healthcare, police and social sectors in the development of the standard operating procedures.  These procedures  will play a critical role within this system in ensuring that gender-based violence affected women and girls get access to essential services and providing a human-rights based, women-centered support.
The world must redouble such efforts, Dr. Kanem said: “As the global community comes together in solidarity to survive this pandemic, we lay the foundation for more resilient, gender-equal societies and a healthier, more prosperous future for all.”

Title: Marley family to ‘reimagine’ Bob Marley’s One Love in support of UNICEF
Content: 10 July 2020
Members of the Marley family will reimagine the late Bob Marley’s iconic anthem One Love to support UNICEF’s work to reimagine a fairer, more just world for children whose lives have been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Tuff Gong International and Amplified Music will release a new version of the seminal song on 17 July. All proceeds from the song and related activities will directly support Reimagine, UNICEF’s global campaign to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from becoming a lasting crisis for children and to ensure the post-pandemic world is more fair and equal for every child.
Starting today, jewellery brand and UNICEF global partner Pandora will match every dollar donated by the public to One Love, up to the value of US$1 million.
“Over forty years ago, my father wrote One Love about unity, peace and universal love during a time when there was much trouble in the world. Even in a time when we aren’t able to get together, his message remains true today, we can get through this global crisis if we come together through one love and one heart,” said Cedella Marley.
Originally recorded in 1977 by Bob Marley and the Wailers, One Love/People Get Ready is an iconic song for millions across the globe with its everlasting message to come together as one. The reimagined version of the song will be a true global anthem for 2020 featuring members of the Marley family, established musicians from all corners of the globe, artists from conflict zones around the world, and children living in vulnerable communities.
“One Love speaks directly to one key truth about this pandemic: Our best hope to defeat COVID-19 and to reimagine a more equal, less discriminatory world for children is through global solidarity and co-operation,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “We are delighted that the Marley family along with Pandora have lent their generous support, creativity and love to help the most vulnerable children.”
COVID-19 has upended the lives of children around the world and exposed rampant inequalities both within and among countries. UNICEF estimates that an additional 6,000 children could die every day from preventable causes over the next six months – almost all of them (over 90 per cent) in low or lower-middle income countries – as the pandemic continues to weaken health systems and disrupt services. Children are also extremely vulnerable to the indirect impacts of COVID-19, such as school closures, food shortages, limited access to basic healthcare, and disruptions to medical supply chains.
In response, UNICEF has launched Reimagine — an urgent appeal to governments, the public, donors and the private sector to support UNICEF’s efforts to respond, recover and reimagine a world currently besieged by COVID-19.
The money raised from One Love for Reimagine will help UNICEF respond to the immediate needs by providing soap, masks, gloves, hygiene kits, protective equipment and life-saving information for children and families; support near term recovery efforts, including by supporting education, protection and healthcare systems; and further UNICEF work to reimagine a fairer, more just world for children.
To support the song launch, social networking service TikTok will be hosting a special event and public challenge for fans around the time the song is launched. Additional details will be provided at a later date.
“We have a unique opportunity to chart a brighter future for the children and young people mostly likely to suffer its long-term consequences,” said Fore. “From ending violence, injustice and discrimination, to building fairer and more just societies, young people have made their message loud and clear. It is time for the rest of the world to hear it.”

Title: Turkmenistan shares experience on use of VNR data for country programming
Content: 08 July 2020
Such Labs are organized annually to provide an informal platform to share best practices focusing on crosscutting themes and country experiences.
The meeting was conducted online, at which Mr Atajan Atayev, Head of the Department for Strategic and Sustainable Development of the Ministry of Finance and Economy of Turkmenistan presented the process of VNR development in Turkmenistan and how the data from the national report was used during the CCA process and design of the Government-UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2021-2025.
The UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan shared how the UN Country Team supported the Government to ensure that key findings’ from the VNR informed the CCA and Cooperation Framework. She also stressed that the VNR development process triggered extensive data collection and analytical processes aimed at measuring the country’s progress on SDGs.
“The VNR process has served as an important joint platform for analysis of the country’s situation vis-a-vie the SDGs, thematically selected for the 2019 HLPF. The VNR has demonstrated the level of cross-cutting inter-connectedness of the concerned SDGs as well as the impact of their implementation on the groups that are most left behind”, noted Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
The importance of delivering on SDGs was further emphasized in light of vulnerabilities emerging due to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. The UNRC also mentioned that UN Country Team supported the Government in developing the socio-economic response plan to COVID-19 impacts, which was recently approved by a Presidential resolution.

Interview with Dr Catherine Smallwood, Senior Emergency Officer, WHO Regional Office for Europe, and WHO COVID-19 mission lead to Turkmenistan
1/ The WHO COVID-19 mission is arriving to Turkmenistan next week. What is the purpose of this mission, how many WHO experts are part of it and how long will they be working in Turkmenistan?
The WHO mission is scheduled to arrive in Turkmenistan on 6 July to work with national and local authorities on aspects of COVID-19 preparedness and response. These areas include coordination and control systems at the national level, epidemiology and surveillance, laboratory services, patient management, infection prevention and control and risk communication.
During 10-day deployment, the mission team aims to meet high-level officials and public health experts in the relevant areas to work together to assess the risks and develop the response mechanisms that would be required to tackle COVID-19. Experts will visit healthcare facilities, public health centers, laboratories and other facilities at the national, regional, and city levels and points of entries.
The mission is part of the tailored support WHO is providing to its countries in the European Region. During the past months, WHO sent around 70 missions to countries in the Region to assist with their responses to COVID-19 outbreaks, and we very much welcome this new opportunity to work closely with Turkmenistan in these unprecedented times.
2/ WHO mission has been postponed several times. Can you explain why?
Travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic have made travelling across Europe very challenging. We and the government of Turkmenistan have continued discussing transport options to enable a technical mission to reach the country and this is now happening on 6 July with the support of the Government of Turkmenistan.
3/ How do you consider WHO relationship with the Government of Turkmenistan? How do you work with the Ministry of Health on COVID-19?
WHO has had a long-standing relationship with the Government of Turkmenistan and its Ministry of Health. The WHO Country Office in Turkmenistan was established in November 1995 in Ashgabat to assist the Government in developing its health policy, health system and public health programmes. The Office is the focal point for WHO activities in Turkmenistan. The planned mission to the country will focus on preparing for and getting ready to manage COVID-19’s emergence and spread. Together with the Health Ministry and with the support of partners and donors, we have been working on several projects such as trainings for healthcare workers, development of communication materials and many others.
4/ Turkmenistan has not reported COVID-19 cases. The country has been keeping the virus at bay and the COVID-19 control approach of the Turkmen authorities is working well. As WHO expert, what is your opinion of the situation in the country?
Turkmenistan has established a national multi-sectoral COVID-19 task force; approving a COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan; and developing COVID-19 guidelines for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Reorganization of facilities and staff at all levels of the health system is a critical step the government has been taking: this includes repurposing facilities and training healthcare workers. We are looking forward to learning more during our visit.
We are ready to support Turkmenistan to identify the most effective measures to stop COVID-19 spread and look forward to having our team on the ground to work hand-in-hand with national and local authorities to protect people from COVID-19 in the country.
5/ The Government of Turkmenistan together with the UN Resident Coordinator developed the National Plan for Preparing and Responding to the Coronavirus Infection. WHO was part of this process. Can you tell us more about the Plan, is it in line with WHO standards?
Indeed, WHO took the lead in helping the country develop its COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan. It has been developed according to the WHO standards. The goal of the plan is to prevent the importation of the infection into the country and, if it happens, interrupt further transmission and mitigate the social and economic consequences of the outbreak. In the preparation phase, the Plan should help determine the areas and measures required to strengthen national capacities, as well as help the Government, UN agencies and other international partners to identify the areas that need additional resources and funding.
WHO is also supporting Turkmenistan dealing with long term impact of pandemic.

Title: Promoting the value and social worth of women and girls
Content: 01 July 2020
At least 19 harmful practices, ranging from dowry-related violence to virginity testing, are considered human rights violations, according to the UNFPA report, which focuses on the three most prevalent ones: female genital mutilation, child marriage, and extreme bias against daughters in favour of sons.
“Harmful practices against girls cause profound and lasting trauma, robbing them of their right to reach their full potential,” says UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem.
An extreme preference for sons over daughters in some countries has fueled gender-biased sex selection or extreme neglect that leads to their death as children, resulting in 140 million “missing females.”
In the Eastern Europe and Central Asia, child marriage is generally illegal and on the decline overall, but is still practiced widely in parts of the region (up to 15% of women were married before they turned 18 in some countries; and in some communities one in two women was married as a child).
Son preference also remains common in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region, resulting in heavily imbalanced sex-at-birth ratios in parts of the South Caucasus and South-East Europe, as many more boys are born there than girls.
Countries that have ratified international treaties such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child have a duty to end the harm. Many have responded with laws, but laws alone are not enough.  Decades of experience and research show that bottom-up, grassroots approaches are better at bringing change, the UNFPA report states.
“These harmful practices have one root cause in common: the widespread and persistent under-valuing of girls and women,” says Alanna Armitage, UNFPA Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. “But we are seeing that social norms are shifting in the right direction, and there is a real chance that working together – governments, civil society, influencers and role models – we can make practices harming girls a thing of the past.”
In Turkmenistan, on the occasion of the Global Report release, UNFPA will launch a campaign #Arzylyzenan (#Shecounts), which will encourage people to empower a girl in their families.  Fathers, husbands and brothers will be invited to join the social media campaign to generate sentiment that there is pride in having girls and that they are valuable.
Amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, the progress made in ending some harmful practices is threatened. A recent analysis revealed that if services and programmes remain shuttered for six months, an additional 13 million girls may be forced into marriage between now and 2030.
The pandemic may increase the risk of forced early marriage as a strategy to reduce the economic burdens in the family. And lockdowns, school closures and movement restrictions are disrupting adolescent girls’ routines and their support systems.
“The pandemic puts more girls at risk and threatens to undermine the progress we’ve made,” Armitage says. “We must redouble our efforts to ensure that girls everywhere are fully able to enjoy their rights, make choices about their lives and their bodies.”

Title: COVID-19 may push millions more children into child labour – ILO and UNICEF
Content: 12 June 2020
Millions more children risk being pushed into child labour as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, which could lead to the first rise in child labour after 20 years of progress, according to a new brief from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF.
According to COVID-19 and child labour: A time of crisis, a time to act, child labour decreased by 94 million since 2000, but that gain is now at risk.
Children already in child labour may be working longer hours or under worsening conditions, the report says. More of them may be forced into the worst forms of labour, which causes significant harm to their health and safety.
“As the pandemic wreaks havoc on family incomes, without support, many could resort to child labour,” said ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder. “Social protection is vital in times of crisis, as it provides assistance to those who are most vulnerable. Integrating child labour concerns across broader policies for education, social protection, justice, labour markets, and international human and labour rights makes a critical difference.”
According to the brief, COVID-19 could result in a rise in poverty and therefore to an increase in child labour as households use every available means to survive. Some studies show that a one percentage point rise in poverty leads to at least a 0.7 per cent increase in child labour in certain countries.
“In times of crisis, child labour becomes a coping mechanism for many families,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “As poverty rises, schools close and the availability of social services decreases, more children are pushed into the workforce. As we reimagine the world post-COVID, we need to make sure that children and their families have the tools they need to weather similar storms in the future. Quality education, social protection services and better economic opportunities can be game changers.”
Vulnerable population groups – such as those working in the informal economy and migrant workers – will suffer most from economic downturn, increased informality and unemployment, the general fall in living standards, health shocks and insufficient social protection systems, among other pressures.
Evidence is gradually mounting that child labour is rising as schools close during the pandemic. Temporary school closures are currently affecting more than 1 billion learners in over 130 countries. Even when classes restart, some parents may no longer be able to afford to send their children to school.
As a result, more children could be forced into exploitative and hazardous jobs. Gender inequalities may grow more acute, with girls particularly vulnerable to exploitation in agriculture and domestic work, the brief says.
The brief proposes a number of measures to counter the threat of increased child labour, including more comprehensive social protection, easier access to credit for poor households, the promotion of decent work for adults, measures to get children back into school, including the elimination of school fees, and more resources for labour inspections and law enforcement.
ILO and UNICEF are developing a simulation model to look at the impact of COVID-19 on child labour globally. New global estimates on child labour will be released in 2021.

Title: Discussing the integration of SDGs into national sectoral plans
Content: 11 June 2020
Representatives of line national ministries and institutions together with the UN Agencies reviewed the list of national programs which are under implementation or being developed for next 5 years with the aim of possible integration of SDGs indicators into planning and monitoring.
As noted by Mr. Chary Nurmuhammedov, the UNRCO Team Leader,
“The UN agencies and national partners are already developing new joint programs, plans and strategies integrating the Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, for better monitoring and assessment of the implementation of ongoing programs and the development of new strategies and joint plans, it is necessary to introduce a data system with baselines and target indicators”.
The discussion was held within such thematic areas as human rights, social, economic, environmental and governance. The participants presented the national programmes where the SDG indicators could be integrated.
The results of the meeting will be presented at the next SDG Working Group meeting at the level of Deputy Ministers which is scheduled for July 2020.

Title: Turkmenistan prepares to report national progress  using the online Sendai Framework Monitor
Content: 05 June 2020
This capacity building event is part of the UNDRR Central Asia Initiative “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia 2019-2022”, funded by the European Union.
The training is part of Result Area “Building the foundations for greater resilience in Central Asia through data, capacity, governance and cooperation at local, national and regional level”, which focuses on aligning collection of data, its analysis and reporting with the priorities of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, which also supports the reporting on implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
The training was conducted on 2-4 June 2020 at the United Nations House in Ashgabat. During the training, an online meeting was organized between the Sendai National Focal Point and representatives of UNDRR Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia
The Sendai National Focal Point and Technical Focal Point were equipped with knowledge and skills to contribute to the SFM system. By quantitative and qualitative reporting through the Sendai Framework Monitor, Turkmenistan will be able to assess and track its progress in reducing disaster risks according to the SFM indicators. This information can be used to support regional and global analyses of Sendai implementation.
UNDRR’s capacity-building trainings support the priority directions set by the UNDRR office and the Government of Turkmenistan on reducing the negative impact of natural and man-made hazards, and on transition from management of disasters to management of risk. SFM reporting will contribute in making Turkmen communities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

Title: First-ever monitoring of snow leopard population close to Kyrgyzstan’s capital
Content: 05 June 2020
World Environment Day, which in 2020 focuses on biodiversity, serves as a call to action to combat the accelerating species loss and degradation of the natural world. With our ever-increasing demands, humans have pushed nature beyond its limits.
Climate change is pushing the elusive cat – known as the ‘ghost of the mountains’ – towards increased conflict with local communities and their livestock.
Scientific studies suggest that the climate crisis will reduce snow leopard habitats globally by two thirds by 2070. Meanwhile, warmer temperatures are forcing farmers further uphill to find suitable pastures for their livestock to graze on. As a result, the two are likely to increasingly compete for the same land, with livestock attacks and retaliatory killings set to rise.
In response, UNEP is leading a programme called Vanishing Treasures to help people in Kyrgyzstan to diversify their livelihoods through innovative approaches to ecotourism, beekeeping, and horticulture, for example, with a view to fostering a peaceful co-existence with wildlife.
“If snow leopards could roar, we would hear them cry out for our help,” said UNEP Europe Office Director Bruno Pozzi. “Climate change is hitting Central Asian mountains. Conflicts between snow leopards and local communities and livestock are likely to become more frequent. This may also result in a possible increase in poaching and illegal wildlife trade. Greater interaction between humans and wildlife may increase the chances of transfer of zoonotic diseases like COVID-19. The Vanishing Treasures programme targets solutions that work for people and nature.”
In a recent survey conducted by The Snow Leopard Trust, at least 15 adult snow leopards were recorded by motion-triggered infrared cameras multiple times in the Kyrgyz Republic’s Ala Too range. Some cats were photographed as close as 40 kilometres to Kyrgyzstan’s capital, Bishkek. At least two sets of cubs were also sighted, suggesting that there is a breeding snow leopard population close to the city. Both residents and wildlife in the region are highly dependent on healthy mountain ecosystems for their survival.
“People used to very rarely meet snow leopards,” said Sasykulov Azim Kurmankulovich, a farmer and ranger from Shamshy in the Chuy region in the AlaToo range. “Maybe they attack livestock because their prey base has decreased. If we protect wildlife in the mountains, snow leopards would not need to attack livestock,” he said.
“Over the last three to four years, we have had a lot of rain in spring,” noted Dzhaparov Emilbek Kuvatovich, a ranger in the nearby Shamshy-Tuyuk region of Kyrgyzstan. “This makes it harder to plough our fields, so we have to delay sending our livestock to the pasture. If we could bring our livestock down to pasture earlier, they would be less likely to meet snow leopards.”
“Kyrgyzstan was the first country to raise the issue of conservation of the snow leopard and its prey,” said Musaev Almaz Mustafaevich, Biodiversity Director at the country’s State Agency for Environmental Protection. “Further to the signing of the Bishkek Declaration, we are working with neighboring countries to study habitats and monitor the snow leopard,” he said, referring to a 2013 agreement signed by 12 countries aimed at securing the cat’s long-term survival.
The Vanishing Treasures programme aims to map livestock losses, retaliatory killings of snow leopards, pasture conditions and crop damage by wild herbivores. Such data will help to identify the location and drivers of conflict hotspots. There, for example, predator-proof corrals could be built to keep snow leopards and livestock safe, or livestock insurance schemes may be introduced.
Preliminary data collected shows that less than a quarter of the 160 households surveyed have alternative sources of income to farming which makes them particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Vanishing Treasures will therefore help to pilot ways of securing alternative incomes. Ecotourism may provide one such example in Kyrgyzstan. All 18 villages close to the Ala Too mountain range are well connected by road, but lack information centres or an internet connection. It will also investigate case studies on the potential transfer of diseases between wildlife, livestock and humans.
The programme, funded by the Government of Luxembourg, is carried out in collaboration with international and local partners in Kyrgyzstan, including the Snow Leopard Trust, the Ilbirs Foundation and the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program.

Title: UNICEF Turkmenistan congratulates all children on International Child Protection Day
Content: 01 June 2020
“The first of June is observed in many countries around the world to honor children. This Day means not only the first day of the summer and the first day of the long school holidays, but something more meaningful for children’s future,” said Christine Weigand.
On this special day UNICEF partnered with the national television to feature two TV talk shows with UNICEF’s participation – one on the partnership of UNICEF and the Government in the area of child rights, and another - on early childhood development, as June marks the global celebration of the parenting month and the national celebration of the fourth year of the national campaign “First 1000 days of a child’s life is the foundation of the happy future”.
Moreover, today UNICEF and the Ministry of Education have launched a drawing activity among children of all 1,075 pre-school establishments on the theme “My happy family”. And later in the month, UNICEF will partner with Turkmen Owazy TV channel to produce a talk show on early childhood development with renowned Turkmen performers.
Both in his TV show for children and in UNICEF social media channels the famous anchor Ashir Dade will congratulate children on this special day. UNICEF and the Office of Ombudsperson will issue a joint article for national media this week.
“Children are our future. Let’s keep working together to make sure that all children can enjoy their rights, be healthy, explore opportunities, learn something new every day and stay connected with their friends and families! Let’s unite to ensure that our children enjoy their childhood,” said Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan.

Title: COVID-19: Number of children living in household poverty to soar by up to 86 million by end of year
Content: 29 May 2020
The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic could push up to 86 million more children into household poverty by the end of 2020, an increase of 15 per cent, according to a new analysis released today by Save the Children and UNICEF.
The analysis highlights that, without urgent action to protect families from the financial hardships caused by the pandemic, the total number of children living below the national poverty line in low- and middle-income countries could reach 672 million by year-end. Nearly two-thirds of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
Countries across Europe and Central Asia could see the most significant increase, up to 44 per cent across the region. Latin America and the Caribbean could see a 22 per cent increase.
“The coronavirus pandemic has triggered an unprecedented socio-economic crisis that is draining resources for families all over the world,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “The scale and depth of financial hardship among families threatens to roll back years of progress in reducing child poverty and to leave children deprived of essential services. Without concerted action, families barely getting by could be pushed into poverty, and the poorest families could face levels of deprivation that have not been seen for decades.”
Save the Children and UNICEF warn that the impact of the global economic crisis caused by the pandemic and related containment policies is two-fold. Immediate loss of income means families are less able to afford the basics, including food and water, less likely to access health care or education, and more at risk of child marriage, violence, exploitation and abuse. When fiscal contraction occurs, the reach and quality of the services families depend on can also be diminished.
For the poorest families, lack of access to social care services or compensatory measures further limits their ability to abide by containment and physical distancing measures, and thus further increases their exposure to infection.
“The shocking poverty impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic will hit children hard. Children are highly vulnerable to even short periods of hunger and malnutrition—potentially affecting them for their whole life. If we act now and decisively, we can prevent and contain the pandemic threat facing the poorest countries and some of the most vulnerable children. This report should be a wake-up call for the world. Poverty is not inevitable for children,” said Save the Children International CEO, Inger Ashing.
Before the pandemic, two-thirds of children worldwide did not have access to any form of social protection, making it impossible for families to withstand financial shocks when they hit and furthering the vicious cycle of intergenerational poverty. Only 16 per cent of children in Africa are covered by social protection.
Hundreds of millions of children remain multidimensionally poor - meaning they lack access to health care, education, proper nutrition, or adequate housing – often a reflection of inequitable investments by governments in social services.
For children living in countries already affected by conflict and violence, the impact of this crisis will further increase the risk of instability and of households falling into poverty. The Middle East and North Africa region, home to the highest number of children in need due to conflict, has the highest unemployment rate among young people, while nearly half of all children in the region live in a multidimensional poverty.
To address and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on children in poor households, Save the Children and UNICEF call for rapid and large-scale expansion of social protection systems and programmes including cash transfers, school feeding and child benefits – all critical investments that address immediate financial needs and lay the foundation for countries to prepare for future shocks.
Governments must also invest in other forms of social protection, fiscal policies, employment and labor market interventions to support families. This includes expanding universal access to quality healthcare and other services; and investing in family friendly policies, such as paid leave and childcare.
Since COVID-19 hit, many countries have already scaled up their social protection programmes. For example:

Title: Discussing SDG financing and the role of Integrated National Financing Frameworks
Content: 28 May 2020
The event geographically covered the countries, participants in UN Special Programme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA), and aimed to facilitate dialogue and  exchange of experience on immediate response measures to mitigate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic and link these measures to longer term goals on SDG financing through Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFF).
This high-level event brought together ministers and deputy-ministers of finance and economy of SPECA Programme countries, as well as the representatives of UNDESA, UNECE, World Bank, IMF, ADB, IDB, EBRD, UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA and experts of a number of UN agencies and other international organizations. The USG, Executive Director of UN Economic Commission for Europe, Ms. Olga Algaerova, briefed the participants on the ongoing consultations between the SPECA countries on the possibility of establishment of a SPECA Fund as a sub-regional instrument for SDG financing.
As noted by Ms. Elena Panova, the UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan
“International seminar in such format provides a unique platform for exchange of experiences among ministries of finance and economy of the SPECA Programme countries regarding short-term responses to socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 and longer-term SDG financing strategies.  This is first such dialogue of ministers and deputy-ministers of finance and economy at regional level on financing for sustainable development, organized at a time of pandemic, and we hope that the exchange of experience in this format will continue in the future”.
Building on the discussions of the fifth Forum of the Economic and Social Council on Financing for Development, held on 23 April 2020, the International seminar facilitated regional level reflections of the outcomes of the ECOSOC forum.  Discussions also highlighted the importance of addressing existing structural weaknesses, highlighted by the pandemic, such as the need for better financing of the health sector, education, social protection and addressing inequalities. The outcome of the International seminar will feed into the discussions of the High-Level Event on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond convened by UN Secretary-General António Guterres and is planned today in New-York.
The international seminar resulted in the adoption of the Statement of participants that outlines the summary of discussions, recommendations and follow up actions related to linking short-term financial stimulus measures in light of COVID-19 with longer term SDG financing at country level, including through the establishment of integrated national financing frameworks.

Title: UN and Turkmenistan to jointly develop measures on addressing the socio-economic impact of COVID-19
Content: 22 May 2020
Representatives of ministries, Mejlis, Migration Service, Customs service, Union of industrials and entrepreneurs, private sector and NGOs were engaged in the thematic discussions organized along the five pillars recommended by the UN framework on immediate response to socio-economic impact of the COVID-19. These areas include:
1. Improving the quality and access to basic health services
2. Social protection and basic services
3. Jobs, support for small and medium enterprises, workers in informal sector
4. Macroeconomic stimulus and multilateral cooperation
5. Social harmony and community resilience
“It is important to develop measures aimed to support the vulnerable groups of population and affected sectors of economy in overcoming the socio-economic impact of the pandemic, because as the experience of other countries shows vulnerable groups are more likely to be affected by the negative impact of the pandemic”, noted Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator.
The draft joint Action Plan is planned to be finalized and presented during the next meeting of the Joint Working Group between the UN and the Government of Turkmenistan.
The proposed measures build on the priority directions set by the Government of Turkmenistan on addressing the negative impact of global economic crisis triggered by the pandemic and are informed by  the preliminary analysis of potential channels of  socio-economic impact of COVID-19 in Turkmenistan, including on vulnerable groups presented at the 1st meeting of the Joint Working Group on April 21, 2020.

Title: As COVID-19 devastates already fragile health systems, over 6,000 additional children under five could die a day, without urgent action
Content: 13 May 2020
NEW YORK, 13 MAY 2020 – An additional 6,000 children could die every day from preventable causes over the next six months as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to weaken health systems and disrupt routine services, UNICEF said today.
The estimate is based on an analysis by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, newly published in The Lancet Global Health journal. Based on the worst of three scenarios in 118 low- and middle-income countries, the analysis estimates that an additional 1.2 million under-five deaths could occur in just six months, due to reductions in routine health service coverage levels and an increase in child wasting.
These potential child deaths will be in addition to the 2.5 million children who already die before their 5th birthday every six months in the 118 countries included in the study, threatening to reverse nearly a decade of progress on ending preventable under-five mortality.
Some 56,700 more maternal deaths could also occur in just six months, in addition to the 144,000 deaths that already take place in the same countries over a six-month period.
“Under a worst-case scenario, the global number of children dying before their fifth birthdays could increase for the first time in decades,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “We must not let mothers and children become collateral damage in the fight against the virus. And we must not let decades of progress on reducing preventable child and maternal deaths be lost.”
In countries with already weak health systems, COVID-19 is causing disruptions in medical supply chains and straining financial and human resources. Visits to health care centres are declining due to lockdowns, curfews and transport disruptions, and as communities remain fearful of infection. In a commentary to the Lancet report, UNICEF warns these disruptions could result in potentially devastating increases in maternal and child deaths.
The paper analyzes three scenarios for the impact of reductions in lifesaving interventions due to the crisis on child and maternal deaths. It warns that in the least severe scenario, where coverage is reduced around 15 per cent, there would be a 9.8 per cent increase in under-five child deaths, or an estimated 1,400 a day, and an 8.3 per cent increase in maternal deaths. In the worst-case scenario, where health interventions are reduced by around 45 per cent, there could be as much as a 44.7 per cent increase in under-five child deaths and 38.6 per cent increase in maternal deaths per month. These interventions range from family planning, antenatal and postnatal care, child delivery, vaccinations and preventive and curative services. The estimates show that if, for whatever reason, routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased, the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. The greatest number of additional child deaths will be due to an increase in wasting prevalence among children, which includes the potential impact beyond the health system, and reduction in treatment of neonatal sepsis and pneumonia.
According to the modeling, and assuming reductions in coverage in the worst-case scenario, the 10 countries that could potentially have the largest number of additional child deaths are: Bangladesh, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania. The 10 countries that are most likely to witness the highest excess child mortality rates under the worst-case scenario are: Djibouti, Eswatini, Lesotho, Liberia, Mali, Malawi, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone and Somalia. Continued provision of life-saving services is critical in these countries.
In addition to the estimated potential rise in under-five and maternal deaths described in the Lancet Global Health Journal analysis, UNICEF is deeply alarmed by the other knock-on effects of the pandemic on children:
This week, UNICEF is launching #Reimagine, a global campaign to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from becoming a lasting crisis for children, especially the most vulnerable children – such as those affected by poverty, exclusion or family violence. Through the campaign, UNICEF is issuing an urgent appeal to governments, the public, donors and the private sector to join UNICEF as we seek to respond, recover and reimagine a world currently besieged by the coronavirus:
To kickstart the campaign, two of UNICEF’s valued partners - Pandora and ING - have both agreed to pledge a generous donation to show their part in answering the call to this appeal and to spur more donations from the public in the coming weeks.
“The COVID-19 crisis is a child rights crisis. We need an immediate-, medium- and long-term response that not only addresses the challenges created by the pandemic and its secondary impacts on children, but also outlines a clear version for building back a better world when the crisis finally recedes. For that, we need everyone’s ideas, resources, creativity and heart.” said Fore. “It is our shared responsibility today, to reimagine what the world will look like tomorrow.”

The authors of the Lancet Global Health study used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to model maternal and under-five child mortality for three scenarios in 118 low- and middle-income countries. They modelled three scenarios in which the coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions is reduced by 9·8–51·9 per cent and the prevalence of wasting is increased by 10–50 per cent.  They estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months
These interventions range from family planning, antenatal and postnatal care, child delivery, vaccinations and preventive and curative services. The modeled scenarios are hypothetical and do not reflect actual policies or distinguish between mitigation strategies—only that disruptions will occur.

Title: UNICEF appeals for $1.6 billion to meet growing needs of children impacted by COVID-19 pandemic
Content: 12 May 2020
NEW YORK, 12 May 2020 – UNICEF is appealing for US$1.6 billion to support its humanitarian response for children impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, up from $651.6 million requested in a similar appeal late March. This increase reflects the devastating socioeconomic consequences of the disease and families’ rising needs. As the outbreak enters its fifth month, the costs for supplies, shipment and duty of care are increasing dramatically.
“The pandemic is a health crisis which is quickly becoming a child rights crisis,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Schools are closed, parents are out of work and families are under growing strain. As we begin to reimagine what a post-COVID world would look like, these funds will help us respond to the crisis, recover from its aftermath, and protect children from its knock-on effects.”
Access to essential services like health care and routine immunization has already been compromised for hundreds of millions of children, which could lead to a significant increase in child mortality. Meanwhile, the mental health and psychosocial impact of restricted movement, school closures and subsequent isolation are likely to intensify already high levels of stress, especially for vulnerable children.

According to a UNICEF analysis, some 77 per cent of children under the age of 18 worldwide, or 1.8 billion, are living in one of the 132 countries with some form of movement restrictions in place due to COVID-19.
Risk factors for violence, abuse and neglect are on the rise for children living under restricted movement and socio-economic decline. Girls and women are at increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence. In many cases, refugee, migrant and internally displaced children, as well as returnees, are experiencing reduced access to services and protection and increasing exposure to xenophobia and discrimination.
“We have seen what the pandemic is doing to countries with developed health systems and we are concerned about what it would do to countries with weaker systems and fewer available resources,” said Fore.
UNICEF is focusing its response to the pandemic on countries with existing humanitarian crises – working both to prevent transmission and mitigate the collateral impacts on children, women and vulnerable populations, especially around access to health, nutrition, water and sanitation, education and protection.

UNICEF has so far received US $215 million in support of its response to the pandemic. Additional funding will help UNICEF build upon results already achieved which include:

Title: New UNFPA projections predict calamitous impact on women’s health as COVID-19 pandemic continues
Content: 04 May 2020
New York, USA/ Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, 4 May 2020. As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, number of women unable to access family planning, facing unintended pregnancies, gender-based violence and other harmful practices could skyrocket by millions of cases in the months ahead, according to data released by UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund.
The research reveals the enormous scale of the impact COVID-19 is having on women as health systems become overloaded, facilities close or only provide a limited set of services to women and girls, and many choose to skip important medical checkups through fear of contracting the virus. Global supply chain disruptions may also lead to significant shortages of contraceptives and gender-based violence is expected to soar as women are trapped at home for prolonged periods.
“This new data shows the catastrophic impact that COVID-19 could soon have on women and girls globally. The pandemic is deepening inequalities, and millions more women and girls now risk losing the ability to plan their families and protect their bodies and their health,” said Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director. “Women’s reproductive health and rights must be safeguarded at all costs. The services must continue; the supplies must be delivered; and the vulnerable must be protected and supported."
Turkmenistan has no reported cases of the coronavirus. Nonetheless, amid the global pandemic, UNFPA supports the Government within the framework of the Joint UN and Government Working Group on Socio-Economic Impact of COVID-19 and the developed Country Preparedness and Response Plan.
UNFPA provides a technical assistance to the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry in updating the policy regulations on COVID-19 preparedness, including sanitation, personal protection, COVID-19 case management among women, specifically on principles of safe care during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding.
UNFPA also supports the health sector in procurement of the medical and sanitation supplies, as well as ensuring that the 94 reproductive health rooms countrywide do not experience a stock-out of the contraceptives. In March, UNFPA procured 8,000 vials of injectable contraceptives Sayana Press to meet the needs of the women of reproductive age and who receive services at the reproductive health rooms of the country.
Yashlyk.info website, operated by UNFPA Turkmenistan has been a reliable source of information for young people and their parents in Turkmen language. The site features a rubric on COVID-19 and offers World Health Organization’s recommendations on promoting healthy behavior at schools, home and community, sharing the correct information to promote prevention, as well as staying safe and positive.
“UNFPA commends the Government for sustaining family planning and reproductive health services in the country,” said Ayna Seyitliyeva, UNFPA Turkmenistan Assistant Representative.  “We continue to support the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry to ensure continuity of and access to the maternal and reproductive health in the country not to compromise the realization of the commitments made at Global Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 during the global pandemic.”
The global research on COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on women’s health was conducted by UNFPA, with contributions from Avenir Health, Johns Hopkins University (USA) and Victoria University (Australia). Its projections were based upon recent UNFPA research into what will be required to achieve the organization’s goals by 2030. For each estimate, researchers projected the direct impact of COVID-19 on the issue in question and combined it with the disruption to global prevention programmes caused by the pandemic.

Title: New guidelines provide roadmap for safe reopening of schools
Content: 30 April 2020
NEW YORK/PARIS/ROME, 30 April 2020 – UNESCO, UNICEF, WFP and World Bank today issued new guidelines on the safe reopening of schools amidst ongoing closures affecting nearly 1.3 billion students worldwide.
The agencies also warned that the widespread closures of educational facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic present an unprecedented risk to children’s education and wellbeing, particularly for the most marginalized children who rely on school for their education, health, safety and nutrition. The guidelines offer practical advice for national and local authorities on how to keep children safe when they return to school.
“Rising inequality, poor health outcomes, violence, child labour and child marriage are just some of the long-term threats for children who miss out on school,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “We know the longer children stay out of school, the less likely they are to ever return. Unless we prioritize the reopening of schools – when it is safe to do so – we will likely see a devastating reversal in education gains.”
The new guidelines note that while there is not yet enough evidence to measure the impact of school closures on disease transmission rates, the adverse effects of school closures on children’s safety and learning are well documented. Gains made in increasing access to children’s education in recent decades risk being lost and, in the worse cases, reversed completely.
“In the poorest countries, children often rely on schools for their only meal of the day. But with many schools now closed because of COVID, 370 million children are missing out on these nutritious meals which are a lifeline for poor families. They are also being denied the health support they normally get through school. This could do lasting damage, so when schools reopen it is critical that these meal programmes and health services are restored, which can also help to draw the most vulnerable children back to school,” said David Beasley, WFP Executive Director.
The best interests of children and overall public health considerations – based on an assessment of the associated benefits and risks to education, public health and socio-economic factors – must be central to national and local authorities’ decisions to reopen schools, the guidelines say.
Schools must look at how they can reopen better – with improved learning and more comprehensive support for children at the school including health, nutrition, psychosocial support and water, sanitation and hygiene facilities.
As countries grapple with when to reopen schools, UNESCO, UNICEF, WFP and World Bank – as part of the Global Education Coalition – urge governments to assess the benefits of classroom-based instruction compared to remote learning, and the risk factors related to reopening of schools, noting the inconclusive evidence around the infection risks related to school attendance.
“While many students are falling behind in their learning journey because of prolonged school closures, the decision of when and how to reopen schools, while far from straightforward, should be a priority. Once there is a green light on the health front, a whole set of measures will need to be in place to ensure that no student is left behind. These guidelines provide all-round guidance for governments and partners to facilitate the reopening of schools for students, teachers and families. We share one goal: to protect and advance the right to education for every learner,” said UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay.
The guidelines include:
"Once schools begin to reopen, the priority becomes reintegrating students into school settings safely and in ways that allow learning to pick up again, especially for those who suffered the biggest learning losses. This is a critical moment as it is the launching pad for a new normal that should be more effective and equitable. To manage reopenings, schools will need to be logistically prepared with the teaching workforce ready. And they will need to have plans specifically for supporting learning recovery of the most disadvantaged students. The guidelines offer a framework for moving forward that the major UN agencies are aligned around," said Jaime Saavedra, World Bank Global Director for Education.

Title: Greta Thunberg and NGO Human Act launch a child rights driven coronavirus campaign for UNICEF
Content: 30 April 2020
NEW YORK, 30 April 2020 – Climate activist Greta Thunberg today launched a child rights driven campaign with Danish NGO Human Act to support UNICEF’s efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic and protect children from its direct and knock-on consequences. These include food shortages, strained healthcare systems, violence and lost education.
“Like the climate crisis, the coronavirus pandemic is a child-rights crisis,” said Thunberg. “It will affect all children, now and in the long-term, but vulnerable groups will be impacted the most. I’m asking everyone to step up and join me in support of UNICEF’s vital work to save children's lives, to protect health and continue education.”
The campaign is being launched with an initial donation on behalf of Human Act and the Greta Thunberg Foundation to UNICEF of $200,000. Greta Thunberg was recently awarded for her global activism by Human Act who granted her foundation the prize money of $100,000. This sum will now go to UNICEF along with an additional $100,000 from Human Act.
Proceeds from the campaign will go directly towards UNICEF’s emergency programmes to fight COVID-19, including through the provision of soap, masks, gloves, hygiene kits, protective equipment, life-saving information and other support to healthcare systems.
A report issued this month by the United Nations warned that children risk being among the biggest victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. While children have been largely spared from the direct health effects of the disease up to this point, the crisis is having a profound effect on their overall wellbeing. All children, of all ages and in all countries, are being affected, in particular by the socio-economic impacts and, in some cases, by the mitigation measures implemented to stem the spread of the disease.
UNICEF’s global COVID-19 response focuses on working with partners to help reduce the transmission of the virus and mitigate its impact on children while ensuring that essential services for children continue. This includes:
“The coronavirus pandemic is the greatest struggle the world has seen in generations,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Children and young people are among the most severely impacted by the knock-on effects of COVID-19, so it is only natural that they would want to do something about it. Through her activism, Greta Thunberg has proven that young people are ready to take a stand and lead change in the world. UNICEF is very pleased that Greta and her supporters have not only chosen to take a stand against this pandemic, but to do so in partnership with UNICEF.”

Title: UN and Turkmen NGOs building partnership to respond to COVID-19 pandemic
Content: 30 April 2020
The meeting participants were briefed about joint measures taken by the UN country team and Government of Turkmenistan to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country. In this context, NGOs were informed about the draft Country Preparedness and Response Plan on COVID-19 in Turkmenistan.
The main objective of this Plan is to prevent the introduction of infection to the country and, if it appears in the country, to prevent its further transmission and mitigate the effects of the outbreak in the country.
Participants were also informed about the establishment of UN-Government Joint Working Group (JWG) on socio-economic impact of COVID-19 and its first meeting held on 21 April 2020. It was stressed that socio-economic impact of pandemic will primarily affect the most vulnerable groups.
The key role of NGOs in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and mitigating its impact on people was specifically underlined.  “We understand the importance of public organizations’ involvement in the process of fighting with COVID-19. Your role in raising public awareness of COVID-19 prevention measures and helping your communities to survive is particularly high” stressed Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
Participating NGOs gave their vision on the role of public organizations in preventing COVID-19 in Turkmenistan and outlined current and potential activities to be taken to support joint mitigation measures, in particular focusing on the support to the vulnerable groups. They have expressed expectation for more active engagement with UN on delivery of services to their constituencies. Participants discussed potential areas of cooperation including employment, human rights, disability, refugees, environment, sports and other. In particular, the possibility of implementation of social programs through introduction and expansion of social contracting was also discussed.
The meeting participants agreed to continue the dialogue in the format of individual meetings between a particular NGO and UN Agency to discuss potential joint initiatives in helping the most vulnerable to withstand the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic. The results of these consultations will be presented at the next meeting of the UN-Government of Turkmenistan JWG on socio-economic impact of COVID-19 to be held early June 2020.

Title: “Earth School” launches to keep students connected to nature in the time of COVID-19
Content: 23 April 2020
Nairobi, 22 April 2020 - In response to the COVID-19 crisis, an unprecedented coalition has come together to launch “Earth School,” which provides free, high-quality educational content to help students, parents and teachers around the world who are currently at home. Initiated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and TED-Ed, Earth School takes students on a 30-day “Adventure” through the natural world.
The curated Earth School content features videos, reading materials and activities — which will be translated into 10 languages — to help students gain an understanding of the environment while considering their role within it. This is the biggest online learning initiative in UNEP’s history and is available for free on TED-Ed’s website.
According to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), more than 1.5 billion learners are affected by COVID-19 school closures. The pandemic has caused a health, economic, and education crisis; in the age of physical and social constraints, there is a strong need for global science literacy.
That is why UNEP and TED-Ed — in coordination with 30 collaborators, including National Geographic, WWF and UNESCO — came together to launch Earth School in just over two weeks. Built for children and youth ages 5-18, it spans 30 school days that run between Earth Day and World Environment Day on June 5, which this year will take place under the banner of Time for Nature.
TED-Ed creates free, video-based lessons on everything from animals and climate change to underwater farms. It is the educational arm of TED, whose library of thousands of interactive lessons — built by a network of 500,000 educators from across the world — spans all ages and subjects.
Each Adventure has been carefully selected by a panel of expert practitioners and caters to different age groups. Each consists of a hands-on experiment and nature discovery. In addition to TED-Ed’s own content, Earth School will feature videos from notable media organizations including National Geographic, PBS LearningMedia and the BBC with the goal of empowering participating students to be caretakers of our planet.
“Billions of children are currently out of school because of COVID-19. But learning cannot stop. COVID-19 has revealed how deeply interconnected all life on this planet is," said UNEP’s Executive Director, Inger Andersen. "I am delighted that UNEP, along with TED-Ed and other collaborators, are launching Earth School. Learning about the natural world will be critical to building a better and sustainable future for all."
“These unprecedented times highlight just how important it is for young people to connect with the natural world and understand science,” said Vicki Phillips, executive vice president and chief education officer at the National Geographic Society. “We’re thrilled to join forces with trusted organizations like UNEP and TED-Ed to cultivate a spirit of exploration and build empathy for the Earth, no matter where students are the world — even if it's from inside their homes, from a window, or on a short walk in the neighborhood.”
“Despite being confined to their homes, this project shows that students, parents and teachers throughout the world can still engage in science-based learning and adventures together. Earth School is a collaboration between so many talented educators and incredible partners from around the world, which is why we’re proud and thrilled to see the initiative feeding the global curiosity of home-bound students, all of whom are the future environmental stewards of our planet. This platform is a gateway to some of the most inspiring lessons on nature and the environment, and each lesson comes with practical and fun activities that students can engage with and share,” said Logan Smalley, founding director of TED’s youth and education initiative, TED-Ed.
The lessons were curated by a team of environmental education experts including Kathleen Usher Ph.D, Jessie Oliver and Juliane Voss, who worked with over 100 contributors in creating Earth School. The initiative is in support of SDG 4.7 and the Decade of Delivery and will contribute towards the Global Education Coalition launched by UNESCO last month to convene governments, technology partners and leaders in the education field to keep pupils learning. As part of this coalition, UNEP will be exploring how this content can be adapted and shared with children who aren’t able to access the Internet.
Collaborators who have agreed to support this initiative include: BBC Ideas, Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, Bill Nye the Science Guy, Conservation International, CEE, Earth Day Network, Earth Challenge 2020, Environment Online (ENO), GeSI, International Olympic Committee, IUCN, Institute for Planetary Security, Junior Achievement, Learning in Nature, Littlescribe, Minecraft, National Geographic Society, Ocean Wise, Only One, Royal Geographic Society, SciStarter, Sitra, TAT, TED-Ed, The Nature Conservancy, UN Convention on Biodiversity, UN SDSN / TRENDS, UN Technology Innovation Lab, UNCCD, UNDP, UNEP, UNESCO, UNFCCC, UN Food and Agriculture Organization, University of Pennsylvania, Vult Labs, World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), Wild Immersion and WWF.

Title: Public support for international cooperation surges amid global upheaval
Content: 23 April 2020
New York, April 20, 2020. As the whole UN system unites to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, the Organization is also scaling up its efforts to give voice to the global public through its 75th anniversary initiative (UN75). Launched in January, UN75 will run throughout 2020, to give all people the opportunity to shape global priorities by participating in a UN75 dialogue or completing a one-minute survey available at www.un75.online.
Preliminary findings, based on data collected between 1 January 2020 and 24 March 2020, were published today on www.un.org/en/un75/news-events:
1. An overwhelming majority—95%--of respondents agreed on the need for countries to work together to manage global trends, with a noticeable uptick from late February, as the upheaval caused by COVID-19 spread around the world. Support cut across all age groups and education levels. Ideas on strengthening international cooperation included more effective partnerships with civil society and the private sector, and greater involvement of women, youth, indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups in policymaking.
2. Climate and environment topped the list of issues that will most affect humanity’s future – with more than double the responses of any other issue. Conflict and violence came second, and health risks third, having risen sharply since early March.
3. The top five future priorities that emerged were: environmental protection, protection of human rights, less conflict, equal access to basic services, and zero discrimination.
“I look forward to our continued efforts to ensure a meaningful observance of the seventy-fifth anniversary of our Organization, and to use this milestone for reflection on the multilateral cooperation the world needs at this time, both in addressing the immediate pandemic and in achieving the longer-term goals for which the United Nations was founded.” – United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres
Notes
Launched by the UN Secretary-General, the UN’s 75th anniversary initiative is markedly different from previous commemorations, with less emphasis on communicating the UN’s successes and a strong focus on listening to the global public, especially young people. Over the course of 2020, the UN75 team will gather public perspectives on global challenges and solutions on how to tackle them through a one-minute survey (in 53 languages) and dialogues – now overwhelmingly online – organised by partners across the world. This data will be complemented by representative polling; academic research; and media and social media analysis in some 70 countries. The results will be presented in September 2020, at the official commemoration of the UN’s 75th anniversary, after which UN75 will focus on how best to take them forward, with a final report to be published in January 2021.
The data used was gathered between 1 January and 24 March 2020. During this period, 35,556 in 186 UN Member States took the one-minute survey online, in addition to 5,688 who participated through mobile applications. Over 330 dialogues took place in 87 UN Member States, with 56 summaries from 32 of them included in this preliminary analysis.

Title: UN, Government explore ways to mitigate potential socio-economic impact of COVID-19 in the country
Content: 21 April 2020
During the meeting, the UN agencies welcomed the measures the Government of Turkmenistan is taking to mitigate potential socio-economic impact of the pandemic in Turkmenistan and to reduce the negative impact of the global crisis caused by COVID-19 on the situation in Turkmenistan. In particular, measures on strengthening the health sector, reviewing the fiscal policy, supporting the SMEs, ensuring targeted social protection for vulnerable groups and transition to digital solutions were discussed.
The joint working group was established on 15 April 2020 as a follow up to the call by the UN Secretary General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, on world community to take urgent measures to mitigate the socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's livelihoods.
It involves the representatives of the national ministries and UN Agencies represented in Turkmenistan. The main goal of the WG is to coordinate and jointly elaborate measures informed by joint analysis on mitigation of possible socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable groups in the country.
“Studying and mitigating potential risks for vulnerable groups is especially important in light of the key principle of the Sustainable Development Goals of “leaving no one behind.” Indeed, vulnerable groups will be primarily affected by the negative socio-economic impact of the pandemic,” emphasized Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
The recommendations of the WG are also expected to guide the UN agencies to adapt their existing programmes as well as develop new initiatives to assist the Government of Turkmenistan in mitigating the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19.
The meeting participants agreed to continue the dialogue and that a series of bilateral consultations between the UN Agencies and relevant ministries will take place to review existing programs and develop possible joint initiatives to support the mitigation of socio-economic impact of COVID-19 in the country. The next meeting of the WG is planned in the first half of June 2020.

Title: Turkmenistan will develop an action plan to implement the early childhood development strategy
Content: 21 April 2020
The first steps in developing an action plan have been discussed last week at the online consultation meeting organized by UNICEF with participation of an inter-sectoral group of representatives of national entities and UNICEF international expert.
The National ECD Strategy will contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the overall 2030 Agenda. The Strategy focuses on cross-sectoral collaboration to ensure survival and development of young children, and prioritizes early childhood care and education.
The ECD Strategy highlights the importance of measuring progress through reliable data and emphasises the need for strengthening coordination mechanisms and referrals at national and local levels. This will help to provide effective, efficient and quality services to young children and their families, as well as promote sharing of experiences and innovations, external advice, and oversight. As a result, more children will survive, develop to their fullest potential; more parents will be empowered to adopt beneficial child care practices; professionals will enhance their skills; and more positive social norms and beliefs benefitting children’s development will be promoted.
The action plan of the ECD strategy, that is expected to be ready by June, will include specific activities, results, deliverables, timeframes, and a monitoring and evaluation framework. Early childhood development will continue to be one of the key pillars of the next country programme between UNICEF and the Government of Turkmenistan for the period 2021-2025.

Title: Maintaining routine immunization services vital during the COVID-19 pandemic – WHO and UNICEF
Content: 20 April 2020
Press note to mark European Immunization Week 2020
GENEVA/COPENHAGEN, 20 April 2020 - The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder that infectious diseases know no borders. All countries are vulnerable, regardless of income levels or the strength of their health care systems. Across the European Region, where tens of millions of people have been living in lockdown for weeks, and over 100,000 people have died, the speed and devastation of the novel coronavirus has completely upended lives.
The urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine underscores the pivotal role immunizations play in protecting lives and economies. As scientists around the world work to develop a vaccine against the novel coronavirus and health care capacities are stretched in responding to COVID-19, national routine immunization programmes are more critical than ever before. Governments across the Region must use every opportunity possible to protect people from the many diseases for which vaccines are already available.
When routine vaccinations are missed, the risk of disease outbreaks increases.
In 2018, approximately 527 000 children missed their first dose of measles-containing vaccine in the WHO European Region. One year later in 2019, the measles virus exposed immunity gaps in Europe, infecting over 100 000 people, across all age-groups. Protecting children, adolescents and adults from vaccine-preventable diseases through vaccination is a must for the sustainability of health care systems.
“We know that vulnerability to infectious diseases anywhere is a threat to public health everywhere,” said Ms. Afshan Khan, UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia. “It is critical that routine immunization programmes continue during this crisis, while adequately protecting health workers and individuals receiving vaccinations. Reaching the most vulnerable children who have missed routine immunizations in the past should be prioritized.”
If, during these unprecedented times, local COVID-19 response measures cause temporary interruptions of routine immunization services, countries should plan to resume immunization services as quickly as possible after the situation stabilizes.
Countries should be prepared to vaccinate those at higher risk and ensure everyone, including the most marginalized, will have equal access to a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available.
“We can prevent further impact of COVID-19 on our healthcare systems by assuring that individuals of all ages remain vaccinated according to national schedules. I urge countries to maintain immunization service delivery and drive demand for vaccination, through the life-course even at this difficult time. Prioritizing immunization is one of my four flagship areas and central to WHO’s vision for health in the new European Programme of Work” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
Turkmenistan continues to implement its routine immunization programme fully and to finance it through the state funding. Procured through UNICEF and pre-qualified by WHO, quality vaccines are available to all children for free through the national immunization schedule. Thanks to the continuous efforts of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry of Turkmenistan, the country has sustained near universal vaccination coverage.
WHO and UNICEF will continue to support governments’ efforts to strengthen their immunization programmes, including through strategic planning for equitable provision of immunization, strengthening vaccine-preventable disease surveillance and community engagement and education.
As we step into a new future, vaccines will continue to serve as a foundation for health and wellbeing for all. It is through solidarity, joint action and tireless commitment to leaving no one behind that we can create a healthier future together.

Title: Children at increased risk of harm online during global COVID-19 pandemic - UNICEF
Content: 16 April 2020
Newly released technical note aims to help governments, ICT companies, educators and parents protect children in lockdown
Download the technical note here
NEW YORK, 15 April 2020 – Millions of children are at increased risk of harm as their lives move increasingly online during lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF and partners said today.
“The coronavirus pandemic has led to an unprecedented rise in screen time,” said Global Partnership to End Violence Executive Director Dr. Howard Taylor. “School closures and strict containment measures mean more and more families are relying on technology and digital solutions to keep children learning, entertained and connected to the outside world, but not all children have the necessary knowledge, skills and resources to keep themselves safe online.”
More than 1.5 billion children and young people have been affected by school closures worldwide. Many of these students are now taking classes as well as socializing more online. Spending more time on virtual platforms can leave children vulnerable to online sexual exploitation and grooming, as predators look to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. A lack of face-to-face contact with friends and partners may lead to heightened risk-taking such as sending sexualized images, while increased and unstructured time online may expose children to potentially harmful and violent content as well as greater risk of cyberbullying.
UNICEF together with its partners, Global Partnership to End Violence against children, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), WePROTECT Global Alliance, World Health Organization (WHO), and World Childhood Foundation USA, is releasing a new technical note aimed at urging governments, ICT industries, educators and parents to be alert, take urgent measures to mitigate potential risks, and ensure children’s online experiences are safe and positive during COVID-19.
“Under the shadow of COVID-19, the lives of millions of children have temporarily shrunk to just their homes and their screens. We must help them navigate this new reality,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “We call on governments and industry to join forces to keep children and young people safe online through enhanced safety features and new tools to help parents and educators teach their children how to use the internet safely.”
The preliminary recommended actions to mitigate online risks for children during COVID-19 include:

Title: WHO and UNICEF to partner on pandemic response through COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund
Content: 10 April 2020
NEW YORK/GENEVA/WASHINGTON DC, 3 April: The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF today announced an agreement to work together on COVID-19 response, through the historic COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund powered by the United Nations Foundation and Swiss Philanthropy Foundation.
The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund has been set up to facilitate an unprecedented global response by supporting the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan. As part of the agreement, an initial portion of the money from the Fund – which currently stands at more than $127 million – will flow to UNICEF for its work with vulnerable children and communities all over the world.
“COVID-19 is an unprecedented pandemic requiring extraordinary global solidarity to urgently respond,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “I’m pleased that UNICEF joined the Solidarity Response Fund. With their extensive experience both in fundraising and in implementing programmes, this partnership will help us to work together closely to save lives.”
The money collected through the fund will be used, among others, to train and equip communities and health-care workers to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19. It will help countries expand their health-care capacity and mitigate its social impact, especially on women, children and vulnerable social groups. And it will accelerate research and development of treatments and preventive vaccines.
As a key partner in this joined-up effort, UNICEF will lead emergency efforts to ensure families and communities in the most vulnerable countries are fully engaged in the response and have access to water, sanitation and hygiene and other infection prevention and control measures. UNICEF will also ensure children, caretakers, and frontline responders such as social workers, teachers and healthcare workers are supported through evidence-based guidance through its vast community outreach and country programs.
“This is an extraordinary emergency that demands an extraordinary response, and we need all hands on deck—individuals, corporations, foundations, governments and other organizations around the world,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “UNICEF is pleased to join the Solidarity Response Fund. It will bolster our efforts to strengthen health and sanitation systems and help protect the most vulnerable families from knock-on impacts of COVID-19 on already overstretched health systems.”
Funds raised will be spent in alignment with the global response plan, and where needs are greatest. At the direction of WHO leadership, it is expected that resources will go directly toward:
The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund was set up at WHO’s request by the UN Foundation and Swiss Philanthropy Foundation and launched three weeks ago. It is the only way for individuals and organizations to contribute directly to WHO’s global efforts to tackle the pandemic. To date the fund has $127 million raised or committed from more than 219,000 individuals from all over the world plus more than 90 global companies and organizations. The partnership is also a tremendous demonstration of solidarity across UN organizations in coordinating, partnering and supporting each other in dealing with the immediate and longer-term impact of the pandemic.
“There has never been a more urgent need for global cooperation,” said Elizabeth Cousens, President & CEO of the UN Foundation. “The COVID-19 pandemic shows us that we all can play a part to stop the spread. The incredible generosity shown to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund from around the world will help WHO, UNICEF, CEPI and partners accelerate their lifesaving work, especially to support the most vulnerable communities and speed the development of a vaccine.”

Title: UN, Government and development partners lay a ground for joint action to prevent the COVID-19 spread and reduce its social-economic impact in Turkmenistan
Content: 09 April 2020
The participants including national partners and international organizations as OSCE, EU delegation, USAID, EBRD, ADB, World Bank reviewed the proposed actions across CPRP’s 10 pillars, which are: national  level coordination; risk communication and community engagement; surveillance; points of entry; case investigation and rapid response; national laboratory system; infection prevention and control (IPC); case management; multisectoral action to mitigate the social and economic consequences; logistics and  supply management.
“The strategic goal of the plan is to prevent the importation of infection into the country and, if it appears in the country, interrupt further transmission and mitigate the social and economic consequences of the outbreak in the country,” emphasized Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
The Head of Prevention Department of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry noted that the CPRP is a comprehensive plan and meets international standards. Once it is approved, the national partners jointly with development partners will start to implement it.
The development partners informed on available financial and technical resources that could be provided to Turkmenistan within the implementation of CPRP.
Partners agreed on the following steps to be implemented:

Title: Europe and Central Asia: Health Systems, Safety Nets, and Support to Businesses All Critical to Protecting Lives and Livelihoods
Content: 08 April 2020
In addition, countries in the region can help sustain economic activity by supporting the private sector with temporary business credits, tax cuts, or tax payment deferrals. Small and medium enterprises that are impacted could benefit significantly from targeted government subsidies.
“During these exceptionally difficult times, it is imperative for policymakers to act decisively,” says Cyril Muller, World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia. “This means moving rapidly to strengthen health systems and social safety nets, supporting the private sector, and preserving financial stability and confidence — all critical to people’s lives.”
Projections of the economic implications of COVID-19 are subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, the report produces simulation exercises to illustrate the range of growth outcomes that may materialize as a result of the pandemic. *Scenarios suggest regional growth will fall into a recession in 2020, contracting to between −4.4 and −2.8 percent, held back by the coronavirus pandemic, before rebounding in 2021 as policy measures are introduced, global commodity prices gradually recover, and trade strengthens.
“Social distancing and closing of non-essential businesses and schools are necessary measures to contain the spread of the pandemic and save lives,” says Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, World Bank Chief Economist for Europe and Central Asia. “At the same time, policies must seek to minimize the economic costs of these measures and ensure the recovery is quick rather than prolonged, once the pandemic is over.”
Supportive measures such as cash transfers or healthcare subsidies, to help vulnerable people and families, and temporary business credit, and tax breaks to businesses will be critical to cushion the downturn and preserve jobs, says the report.
The COVID-19 pandemic is occurring at an already fragile time for the region. Growth in the emerging market and developing economies of Europe and Central Asia decelerated to 2.2 percent in 2019. Since February, the region has faced an increasingly uphill battle to cope with both the immediate health crisis and the long-term challenges brought about by the global pandemic.
The World Bank Group is taking broad, fast action to help developing countries strengthen their pandemic response, increase disease surveillance, improve public health interventions, and help the private sector continue to operate and sustain jobs. It is deploying up to $160 billion in financial support over the next 15 months to help countries protect the poor and vulnerable, support businesses, and bolster economic recovery.
* Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic circumstances within countries and regions are fluid and change on a day-by-day basis. The analysis in this report is based on the latest country-level data available as of 20 March 2020.

Title: COVID-19: Children at heightened risk of abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence amidst intensifying containment measures-UNICEF
Content: 27 March 2020
Download the technical note on the protection of children during the coronavirus pandemic:  https://www.unicef.org/documents/technical-note-protection-children-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic
NEW YORK, 20 March 2020 – Hundreds of millions of children around the world will likely face increasing threats to their safety and wellbeing – including mistreatment, gender-based violence, exploitation, social exclusion and separation from caregivers – because of actions taken to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF is urging governments to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children amidst the intensifying socioeconomic fallout from the disease. The UN children’s agency, together with its partners at the Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action, has released a set of guidance to support authorities and organizations involved in the response.

In a matter of months, COVID-19 has upended the lives of children and families across the globe. Quarantine efforts such as school closures and movement restrictions, while considered necessary, are disrupting children's routines and support systems. They are also adding new stressors on caregivers who may have to forgo work.

Stigma related to COVID-19 has left some children more vulnerable to violence and psychosocial distress. At the same time, control measures that do not account for the gender-specific needs and vulnerabilities of women and girls may also increase their risk of sexual exploitation, abuse and child marriage. Recent anecdotal evidence from China, for instance, points to a significant rise in cases of domestic violence against women and girls.
“In many ways, the disease is now reaching children and families far beyond those it directly infects,” said Cornelius Williams, UNICEF Chief of Child Protection. “Schools are closing. Parents are struggling to care for their children and make ends meet. The protection risks for children are mounting. This guidance provides governments and protection authorities with an outline of practical measures that can be taken to keep children safe during these uncertain times.”

Increased rates of abuse and exploitation of children have occurred during previous public health emergencies. School closures during the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa from 2014 to 2016, for example, contributed to spikes in child labor, neglect, sexual abuse and teenage pregnancies. In Sierra Leone, cases of teenage pregnancy more than doubled to 14,000 from before the outbreak.

As part of the guidance, the Alliance is recommending that governments and protection authorities take concrete steps to ensure protection of children is integral to all COVID-19 prevention and control measures, including:

Title: COVID-19: IFRC, UNICEF and WHO issue guidance to protect children and support safe school operations
Content: 10 March 2020
GENEVA/NEW YORK, - The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) today issued new guidance to help protect children and schools from transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The guidance provides critical considerations and practical checklists to keep schools safe. It also advises national and local authorities on how to adapt and implement emergency plans for educational facilities.
In the event of school closures, the guidance includes recommendations to mitigate against the possible negative impacts on children’s learning and wellbeing. This means having solid plans in place to ensure the continuity of learning, including remote learning options such as online education strategies and radio broadcasts of academic content, and access to essential services for all children. These plans should also include necessary steps for the eventual safe reopening of schools.

Where schools remain open, and to make sure that children and their families remain protected and informed, the guidance calls for:
The guidance, while specific to countries that have already confirmed the transmission of COVID-19, is still relevant in all other contexts. Education can encourage students to become advocates for disease prevention and control at home, in school, and in their community by talking to others about how to prevent the spread of viruses. Maintaining safe school operations or reopening schools after a closure, requires many considerations, but if done well, can promote public health.
For example, safe school guidelines implemented in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone during the outbreak of Ebola virus disease from 2014 to 2016 helped prevent school-based transmissions of the virus.

UNICEF is urging schools – whether open or helping students through remote learning – to provide students with holistic support. Schools should provide children with vital information on handwashing and other measures to protect themselves and their families; facilitate mental health support; and help to prevent stigma and discrimination by encouraging students to be kind to each other and avoid stereotypes when talking about the virus.

The new guidance also offers helpful tips and checklists for parents and caregivers, as well as children and students themselves. These actions include:

Title: UNICEF: 25 years of uneven progress: Despite gains in education, world still a violent, highly discriminatory place for girls
Content: 08 March 2020
More girls are going to school and staying in school than ever before, but remarkable gains in education have made little headway in helping shape a more equal, less violent environment for girls, UNICEF, Plan International and UN Women warned today in a new report.
The report, released ahead of the 64th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, notes that the number of out-of-school girls has dropped by 79 million in the last two decades. In fact, girls became more likely to be in secondary school than boys in just the last decade.
Yet, violence against women and girls is still common. In 2016, for example, women and girls accounted for 70 per cent of detected trafficking victims globally, most for sexual exploitation. An astonishing 1 in every 20 girls aged 15-19 – around 13 million – has experienced rape in their lifetimes, one of the most violent forms of sexual abuse women and girls can suffer.
“Twenty-five years ago, the world’s governments made a commitment to women and girls, but they have only made partial good on that promise. While the world has mustered the political will to send many girls to school, it has come up embarrassingly short on equipping them with the skills and support they need not only to shape their own destinies, but to live in safety and dignity,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Access to education is not enough – we must also change people’s behaviours and attitudes towards girls. True equality will only come when all girls are safe from violence, free to exercise their rights, and are able to enjoy equal opportunities in life.”
The report, A New Era for Girls: Taking stock on 25 years of progress, is issued in the context of the Generation Equality campaign and to mark the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action – the historic blueprint for advancing women’s and girls’ rights.
“It is vital that we hold governments to account on their commitment to the historic Beijing Declaration, and this report offers a wholistic picture of what the world looks like for girls 25 years on,” said Plan International Chief Executive Officer Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen. “Adolescent girls, in particular, suffer heightened discrimination as a result of their age and gender and yet continue to be side-lined in their communities and in decision-making spaces, largely invisible in government policy. Empowering adolescent girls yields a triple societal benefit – for girls today, the adults they become, and the next generation of children. If we fail to grasp this and to end the discrimination girls continue to face the world over, we will stand little chance of achieving the gender equality ambitions set out in Agenda 2030.”
“Since 1995 in Beijing, when a specific focus on ‘girl child’ issues first emerged, we have increasingly heard girls assert their rights and call us to account. But the world has not kept up with their expectations of responsible stewardship of the planet, a life without violence, and their hopes for economic independence,” said UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. “As long as women and girls have to use three times the time and energy of men on looking after the household, equal opportunities for girls to move from school into good jobs in safe workplaces are going to be out of reach. For everyone’s sake that’s got to change, along with making sure that the skills girls learn are right for the new tech and digital jobs of the future, and that the violence against them ends.”
Girls today are at a startling risk of violence in every space – both online and in the classroom, home and community – leading to physical, psychological and social consequences. The report notes that harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) continue to disrupt and damage the lives and potential of millions of girls globally. Each year, 12 million girls are married in childhood, and 4 million are at risk of FGM. Globally, girls aged 15-19 are as likely to justify wife-beating as boys of the same age.
The report also points to concerning negative trends for girls in nutrition and health, many of which were unimaginable 25 years ago. For example, globalization, a shift from traditional diets to processed, unhealthy foods and the rapid expansion of aggressive marketing techniques targeting children, have resulted in increased consumption of unhealthy foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. This has contributed to an increase in overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence. Between 1995 and 2016, the prevalence of overweight among girls aged 5-19 has nearly doubled from 9 per cent to 17 per cent, resulting in nearly twice as many overweight girls today (155 million) than in 1995 (75 million).
Meanwhile, the last 25 years have seen growing concerns about poor mental health fuelled in part by excessive use of digital technologies. The report notes that suicide is currently the second leading cause of death among adolescent girls aged 15-19, surpassed only by maternal conditions. Girls also remain at high risk of sexually-transmitted infections, including HIV, with 970,000 adolescent girls aged 10-19 living with HIV today compared to 740,000 girls in 1995. Adolescent girls aged 10-19 still account for around 3 in 4 new infections among adolescents worldwide.
The report calls for action in the following areas:

Title: Turkmenistan adopts the national nutrition programme for 2020-2025
Content: 02 March 2020
Developed with technical support of UNICEF and WHO, the National Programme on Nutrition aims at strengthening health and preventing nutrition-related non-communicable diseases.
The National Programme will support Turkmenistan’s efforts in reorienting the health system to prevention, social mobilization, and close inter-sectoral interaction to address the issue of healthy nutrition of the population. The coherence of policies and strategies in health care, education, social support, agriculture, food industry, food security and all other relevant sectors are key points of the programme.
The Nutrition Programme analyzes the nutrition status of children and adults by highliging key nutrition and health related indicators, such as rates of breastfeeding, anemia and micronutrient dificiency prevalance, obesity, stunting and wasting figures, also used for monitoring of SDGs targets. It sets a number of priorites for the Government and stakeholoders to improve the nutrition status of citizens. Among these priorities are advocacy and awareness raising on healthy diets, healthcare system strengthening to prevent alimentary-dependent diseases, ensuring adequate nutrition for pregnant women and children, prevention of obesity and nutrition-dependent non-communicable diseases, and sustainable supply of safe and healthy food products.
The new National Programme on Nutrition stems from the 2013-2017 programme and its evaluation. The evaluation findings suggested that the country should strengthen cooperation in the Programme implementation at all levels; increase acess and affordability of food and nutrition services, including nutrition for children and mothers; ensure strict control of food quality and safety; support food production as per standards; continue research on healthy nutrition in the context of the country, and train specialists.

Title: UN and Government improve cooperation in the area of human rights
Content: 24 February 2020
Chaired by the Minister of Foreign Affairs the meeting focused on identifying strategic areas of cooperation between the Commission, which is comprised of deputy ministers of 17 national agencies, and the United Nations system in Turkmenistan in human rights.
The heads of UN entities presented the achieved milestones in human rights and proposed the areas of joint engagement to deepen the cooperation.
The United Nations proposed four priorities for cooperation in 2020. They are aimed at supporting the country in: (1) the development of the national action plans, particularly the Human Rights Action Plan for 2021-2025, National Action Plan on Gender Equality 2021-2025 with their monitoring plans and budgets, (2) building capacity of the Office of Ombudsman, (3) introducing HR education at all levels, (4) engagement with the Human Rights mechanisms, especially the Special Procedures, and accession to the international human rights conventions that the country is not yet a party to.
“Given the Government’s firm commitment to the implementation of the Agenda 2030, I would like to emphasize that over 90 percent of the goals and targets of the SDGs correspond to human rights obligations. SDGs and human rights are two sides of the same coin. Without notable progress in ensuring and protection of human rights, advances made in the achievement of SDGs will be incomplete”, stressed Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator.
UN has a long-standing history of supporting the Government, the Mejlis and the Office of Ombudsperson in the area of human rights, including bringing the national legislation in line with international standards, assisting the country in reporting to Human Rights mechanisms and following up on the recommendations from them.

Title: 9 million children could die in a decade unless world acts on pneumonia, leading agencies warn
Content: 02 February 2020
BARCELONA — Boosting efforts to fight pneumonia could avert nearly 9 million child deaths from pneumonia and other major diseases, a new analysis has found ahead of the first ever global forum on childhood pneumonia in Barcelona (January 29-31).
According to a modelling by Johns Hopkins University, scaling up pneumonia treatment and prevention services can save the lives of 3.2 million children under the age of five. It would also create ‘a ripple effect’ that would prevent 5.7 million extra child deaths from other major childhood diseases at the same time, underscoring the need for integrated health services.
In 2019, the Government of Turkmenistan introduced a pneumococcal vaccine to the routine immunization plan that will help prevent occurrence of pneumonia in young children. Two-month, four-month and twelve-to-fifteen-month old children are covered through the vaccine, procured through UNICEF.
Pneumonia is caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, and leaves children fighting for breath as their lungs fill with pus and fluid. It is the biggest single killer of children, claiming the lives of 800,000 children last year, or 1 child every 39 seconds. Although some types of pneumonia can be prevented with vaccines and can be easily treated with low-cost antibiotics if properly diagnosed, tens of millions of children are still unvaccinated – and one in three children with symptoms do not receive essential medical care.
Child deaths from pneumonia are concentrated in the world’s poorest countries and it is the most deprived and marginalised children who suffer the most. Forecasts show 6.3 million children under the age of five could die from pneumonia between 2020 and 2030, on current trends. Over the next decade, deaths are likely to be highest in Nigeria (1.4 million), India (880,000), the Democratic Republic of Congo (350,000) and Ethiopia (280,000).
Health interventions aimed at improving nutrition, providing antibiotics and increasing vaccine coverage, boosting breastfeeding rates – key measures that reduce the risk of children dying from pneumonia – would also prevent millions of child deaths from diseases like diarrhoea (2.1 million), sepsis (1.3 million), and measles (280,000).
Kevin Watkins, Chief Executive of Save the Children, said:
“The number of lives that could be saved is potentially far higher as the modelling did not take account of factors like availability of medical oxygen, or action to reduce levels of air pollution, a major risk factor for pneumonia.”
“These results show what is possible. It would be morally indefensible to stand and allow millions of children continue to die for want of vaccines, affordable antibiotics and routine oxygen treatment.”
Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of UNICEF, said:
“If we are serious about saving the lives of children, we have to get serious about fighting pneumonia. As the current coronavirus outbreak shows, this means improving timely detection and prevention. It means making the right diagnosis and prescribing the right treatment. It also means addressing the major causes of pneumonia deaths like malnutrition, lack of access to vaccines and antibiotics, and tackling the more difficult challenge of air pollution.”
Outdoor air pollution contributes to 17.5 per cent – or nearly one in five – pneumonia deaths among children under five worldwide, according to a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME-GBD). Household pollution from the indoor use of solid cooking fuels contributes to an additional 195,000 (29.4 per cent) deaths.
Ninety-one per cent of the world’s population is breathing outdoor air that exceeds WHO standards. The scale of the air pollution challenge could potentially undermine the impact of scaling up pneumonia-related interventions.
Other causes of pneumonia deaths include malnutrition, and lack of access to vaccines and antibiotics. According to the Johns Hopkins modelling, of the total 8.9 million deaths from all causes that could be averted over the next decade, 3.9 million would be the result of greater efforts to reduce levels of malnutrition alone.
Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said:
“Pneumococcal pneumonia is an easily preventable, often treatable disease – no parent should go through the agony of losing their child to this disease. Over the past decade we have made progress in boosting the number of children receiving lifesaving pneumococcal vaccine and it is vital that we keep up these efforts to protect the next generation against this deadly disease. Gavi’s donor pledging conference in June will offer the international community the chance to help us do so.”
Quique Bassat, Research Professor at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) and Chair of the Global Forum on Childhood Pneumonia said:
"The disease that kills most children in the world cannot be neglected any longer in terms of its scarce global research funding. Research and innovation need to drive policy change, and lead the way for further decreases in pneumonia-attributable mortality."
Leith Greenslade, Co-ordinator of the Every Breath Counts Coalition, said:
"This analysis shows that collective action to protect children from pneumonia could really boost national efforts to achieve the SDG for child survival. Governments and international development agencies must act urgently to protect the most vulnerable children from malnutrition and exposure to air pollution, and ensure that they receive pneumonia-fighting vaccines and speedy diagnosis, child-friendly antibiotics and oxygen if they become sick. If they don’t, 9 million children’s lives are at stake.”
On January 29-31, the nine leading health and children’s organisations – ISGlobal, Save the Children, UNICEF, Every Breath Counts, “la Caixa” Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID,Unitaid and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance – are hosting world leaders at the Global Forum on Childhood Pneumonia in Barcelona, the first international forum on childhood pneumonia.
Among the announcements to be made at the forum include a more affordable, PCV vaccine from the Serum Institute of India and political commitments from governments in high-burden countries to develop national strategies to reduce pneumonia deaths.

The presentation of the HDR was conducted in the form of the national conference on inequalities and development with participation of UNDP Senior Economist, Ben Slay, Deputy Minister of Finance and Economy of Turkmenistan, Mr. Muhammedgeldy Serdarov, Deputy Minister of Health and Medical Industry, Mr. Chary Agamuradov and Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Environment Protection, Mr. Allanur Altyev.
“This year, we are talking about inequality in all its forms. As claimed in the report, inequality is multidimensional and multifaced concept, and we shall move away from measuring the progress by average salaries or average growth rates and look deeper into the substance of it. This change in thinking about progress and growth is vital to start seeking for better solutions and better policies for all,” noted Mr. Ben Slay in his statement.
Participants of the conference were delivered a presentation of the key findings and messages of the report, comments from the side of the Government of Turkmenistan on the progress made in the country for the last 10 years, and the role of UNDP is fostering sustainable development and growth.
“Turkmenistan has already achieved a lot of progress on the way of adopting and implementing SDGs, but there are persisting developmental issues that need to be addressed. It gives us a pleasure to see the level of response from the Government of Turkmenistan and its willingness to work together with UNDP to address SDGs and human development challenges. We hope that today’s event with spark a fruitful discussion and further expand the areas of cooperation between UNDP and the Government of Turkmenistan,” stated Ms. Natia Natsvlishvili, UNDP Resident Representative a.i.

Within the framework of the joint project “Sustainable Cities in Turkmenistan: Integrated Green Urban Development in Ashgabat and Awaza”, specialized equipment was purchased and installed to assess and control the state of atmospheric air for the Environmental Monitoring Service and regional laboratories of the Nature Protection Departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection.
“In order to promote sustainable practices, develop and create green cities, it is very important to make decisions based on research and collected data and analysis using specialized equipment. That is why one of the objectives of our project is to improve the practice of assessing the state of environment of the city of Ashgabat by various indicators and building the capacity of the relevant departments in processing the data received and reporting on them,” said Batyr Ballyev, UNDP/GEF project manager.
New equipment includes modern instruments and methods for determining the concentrations of pollutants contained in industrial emissions and other sources of air pollution. The employees of the Environmental Control Service underwent a 3-day training, obtained theoretical and practical skills of working on and maintaining new equipment. After practical exercises, participants of the trainings discussed further development and possible improvement of the existing environmental monitoring system.
The installation and use of this equipment by specialists of the Environmental Monitoring Service and regional laboratories of the Nature Protection Departments will significantly improve air pollution control system in Ashgabat and regional centers, and monitor air pollution at a qualitatively new level. In addition, measures taken to improve the monitoring system will also contribute to the implementation of the main goal of the project - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by optimizing the environmental control of the activities of industrial and production enterprises in and around cities.
As part of implementation of project activities, the procurement of specialized equipment for assessing and monitoring the state of water resources is underway.

Title: Tuberculosis detection with Bactec technology is available in Akhal and Balkan
Content: 25 January 2020
The detection of MDR-TB can take several months, as it is necessary to prescribe standard treatment for TB and determine if the patient responds to it. In addition, special equipment for lab tests is required and its availability is one of the important factors in the rate of detection of MDR-TB.
In this regard, the UNDP project on the diagnosis and treatment of TB in Turkmenistan, funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, supports the implementation of the National TB program and provides modern equipment for the detection and treatment of MDR-TB. Bactec MGIT technology is used for the cultural diagnosis of tuberculosis and for determining drug susceptibility to TB drugs. Earlier, laboratories of the Ahal and Balkan regions sent specimens for testing to the National Reference Laboratory in Ashgabat.
“For the timely diagnosis of MDR-TB in Turkmenistan, our project has supplied and installed Bactec MGIT equipment in the Ahal and Balkan provinces. This equipment will allow laboratory specialists in Ahal and Balkan provinces to independently conduct cultural studies on liquid media for the diagnosis and monitoring of MDR-TB treatment,” said Svetlana Tomasova, laboratory specialist at the project.
The introduction of the system into the laboratory practice provides a number of significant advantages: it reduces the time for detection of mycobacteria on average to 10-20 days, and the time for determining drug sensitivity to 5 to 14 days compared to testing on dense Löwenstein–Jensen medium, where the time for obtaining results ranges from 4 to 6 weeks. The system is fully automated, safe and has the capacity to do up to 2,700 analyzes per year.
“The drug susceptibility testing is of great importance for the proper treatment of TB patients. For the treatment of tuberculosis, a medication regimen is usually prescribed. It is important that the prescribed TB medicines have a sufficiently high activity against TB mycobacterium. Therefore, it is very important to determine which antibiotics will affect the TB mycobacterium for each individual patient. Such testing is carried out before the start of treatment, as well as during the course of treatment, because if the patient takes medication with a break, or has not completed the full course of treatment, then mycobacteria in his body will become insensitive to the prescribed drugs,” explains Svetlana Tomasova.
Ahal and the Balkan remained the only regions where it was not possible to carry out the cultural method of sputum testing in regional TB laboratories. In other regions, such equipment was installed in 2014-2015. As a result, by 2019, all regions of the country are equipped with the automated BACTEC MGIT system, which will allow a full range of drug susceptibility testing, TB diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of TB patients.

Title: New Year’s Babies: Over 361 children will be born in Turkmenistan on New Year’s Day - UNICEF
Content: 01 January 2020
An estimated 361 babies will be born in Turkmenistan on New Year’s Day, UNICEF said today. Turkmenistan’s babies will account for 0.09 per cent of the estimated 392,078 babies to be born on New Year’s Day.
“The beginning of a new year and a new decade is an opportunity to reflect on our hopes and aspirations not only for our future, but the future of those who will come after us,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “As the calendar flips each January, we are reminded of all the possibility and potential of each child embarking on her or his life’s journey—if they are just given that chance.”
Fiji in the Pacific will most likely deliver 2020’s first baby. The United States, its last. Globally, over half of these births are estimated to take place in eight countries:
Each January, UNICEF celebrates babies born on New Year’s Day, an auspicious day for child birth around the world.
However, for millions of newborns around the world, the day of their birth is far less auspicious.
In 2018, 2.5 million newborns died in just their first month of life; about a third of them on the first day of life. Among those children, most died from preventable causes such as premature birth, complications during delivery, and infections like sepsis. In addition, more than 2.5 million babies are born dead each year.
Over the past three decades, the world has seen remarkable progress in child survival, cutting the number of children worldwide who die before their fifth birthday by more than half. But there has been slower progress for newborns. Babies dying in the first month accounted for 47 per cent of all deaths among children under five in 2018, up from 40 per cent in 1990.
UNICEF’s Every Child Alive campaign calls for immediate investment in health workers with the right training, who are equipped with the right medicines to ensure every mother and newborn is cared for by a safe pair of hands to prevent and treat complications during pregnancy, delivery and birth.
“Too many mothers and newborns are not being cared for by a trained and equipped midwife or nurse, and the results are devastating,” added Fore. “We can ensure that millions of babies survive their first day and live into this decade and beyond if every one of them is born into a safe pair of hands.”

Title: Defining strategic partnership priorities with the Government of Turkmenistan for 2021-2025
Content: 03 December 2019
UNFPA and the Government of Turkmenistan marked the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Population Fund and the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD25) with a high-level advocacy event “The Government of Turkmenistan and UNFPA: Partnership for ensuring the rights and choices for all.”
The event gathered high-level representatives from the key government ministries and organizations, UN Agencies, international development partners, diplomatic missions, public and private organizations, academia, mass media and youth.
All the partners and UNFPA convened together to celebrate the achieved progress, remind about the unfinished agenda and commitments, and reflect on the lessons learnt and recommendations derived from the current programme of cooperation between the Government and UNFPA for 2016-2020. The strategic shifts required in jointly implementing the programmes for women and adolescents in the next five years to realize the goals and targets of the 2030 Development Agenda was also the focus of the discussion. The results of the current cooperation were communicated through three powerful stories of a young couple receiving improved family planning services; an empowered Y-PEER Volunteer sharing critical information on reproductive health and gender equality; and a woman with disability, who was able to make a decision on having a child and was lucky to receive the much needed support from the medical professional.
Beyond the national ICPD narratives, the high-level event also featured major highlights of the anniversary edition of the UNFPA Global Report ‘The State of World Population 2019’, outcomes of the Global Nairobi Summit held in November, and the groundbreaking results of the global costing study for the three transformative results towards ending preventable maternal deaths, ending the unmet needs for family planning and ending the gender-based violence by 2030.
Dr. Tachmyrat Siliyev, Deputy Minister of Health and Medical Industry highlighted the progress made since 1994, specifically in the area of improving maternal health and presented the financial and policy commitments voiced at the ICPD25 flagship event held in Nairobi.  “Twenty five years later after the Cairo Conference, Ministry of Health and Medical Industry once again led the Turkmenistan delegation to the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25,” said the Deputy Minister. “At the Summit we reinforced our political will to achieve universal access to reproductive health and improving maternal health; expanding the comprehensive reproductive health education for adolescents; promoting gender equality and preventing gender-based violence; and using quality data for simulating economic growth and sustainable development.”
“The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the world’s blueprint for a better future for all on a healthy planet,” said Ms. Elena Panova, United Nations Resident Coordinator. “At the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development in 1994, world leaders first spelt out the links between population, development and human rights, including reproductive rights. They also recognized that promoting gender equality is both the right thing to do and one of the most reliable pathways to sustainable development and improved well-being for all,” she said
In Turkmenistan, partnership between the Government and UNFPA began nearly 30 years ago. Today, the UNFPA support to Turkmenistan has evolved into a strategic partnership, including the fact that the current Country Programme is co-financed by the Government. “Based on extensive consultations with the government partners, public organizations, and women, men and young people, together, we were able to identify new strategic directions of our partnership for the next five years,” said Ms. Ayna Seyitlieva, UNFPA Assistant Representative. “They include providing technical support and policy advice to the Government to improve the wellbeing of women, adolescents and youth, enabled by access of quality population data, implementing programmes and mechanism to advance gender equality, and enhancing the quality and inclusive reproductive health services. We are facing ambitious tasks that we can accomplish only in close cooperation,” she added.
The 2030 Vision for Partnership was voiced through the story of a 10-year-old girl who imagines the world, which nurtures her to realize her dreams and reach her full potential. Ms. Guncha Annageldiyeva, student of the International University of Humanities and Development and volunteer of the Y-PEER Youth Center delivered an inspirational speech to showcase to the high-level guest what it means to live in a world, for which the girls of Turkmenistan aspire.
“If a 10-year-old’s rights are protected through evidence-based laws, services, information and investments, she will have a chance to reach her potential and become a valuable part of a thriving society,” said Guncha. “And what the world will look like in 10 years will depend on our doing everything in our power to ignite the potential of a 10-year-old girl today and achieve the sustainable development in our country.”

A high-level CRC@30 event was organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan and UNICEF to mark this occasion. The event secured refreshed commitment of all stakeholders, such as the government, civil society, media, private sector and academia to implement the CRC and follow up on CRC recommendations.
The event gathered both government and non-government partners, featuring speakers from all the different stakeholders, which can make a difference for child rights. The Minister of Education, as well as the Minister of Health and Medical Industry made opening statements reflecting on the importance of child rights and Turkmenistan’s achievements and continued commitment to the CRC. Young SDG Ambassadors who represent the youth of Turkmenistan shared their aspirations on what future children and young people want. Mahabat Advertising Agency under the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting and Cinematography, the public association ‘Yenme’, and the Union of Entrepreneurs spoke about the role of media, civil society and private sector, respectively, in promoting child rights. Reflecting the truly global nature of the CRC, Ambassadors and representatives of the diplomatic missions of the European Union, China and Afghanistan shared their perspectives on child rights and the CRC.
“In the face of new threats but also new opportunities for children in today’s rapidly changing world, it is our responsibility to ensure that the government, businesses and communities continue to work together and commit to action so that every child has every right,” said Christine Weigand, UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan. “It is time for a renewed commitment to the Convention and to the world’s children, particularly the most disadvantaged, here and everywhere,” she added.
“It doesn’t matter if you are blonde or brunette, if you wear glasses or not, if you have a disability or not – what matters is being a human,” exclaimed young SDG Ambassadors when talking about leaving no child behind. “We must understand that creating an inclusive society is not only the business of the Ministry of Health or Ministry of Social Protection. It is a collective effort of all the stakeholders,” said Kemal Gaitnazarov, SDG Ambassador on partnerships.
The statements at the event were blended with interactive videos, featuring UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore; children in Turkmenistan, including children with disabilities, talking about their dreams; children taking over the media space; and the World Children’s Day video calling everyone to join the global CRC@30 celebrations.
The high-level meeting is one of the CRC@30 events carried out this week in Turkmenistan. This week Turkmenistan joined the global pledge to renew commitment to child rights along with other states. On November 20th, Turkmenistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, Ms. Aksoltan Atayeva, will participate in the special CRC@30 event in the General Assembly.
Earlier in the week, at the FIFA World Cup qualifying match between Turkmenistan and Sri Lanka, which took place on 19 November, for the first time, children, including children with disabilities, accompanied players to the field, and about 26,000 fans were congratulated on the occasion of World Children’s Day through a special audio announcement. In the evening of November 20th, children will take over the media space in the “For you, children!” popular TV show. And finally, the popular entertainment centre Berkarar in the capital Ashgabat will be lit up in blue to symbolize unity for child rights.

This project was aimed at increasing the potential of public associations of Turkmenistan in managing the organization, strategic planning, the provision of social services and writing grant applications.
Upon completion of the UNDP project, the Centre to Support People with Disabilities of Turkmenistan independently using the acquired skills and knowledge presented its project for a grant from the Japanese Embassy and received funding for a project that created jobs for people with disabilities and will expand and strengthen the potential of the Center.
“The implementation of such events allows to expand opportunities for people with disabilities and contributes to the implementation of the basic principle of the Global Agenda 2030 – leaving no one  behind,” noted Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator.
Today, the greenhouse of the Center already employs 4 people full-time. The Center receives advisory support for growing vegetables, such as tomatoes and bell peppers from a private entrepreneur. It is planned that the crop received from the greenhouse will be sold in the local market. The Center plans to expand its production to fisheries.
This project became possible with the support of the administration of the Akhal velayat of Turkmenistan, which allocated 3 hectares of land for the economic activities of the Center.

Title: Over 1000 people engage in UNODC campaign to prevent trafficking in persons in Turkmenistan
Content: 07 October 2019
The campaign, which engaged over 1000 youth, representatives of government organizations, law enforcement, public organizations and universities, was the result of a two-day workshop, held in early July 2019, for 15 public sector representatives, youth and civil society organizations and mass media.
Together they developed specific action plans to conduct public awareness raising initiatives focusing on root causes, consequences and indicators of trafficking in persons and providing people with information to reduce the risk of becoming a victim and to know where to turn to in case of questions or to ask for help.
“Virtually every country in the world is affected by these crimes. The challenge for all countries, rich and poor, is to target the criminals who exploit desperate people and to protect and assist victims of trafficking and smuggled migrants, many of whom endure unimaginable hardships in their bid for a better life”, said Mr. Koen Marquering, Manager of UNODC’s Criminal Justice Program for Central Asia at a coordination meeting on countering human trafficking held at the UN Office in Ashgabat with the participation of national partners from the Supreme Court, Ministry of Interior, General Prosecutor’s Office, State Migration Service, Mejlis (Parliament), Ministry of Justice, Institute of State, Law and Democracy, Ombuds Office, Ministry of Sport and Youth Policy, Women’s Union, Magtymguly Youth Union, as well as representatives from international organizations, such as IOM, UNDP and UNFPA, and the Embassies of the United States and Russian Federation.
The campaign, which was led by national and local authorities in partnership with UNODC, USAID, IOM and civil society organizations, such as Junior Achievement and Beyik Eyyam, covered the capital city Ashgabat and 2 provinces: Dashoguz and Lebap. Interventions included multiple trainings for law enforcement and local authorities, as well as a variety of interactive sports and cultural events, quiz nights and concerts.
During the events, UNODC disseminated leaflets and posters prepared by UNODC volunteers with key messages on trafficking in Persons, such as “Have a heart for victims of trafficking”, “Some things should never be for sale. Act to Stop Human Trafficking” and “We must all get on board to Stop Human Trafficking. It is everybody’s business”.
“Victims of trafficking are often duped by a recruiter who is a relative, a supposed friend or seems like someone they can trust. Traffickers and victims often share the same nationality. UNODC helps to make people aware of these risks by running such campaigns as here in Turkmenistan”, said Mr. Koen Marquering.
During the mission, UNODC representatives met with national counterparts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the General Prosecutor’s Office in Turkmenistan to discuss further cooperation in countering trafficking in persons, including through promotion of international cooperation and mutual legal assistance.
UNODC supports national efforts to prevent and respond to trafficking in persons within the framework of the UNODC Program for Central Asia with generous financial support from the US State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL).

In his opening remarks David Pert, Deputy Head of the British Embassy noted, that the Embassy is pleased to be able to support IOM in implementing such a workshop for the mass media representatives and NGOs in combating human trafficking through prevention measures.
Addressing the participants of the workshop Azat Atajanov, the Head of IOM Turkmenistan acknowledged the importance of close cooperation with the Government Turkmenistan on the implementation of the next National Action Plan on Counter-trafficking on 2020-2022 that will include among other areas work with the national mass media and journalists. For this event IOM invited two international experts, a family couple from Belarus: Vitaut and Lana Rudnik to facilitate the training, as well as brought together representatives from the civil society working directly with vulnerable migrants and representatives of the media: national newspapers and journals, TV and radio channels, digital news agencies and young journalists from the local universities.
“Human trafficking is an important issue that needs to be addressed in a coordinated manner. Indeed, misinformation or unawareness of this phenomenon led the victims to fall into the hands of human traffickers. And mass media plays a key role in the spread of information and educating the general population about the notion of human trafficking for them to be well equipped and alerted while facing with migration issues”,- stressed Vitaut Rudnik, IOM international expert.
The program of the workshop was based on theoretical and practical learnings of global human rights activism in the context of organizing information awareness-raising campaigns to prevent and combat irregular migration and human trafficking. This workshop provided an opportunity for in-depth discussion and introspection on the role and responsibilities of journalists and media professional and the importance of coherent work of all the actors. The joint group work allowed the senior and young journalists gain a deeper understanding of key problems and challenges in the field of migration.

Title: Turkmenistan receives UNICEF’s award letter for sustaining high immunization rates
Content: 20 July 2019
Turkmenistan’s achievements in immunization have received high recognition by UNICEF.
At the international health conference commenced today, UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan Ms. Christine Weigand presented an award letter to the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry for sustaining high immunization rates through the government-financed National Immunization Programme.
“We congratulate Turkmenistan on this milestone. We look forward to continuing our long-standing and fruitful partnership for the health, nutrition and well-being of Turkmenistan’s children,” said UNICEF Representative while presenting the award letter to Turkmenistan’s Minister of Health and Medical Industry Mr. Nurmuhammet Amannepesov.
“Immunization is one of Turkmenistan’s key public health strategies to prevent diseases. We have sustained universal coverage throughout these years thanks to our partnership with UNICEF and WHO, as well as trained frontline health workers who immunize children, family doctors and public health education through media,” said Mr.Nurmuhammet Amannepesov.
Since 2001, the Government has been fully funding the procurement of all vaccines and vaccine related supplies and equipment through UNICEF. The Government has also ensured the necessary infrastructure and human resources for maintaining high vaccination rates. For the period of 2016-2020, the Government allocated more than 40 million US dollars to ensure full coverage against major vaccine-preventable diseases. Recently, the Government has allocated additional 17 million US dollars for the procurement of three more vaccines against rotavirus, pneumococcal disease and Hepatis A.
In the framework of the international health conference, UNICEF will lead a session on public health nutrition with a focus on the Fortification Monitoring and Surveillance System (FORTIMAS). FORTIMAS is a cost-effective approach for the collection of population level monitoring and surveillance data to track the implementation and impact of the flour fortification programme, also fully funded by the Government of Turkmenistan.
As an upper middle-income country, Turkmenistan is well-positioned to achieve many targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), given that it continues to increase investments in high impact interventions in public health and child survival, including in human resources and capacity development.

Title: Improving the capacity of the public sector representatives, the youth and the civil society
Content: 04 July 2019
The workshop was aimed at conducting public awareness raising campaigns on the root causes, consequences and indicators of trafficking in persons which is the main instrument to preventing and revealing the crime. More than 15 representatives of government institutions and civil society organizations, including the office of Ombudsman, the Parliament, the Prosecutor General’s office, the Women’s Union, Ministries of Internal Affairs, Education, and Sport, and Youth Policy of Turkmenistan have improved the knowledge and skills on the effective cooperation of all sectors of the society to fight against trafficking in persons, on the effective tools of carrying out preventive measures within public awareness raising events; and on the role of mass media on the enlightenment of this issue among the population.
In the course of the workshop, UNODC international experts, Ms. Rimma Sultanova and Ms. Alena Muhovikova presented a ten-step approach for effective planning and implementation of public events devoted to the World Day against Trafficking in Persons, as well as the best practices of Central Asian countries, in particular, the “100 days against trafficking in persons” campaign in Kyrgyzstan. Ms. Sultanova noted that educational and awareness raising events play an important role in preventing this phenomenon, in the sense that as trafficking in persons cases are acknowledged by law enforcement and broader public, people are informed on relevant government initiatives, support systems, hotlines and etc.
Participants of the workshop expressed their gratitude for the opportunity to learn about the experiences of other countries in conducting systematic awareness raising campaigns, and they exchanged their achievements and challenges in carrying out public events, especially on TiP issues. Moreover, during the workshop, participants suggested and agreed on a number of ideas and activities devoted to the celebration of World Day against Trafficking in Persons which will be implemented across Turkmenistan this year. Towards the end of the workshop, participants drafted a document on Plan of Activities to celebrate the World Day against Trafficking in Persons in Turkmenistan which will be submitted for the government's approval.

Title: Youth consultative forum in Turkmenistan paves the way for establishing a youth advisory group on child rights
Content: 25 June 2019
“We, the children, are experts in matters concerning us and ready to help the Government to develop child and youth focused programmes,” said Diyar Lomanov, young delegate at the Youth Consultative Forum organized by the Parliament of Turkmenistan and UNICEF.
The Forum on the occasion of the first anniversary of the adoption of the National Plan of Action for Children (NPAC) was aimed at advocating for child and youth participation in implementation and monitoring of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the National Plan itself.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the right of every child to express views, taking into account the age and maturity of the child. The right of the child to be heard is a right in itself, but it is also important for the realization of all other rights. The NPAC also stipulates that children have a right for freedom of expression in all issues related to their interests and have a right to actively participate in social, cultural, economic and public life.
Through an interactive session, young people had an opportunity to voice recommendations to the larger audience of policy makers on six goals of the NPAC, primarily, on CRC implementation, health, education, economic wellbeing, protection from violence and child participation, and on how children can play a role in the implementation of the NPAC.
“With political will and adequate resources, children and young people can positively change our world. By organizing the Forum, we hope that the Government will consider establishing a youth advisory group on child rights,” stated Siraj Mahmudlu, UNICEF Deputy Representative in Turkmenistan addressing participants of the Forum.
“With the enabling environment for child participation in our country, we are willing and ready to help develop laws and social policies concerning our life. We want to have a voice at home, at school, in the community and be able to run youth led associations. We want to participate in various decisions that affect our life,” said Jennet Shatova and Agageldi Dovletov, delegates representing the voices of youth.
If established, the youth advisory group could participate in implementing and monitoring of the NPAC and UNICEF-Government joint work plans, as well as in the development and discussion of youth-related policies and laws. The Group would also be instrumental in reporting to the Committee on the Rights of the Child and in interacting with the Office of Ombudsman.

Title: WHO highlights huge scale of tobacco-related lung disease deaths
Content: 30 May 2019
Ahead of World No Tobacco Day (31 May), the World Health Organization highlighted the damage that tobacco causes to lung health: over 40% of all tobacco-related deaths are from lung diseases such as cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and tuberculosis. WHO is calling on countries and partners to increase actions to protect people from exposures to tobacco.
“Every year, tobacco kills at least 8 million people. Millions more live with lung cancer, tuberculosis, asthma or chronic lung disease caused by tobacco,” said WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Healthy lungs are essential to living a healthy life. Today – and every day – you can protect your lungs and those of your friends and family by saying no to tobacco.”
In 2017, tobacco killed 3.3 million direct consumers as well as individuals exposed to second-hand smoke from lung-related conditions, including:
More than 60 000 children under the age of 5 die from lower respiratory infections caused by second-hand smoke. Those who live on into adulthood are more susceptible to develop a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) later in life.
What can be done?
WHO urges countries to fight the tobacco epidemic through full implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) and through the enforcement of effective tobacco control actions, including WHO’s recommended “MPOWER” policy measures, for example by reducing demand for tobacco through taxation, creating smoke-free places, and providing cessation support.
The Organization also encourages parents and community leaders to initiate steps in order to safeguard the health of their families and communities by actively informing them and protecting them from the detriments caused by tobacco.
Notes for editors:
Exposure to tobacco severely impacts lung health of people across the globe in the following ways:
Lung cancer: Tobacco smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer, responsible for over two thirds of lung cancer deaths globally. Second-hand smoke exposure at home or in the work place also increases the risk of lung cancer. Ceasing to smoke can reduce such a risk: following a 10 year period of quitting smoking, risk of lung cancer falls to about half that of a smoker.
Chronic respiratory disease: Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition where the build-up of pus-filled mucus in the lungs results in a painful cough and agonizing breathing difficulties. The risk of developing COPD is particularly high among individuals who start smoking at a young age, and those exposed to second-hand smoke, as tobacco smoke significantly slows lung development. Tobacco also exacerbates asthma, which restricts activity and contributes to disability. Early smoking cessation is the most effective treatment for slowing the progression of COPD and improving asthma symptoms.
Across the life-course: Infants exposed in-utero to tobacco smoke toxins, through maternal smoking or maternal exposure to second-hand smoke, frequently experience reduced lung growth and function. Young children exposed to second-hand smoke are at risk of the onset and exacerbation of asthma, pneumonia and bronchitis, and frequent lower respiratory infections. Smokers should ensure they never smoke in the presence of an infant or young child.
Tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB) damages the lungs and reduces lung function, which is further exacerbated by tobacco smoking. About one quarter of the world’s population has latent TB, placing them at risk of developing the active disease. Smokers are twice as likely to fall ill with TB. Active TB, compounded by the damaging lung health effects of tobacco smoking, substantially increases risk of disability and death from respiratory failure. TB sufferers are advised to take immediate steps to quit tobacco, in order for their TB treatment regime to be effective.
Air pollution: Tobacco smoke is a dangerous form of indoor air pollution: it contains more than 7 000 chemicals, 69 of which are known to cause cancer. Though smoke may be invisible and odourless, it can linger in the air for up to five hours.
How tobacco relates to the SDGs: In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of a one-third reduction in NCD premature mortality by 2030, tobacco control must be a priority for governments and communities worldwide. Currently, the world is not on track to meet this specific target.

Title: UNICEF launches #VaccinesWork campaign to inspire support for vaccines
Content: 19 April 2019
UNICEF is launching a new global campaign on 24 April to emphasize the power and safety of vaccines among parents and wider social media users.
The campaign will run alongside World Immunization Week from 24 to 30 April to spread the message that together communities, including parents, can protect everyone through vaccines.
#VaccinesWork has long been used to bring together immunization advocates online. This year, UNICEF is partnering with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization (WHO), and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to encourage even greater reach. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will contribute USD$ 1 to UNICEF for every like or share of social media posts using the hashtag #VaccinesWork in April, up to USD$1 million, to ensure all children get the life-saving vaccines they need.
Vaccines save up to 3 million lives yearly, protecting children from potentially deadly, highly infectious diseases such as measles, pneumonia, cholera, and diphtheria. Thanks to vaccines, fewer people died from measles between 2000 and 2017 and polio is on the verge of being eradicated. Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective health tool ever invented – every USD$1 spent on childhood immunization returns up to USD$44 in benefits.
“We want the awareness that #VaccinesWork to go viral,” said Robin Nandy, UNICEF’s Chief of Immunization. “Vaccines are safe, and they save lives. This campaign is an opportunity to show the world that social media can be a powerful force for change and provide parents with trustworthy information on vaccines.”
The campaign is part of a global, week-long celebration under the theme, Protected Together: Vaccines Work, to honour Vaccine Heroes – from parents and community members to health workers and innovators.
“More children than ever before are being reached with vaccines today,” said Violaine Mitchell, Interim Director of Vaccine Delivery at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “We are delighted to work with UNICEF and all the global and country partners around the world who are working tirelessly to ensure all children, especially those in the world’s poorest countries, can be protected from life-threatening infectious diseases.”
Despite the benefits of vaccines, an estimated 1.5 million children died of vaccine-preventable diseases in 2017. While this is often due to lack of access to vaccines, in some countries, families are delaying or refusing to vaccinate their children because of complacency or skepticism about vaccines. This has resulted in several outbreaks, including an alarming surge in measles, especially in higher-income countries. Uncertainty about vaccines on digital and social media platforms is one of the factors driving this trend.
That is why the centerpiece of this UNICEF campaign is a 60-second animated film, “Dangers,” which, along with illustrated animations for social media posts and posters, is based on the relatable insight that kids, by their very nature, are little daredevils who are constantly putting themselves in danger. Available in Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, Spanish and Tagalog, the video explains that while parents can’t prevent all the dangers their kids get themselves into, they can use vaccination to help prevent the dangers that get into their kids.
In addition, UNICEF experts will be answering questions about vaccination, including how vaccines work, how they are tested, why children should receive vaccines, as well as the risks of not vaccinating children in a timely manner.
Additional quotes from campaign supporters:
Angélique Kidjo, UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and Grammy Award-Winning Singer:
“Today nine in ten children receive immunizations, but we cannot leave anyone behind. We must reach every child with life-saving vaccines.”
Amitabh Bachchan, UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and longtime vaccination advocate: "Millions of frontline health workers travel vast distances: on foot, over water, through snow, even on carts to deliver life-saving vaccines. Even though they occasionally encounter fear and suspicion, they know they are saving lives. We can also do our part to combat myths and let everyone know #VaccinesWork.”
Maisa Silva, 16-year-old, Brazilian TV hostess and actress: "I accepted the invitation to participate in this campaign because I know the importance of vaccines for children's health. It is a way to protect children from various hazards we already know. Health is a very serious matter and we must not forget that vaccines work and are necessary. "

Title: Turkmenistan initiates Comprehensive National Review Bejing+25
Content: 12 April 2019
As the global community marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, and five years of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  and its Sustainable Development Goals, the moment is right to achieve irreversible and measurable progress towards this universal commitment to all women and girls, everywhere.
The comprehensive national-level review will assess progress made in the implementation and identify challenges encountered.  It will take stock of achievements, identify gaps and setbacks, and outline strategies for addressing those gaps and challenges. Also, the review will result in renewed commitment and clear sets of priority actions, with timelines, actors and resources for their implementation.  It is important to note, that the review is a great tool to align and build synergies with work on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and galvanize its gender-responsive implementation.
As per the global calendar, the national comprehensive reviews will be submitted by the Governments to the United Nations in May 2019 followed by regional reviews and consultations, consultative meetings at national and regional levels and presentations at the high-profile global events - 64th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in March 2020 and High-level meeting of the General Assembly on Beijing+25 in September 2020.
“There is a solid understanding about the importance of the comprehensive national review in supporting women empowerment and at the same time a great interest in informing the global community about the progress Turkmenistan has made towards attaining the targets under the Beijing Platform of Actions”, said Shemshat Atadjanova, Head of Democracy and International Relations Unit of the Institute of State, Law and Democracy of Turkmenistan.

Title: WHO urges stronger action to reduce deaths from noncommunicable diseases in Europe by one third
Content: 09 April 2019
The interventions range from policies that promote physical activity and curb tobacco and alcohol consumption, to reducing salt and sugar and eliminating trans-fats in food. The actions countries can take to achieve the target will be in focus at the WHO European High-level Conference on Noncommunicable Diseases taking place in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, on 9–10 April 2019.
“NCDs are the leading cause of death in the Region, and pose a massive barrier to economic and social development. While Europe is the only WHO region in the world where premature deaths from NCDs are decreasing fast enough currently to meet the target, it is also where the highest rates of alcohol and tobacco consumption are found globally. Many more lives could be saved by implementing the WHO best buys. Countries have these effective policies at their fingertips yet implementation is sadly lacking,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
NCDs – such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and diabetes – account for nearly 90% of deaths and 84% of ill-health in Europe and put increasing strain on the well-being of the population, the health systems working to treat patients, and the overall economic development of the Region, as well as increasing inequity. This burden continues to rise disproportionately in low- and lower-middle-income countries.
Closing the east–west divide in reducing NCDs
“The best buys are measures which are known to curb rates of disability and death from NCDs. The rate of implementation of the best buys is increasing in Europe, but there is still great room for improvement. We have the tools – it is now time to deliver. By implementing these interventions, countries can hope to close the health divide in Europe and achieve SDG 3.4 to reduce premature deaths from NCDs by 33% by 2030,” said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director of the Division of Noncommunicable Diseases and Promoting Health through the Life-course.
Closing the divide between NCD rates in eastern and western parts of the Region will reduce premature mortality rates significantly overall and reduce the significant inequities. For example, the risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases is 2–3 times higher for men born in the eastern part of the Region. However, by implementing the best buys countries can dramatically reduce this risk through interventions targeting the consumption of food high in salt, sugar and fats, use of tobacco and alcohol, as well as by strengthening their health systems.
Editors notes:
Best buy interventions
WHO is urging countries to implement the best buys to address NCDs. The interventions address the four key risk behaviours (tobacco use, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity) with the four key disease groups (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory disease). Mental health and air pollution were added as the fifth NCD and the fifth risk factor, respectively, at the third High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of NCDs, held in New York in September 2018.
Chronic respiratory disease, linked to smoking, has been a persistent problem in Europe. The Region has the highest proportion of tobacco use in the world, with an estimated 252 million adults (or 29%) smoking, while 18% of NCD deaths in Europe are attributable to tobacco use. Almost one in five premature NCD deaths could be avoided if tobacco use was eliminated.
WHO best buy interventions for tobacco include increasing taxation on tobacco products in order to make them less affordable. Another best buy intervention is to enforce bans on tobacco advertising and promotion, as well as sponsoring anti-tobacco mass media campaigns.
The interventions are effective – the Russian Federation, for example, experienced a dramatic reduction in tobacco and alcohol consumption following implementation of best buys with support from the Government. Smoking was reduced by 23% between 2009 and 2016, and alcohol consumption plummeted by 24% between 2010 and 2016.
In central Asia, traditional food markets and street vendors play a central role in cuisine, selling many processed meats, yoghurts and ready-to-eat meals. Unfortunately, many of these foods are energy-dense products rich in saturated fat, trans-fats and salt. The problem is worsened with increased use of processed foods, which are often rich in fats, including trans fats, sugar and salt. All these ingredients are strongly linked to the development of NCDs – specifically diets high in trans-fats, which increase the risk of heart disease by 23%.
Implementation of the WHO best buys will have a positive influence on all NCDs. They propose such options as eliminating industrial trans-fats through the development of legislation to ban their use in the food chain (recently adopted in a large number of European countries, including in Eurasian Economic Union Member States), or reducing sugar consumption through effective taxation and mass media campaigns on healthy diets, including social marketing campaigns to reduce the intake of salt and saturated fats and promote consumption of fruits and vegetables.

Title: UN supports aligning Turkmenistan’s national health indicators with the 2030 Agenda
Content: 15 February 2019
The compliance of the national health indicators with the international methodology will specifically support the monitoring and reporting of the progress in Sustainable Development Goals in a Turkmenistan context.
Ms. Bahar Agayeva, Head of the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, facilitated the working session attended by the representatives of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry of Turkmenistan, State Statistics Committee of Turkmenistan, UNFPA and World Health Organization in Turkmenistan.  The participants discussed the application of the SDG metadata to the national indicators on maternal mortality ratio, the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel, the proportion of women of reproductive age (aged 15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods, and adolescent birth rate.
The meeting reviewed the compliance of the indicators and their processing, clarified technical questions, worked out the reporting structure and identified the areas of focus, such as the development of the methodological guide for processing data under SDG health targets and indicators.
Earlier UNFPA conducted the Baseline Assessment of the Sustainable Development Goals indicators that relate to reproductive rights and maternal health, gender equality and data for development - the key issues promoted by the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), the main guiding document for UNFPA’s efforts globally and in Turkmenistan.
“The need for analyzing the compliance of the national health indicators with the internationally adopted methodology was one of the findings and recommendations of the Baseline Assessment initiated by UNFPA,” said Ms. Bayramgul Garabayeva, UNFPA Assistant Representative.  “The Government already has a system in place for data collection and reporting, and UNFPA stands ready to further advance the existing system and national capacity and align it with the international standards.  Aligning the national indicators with the international SDG metadata will strengthen the quality of monitoring and reporting of the SDG progress in the country,” she said.
The focus of the assessment was on a detailed evaluation to consolidate, further analyze, disaggregate the existing data to serve as SDG baselines and to inform programming and policymaking for women and population and development actions.  Other findings of the Assessment include the establishment of an internet resource with the SDG data and information on the country’s progress towards SDG targets, gaps in data availability and potential solutions.
Technical meetings will continue with the national partners on aligning the national indicators on gender equality, quality education and data for development.

Title: Russian experience in SDG monitoring presented in Turkmenistan
Content: 24 January 2019
The United Nations in Turkmenistan has supported the visit of experts of the Russian Federation State Statistics Committee (ROSSTAT) to share their experience in developing Sustainable Development Goals’ monitoring system. The mission had meetings with the State Statistics Committee of Turkmenistan and the UN Agencies in Turkmenistan culminated in the round table discussion for the members of the national interagency SDG Working Group.
The Russian experts presented the organization of the data collection process, how the intersectoral coordination process was organized for the collection of administrative statistics for SDG reporting, how non-governmental organizations and the private sector were involved in this process. They also shared their experience in the website development and database and platforms they used to create such a database, etc.
The Russian experts addressed questions of the participants in collecting, adapting international data and meta-data and how they can be replicated in Turkmenistan.
“Strengthening national capacity involves many issues - this includes interaction between departments, various training courses, the study and adaptation of new methods and technologies for collecting information. The main principle of the implementation of SDGs is that the SDG statistics should be based on the national priorities”, stressed Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
The ROSSTAT example in this regard is very indicative, as they participate in numerous national and international initiatives. Over the years, they have proved to be an organization with a long history capable of responding very quickly to the demands of the rapidly changing world. The contribution of ROSSTAT to the work of the CIS countries, BRICS and, of course, very active participation in the inter-agency expert group on SDG indicators is indeed considerable.

Content: 27 August 2018
The event attended by representatives of diplomatic missions, international organizations, environmental experts, civil society and mass media drew the Summit outcomes presented by the Foreign Minister of Turkmenistan, heads of the UN Country Office, UNRCCA and OSCE.
“I believe that holding of the Summit was timely, as the problems of the Aral Sea basin have deteriorated. The scale of the impact of the Aral Sea crisis has spread far beyond the region of Central Asia. This means that the efforts of the countries themselves in the region are not enough. We need a unified, coordinated approach to solving this problem of absolutely all partners: governments, the UN, donor organizations, financial institutions, civil society, youth, and the private sector” noted Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan.
She also welcomed the Summit decision to adopt the Program of actions on providing assistance to the countries of the Aral Sea Basin (ASBP-4) and Concept of UN Special Program to join efforts and capacities of the states of the region and the international community in order to address the overall priority issues as water, environmental and socio-economic dimensions.

Title: UN Mourns Death of Former Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Content: 20 August 2018
The UN Office in Turkmenistan deeply mourns the death of the seventh UN Secretary General, Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Kofi Annan will be remembered for his leadership in important moments in the life of the United Nations, a significant contribution to strengthening the Organization's central role in the world arena, its reform in order to build up the authority and capacity for a long-term solution to global problems based on respect for human rights and the rule of law, as well as for his advanced initiatives in defense of the peace and well-being of all mankind.
The UN flag was lowered  on Monday, 20 August and will remain at half-mast until Wednesday, 22 August 2018, 6:00 pm.
The United Nations office in Turkmenistan has placed a condolence book at the front hall of the United Nations Office open from 12:00 on 20 August 2018 to 17:00 on 22 August 2018 to allow the Government representatives, diplomatic corps accredited in the country and people of Turkmenistan to pay tribute to Mr. Annan.
UN House is located at 21 Archabil Avenue, Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.
***
18 August 2018. Mr. Annan was the seventh man to take the helm of the global organization and the first Secretary-General to emerge from the ranks of its staff.
The current UN chief, Antonio Guterres hailed him as “a guiding force for good” and a “proud son of Africa who became a global champion for peace and all humanity.”
“Like so many, I was proud to call Kofi Annan a good friend and mentor. I was deeply honoured by his trust in selecting me to serve as UN High Commissioner for Refugees under his leadership. He remained someone I could always turn to for counsel and wisdom — and I know I was not alone,” Mr. Guterres said in a statement.
“He provided people everywhere with a space for dialogue, a place for problem-solving and a path to a better world.  In these turbulent and trying times, he never stopped working to give life to the values of the United Nations Charter. His legacy will remain a true inspiration for all us.”
Kofi Annan was born in Kumasi, Ghana, on 8 April 1938.
He served as UN Secretary-General for two consecutive five-year terms, beginning in January 1997.
Mr. Annan joined the UN system in 1962 as an administrative and budget officer with the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, rising to hold senior-level posts in areas such as budget and finance, and peacekeeping.
As Mr. Guterres noted: “In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination.”
From his beginnings in Geneva, Mr. Annan held UN posts in places such as Ethiopia, Egypt, the former Yugoslavia and at Headquarters in New York.
Following Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, he was tasked with facilitating the repatriation of more than 900 international staff as well as the release of Western hostages.
He later led the first UN team negotiating with Iraq on the sale of oil to fund purchases of humanitarian aid.
Immediately prior to his appointment as Secretary-General in January 1997, Mr. Annan headed the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations during a period which saw an unprecedented growth in the Organization’s field presence.
His first major initiative as UN chief was a plan for UN reform, presented to Member States in July 1997.
Mr. Annan used his office to advocate for human rights, the rule of law, development and Africa, and he worked to bring the UN closer to people worldwide by forging ties with civil society, the private sector and other partners.
As Secretary-General, he also galvanized global action to fight HIV/AIDS and combat terrorism.
Mr. Annan and the United Nations jointly were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.
In his farewell statement to the UN General Assembly in December 2006, Kofi Annan expressed emotion over leaving what he called “this mountain with its bracing winds and global views.”
Although the job had been difficult and challenging, he admitted that it was also “thrillingly rewarding” at times.
“And while I look forward to resting my shoulder from those stubborn rocks in the next phase of my life, I know I shall miss the mountain,” he said.
However, Mr. Annan did not rest, taking on the role of UN Special Envoy for Syria in the wake of the conflict which began in March 2011.
He also chaired an Advisory Commission established by Myanmar in 2016 to improve the welfare of all people in Rakhine state, home to the minority Rohingya community.
His homeland, Ghana, established an international peacekeeping training centre that bears his name, which was commissioned in 2004.

Title: Partners Commit to Eliminate Double Burden of Malnutrition
Content: 21 July 2018
Eight member states of Central Asia and Caucasus supported by UNICEF, WHO, FAO and WFP committed to strengthen capacity and governance in improving the nutrition and food security status of the most vulnerable in the region today at the official launch of the Regional Nutrition Capacity Development and Partnership Platform.
The platform provides an opportunity for member states and UN agencies in the region to come together towards a collective call for action on a nutrition agenda supporting governments in delivering on commitments of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The Nutrition Platform members committed to accelerate progress towards meeting the SDGs, the global nutrition targets for United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition 2025 and the Noncommunicable Diseases Global Monitoring Framework.
“Children across the Region are facing the double burden of being obese or stunted,” said UNICEF Deputy Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia Philippe Cori. “I invite governments of Central Asia and Caucasus to position food security and nutrition higher in the development agenda, ensure increased investments and have dedicated and stronger trained workforce to eliminate the double burden of malnutrition and obesity. Investing in children’s nutrition is one of the most effective investments a country can make for its sustainable development.”
The Platform aims to address all forms of malnutrition including stunting, obesity as well as micronutrient deficiencies. The current prevalence of child obesity in Central Asia is estimated to be the second highest globally (10.7 %), while the number of overweight under five-year-old children has doubled from 1.6 to 3.2 million between 2000 to 2017.
Infant and young child feeding practices need to be addressed across the Region due to low quality diet and poor feeding practices during the first years of life.
This initiative will enhance capacity in the region under the following areas:
The two-day meeting concluded with official launch of the platform by adopting a joint statement with the Republic of Kazakhstan confirming they will chair the Platform for the next two years.
Delegates from Central Asia and Caucasus as well as representatives of FAO, WFP, WHO and UNICEF expressed their gratitude to the Government of Turkmenistan for successfully hosting the first meeting of the Regional Nutrition Capacity Development and Partnership Platform.

Opening the discussion, Mr. Dejan Keserovic, Regional IOM Coordinator for Central Asia underlined that “IOM and the Government of Turkmenistan continue to effectively cooperate in three areas that were named strategic areas of cooperation during the meeting between the Esteemed President of Turkmenistan, His Excellency Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov and Director General of IOM Mr. William Lacy Swing in 2013. Combating human trafficking is one of these areas. Other two areas include Migration and Health and Migration and Emergencies.”

Title: United Nations Launches Regional Counter-terrorism Project
Content: 30 April 2018
The Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT), Vladimir Voronkov, and Michèle Coninsx, Assistant Secretary-General and Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), have just concluded a joint high-level visit to Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.
During the first day of the visit, Mr. Voronkov, accompanied by Ms. Natalia Gherman, the Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) for the UN Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia (UNRCCA), met with President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow and discussed potential areas of cooperation between Turkmenistan and the UNOCT. Mr. Voronkov thanked the President for Turkmenistan's contribution to the regional stability.
On the second day of the programme, the delegation, joined by Ms. Coninsx, attended a high-level launch of the next phase of a regional project to counter terrorism in Central Asia. This project is jointly implemented by the UNRCCA and the UN Counter-Terrorism Centre within the UNOCT.
The high-level launch was hosted by H.E. Rashid Meredov, Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan, and SRSG Gherman. The event gathered the Deputy Foreign Ministers of five Central Asian States – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan – Heads of Regional Offices of international organizations, representatives of government institutions of Turkmenistan, the diplomatic community, and accredited media.
In November 2011, the five countries developed a regional initiative to implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, known as the Joint Plan of Action for Central Asia (JPoA).
The JPoA is now entering its third phase. "Towards a Comprehensive Implementation of United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia” is broader in scope and consists of capacity-building activities in common priority areas. The latter were identified by the Central Asian Member States and the United Nations at a High-Level Dialogue on Counter-Terrorism that took place in June 2017 in Ashgabat and was attended by UN Secretary-General António Guterres. The JPoA embraces preventive measures against terrorist threats in the region, emphasizing information and best practice sharing, as well as regional partnerships. The new initiative will mainstream human rights in its implementation.
At the launch, Mr. Voronkov commended the five Central Asian countries on their efforts to address the threat posed by terrorism and violent extremism in a coordinated manner. “Increasing international cooperation at the regional and global levels is a must to effectively fight terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism,” he said. “The Joint Plan of Action for Central Asia clearly demonstrates the benefits of regions coming together as one to tackle the scourge of terrorism,” he added.
Michèle Coninsx, Assistant Secretary-General and Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), noted that since 2015 had CTED conducted assessment visits, on behalf of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee, to all five countries of Central Asia, most recently to Turkmenistan in November 2017. “These visits have yielded a wealth of information on the counter-terrorism capacities and technical assistance needs of these States and provided the Committee and CTED with a complete picture of the counter-terrorism situation in the region,” she stated.
UNRCCA will facilitate regional and cross border cooperation in preventing violent extremism and countering terrorism, in coordination with other international and regional partners active in this field in Central Asia. "Today's event, which focuses on preventing violent extremism and countering terrorism, should be seen through the prism of international and regional cooperation, since tackling these phenomena cannot be left to one state alone, or just a group of them. It is a much larger effort that is required for an effective response to terrorism and violent extremism, "said SRSG Natalia Gherman.
Deputy Foreign Ministers of Central Asian States described their countries’ vision and efforts to tackle the phenomenon of terrorism and extremism through their national strategies.
At the conclusion of the visit, participants reiterated their commitment to working with the United Nations in support of implementing the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its Joint Plan of Action for Central Asia, in particular through the new phase of this regionally owned counter-terrorism initiative.

Title: Monitoring System for the National Human Rights Action Plans
Content: 01 December 2017
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), together with the Working Group of the Interdepartmental Commission on Human Rights, held a seminar on the development of a monitoring and evaluation system for the implementation of the National Human Rights Action Plans of Turkmenistan (NHRAP). The seminar was carried out as part of a joint UNDP project with the National Institute for Democracy and Human Rights under the President of Turkmenistan. The seminar was titled "Assisting in the implementation of the National Action Plan for Human Rights for 2016-2020".
Participants in the meeting discussed the process of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the activities of the NHRAP, determined its advantages and disadvantages, and also considered how well the organization functions, which includes its procedures and the role of NHRHAP generally. As noted by the international expert of UNDP, Mr. Sinisa Milatovic: "The existence of an effective monitoring system enables the responsible ministries and departments to monitor progress in achieving the expected results in the field of human rights. The proposed human rights monitoring system will also contribute to the implementation and monitoring of relevant goals, targets and indicators for sustainable development adopted by Turkmenistan in 2016, in particular Objective 16 on rule of law and governance issues".
In the second half of the workshop, special attention was paid to the institutional structure of the monitoring system and the reporting format for collecting information on the implementation of the NHRAP.

Title: State of World Population 2017 Report Presented in Ashgabat
Content: 16 November 2017
UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund’s flagship Report, The State of World Population (SWOP) 2017, titled “Worlds Apart: Reproductive Health and Rights in an Age of Inequality” was presented today in Ashgabat. The Award Ceremony of the Media Competition 2017 for the best published materials in gender equality followed the Report Launch.
The Report was presented at the ceremony, which was attended by the Turkmen national partners, representatives of the UN agencies and international organizations, the diplomatic corps, university professors and students, as well as the civil society and national and international mass media. The report was also launched globally in more than 100 countries.
The costs of inequalities, including in reproductive health and rights, could extend to the entire global community’s goals, states the new UNFPA report.
Failure to provide reproductive health services, including family planning, to the most vulnerable women can weaken economies and sabotage progress towards the sustainable development goals.
“The 2030 Agenda has envisaged a better and more inclusive future,” said Elena Panova, United Nations Resident Coordinator and UNFPA Representative in Turkmenistan. “One where we collectively tear down the barriers and correct disparities, focusing first on those left furthest behind. Reducing all inequalities needs to be the aim. In that respect, some of the most powerful contributions can come from realizing gender equality and women’s reproductive rights.”
UNFPA’s Worlds Apart report calls for actions that lead to a brighter future, where all women govern their own lives, have equal access to reproductive health care and have the knowledge, skills and power to find gainful employment.
During the SWOP Report Launch in Ashgabat, Mr. Batyr Orazov, Deputy Director of the Turkmen National Institute of Democracy and Human Rights under the President of Turkmenistan, welcomed the guests of the event and expressed appreciation to UNFPA for the continued partnership.  He noted the results of the country in promoting gender equality.  The adoption of the National Action Plan on Gender Equality in Turkmenistan for 2015-2020, with UNFPA support, continues to serve as the major instrument for gender mainstreaming in all spheres of life.
Mr. Muhammet Ergeshev, Head of the Treatment and Prophylactics Department of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, read the opening statement of the Deputy Minister, which reiterated the importance and relevance of the topic.  He outlined key milestones in the strategic partnership between UNFPA and the Ministry of Health in realizing the reproductive rights of women and couples.  He further reaffirmed the commitment of the Government of Turkmenistan in providing universal access of the people to the reproductive health services.
The key findings and recommendations of the Global Report were presented by Ms. Ene Tuyliyeva, UNFPA Advocacy Communication Associate.  Ms. Tuyliyeva gave an overview of the linkages between the economic inequalities and gender inequalities, as well as inequalities in access to reproductive health services.
When a woman is able to exercise her reproductive rights, she is more able to benefit from her other rights, such as the right to education. The results are higher incomes, better health for her and her children and greater decision-making power for her, both in the household and the community. When women and men together plan their childbearing, children benefit immediately and in their long-term prospects. “That is what 179 governments agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994,” said Ms. Tuyliyeva.
Ms. Bayramgul Garabayeva, UNFPA Assistant Representative in Turkmenistan, continued the dialogue by presenting the relevance of the Report to Turkmenistan.  In her interactive presentation, Ms. Garabayeva made a focus on importance of increasing access of women, especially most vulnerable groups, to the reproductive health information, services and commodities.  The partnership between UNFPA and Ministry of Health and Medical Industry was described, starting from the beginning of cooperation when UNFPA delivered contraceptives into the country.
Key milestones were featured, including development of the first national strategy on reproductive health in the region and establishment of the reproductive health centers and rooms countrywide, and later the adoption of the new indicator into the medical statistical system, which helped better identify most at risk women.  Most significant milestone was the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding, where the Government demonstrated a financial commitment to procurement of the contraceptives in the country in 2014.  At the end of the partnership roadmap was the establishment of the Coordination Committee, which will further reduce the gap in women’s access to reproductive health services, enabling them to realize their reproductive rights, especially those furthest behind.
“UNFPA is proud of the achievements of the Government of Turkmenistan in realizing the reproductive rights of women and couples in the country,” said Ms. Garabayeva.  “Although we are very close to reaching the goal of providing universal access to women and couples to reproductive health, much remains to be addressed.  We hope that the Coordination Committee will be an effective mechanism in meeting the needs of women.  It is also crucial that evidence-based analysis and timely forecasting is conducted by the Committee to ensure uninterrupted supply of at least four methods of contraceptives in the country.”
Ms. Akjemal Durdyeva, Director of the National Reproductive Health Center of Turkmenistan and a member of the Coordination Committee further presented the structure, key stakeholders and functions of the Committee under the leadership role of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry.  Ms. Durdyeva assured that the primary purpose of the Committee is to work together with the private sector to identify women in need and ensure that they are equipped with the modern methods of contraception in a timely manner.  “This will help us significantly improve maternal and child health in our country,” said Director.
The Report Launch concluded with the Award Ceremony of the UNFPA Media Competition 2017.  Here, UNFPA recognized the winners of the Media Competition under the theme “Equal opportunities of women and men in achieving the sustainable development”, which was announced in the beginning of the year.
Journalists of the national media submitted more than 40 materials covering the issues of women empowerment, gender in healthcare, education and employment.  Five media materials published in the national and local media were awarded the first prizes during the SWOP Report Launch in Ashgabat for quality and in-depth coverage.
“Media plays a key role in promoting gender equality in our society,” said Ms. Bayramgul Garabayeva, UNFPA Assistant Representative in Turkmenistan during the Award Ceremony.  “The UNFPA Media Competition allows us to raise the awareness of the public at large on importance of the issue.  It is also noteworthy that the annual UNFPA Media Competition, which is now a tradition, has already created a professional network of journalists interested in covering the issue of gender equality.  This year it was a great pleasure to see an entire sequence of creative works published on women empowerment, male engagement and existing mechanisms and legislation in Turkmenistan promoting gender equality.”

Title: Explaining the Importance of Children's data, One Region at a Time
Content: 15 November 2017
The State Statistics Committee (SSC) in partnership with UNICEF and the United Nations Office of the Resident Coordinator (UNRCO) in Turkmenistan completed a series of workshops for the representatives of the health, education, and social protection departments of the capital and velayats on Sustainable Development Goals and children.
From June to November this year, a team of specialists from UNICEF, UNRCO and SSC reached each region of the country with an objective to sensitize relevant social sector representatives on SDGs, child related indicators and UNICEF data collection tools, such as the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) on the situation of children and women in Turkmenistan. The importance of baseline was underlined for the measurement and reporting of child related indicators in SDGs with timely and credible collection of data at etrap, velayat and national level.
“We take pride in early nationalization of SDGs in Turkmenistan, which shows the country’s commitment to leaving no child behind,” said Gozel Charyyeva, Head of the Demography Department of the State Statistics Committee. “The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and other internationally comparable data that we will collect with support of UNICEF, will serve as a basis to measure the progress in the area related to children’s wellbeing in Turkmenistan,” she said.
Turkmenistan adopted 187 SDG indicators, of which 55 are considered child-related. UNICEF, as the global leader of data for children, is the custodian for 10 global SDG indicators and co-custodian for further seven indicators. Better disaggregated data is necessary to meet the commitment to leave no one behind. In this role, UNICEF supports countries in generating, analyzing and using data for these indicators for all their citizens.
“At the early stage of SDGs implementation in Turkmenistan, it is important that we ensure using data to drive better results for children to support decisions, target investments and interventions in order to reach the most vulnerable children. Together with State Statistics Committee, I am pleased that UNICEF is taking this wider UN mandate for reaching the SDGs for all children. The process of generating evidence on results for children must inspire everyone, hence the more we engage on building capacities at all levels, the better it pays back to the country in achievement of SDGs,” said Shaheen Nilofer, UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan.
As a step forward, the Government of Turkmenistan and UNICEF are carrying out an assessment that will look into availability and disaggregation of latest data to serve as baselines for SDG indicators, focusing primarily on child-related indicators.

Title: Increasing Women's Access to Reproductive Health
Content: 07 November 2017
The new partnership between the government and private sector will reduce the gap in women’s access to reproductive health services, enabling them to realize their reproductive rights, especially those furthest behind.
Establishment of the new Coordination Committee On Ensuring the Supply of Reproductive Health Commodities in State and Private Pharmacies, Reproductive Health Centers and Rooms, as per the Order of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, was the result of the UNFPA advocacy meeting in April 2017. More than 20 representatives of the government and private sectors came together to discuss how to work together to improve women’s access to reproductive health services, including contraceptives, in the context of UNFPA’s phasing out assistance to the country.
Following UNFPA’s two decades of contraceptives supply in Turkmenistan, this year the Government of Turkmenistan has assumed full financial responsibility for procurement of contraceptives due to the upper-middle income level status of the country. While the Government will cover the needs of the vulnerable population, there is a need to fill the gap and meet the needs of the rest of the women of fertile age who want to use contraception.  This is where the private sector comes into play. The newly established Coordination Committee will provide effective coordination of stakeholders to ensure uninterrupted supply of modern contraceptives essential for ensuring reproductive health, in particular among vulnerable populations.
“Family planning saves lives. We’re proud that our strategic partnership with the Government of Turkmenistan in ensuring universal access of women in Turkmenistan to reproductive health services has sustainable results,” said Ms. Bayramgul Garabayeva, UNFPA Turkmenistan Assistant Representative. “Expanding options and choices for the women by empowering them to enjoy their right to make their own decisions about the timing and spacing of pregnancies is one important pathway towards their economic security and independence.  It is also a pathway towards more balanced economies and societies.”
Nearly half of women of fertile age of Turkmenistan use modern methods of contraception. Another 12 percent are defined as having an unmet need for modern contraception, meaning they would like to delay or avoid childbearing but do not have means or access to contraception.
For the last three years, UNFPA has partnered with the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry to address these issues by integrating a ‘total market approach’ to family planning in Turkmenistan. This means working with multiple sectors – including the government sector and commercial suppliers – to ensure that all people can choose, obtain and use quality contraceptives whenever they need them.
The Order on establishment of the Coordination Committee sets out the structure, key stakeholders and functions of the Committee under the leadership role of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry.
As per the Order, the government-owned 95 National Reproductive Health Centers countrywide, also initially launched by UNFPA, will continue offering the modern methods of contraception free of charge to the women with at risk health conditions or low socio-economic status. According to the National Reproductive Health Center of Turkmenistan, there are 1.5 mln women of fertile age in Turkmenistan and nearly 16 percent are registered as most at risk women. “Identifying women in need and equipping them with modern methods of contraception in a timely manner through the newly established mechanism will help us significantly improve maternal and child health in our country,” said Ms. Akjemal Durdyeva, Director of the Center.

Title: New Tools for Justice Practitioners to Stop Human Trafficking
Content: 06 November 2017
To support implementation of the action plan UNODC conducted a series of consultations with government counterparts and international partners in Turkmenistan to discuss needs of criminal justice practitioners in relation to investigation and prosecution of human trafficking crimes.
"Trafficking in persons is a complex, hidden crime. Tackling it requires strong capacity and coordination on the part of law enforcement and judicial bodies, as well as effective victim and witness support and protection", noted Koen Marquering, UNODC International Coordinator.
The UNODC mission met with representatives of the General Prosecutor's Office, the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Interior and the Migration Service. State bodies, international organizations and diplomatic missions also gathered for a meeting of the Technical Working Group on counter-trafficking issues in Turkmenistan.
David Newton, UNODC International Consultant on trafficking in persons, presented the UNODC Anti-Human Trafficking Manual for Criminal Justice Practitioners and other training tools.
"The UNODC manual is a practical training tool, which addresses every phase of the criminal justice response to trafficking in persons - from identification of victims to investigations and prosecutions of human trafficking, including victim support and protection", said Mr. Newton, the lead author of the manual.
As a result of the mission, preliminary priority issues were identified, which will now form the basis for the development of a basic training manual on the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking crimes for criminal justice practitioners in Turkmenistan. Workshops for police officers, prosecutors, judges and other relevant stakeholders are foreseen in 2018.
UNODC provides assistance to Turkmenistan and other countries in Central Asia in implementing the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking In Persons, Especially Women and Children with funding provided by the US State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.

Title: Turkmenistan's Priority Positions in the Next UN General Assembly
Content: 18 August 2017
Regular 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly will start in a few weeks. According to the tradition on occasion of this important event of international life, Turkmenistan will promulgate Priority Positions, which our country will carry out and uphold during coming political season.
Such openness and willingness to joint solution of urgent problems of modern world’s development, which became distinguishing feature of Turkmen diplomacy, are highly appreciated in international communities and indicate growing authority of our neutral state as a reliable member of the United Nations.
Unwearing and steadfast uphold of common peace, security and stability are the key area of Turkmenistan’s activity during the 72nd session of the General Assembly. In this work, our country will rest on broad and multi-format partnership with the United Nations Organizations, which has always been and remains a strategic vector of foreign policy of Turkmenistan.
Active cooperation with partners in counteracting the terrorism will be continued. Particularly, Turkmenistan is willing to cooperate actively with this structure for further implementation of Ashgabat Declaration adopted by the outcomes of the High Level Central Asia – the UN Dialog for implementation of the UN Global Counterterrorist Strategy in central Asia on June 13, 2017 in Ashgabat under UN General Secretary presidency.
Turkmenistan assigns an important role to preventative diplomacy in prevention of conflict situations, elimination of the root causes, creation of the atmosphere of trust between the countries, formation of favourable conditions for efficient cooperation of the state in political, diplomatic, economic, social, ecological and other spheres. In this context, the significance of the work of the UN Regional Centre for Preventative Diplomacy in the Central Asia for fulfilment of the above-mentioned objectives in the Central Asian region is growing objectively and our country proposes to review the opportunity of the development and adoption of the Resolution to support the mechanisms of preventative diplomacy in solution of topical problems in provision of peace and security during the 72nd session of the General Assembly.
Taking into account the realities of the modern world, which development is accompanied by advanced achievements in informative and technological spheres, Turkmenistan considers it reasonable to approach the subject of provision of global cyber security and to propose the world community to activate the work on this matter during the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly.
Further consolidation of the partnership for achievement of the Goals of sustainable development (the GSD) will be priority vector of the activity of our state in international arena. Carrying out integrated and efficient work together with the UN in this direction from October 2015 and having made National mechanism for implementation of the GSD, Turkmenistan considers it reasonable to use an opportunities of the high-level political forum “Transformation on the Way to Sustainable and Vigorous Society” coming in 2018 during the 72nd session. 

Highlighting the significance of the sports as an important factor of provision of sustainable development, our country again confirms its adherence to consolidation of international sport cooperation aimed at realization of the principles of development and peace, expansion of the right and opportunities of people, solution of the objectives in health care, education, social integration and other spheres.
Following these purposes and relying on the Final Declaration of International Sports Congress “Asian Games 2017: International Sports Cooperation for Peace and Development” published as official document of the 71st session of the UN General Assembly, Turkmenistan confirms its proposal on organization of the 7th International Conference of the minsters and leading personnel responsible for physical training and sports in the country under the UNESCO aegis. 

As is known, Turkmenistan, invariably following the provisions of the UN General Assembly Resolution of September 25, 2015 “Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” and recognizing growing input of the sport in expansion of the rights and opportunities of certain people and communities, initiated the participation of the Olympic team of refugees during V Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games on September 17 – 27, 2017 in Ashgabat. 

In this context, our country suggests to adopt the document on encouragement of priceless contribution of the Olympic refugee team in consolidation of peace and security under the 36th session of the UN Human Rights Council in September 2017 in Geneva. 

Special place in activity of Turkmen diplomacy during the 72nd session of the UN general Assembly will be given to the development of cooperation in transport sphere. Our country will continue active support to implementation of the decisions taken by the world community aimed at formation of new and intensification of existing international transport and transit corridors. 

As is known, the UN Global Sustainable Transport Conference was held in November 2016, which resulted in adoption of Ashgabat Declaration defining the main parameters of international cooperation in this sphere based on the principles of provision of sustainability and reliability of international transport and transit infrastructure. Referring to this document and for fulfilment of the objective of the 2030 Agenda, Turkmenistan proposes to review the development of the General Assembly Resolution “Development of Multimodal Transport for Achievement of the Goals of Sustainable Development” during the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly. In addition, our country suggests reviewing the opportunity of declaring of the Year of sustainable transport in near future on the UN level. 

Same as previously, cooperation in energy sphere, provision of sustainable and fair access to energy resources are one of the main directions of foreign strategy of Turkmenistan.
Turkmenistan will fulfil clearly and steadily the provisions of relative UN General Assembly Resolutions aimed at provision of reliable and stable energy supply and in this regard, to reconfirm its willingness to the development of close cooperation with all interested states and international organizations. 

In 2017, Turkmenistan is a chairing country of the Conference of International Energy Charter. According to the concept of its chair, our country performs the number of comprehensive measures within this year, which are to activate the process of the development of new international legal mechanism in sustainable energy. In this context, Turkmenistan confirms its commitment to the activity of international expert group for development of multilateral documents on energy security and formation of sustainable energy system. 

At the same time, Turkmenistan will actively participate in making of organizational, legal, economic, technical and other conditions, which are necessary for diversification of energy sources and supply routes of energy carriers. 

Intensification of cooperation between the states and international structures in provision of energy efficiency and saving is one of the priorities of the activity of the world community. In this regard, our country consider it to be reasonable to review the subject of the beginning of the process for summarizing of the outcomes and recommendations of international conferences and meetings on energy range of problems held under the UN aegis for future concentrated statement in relative multilateral document of the United Nations Organizations during the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly. 

Initiative support of international partnership in ecology field is traditionally recognized feature of foreign policy course of Turkmenistan. Our state will actively participate in international efforts for solution of important issues of environmental protection, management of water resources and mitigation of the consequences of natural and anthropogenic catastrophes during coming session of the General Assembly. 

Taking into account the chairing of Turkmenistan in International Fund for Saving of the Aral Sea (IFAS), our country suggests to hold the Summit of the Heads of IFAS Founder States with participation of specialized international structures like the UNDP, UNEP, the UN Regional Centre of Preventive Diplomacy in the Central Asia in Turkmenistan in 2018. Turkmenistan also offers to review the subject on establishment of international expert group, which would start the development of special Aral Ecological Programme in cooperation with the UN. 

Being firmly committed to intensification of international efforts in solution of pressing humanitarian problems, Turkmenistan confirms the willingness to active partnership with the UN and its specialized structures in implementation of practical measures for fulfilment of fundamental UN Conventions in human rights as well as compliance to its obligations followed from international humanitarian right. 

Under the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly, our country will concentrate the efforts at cooperation with the United Nations specialized structures for implementation of national and regional programmes and action plans on provision of human rights and freedoms adopted according to international legal documents of the UN. 

Special part in this activity will be assigned to the partnership with the United Nations agencies for implementation of National Action Plan on human rights in Turkmenistan for 2016 – 2020. 

Priority positions of Turkmenistan are another evidence of the responsibility, openness and resolution of our country to do all necessary together with the world community for consolidation of peace, stability and equal security on the planet, assertion of humane principles and ideals of the UN, achievement of the Goals of sustainable development.

Title: The Rights of Women and Youth in Turkmenistan's Future
Content: 24 July 2017
Government partners gathered at a roundtable to discuss the methodology of SDGs data collection and analysis in the area of reproductive health, gender equality, youth development and data. The meeting was co-led by UNFPA and the State Statistics Committee (SSC) of Turkmenistan.
Ms. Gozel Mosheva, Representative of the State Statistics Committee, gave an overview of Turkmenistan’s active part in the global consultations on adopting the SDGs and the ongoing work in adapting the SDG targets and indicators to match the national context. Ms. Mosheva noted that the Government of Turkmenistan, with support from the United Nations agencies, has adopted all 17 goals, its 169 global targets, as well as 39 additional national targets. SSC representative further elaborated on responsibility of the relevant ministries in integrating and monitoring the SDG targets and indicators in the area of reproductive health, gender equality, youth and data. The consultations continue on the targets that will require intersectoral engagement.
The concept of Big Data was presented by Mr. Dovran Yamatov, UNFPA National Programme Associate on Population and Development and Gender Equality. Mr. Yamatov stimulated a discussion on challenges and possibilities of using the Big Data in monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals in Turkmenistan.
Big Data is large volume of digital information that reveal the behavior of people taken from multiple sources, including online news and social media, trends in online search, mobile phone usage or even transaction records. Following the principles of data privacy and personal data protection, the Big Data analytics can positively contribute to sustainable development and monitoring the Global Goals.
For instance, according to the United Nations Global Pulse, UN Secretary-General’s innovative initiative on Big Data, mapping the movement of mobile phone users can help predict the spread of infectious diseases, contributing to SDG 3 on good health and well-being. Analysis of financial transactions can reveal the spending patterns and different impacts of economic shocks on men and women, contributing to the SDG 5 and targets on gender equality. Better use of data for sustainable development can be achieved through partnerships to enable the combining of statistics, mobile and internet data that can provide a better and real-time understanding of today’s hyper-connected world.
“UNFPA, as one of the world’s largest supporters of population data collection, believes that data can inform and increase the effectiveness of investments in health and rights of the women and young people,” said Mr. Yamatov. “The importance of today’s round-table is the discussion among the national stakeholders on the ways forward and actions toward monitoring the progress of SDGs in Turkmenistan in the area of data for development, gender equality, reproductive health of women and young people. We at UNFPA stand ready to continue our partnership with the Government in equipping with the monitoring tools and methodologies to help integrate the global goals and targets into the national plans and strategies.”

Title: Secretary-General Outlines Steps to Strengthen UN System
Content: 07 May 2017
Stating that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the “boldest agenda for humanity” and requires equally bold changes in the United Nations development system, Secretary-General António Guterres today outlined steps to better place the Organization to deliver tangible results in the lives of the people it serves.
“We need to change in order to secure the promise of sustainable development, human rights and peace for our grandchildren and we have no time to lose,” Mr. Guterres told the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
“The UN development system, therefore, must itself be far more integrated [and aligned] in our response […] to work seamlessly across sectors and specializations – and to do so more effectively.”
Mr. Guterres noted that his report to the Council (on repositioning the UN development system) is an integral component of the broader reform agenda at the UN to better meet the world’s complex and interlinked challenges.
He added that his ideas and proposals are intended to spur further discussions in the Council and to solicit the views of Member States on a number of key areas. A more detailed report will be submitted in December.
Mr. Guterres highlighted eight key guiding areas for his proposed reforms. The first is accelerating the transition of the UN development system from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the 2030 Agenda and, at the same time, closing gaps and improving skillsets.
“We must be able to provide advice, pool expertise and help governments implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and help convene the partners they require to take actions to scale,” he said.
He also highlighted the need for a stronger focus on financing for development to help governments better leverage financing as well as working with a broad range of actors including the private sector, international financial institutions and other partners.
Another area of focus is enhancing the effectiveness of UN Country Teams – which comprise all UN agencies operating in a particular country – to build on the strengths of individual agencies while delivering with greater coherence, unity and accountability.
He also underlined the need to “delink” the functions of UN Resident Coordinators from UNDP Resident Representatives to enable more effective and integrated analysis and planning at the country level to encompass the dimensions of sustainable development.
Further, he noted that reform efforts would be taking place at the headquarters levels as well to ensure that no new bureaucracies or superstructures are created.
To that end, he announced that Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed has been tasked to oversee and provide strategic guidance to the UN Development Group and lead a Steering Committee to strengthen coherence between humanitarian action and development work.
Other areas of focus included strengthening a more cohesive UN policy voice at the regional level; strengthening accountability of the UN development system; and ensuring effective and efficient funding structures that would offer greater value-for-money and reporting on system-wide results.
Noting that the success of the reforms would be seen in tangible results in the lives of the people served by the Organization, the Secretary-General said that many of the issues raised in the report would require further consideration and that he looked forward to working with the Member States on that matter.
“Repositioning the UN development system is our shared responsibility […] I am convinced that, together, we can take the bold steps that the new agenda requires and that humanity deserves,” he stated.

Title: Investigators Learn to Recognize Signs of Human Trafficking
Content: 01 May 2017
The training followed a similar seminar for judges and prosecutors held in March and is part of a series of capacity building activities on human trafficking for Turkmenistan’s criminal justice practitioners implemented by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
“The training equipped students with up-to-date knowledge and skills on identification of trafficking in persons, as well as crime scene and physical evidence examination” noted David Newton, an independent expert on trafficking in person working with UNODC to facilitate the training. “Through case studies and role play participants learned about human trafficking case management and practiced their skills to recognize indicators of trafficking and interview victims and witnesses”, Newton added.
To support capacity development on the criminal justice response to trafficking in persons, UNODC has developed an Anti-Human Trafficking Manual for Criminal Justice Practitioners of Turkmenistan.
“Our manual highlights promising practices that criminal justice practitioners can rely on to identify, investigate and prosecute human trafficking cases.” said Koen Marquering, UNODC International Coordinator.
“We call on the Government of Turkmenistan to regularly organize such training and use the manual to guide capacity development of law enforcement officers, prosecutors and judges in line with Turkmenistan’s National Action Plan to combat human trafficking”.
In conjunction with the training, UNODC facilitated a coordination meeting of UN agencies and other international organizations to discuss public awareness raising initiatives for the prevention of human trafficking. Various joint initiatives are planned to celebrate the World Day against Trafficking in Persons (30 July).
UNODC supports Turkmenistan’s efforts to strengthen the criminal justice response to trafficking in persons with funding provided by the US State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.

Title: Turkmenistan Invests in Essential Vaccines
Content: 27 April 2017
“Immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health investments we can make for a healthy future of children. Globally, each year, approximately 1.5 million children still die unnecessarily from diseases that could have been prevented by vaccines. There are complex reasons to this, including issues of access to vaccination services, insufficient human and financial resources allocated to immunization programs. Turkmenistan’s sustainable and increasing investments in immunization is practical determination of its commitment to strengthen maternal and child health with increased capacity of a future generation. The survival, health and well-being of women, children and adolescents are essential to achieving all the Sustainable Development Goals. UNICEF will continue to support the Government in providing procurement services to all vital immunization supplies for the routine series of vaccination, as well as in introducing new vaccines into the national immunization schedule”, said UNICEF Representative in Turkmenistan Shaheen Nilofer on the occasion of the World Immunization Week.
The recent findings from the 2015 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey provided evidence of more than 95% full immunization coverage among children along with progress in other critical child well-being indicators, which is the result of the strong political will and allocation of the public resources in immunization, as well as in health, education and social protection programmes for children and families. Immunization not only saves lives, it contributes to the social and economic wellbeing of communities and returns 16 US$ for 1 US$ invested in by saving in healthcare costs, lost wages and productivity due to illness.
In 2015, the Government of Turkmenistan and UNICEF signed a five-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for procurement of life saving vaccines for over 40 million US dollars. The scope of the MOU enables the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry to procure essential drugs and equipment for child survival and health. The total amount doubled from the previous six-year agreement, which reiterates the Government’s commitment to protect children from various forms of vaccine preventable diseases.
Partnerships with the Government of Turkmenistan and UNICEF on immunization started in 1994 when the Government signed an agreement called the Vaccine Independence Initiative. Since then Turkmenistan became fully self-sufficient in vaccine procurement and has sustained high immunization coverage. UNICEF and WHO have provided support to the Government of Turkmenistan in polio eradication, training on immunization programme management, safe immunization practices, upgrading existing cold chain facilities, and development of a computerized monitoring system for vaccine distribution and utilization. Last year, the Government of Turkmenistan upgraded cold chain equipment for all primary health care facilities, as well as introduced the administration of the new Human Papilloma Virus vaccine for all 9-year-old children, both girls and boys, across the country.

Title: National Action Plan on Gender Equality Discussed
Content: 12 April 2017
The focus of the round-table, organized by the National Institute of Democracy and Human Rights under the President of Turkmenistan and UNFPA, United Nations Population Fund was to establish a monitoring and evaluation framework for the National Action Plan (NAP) on Gender Equality in Turkmenistan for 2015-2020.
The Working Group of the Interministerial Commission on the implementation of the international obligations of Turkmenistan in the area of human rights, with participation of UNFPA, UN Women, UNDP, met to agree on the framework of the monitoring tool to be used to track the progress of the National Action Plan.
This was a follow-up meeting to the Coordination meeting of national stakeholders with the UN agencies on implementation of the NAP on Gender Equality, organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan in July 2016.  At the July meeting, a road map has been developed by thirty-two members of the Working Group with concrete activities and actions to successfully implement 14 strategic tasks spelled out in the NAP on Gender Equality, identification of a coordinating agency among government structures for each objective and setting the timeline for implementation of every activity.
In his opening remark, Mr. Batyr Orazov, Deputy Director of the National Institute of Democracy and Human Rights noted that significant work has been accomplished by ministries and public organizations of Turkmenistan in implementation of the National Action Plan on Gender Equality in Turkmenistan.  “Identifying clear indicators for the NAP on Gender Equality will help better measure the results of the activities in the area of gender equality and women empowerment,” he stressed.
Ms. Bayramgul Garabayeva, UNFPA Assistant Representative stated in her opening speech that Turkmenistan plays a leading role in adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals and nationalizing the targets and indicators of the Global Goals.  The monitoring indicators developed for NAP will also be relevant for the national plans and development strategies in the area of gender of the line ministries. This will also contribute to the overall monitoring and evaluation system currently being developed for the adopted National Human Rights Action Plans. Ms. Garabayeva assured the national partners that UNFPA stands ready to support in providing the methodology and data collection, including establishing baselines.
Prior to the discussions on the framework for monitoring the Plan, the overview of the international practices in developing and conducting the monitoring and evaluation framework of the national action plans in the area of gender equality have been presented by Mr. Dovran Yamatov, UNFPA National Programme Associate on Population and Development and Gender equality.  Mr. Yamatov introduced the proposed monitoring and evaluation framework for the NAP on Gender Equality in Turkmenistan.
The members of the Working Group have reviewed 14 targets and activities of the National Action Plan, established the expected results, baseline and target indicators, discussed the possibility of costing the plan and updated the partners and responsible agencies. Next steps have been identified by the members of the Working group in further improving the framework and actions to finalize it.
“Turkmenistan regularly presents its periodic reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women,” noted Ms. Garabayeva. “While the establishment of the solid monitoring and evaluation framework will serve as an important instrument for successful implementation of the Plan, the data collected on gender equality and women empowerment during monitoring and evaluation, will also be a good asset in presentation of the results to the Committee.”
The NAP on Gender Equality was developed with support of UNFPA and approved on 22 January 2015, and substantial work has already been done for realization of the plan. This includes awareness raising trainings among line ministries, legislative analysis and its improvement, studies of international legislative practices in domestic violence, and dissemination of information on gender equality among the public.
The plan also addresses the issues on elimination of discrimination against women, promotion of equal opportunities for women, equal access to quality education, health care and the labor market, as well as the fulfillment of international treaty obligations. The NAP aims to strengthen national capacity on reporting, monitoring and implementation of Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and other human rights obligations relating to gender equality.

Title: Turkmenistan Gains Skills to Manage Health Emergencies
Content: 30 March 2017
Representatives of the national ministries, members of the recently established National Working Group on Emergency Risk Communications (ERC), have built their capacities in emergency communications as part of national preparations to the V Asian Indoor and Martial Games to be held in September 2017 in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.
For this purpose, the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry of Turkmenistan in cooperation with the WHO Country Office organized a national training and simulation exercise (SimEx) carried out in the Olympic Village. The main objective of the training and SimEx was to build capacity of the communication group throughout the preparedness, response and recovery phases of a serous public health event.
The National ERC Working Group consisting of the communication focal points of the key national ministries and members of the UN Communications Group has been mandated to cope with outbreaks and health emergencies during the first ever biggest sports forum held in Turkmenistan.
The Group drafted and reviewed the ERC Action Plan. The Plan sets forth the overarching goal of communications during a health emergency and aims to mitigate adverse effects through ensuring informed decision-making and encouraging positive behaviour change in target audiences. The document also describes the main principles of risk communication and provides the tools to be used in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
The ERC plan considers MERS-CoV as potential threat during the sports forum. By September 2017 the Working Group will complement the plan by other potential threats as earthquake, mudslide or other infections.

Title: Justice Practitioners Learn New Legislation to Stop Human Trafficking
Content: 27 March 2017
Following the entry into force of amendments to the Criminal Code of Turkmenistan in 2017, the training aimed to build the knowledge and skills of criminal justice practitioners on the practical application of the new legislation in line with the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children.
“During the training, the participants studied the evidence investigators should provide and opportunities to strengthen it”, noted David Newton, an independent expert on trafficking in person working with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to facilitate the training. “We also discussed case management in trafficking in persons cases, common defense strategies and how to counter them, considerations in sentencing and compensation for trafficking victim”, Newton added.
Based on consultations with Turkmenistan’s law enforcement bodies and judicial institutions, UNODC has developed a new Anti-Human Trafficking Manual for Criminal Justice Practitioners. This manual, which is based on a global UNODC tool and adapted to reflect Turkmen criminal legislation, was tested during the training and used as a basis for interactive discussions and group exercises.
“Training practitioners is a key step to put adopted legislation into practice”, stated Koen Marquering, UNODC International Coordinator. “It takes time and dedicated resources for a national criminal justice system to acquire sufficient expertise to detect, investigate and successfully prosecute cases of trafficking in person”, he added.
In conjunction with the training, UNODC facilitated a coordination meeting of State bodies, international organizations and diplomatic missions. During the meeting, UNODC presented an assessment report on the compliance of Turkmenistan’s anti-human trafficking legislation with international standards. Participants confirmed the need to review the implementation of the 2016-2018 National Action Plan of Turkmenistan to counter trafficking in persons. Joint action to celebrate the World Day against Trafficking in Persons (30 July) and engage in regular public awareness raising for the prevention of trafficking in persons was also recommended.
UNODC supports Turkmenistan’s efforts to strengthen the criminal justice response to trafficking in persons with funding provided by the US State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.

Title: Reproductive health issues will be better catered to students
Content: 14 March 2017
. Education specialists from the capital and all velayats of the country have met in Ashgabat to discuss and agree on the set of indicators to measure the knowledge of the school students on reproductive health topics, a direct link to the quality of teaching the material.  The monitoring indicators will also help measure the progress towards the relevant targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The issues of reproductive health, gender equality and reproductive rights are being taught in 7 to 11 grades of the secondary schools of Turkmenistan.  The quality of teaching of these issues is increasingly improving, as in the past years UNFPA and the Ministry of Education of Turkmenistan have jointly developed six national standards of reproductive health education, teacher’s competencies required to teach the subject, as well as the teacher’s manual to ensure that the methodologies used are interactive and effective.
Two-day intensive meeting focused on integrating the teaching norms and standards, and different ways of assessing it, for instance, through measuring the knowledge of students, to find out to what extent the taught materials have been internalized by the adolescents.  Indeed, finding the right methodology is a challenge, considering that the subject does not only provide knowledge, but also life skills to be an effective communicator, to be able to think critically and make responsible life choices in regard to relationships and their health.   The team of education specialists have agreed on the methodology and set of indicators that would reflect the level to which the students have been able to grasp the subject.  This will be done through a specially designed questionnaire, which was developed during the meeting.
Specifically, the questions will test whether the students know the international and national legislation in the area of reproductive health and gender equality, can identify gender stereotypes, know traditional and universal values that allow us to practice reproductive rights and have healthy families.  The questionnaire also reveals whether the youth knows different models of behavior, their critical thinking and conflict-solving skills, as well as assess the knowledge on leading healthy reproductive life.  This includes correctly identifying the ways of preventing and acquiring the sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.
During her opening speech, Ms. Bayramgul Garabayeva, UNFPA Assistant Representative in Turkmenistan congratulated the Ministry of Education of Turkmenistan for adopting the SDG target on substantially increasing the supply of qualified teachers.  Academically well-trained teachers play a key role in ensuring the quality of education, especially in the area of reproductive health.
“UNFPA will continue to partner with the Ministry of Education in integrating the relevant SDG targets and indicators into the national development programmes and monitoring frameworks,” said Ms. Garabayeva.  “Providing quality education in the area of adolescent reproductive health and rights for young people is critical for achieving the Global Goals. We stand ready to support the Ministry in measuring the progress of the target on continuously improving the qualification of the teachers to better cater the issues of reproductive health, reproductive rights and gender equality to adolescents in Turkmenistan.”

The presentation of the reports Human Development For Everyone and Progress at Risk: Inequalities and Human Development in Eastern Europe, Turkey, and Central Asia took place in cooperation with the Ministry of Economy and Development of Turkmenistan.
In his opening remarks Deputy Minister of Economy and Development stressed that the goals of UNDP and the Government of Turkmenistan match, and named recent experience of adopting SDGs as one of the examples. “Increasing of the cooperation between the Government of Turkmenistan and the United Nations is the priority of the strategic development of the country. In 2016, Turkmenistan acted as a vice-chair of the 71st UN General Assembly and chairs three UN committees.”
UNDP experts delivered presentations of the reports where they underlined the importance of the informed decision making based on the high-quality data provided by the national statistical offices. The reports summarize the global trends in development conclude that the distribution of wealth around the world is not equal and there is a strong need to make sure that nobody is left behind.
In the presentation by the representative of the Ministry of Economy and Development it was stressed that starting from 2007 Turkmenistan has launched several programmes to promote equal growth of cities and rural areas and ensure that each citizen of the country has access to social services and improved lifestyle. Turkmenistan has also engaged into the process of transitioning from MDGs to SDGs and makes significant progress on improving the living of its citizens. This is one of the reasons why country is ranked as “low” on inequalities among Central Asian states.
“It is a great honor, jointly with the Ministry of Economy and Development, to launch the 2016 Global and Regional UNDP Human Development Reports. UNDP works closely with the Government of Turkmenistan to ensure that the benefits of development progress are fairly distributed and no one is left behind.  Human development for everyone requires high quality and disaggregated data and analysis to inform more targeted national policies and programs.  We believe that the development progress should be widely shared as this is essential for sustaining the foundations for peaceful, just and inclusive society.,” stated Elena Panova, UNDP Resident Representative in Turkmenistan.
UNDP advisors Ben Slay and Elena Danilova-Cross also held a lecture at the International university of humanities and development for 500 students and faculty to popularize the topic of human development and raise its importance to the students and faculty of the university.
“Human development is the criteria for economic, social and political and any other development. It is also an indicator for measuring the success of implementation of SDGs. This is why it is so important for academia to be involved as it brings up future generation,” stated Ben Slay, UNDP Senior Advisor.
It was noted that Turkmenistan is taking steps in gradual implementation of SDGs and soon there will be an SDG centre responsible for study and analysis of the implementation process.

Title: UNDP holds a workshop on strategic planning
Content: 06 February 2017
The goal of the seminar is to enable public associations with strategic planning skills for the purpose of financial sustainability and engagement into cooperation with the government.
“The work of public associations and civil sector in general is very important because it plays a very important role in supporting the work of the government in the sphere of work. We are very pleased that UNDP’s project has created a platform that encourages and supports the dialogue between the Government of Turkmenistan and public associations,” said Ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Germany in Turkmenistan.
The workshop led by the international expert Erkina Ubysheva took place with participation of representatives of 18 public associations of Turkmenistan providing social services and representing thematic unions of Turkmenistan.
During the seminar, public associations received technical knowledge on how to develop a strategy, shape the mission and hold monitoring and assessment. During the seminar, theoretical knowledge was put into practice and participants drafted strategic plans of development for their organizations.
“One of the reasons why the government does not always see and cannot assess the scale of positive work of the public associations is because organizations do not demonstrate the impact of their work. Many forget about the mission, and therefore, cannot effectively plan their activities. It is therefore necessary to focus on organizational development, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation of the impact of organization’s activities,” explained the international expert.
The seminar took place with financial support of the Embassy of Germany in Turkmenistan.

Content: 02 May 2016
The Government of Turkmenistan and the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) has dedicated 17 days, (one day per goal) in March 2016 to discussing what Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), targets and indicators the country should adopt to implement over the next 15 years. Each goal group was co- led by a government ministry together with a UN agency.
During each of the 17 days, relevant ministries, agencies and departments discussed the goal, its corresponding targets and indicators in order to agree what SDG targets and indicators Turkmenistan would formally adopt. The goal groups exchanged views on various critical issues, including national capacities, foreseen challenges in the implementation, vagueness and the lack of global methodologies for measuring some indicators. They also discussed what SDG targets and indicators would be inserted into the Presidential Socio- Economic plan 2017- 2021 and sector plans and programs.
As a result of the consultations, 121 out of 169 targets were recommended for adoption as they are and 27 targets were modified. Of 241 indicators, 109 were accepted in the current definition, and 50 were modified. In addition, 39 national indicators were formulated. Total 197 indicators. This list of recommendations will go to the Cabinet of Ministers for formal approval.

Title: Day 17: The Goal 17 “Partnerships for the Goals,” a core topic at the last SDGs consultations
Content: 31 March 2016
The final discussion of the Sustainable Development Goals consultations in Turkmenistan concluded with the Goal 17 “Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.” The consultation was co-led by the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economy and Development and the World Bank (WB), supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF).The goal includes the following background,
“While official development assistance from developed countries increased by 66 percent between 2000 and 2014, humanitarian crises brought on by conflict or natural disasters continue to demand financial resources and aid. Many countries also require Official Development Assistance to encourage growth and trade.
The world today is more interconnected than ever before. Improving access to technology and knowledge is an important way to share ideas and foster innovation. Coordinating policies to help developing countries manage their debt, as well as promoting investment for the least developed, is vital to achieve sustainable growth and development.” [1]
Representatives of about 10 national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed 10 targets to the Goal 17 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of today’s consultation have modified nine targets to the local context. Two of 24 indicators were accepted without modification. Five national indicators have been developed.

Title: Day 16: The SDGs consultations covered the Goal 9 “Industry, innovation, infrastructure”
Content: 28 March 2016
The World Bank (WB) together with the Ministry of the Economy and Development has presented the Goal 9 “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation” at the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consultations. The UN agencies, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Women, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) supported the facilitation of the consultations. The Goal 9 includes the following background,
“Sustained investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important, as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies.
Technological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges, such as providing new jobs and promoting energy efficiency. Promoting sustainable industries, and investing in scientific research and innovation, are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development.
More than 4 billion people still do not have access to the Internet, and 90 percent are from the developing world. Bridging this digital divide is crucial to ensure equal access to information and knowledge, and as a consequence foster innovation and entrepreneurship.” [1]
Representatives of about nine national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed eight targets to the Goal 9 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of today’s consultation agreed to adopt three global targets as is, and four were adjusted to the local context.  Three of 12 indicators were accepted without modification.  Six national indicators have been developed.

Title: Day 15: The focus of the SDGs consultations is the Goal 10 “Reduced inequalities”
Content: 25 March 2016
Goal 10 “Reduce inequality within and among countries” was presented at the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consultations by the International Organization of Migration (IOM) and the Ministry of Economy and Development. Consultations were coordinated with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank (WB), the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The goal includes the following background,
“It is well documented that income inequality is on the rise, with the richest 10 percent earning up to 40 percent of total global income. The poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 and 7 percent of total global income. In developing countries, inequality has increased by 11 percent if we take into account the growth of population.
These widening disparities are a call for action that require the adoption of sound policies to empower the bottom percentile of income earners and promote economic inclusion of all regardless of sex, race or ethnicity.
Income inequality is a global problem that requires global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of financial markets and institutions, encouraging development assistance and foreign direct investment to regions where the need is greatest. Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also key to bridging the widening divide.” [1]
Representatives of about 12 national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed 10 targets to the Goal 10 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of today’s consultation agreed to adopt six global targets as is, and three were modified.  Five of 11 indicators were accepted without modification.  Four national indicators have been developed.
Topics that drew much attention of the participants were about income growth of the low income population, equal opportunities, reducing inequalities of outcome, including promotion of the appropriate legislation, policies and action. Implementation of the well-managed migration policies were also in the focus.
Currently, Turkmenistan provides 10% annual increase in wages, pensions and stipends. Nevertheless, the participants discussed the importance of preparing a legal framework to focus on a target group -- bottom 40 percent of the population.
The group also stressed the importance of well-managed migration policies for ensuring safe and responsible migration and mobility of people, which contributes to the economic development of the country.

Title: Day 14: The SDGs consultation and the Goal 12 "Responsible consumption and production"
Content: 24 March 2016
The United Nations Development Programme along with the State Committee for Nature Protection and Land Resources have presented the Goal 12 “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” at the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consultations.  The goal includes the following background,
Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Agriculture is the biggest user of water worldwide, and irrigation now claims close to 70 percent of all freshwater appropriated for human use.
The efficient management of our shared natural resources, and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants, are important targets to achieve this goal. Encouraging industries, businesses and consumers to recycle and reduce waste is equally important, as is supporting developing countries to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption by 2030.
A large share of the world population is still consuming far too little to meet even their basic needs. Halving per capita global food waste at the retailer and consumer levels is also important for creating more efficient production and supply chains. This can help with food security and shift us towards a more resource efficient economy.”[1]
Representatives of about 10 national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed 11 targets to the Goal 12 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of today's consultation agreed to adopt ten of the global targets as is. One target was modified to the local context. Three of 13 indicators were accepted without modification. Three were changed to the local context, six require further clarification. Two national indicators have been developed. They are about adopting national legislation in the area of rational use of resources and developing national models of sustainable consumption in economic sectors of the country including water, food security, and energy.
All participants emphasized the importance of process optimization in economic sectors to ensure rational production taking into account general public demand for consumption.

Title: Day 14: The SDGs consultation and the Goal 16 “Peace, justice and strong institutions” is in the spotlight
Content: 24 March 2016
Goal 16 “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels” is the focus of today’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consultations, conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), General Prosecutor’s Office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs,   supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), International Organization of Migration (IOM), and the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The goal includes the following background,
“Peace, stability, human rights and effective governance based on the rule of law are important conduits for sustainable development. We are living in a world that is increasingly divided. Some regions enjoy sustained levels of peace, security and prosperity while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is by no means inevitable and must be addressed.
High levels of armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country’s development, affecting economic growth and often resulting in long standing grievances among communities that can last for generations. Sexual violence, crime, exploitation and torture are also prevalent where there is conflict or no rule of law, and countries must take measures to protect those who are most at risk.” [1]
Representatives of about 13 national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed 12 targets to the Goal 16 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of todays’ consultation agreed to adopt all global targets as is.  Sixteen of 23 indicators were accepted without modification.  Four were changed to the local context, and one national indicator has been developed.
Crucial topics covered during the consultations were related to the issues of reducing all forms of violence, including in relation to children, tackling corruption and developing effective and accountable institutions.
While there is no national definition of physical, psychological and sexual violence, the country already gathers relevant data. In the near future, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in cooperation with the national partners will carry out a survey on domestic violence. Whereas the roll out of the survey is underway, the data from this survey will be used to recommend changes in legislation improvement, the adoption of which will allow expand UN-Government cooperation in this area.
The participants agreed on the importance of fighting corruption as it allows people to enjoy equal rights and access to justice as well as government services.

Title: Days 12 and 13: The Goal 8 “Decent work and economic growth” has been discussed on the SDGs consultations
Content: 22 March 2016
Discussions at the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consultations proceeded with the Goal 8 “Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.” The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection and the Ministry of Economy and Development have led the consultation, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), International Organization of Migration (IOM), and the UN Women. The goal includes the following background,
“Over the past 25 years the number of workers living in extreme poverty has declined dramatically, despite the long-lasting impact of the economic crisis of 2008/2009. In developing countries, the middle class now makes up more than 34 percent of total employment – a number that has almost tripled between 1991 and 2015.
However, as the global economy continues to recover we are seeing slower growth, widening inequalities and employment that is not expanding fast enough to keep up with the growing labour force. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people are unemployed in 2015.”[1]
Representatives of about 11 national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed twelve targets to the Goal 8 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of todays’ consultation agreed to adopt five of the global targets as is, three were modified o the local context, and two will be adopted in case of developing relevant national methodologies.  Five of 17 indicators accepted without modification.  Six were changed to the local context, two requires further clarification.
The discussion was focused on employment assistance for different target groups, such as youth, migrants, and unemployed people. The participants highlighted the importance of improvement of employment conditions and social benefits for the mentioned groups.
They also stressed on ongoing and new programs in Turkmenistan that already carry out relevant projects. For example, a recent approved National Programme for youth employment that encompasses assistance in occupation, entrepreneurship and support to young families. To implement significant for Turkmenistan indicators, the participants agreed on developing measure system, which will be a part of the final step for SDGs.

Title: Day 11: The SDGs consultations concentrated on the Goal 7 “Affordable and clean energy”
Content: 18 March 2016
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consultation continued with the discussion of the Goal 7 “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all,” presented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Ministry of the Oil and Gas of Turkmenistan. The goal includes the following background,
“Between 1990 and 2010, the number of people with access to electricity has increased by 1.7 billion, and as the global population continues to rise so will the demand for cheap energy. A global economy reliant on fossil fuels and the increase of greenhouse gas emissions is creating drastic changes to our climate system. This is having a visible impact on every continent.
However, there has been a new drive to encourage alternative energy sources, and in 2011, renewable energy accounted for more than 20 percent of global power generated. Still one in five people lack access to electricity and as the demand continues to rise there needs to be a substantial increase in the production of renewable energy across the world.
Ensuring universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 means investing in clean energy sources such as solar, wind and thermal. Adopting cost-effective standards for a wider range of technologies could also reduce the global electricity consumption by buildings and industry by 14 percent. This means avoiding roughly 1,300 mid-size power plants. Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean energy sources in all developing countries is a crucial goal that can both encourage growth and help the environment.” [1]
Representatives of about ten national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed five targets to the Goal 5 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of todays’ consultation agreed to adopt all five global targets as is. Two of six indicators accepted without modification.  One was changed to the local context, one requires further clarification. Two national indicators were developed.
Discussion mainly covered such topics as energy intensity and renewable sources of energy. First needs qualified human resources and computation methodology. Since Turkmenistan has undertaken commitment to report for energy intensity, the recommendation is to consult with the State Committee of Nature Protection and Land Resources to work on the given indicator.
The country also intends to develop renewable sources of energy and work in this direction in the future. The participants proposed reporting in terms of a number of explored technologies, scientific research development in the field of renewable source of energy and their application in Turkmenistan after 2020.

The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Ministry of Communal Service of Turkmenistan gathered today at the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consultation for the Goal 6 «Ensure access for water and sanitation for all» discussion. The goal includes the following background,
«Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people around the world, an alarming figure that is projected to increase with the rise of global temperatures as a consequence of climate change. Although 2.1 billion people have gained access to improved water sanitation since 1990, dwindling supplies of safe drinking water is a major problem impacting every continent.
In 2011, 41 countries experienced water stress; ten of them are close to depleting their supply of renewable freshwater and must now rely on non-conventional sources. Increasing drought and desertification is already exacerbating these trends. By 2050, it is projected that at least one in four people are likely to be affected by recurring water shortages.» [1]
Representatives of about 10 national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed eight targets to the Goal 6 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of today's consultation agreed to adopt all eight global targets as is. Eight of 11 indicators were accepted without modification.

Title: Day 8: The SDGs consultations and the Goal 2 «Zero hunger»
Content: 15 March 2016
Goal 2 «End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture» was discussed on today’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consultation, headed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Industry of Turkmenistan. The goal includes the following background,
«Rapid economic growth and increased agricultural productivity over the past two decades has seen the proportion of undernourished people drop by almost half.
Many developing countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet the nutritional needs of the most vulnerable. Central and East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have all made huge progress in eradicating extreme hunger.
These are all significant achievements in reaching the targets set out by the first Millennium Development Goals.
Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. 795 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2014, often as a direct consequence of environmental degradation, drought and loss of biodiversity. Over 90 million children under the age of five are dangerously underweight. And one person in every four still goes hungry in Africa.» [1]
Representatives of about 13 national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed eight targets to the Goal 2 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of today's consultation agreed to adopt five global targets as is, with one adjusted target. Total number of accepted targets is six. Seven of 14 indicators accepted without modification. Three were adjusted to the local context and one national indicator was developed.
The discussion covered the many dimensions of hunger and the need for improvements in the agriculture sector. While the country has basis for development of plant banks, it also needs qualified plant breeders to have genetic diversity of seeds and cultivated plants.

Title: Day 7: The SDGs consultations were dedicated to the Goal 11 «Sustainable cities and communities».
Content: 14 March 2016
Today’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consultation on the Goal 11“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” was co- led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Construction and Architecture of Turkmenistan and supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The goal includes the following background,
"More than half of the world’s population now live in urban areas. By 2050, that figure will have risen to 6.5 billion people – two-thirds of humanity.
The rapid growth of cities in the developing world, coupled with increasing rural to urban migration, has led to a boom in mega-cities. In 1990, there were ten mega-cities with 10 million inhabitants or more. In 2014, there are 28 mega-cities, home to a total 453 million people.
Extreme poverty is often concentrated in urban spaces, and national and city governments struggle to accommodate the rising population in these areas.
Making cities safe and sustainable means ensuring access to safe and affordable housing, and upgrading slum settlements. It also involves investment in public transport, creating green public spaces, and improving urban planning and management in a way that is both participatory and inclusive." [1]
Representatives of about six national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed ten targets to the Goal 11 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of today's consultation agreed to adopt all ten global targets, with eleven of 15 indicators accepted without modification, and for the rest four indicators the decision is yet to be made.
During the discussion two topics have received special attention. One is ensuring accessible and safe transport system that encourage integration of all groups, such as persons with disabilities. This practice has already have started in the capital city, but needs a further development. A mechanism of communication of municipalities with public has also a positive step forward that was covered on the consultations too. Such improvements include hyakimlik websites and a recent initiative for co-planning of a town involving public. The recommendation is to continue the work and aim at higher results.

Title: Day 6: «Quality education», SDG Goal 4 discussed on the SDGs consultations
Content: 11 March 2016
Today’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consultation on the Goal 4 «Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all» was co-led by the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the Ministry of Education of Turkmenistan and representatives from the regional United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) office, based in Tehran, Iran. Such agencies as the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the World Health Organization (WHO) and UN Women have assisted in the discussion. The goal includes the following background, «Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of universal primary education. The total enrollment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half.
There has also been a dramatic increase in literacy rates, and many more girls are in school than ever before. These are all remarkable successes.
Progress has also faced tough challenges in developing regions due to high levels of poverty, armed conflicts and other emergencies.
In Western Asia and North Africa, ongoing armed conflict has seen an increase in the proportion of children out of school. This is a worrying trend.
While sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrollment among all developing regions – from 52 percent in 1990, up to 78 percent in 2012 – large disparities still remain. Children from the poorest households are four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest households. Disparities between rural and urban areas also remain high.» [1]
Representatives of about five national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed ten targets to the Goal 4 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of today's consultation agreed to adopt 10 global targets, with seven of 11 indicators accepted without modification, four were adjusted to the local context and one national indicator was developed. No indicators were left for further clarification.
One of the main components discussed on consultations was the importance of increasing the number of people with relevant skills, such as soft, technical and computer skills. These skills will raise employment chances. For this reason it is recommended to prepare human resources development strategy in the country.
Also, for the country with the upper middle income level, more scholarships program for international students need to be developed. Turkmenistan already has programs for students from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. More scholarships will give more opportunities to disadvantaged students.

Content: 10 March 2016
The first in the list of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), «End poverty in all its forms everywhere» was presented by the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the Ministry of Economy and Development of Turkmenistan during the SDGs national consultations. The discussion was supported by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the World Health Organization (WHO) and UN Women. The goal includes the following,
«Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in extreme poverty has dropped by more than half – from 1.9 billion in 1990, to 836 million in 2015 – too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs.
Globally, more than 800 million people are still living on less than $1.25 a day; many lacking access to adequate food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid economic growth in countries like China and India has lifted millions out of poverty, but progress has also been uneven.
Women are disproportionately more likely to live in poverty than men due to unequal access to paid work, education and property.
Progress has also been limited in other regions, such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80 percent of the global total of those living in extreme poverty. This rate is expected to rise due to new threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity.» [1]

Content: 07 March 2016
«Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. However, today we are seeing 30 percent of the world’s fish stocks overexploited, well below a level at which they can produce sustainable yields.
Oceans also absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, and we are seeing a 26 percent rise in ocean acidification since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Marine pollution, an overwhelming majority of which comes from land-based sources, is reaching alarming levels, with an average of 13,000 pieces of plastic litter to be found on every square kilometer of ocean.» [1]
Representatives of about 14 national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed ten global targets and ten indicators to the Goal 14 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of todays’ consultation agreed to adopt nine of the ten global targets as globally defined. Five of the ten corresponding global indicators were adopted unmodified.

Consultations were co-led by the United Nations Development Programme and the State Committee for Environment Protection and Land Resources. The goal includes take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact.
«There is no country in the world that is not seeing first-hand the drastic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and are now more than 50 percent higher than their 1990 level. Further, global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system, which threatens irreversible consequences if we do not take action now.
The annual average losses from just earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical cyclones and flooding count in the hundreds of billions of dollars, requiring an investment of US$ 6 billion annually in disaster risk management alone.
The goal aims to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries and help mitigate climate-related disasters.» [1]

The goal includes ensure healthy life and promote well-being for all.
“Health is positioned by the SDGs as a key feature of human development. Social, environmental and economic determinants, such as education, income and urbanization, have an impact on health and, in turn, benefit from a healthy population.

SDGs will keep the spotlight on the unfinished agenda of ending preventable maternal, newborn and child mortality. New HIV infections continue to rise in some locations and in populations that are typically excluded or marginalized.
Chronic and catastrophic disease remains one of the main factors that push households from poverty into deprivation. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) impose a large burden on human health worldwide. Currently, 63% of all deaths worldwide stem from NCDs – chiefly cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes.
The cumulative economic losses to low- and middle-income countries from the four diseases are estimated to surpass US$ 7 trillion by 2025. Additionally, there continues to be underinvestment in the social circumstances and environmental factors affecting health. The job on HIV and health is far from done.” [1]
Representatives of about nine national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed 13 targets to the Goal 3 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of todays’ consultation agreed to adopt 12 of the 13 global targets, with 15 of 24 indicators accepted without modification and 8 were modified to the local context.

Content: 02 March 2016
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) kicked off national consultations of Turkmenistan on adopting SDGs with Goal 15 “Life on land”.
“Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihood. Plant life provides 80 percent of our human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resource and means of development. Forests account for 30 percent of the Earth’s surface, providing vital habitats for millions of species and important sources for clean air and water; as well as being crucial for combating climate change.
Today we are seeing unprecedented land degradation, and the loss of arable land at 30 to 35 times the historical rate. Drought and desertification is also on the rise each year, amounting to the loss of 12 million hectares and affects poor communities globally. Of the 8,300 animal breeds known, 8 percent are extinct and 22 percent are at risk of extinction.”  [1]
Representatives of about 10 national ministries and agencies discussed the proposed 12 targets to the Goal 15 and their relevance to Turkmenistan. Participants of the first consultation agreed on 10 targets, suggested 7 new or additional targets, and put on hold 5 targets.
Particularly, participants noted the issues of desertification and salinization of the soil which are not reflected in the proposed indicators. Therefore, it was suggested to include the new target or change the wording where relevant. It was also suggested to add an indicator on degraded forests.
Participants also suggested specific national plans and strategies where the relevant indicators can be included/
