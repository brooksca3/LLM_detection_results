24th Anniversary of the National Human Rights Commission of Nepal
Honorable Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Mr. Padam Giri
Hon. Chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission, Mr. Tapa Bahadur Magar
Honorable Commissioners of NHRC and other Constitutional Commissions
Chairperson of the NGO Federation of Nepal,
Members of civil society, the media, and the international community
Distinguished Guests

Namaste and a very good afternoon to everyone!
On behalf of the United Nations in Nepal, I would like to offer sincere badhaai to the National Human Rights Commission of Nepal on your 24th Anniversary. Badhaai also for retaining your “A” status and surpassing the scrutiny of the Special Review! The UN Country Team is honored to be partnering with an institution that meets international standards!
Nepal is such a beautiful country! Its diversity is its beauty, as exemplified in the national anthem we heard earlier referring to the country as a garland made up of sayaun thunggaa phool.  Nepal’s diversity is also a challenge. Nurturing social cohesion amongst such diversity requires the Commission, the Government, and the Constitutional Commissions to work hand in hand, to ensure freedom, equality, and equity of ALL its people. Leave No One Behind means prioritizing the furthest behind first like the Dalits, Madhesis, Tharus, Indigenous Peoples, Muslims, women and girls, sexual and gender minorities, as well as persons with disabilities.
Distinguished guests,
Nepal is still in the early stages of Federalism.  While on a recent trip to the Karnali and Madhesh Pradesh, it was so heartening to hear positive narratives from citizens, and local and provincial governments on how federalism has brought the government closer to citizens.
However, much work remains for these citizens to fully experience federalism. Federal structures and institutions need more strengthening to bring services closer to the citizens.  The exercise of autonomy and authority guaranteed by the Constitution is a must.
A lot also still needs to be done to root out deeply entrenched and pervasive harmful practices such as caste-based discrimination, untouchability, gender-based violence, and domestic violence, which hold people back from reaching their full potential.  It is by undertaking steps to reduce inequalities in society, and reinforce the rule of law, that the envisaged structural transformation is achieved.
Distinguished guests,
Last year at the 75th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, member states, including Nepal, vowed to uphold and promote human rights standards, principles, and values.  These commitments are reflected in the recommendations from various UN Human Rights Mechanisms like the Universal Periodic Review; the treaty bodies, Resolutions 1325, and 1820, as well as Guiding Principles like Business and Human Rights.  We hope, Nepal’s National Action Plan based on these international norms, standards, and guidance is adequately funded and will thereby translate into reality, into tangible results.
I urge the Government as well as NHRC Nepal to highlight the progress being made in the country at international forums. This requires timely submission of periodic reports as obligated in various treaties for instance.
Rt. Hon. Prime Minister,
We should not let the momentum of transitional justice lose steam at any cost. Eighteen years after the armed conflict, uncertainty still looms amongst victims regarding the truth of the incidents and the whereabouts of their loved ones. The wounds, the pain, and the tears still plague the victims.
Echoing the Secretary General’s messaging, I would like the encourage your Government and the Parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.
I also urge the Government to expedite the implementation of the recommendations made by the NHRC Nepal.
Dear Friends,
Today, on NHRC’s 24th birthday, we would like to commend the Commission’s continuous vigilance, adaptability, and dedication to the protection and promotion of evolving human rights issues, including in areas like climate change, misinformation, disinformation, and false information.
For NHRC to evolve, be relatable, and grow to keep pace with ever-changing scenarios, it needs an investment of resources, capacity, autonomy, and independence. Furthermore, the proposed new NHRC Act also needs to be adopted, in compliance with the Paris Principles.
One year short of your silver jubilee, at a time when globally we are grappling with numerous human rights challenges, it is even more important for all of us to rekindle the hope of protection of human rights and advance promises of freedom of speech, expression, opinion, equality before the law, and justice for everyone, everywhere, always.
The United Nations in Nepal remains committed to supporting the Commission and the Government in your endeavors to promote and protect human rights.
Jai Maanav Adhikaar !
Dherai Dherai Dhanyabaad.

Title: 2586 Buddha Jayanti Celebration - 23 May 2024, Lumbini
Content: 23 May 2024
Right Honorable Prime Minister Mr. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Honorable Deputy Prime Ministers,
Honorable Minister for Culture Tourism and Civil Aviation and the Chair of the Lumbini Development Trust
Excellencies Ambassadors, Government officials, Media personnels
And dear peace lovers
Namaste, Namo Mitaa-vaya ( greetings in buddhism), and a very good morning to all of you!
It is my profound blessing to be in Lumbini to celebrate the birth, enlightenment, and pari-nirvana of Gautam Buddha.  And what an absolute honour once more to step on these sacred grounds, the soil where the Prince of Peace had walked on nearly 2600 years ago!
Revered guests, it’s been 23 years  that the United Nations gave recognition to the Day of Vesak, or Baisakh as it is known in Nepal.  We must be grateful for Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar the then foreign Minister of Sri Lanka, who in November 1998 made the proposal to the UN to provide international recognition to the “Day of the Full Moon in the month of May” that is most sacred for a fifth of the world’s population.
Last year, when the UN Secretary General visited Lumbini he said, ”This is a place to reflect on the teachings of Lord Buddha. And to consider what his message of peace, interdependence, and compassion, means in today’s troubled world.”
It is indeed a troubled world.  Where we seem to be at loggerheads with nature, as well with ourselves.. across borders, across faiths, across ideologies.
And it is when we come to a place like Lumbini, where its special aura permeates the atmosphere around us and seeps into our souls, that we instinctively try to seek deep within ourselves the reason of our existence.
And when we really dig deep, not carrying the baggage of yesterday or tomorrow, we discover that all we long for is happiness and peace.. peace of mind, and peace around us.. yes, just shanti, shanti shanti! (peace)
“With our thoughts we make the world, “said Lord Buddha to his disciples.
It is thoughts that lead to actions.  And the actions of the United Nations, in its mission to promote peace, security, and human rights, embodies the essence Buddha’s teachings... be it the Five Precepts, or the Eightfold Path… in various aspects of its work.
Like he preached, we in the UN work diligently to ensure that we have the Right View, the right perspective on issues and problems that need to be tackled to ensure safe an equitable life for all.
We strive to have the Right Intention in every task we undertake, every vison we propose which we then voice with Right Speech that respect everyone, and are geared to foster compassion and harmony.
Right Action guides our overall work to promote peace and development, especially in these turbid times. And with Right Effort guided by the principles of the UN Charters, we strive to promote Right Livelihood and ensure that no one is left behind.
Being a global organization, Right Mindfulness  and Right Concentration  are important features of the institution. It prods us to keep adapting to changing situations, be it global politics, climatic changes, planning for the unexpected. But all the time, being mindful of the here and now!

So, Distinguished guests,
Gathered here today in these sacred gardens, let us be at peace with ourselves and with the world. May the full moon of Buddha Purnima take away the darkness of ignorance, bigotry and hatred and herald an era of contentment and peace on earth.
Shanti Shanti Shanti !

Title: Exploring Investment Opportunities in Nepal
Content: 28 April 2024
UN Resident Coordinator in Nepal
Remarks at the Nepal Investment Summit
Day 1 Plenary Session 1 “Exploring Investment Opportunities in Nepal”
Monday, April 28, 2024,
12:30 – 13:50 hrs, Kathmandu

Honorable Finance Minister Mr. Barsha Man Pun
Fellow panelists
Delegates,
Namaste and a wonderful afternoon to all of you!
Dear delegates.
I think between the presentations of this morning and now everything has been covered so I want to highlight the three Ps: People, Planet and Partnership for Peace and Prosperity.
That is what the member states have committed to through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. And these three Ps, I believe, provide immense opportunities for investment in Nepal.
First, always the People.
Nepal has a very young population. About 41 percent of Nepalis are between ages 16 and 40. These are young people, with muscle and brain power, bursting with energy and innovative solutions. This unique demographic dividend is a crucial window of opportunity for Nepal, that begs to be tapped with great urgency!
Tapping into this demographic dividend means increasing investment in health, education, frontier technology, and digital transformation. To unlock this potential, we must invest even more women, girls and marginalized communities and increase their access to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. It may also entail removing barriers for their access to business and employment opportunities. Removing such barriers could also mean there will be more women represented in every sphere including our speakers in this summit.
I couldn’t help but notice the negligent participation of women as presenters and speakers in this meeting. But I hope for the next one we will have much more women.
My second point is about the planet. I need not tell you about the potential in this fantastic country.
Trees cover nearly half of this beautiful country. Himalayan glaciers provide fresh water, as well as the potential to generate an estimated 40,000 megawatts of hydroelectricity by the rivers downstream. As previous speakers highlighted, these natural resources provide investment opportunities.
However, we must make every effort to ensure that financial flows are used to uplift, rather than undermine, the environment, biodiversity and human lives.
What these investments should do is to contribute to offset carbon, accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, and lead to a green economy. These investments should contribute to limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C. and help to achieve net zero.
Yes, these investments will be higher up front, due to the need for investment in frontier technologies and innovation. However, these will ensure a livable planet not just for our generation but those generations who will eventually inherit this planet.  This will be one of the issues that the Summit of the Future will also be focusing on in New York this September.
And this brings me to my third point, that is Partnership for sustainable development.
Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd in private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunity for public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high risk and low return areas.
Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources.
Each of these transitions requires engagement of multiple policy reforms spanning economic, social and environmental dimensions. With the recent effort to amend laws, the government is demonstrating a strong commitment to improving the investment environment.
United Nations stands with the people of Nepal. The world must do the same. As Nepal prepares for LDC Graduation in 2026, we will continue to work with the Investment Board Nepal and concerned ministries to help increase the flow of sustainable investments in the country. We will continue to support the development of a strong business ecosystem with a vision for sustainable, inclusive, and green economy.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate our commitment to take our future generations into account. This need not come at the expense of those currently living. With advances in science, humanities and technology, we have an enormous opportunity that can be harnessed for the good of all generations of Nepalis.
Dhanyabaad!

Title: Stock Exchanges and Global Partners Rally to Advance Gender Equality
Content: 29 March 2024
Kathmandu, Nepal, March 29, 2024—To mark International Women’s Day, Global Compact Nepal, International Finance Corporation, Nepal Stock Exchanges, and the United Nations, partnered to jointly Ring the Bell for Gender Equality, highlighting the private sector’s key role in boosting the investment to gender equality in Nepal.

Under the theme Invest in Women- Accelerate Progress, the event chaired by Honorable Bhagbati Chaudhary, Minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizen and attended by public, private and development partners highlighted the opportunities to jointly advance gender equality by actively increasing women’s access in Nepal’s financial sector.


Speaking at the event, Honorable Minister Chaudhary urged everyone to invest in women to help minimize gender gaps at all levels. She added, “The Ministry has allocated 42% of its budget to empower women through skills development, which will enhance women's economic empowerment. I hope that the bell we rang today will serve as a reminder for all of us to invest every day in women and promote gender equality.”
The event that started with ringing the bell witnessed representatives from different sectors deliver their commitment speech to invest in women and to advance gender equality.


"Women's economic empowerment is not only a question of equality but absolutely necessary for the wellbeing of the society as a whole and its sustainable economic growth. Finland itself is an example of a country that has successfully invested in gender equality when building a strong democracy and economy. The forthcoming LDC graduation of Nepal highlights the need for an inclusive economic transformation - investments in women will multiply.", said H.E. Riina-Riikka Heikka, Finnish Ambassador to Nepal.
Welcoming the participants and setting the context of the event, the Country Representative of UN Women, Ms. Patricia FERNANDEZ-PACHECO highlighted, “Investing in women is not only the right thing to do but also the wisest decision. As investment in women rises, so does productivity, profitability, and efficiency. Aligned with the conclusions of the global gathering, Commission on the Status of Women (CSW68), we urge all sectors to join us in this.”
Research shows that having inclusive and gender-diverse boards and senior leadership is positively correlated with better financial and non-financial performance contributing to overall company growth and enhanced environmental, social and governance or ESG practices and policies.
“Targeted and well-tailored interventions to advance gender diversity and equality in non-traditional sectors, such as hydropower, have proven net positive impacts on the employees, businesses, and the sector worldwide,” said Martin Holtmann, IFC Country Manager for Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. “It would hasten the country’s progress on advancing gender parity, estimated to translate into a $3 billion or a 9.2 percent increase in its GDP by 2025.”
As the largest driver of formal employment, the private sector has a key role in addressing employment and gender gaps in Nepal. An analytical report on ‘Women in Business’ by the Central Bureau of the Statistics in 2021, revealed there are 29.6 percent female managers compared to that of 70.3 percent of male managers.
“Even though the numbers are much less compared to men, we are beginning to see a change, we are beginning to see more women owning and running businesses,” said Dr. Navaraj Adhikari, Acting Chairperson, of the Securities Board of Nepal. “Nepali women are undoubtedly a central force propelling the country’s economy, and today’s bellringing symbolizes our commitment to empowering women through strategic investments,” he added.
This year’s International Women’s Day theme of Investing in Women, Accelerating Progress is a clear call to action. Stock exchanges can help improve transparency and disclosure of gender-related data, promote access to finance, and encourage women to invest in public markets.
Shedding light on the way forwards, Krishna Shah, Executive Director at Global Compact Nepal said, "The adoption of Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPS) within Nepal's private sector is important and Global Compact Nepal is actively driving on this in partnership with UN Women. However, our efforts need amplification, because at our current rate it will take over 169 years to achieve gender equality in terms of women’s economic empowerment and participation."
The event also staged a fireside chat between Bhawani Rana, Former President of FNCCI, and Grace Rauniyar, a pioneer entrepreneur who shared inspirational stories of aspiring women and the importance of investing in leadership role of women to accelerate progress for gender equality.
The Ring the Bell for Gender Equality Initiative – a global partnership that includes UN Women, IFC, United Nations Global Compact, and The World Federation of Exchanges – advocates for the full and equal participation of all people to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and create a world free of poverty on a livable planet.

Title: United Nations urges investments and actions to end Gender Based Violence in Nepal
Content: 19 December 2023
(Patan, 27 Nov 2023)- The United Nations in Nepal emphasized the crucial need for sustained investment and innovative strategies to prevent gender-based violence in Nepal, at an event held in Lalitpur to mark 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence 2023.
Gender-based violence (GBV) is a pervasive violation of human rights that reverberates across the world affecting one in three women globally and more than one in four women in Nepal. Gender-based violence can be prevented – but urgent investments are needed to fulfill the promise of a life free from violence for women and girls, including those affected by humanitarian crises.
Convening a collaborative event in this regard, the United Nations urged the government, development partners, civil society organizations, private sectors, media, and women's rights organizations to increase investments in preventing violence from happening in the first place.
Speaking at the event, the UN Resident Coordinator, Ms. Hanaa Singer-Hamdy said, “Each one of us each has a responsibility to extinguish the flames of violence that threaten the lives and wellbeing of women and girls. As we mark the 16 Days of Activism, I want to highlight the urgent need for investing both monetary and collective will to end gender-based violence in Nepal.”
With the overarching theme, "Invest to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls," the event organized in Lalitpur encouraged investment and innovative strategies in this sector.

The Finland Ambassador to Nepal, Her Excellency Riina-Riikka Heikka, said, "Violence prevention supports basic human rights, accelerates economic development and improves revenues and also helps to respond and build back better from the crisis". She also urged all sectors to come together and invest in preventing GBV by all means.
The first phase of the event commenced with a Gallery Walk, immersing around 100 participants in the powerful stories of resilience and courage shared by survivors of gender-based violence, and innovative initiatives dedicated to ending violence against women and girls.
The second phase of the event witnessed a panel discussion entitled “Invest to Prevent Gender-Based Violence during Humanitarian Crisis”.
The discussion, with a special focus on the devastating earthquake in Western Nepal, comprised of esteemed panelists such as Honorable Indira Rana Magar, Deputy Speaker of the House, Federal Parliament, European Union Ambassador to Nepal, Her Excellency Veronique Lorenzo, Samanata Thapa Magar, Business Incubation and Impact Academy Programmes Coordinator, Impact Hub, Sunita Mainali, Executive Director, Women's Rehabilitation Centre (WOREC) and Sanjog Thakuri, President of Hami Daju Vai.

Participating in the panel discussion, Hon’ble Indira Rana Magar, emphasized for substantial investment towards the advancement of women’s leadership, and economic empowerment. She further added, “Prioritizing investment in female journalists is crucial, particularly in the context of risk prevention and natural calamities.”
The panel, moderated by Patricia Fernandez Pacheco, Country Representative of UN Women, emphasized, and committed to address and invest in GBV prevention and response during humanitarian crises.
Economic crises, conflicts, natural disasters, and climate change have exacerbated violence against women and girls in recent times, increasing the vulnerability faced by women and girls. Thus, bold investments are now more crucial than ever to build back better from multiple crises, prioritizing the well-being and safety of women and girls who have been disproportionately affected.
On this account, the event accentuated the critical need for investment to prevent gender-based violence and ensure the rights and safety of all individuals, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, or social background.

Title: Empowered Women, Prosperous Nepal Programme Joins Global 16 Days of Activism Campaign to Prevent Gender-Based Violence
Content: 08 December 2023
The Joint Programme of the Government of Nepal, European Union and the United Nations
Empowered Women, Prosperous Nepal
8 December 2023
Janakpur, 8 Dec 2023 – The Government of Nepal, the Delegation of the European Union in Nepal and the United Nations, through their Joint Programme ‘Empowered Women Prosperous Nepal,’ organized a joint event aligned with the global theme of "Unite: Invest to Prevent Violence Against Women & Girls" for this year's 16 Days of Activism Campaign Against Gender-Based Violence (GBV).
The event was graced by the presence of the Honorable Chair of Parliamentary of Women Children and Social Justice Ms. Rupa Yadav; the Deputy Head of Cooperation, Delegation of the European Union, Ms Eloisa Astudillo Fernandez; and on behalf of the UN Resident Coordinator in Nepal, Ms. Patricia Fernandez Pacheco, UN Women Representative. Attendees included representatives from the Provincial and Local Governments, the EU, representatives of United Nations agencies, civil society, policymakers, private sector entities and youth from Madhesh Province. The event fostered interactions among policymakers, locally elected women representatives, private sector entities, gender equality advocates youth, and civil society with an aim to understand ground realities and gather diverse perspectives on addressing gender-based violence.
"Despite strides in gender-based violence prevention and equality efforts, challenges persist," said Rupa Yadav, Chair of Parliamentary of Women Children and Social Justice. " Out of the 753 local levels in the country, only 115 municipalities have established the GBV prevention fund, signaling the necessity to expand its coverage. This gap highlights the disparity between promised legal rights and women's actual access to and benefit from these crucial funds. There's a pressing need to expand the coverage of the GBV prevention fund across local levels."
The joint event in Madhesh Province aligns with the global 16 Days of Activism Campaign, focusing on investing in the prevention of violence against women and girls and ensuring they can live lives free of violence and harassment. Highlighted by a Forum Theatre, the event emphasized positive masculinity and men's role in preventing GBV. In addition, a policy discussion gathered diverse stakeholders to garner commitments for increased investments in preventing GBV. This dialogue aimed to promote women's rights and equality through legislative actions, economic empowerment initiatives, and strengthening institutional frameworks. Furthermore, it aimed to bridge the gap between policies and effective GBV prevention services.
GBV is rooted in multifaceted factors, like economic disparities and entrenched cultural norms," stated Eloisa Astudillo Fernandez, Deputy Head of Cooperation from the European Union. "A proactive approach integrating GBV prevention and responses, as well as promoting equality, is essential and the European Union is committed to support the Government of Nepal in the investment in the prevention of Gender Based Violence."
The event highlighted the importance of public and private investments in preventing GBV, advocating for sustainable contributions to women's rights organizations. It also emphasized the critical role of workplace policies in ensuring women's economic security and safety.
"Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG) presents a global concern that transcends borders and necessitates immediate collective efforts. Nepal's commitment to diminish physical/sexual violence by 6.5% among women aged 15-49 by 2030 signifies significant progress, yet effective planning and strategic investment in GBV prevention at every provincial level are imperative. It is imperative to disrupt unequal power dynamics governing women's bodies. To combat VAWG, let us take a united stance, raise awareness, allocate specific budgets, bolster support for women's organizations, and advocate for workplace policies ensuring the safety and economic stability of women," stated Patricia Fernandez Pacheco, UN Women Representative, speaking on behalf of the UN Resident Coordinator in Nepal.
The event culminated with the ministry representatives and agency leaders signing a commemorative plaque, joined by government representatives, private sector delegates, civil society organizations, and youth, affirming their commitment to invest in the prevention of GBV.

Title: UNRC’s Message on International Day for Persons with Disabilities
Content: 04 December 2023
International Day for Persons with Disabilities
The International Day for Persons with Disabilities reminds us of our commitment to remove the barriers faced by persons with disabilities around the world and here in Nepal as they navigate their everyday lives from physical infrastructure, geographical constraints, and systemic and policy-oriented challenges.
We are at the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda. In Nepal, the recent analysis of SDG 4 shows regression compared to previous years, as one-third of the schools do not have access to adapted infrastructures and accessible materials for students with disabilities.
As highlighted by the Secretary-General, sustainable development for persons with disabilities requires a laser-like focus on their needs and rights — not only as beneficiaries, but as active contributors across social, economic, and political life.
This year’s national slogan seeks our commitment to achieve SDGs through ownership, leadership, and solidarity with persons with disabilities. Echoing the slogan, I reiterate the importance of engaging with persons with disabilities in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for the achievement of the SDGs and to live up to the promises to leave no one behind.
We as the UN have adopted the Disability Inclusion Strategy, to bring about lasting and transformative change in the UN’s disability inclusion work and support member states to implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities through its programming in action and operation.
I call on everyone to work side-by-side with persons with disabilities to design and deliver solutions based on equal rights in every province and community.

Title: UN Agencies Launch a Joint Emergency Response to Earthquake in Western Nepal
Content: 06 November 2023
Press Release
Jajarkot, 6 Nov 2023: Days after 153 people were killed and several hundred injured, another strong earthquake with 5.6 magnitude struck Nepal on November 6, 2023.
On November 3, 2023, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck in the Jajarkot and Rukum Districts of Karnali Province in Nepal causing widespread damage. With the completion of the government’s search and rescue operation, the number of deaths stands at 153 (Male: 70, Female: 83) and 338(Male: 138, Female: 200) injured. The initial findings of the Government’s Initial Rapid Assessment (IRA) launched on 05 November say over 4,000 homes were damaged in the hardest hit districts.
Following the initial assessment of the remote damage assessment of available secondary data satellite images USGS data and earthquake risk model, around 1.3 million people might have been exposed and about 0.25 million people may need humanitarian assistance within 72 hours of the earthquake.
In response to the earthquake - the largest to impact Nepal since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2015 - United Nations agencies have been providing temporary shelter, food, and non-food items as part of a comprehensive and urgent response to the pressing needs of the affected communities.
Speaking about the joint UN Response, the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator, Ms. Hanaa Singer - Hamdy said, “The government has immediately responded very effectively with search and rescue operation. Despite geographical remoteness and a difficult operating environment, the UN agencies and humanitarian partners are on the ground supporting the government’s efforts by reaching out to around 3000 households with food, shelter, WASH, protection, and health support. More than 382 aftershocks were reported forcing people to spend nights in the open or makeshift shelters in freezing overnight temperatures.  The impact of this latest earthquake is compounding the difficulties and vulnerabilities of communities with low socio-economic indicators and stretched coping mechanisms.”
The World Food Programme (WFP) is providing logistics support to the Government and humanitarian partners through the Humanitarian Staging Area, as well as has rapidly dispatched 6 metric tonnes of ready-to-eat emergency food to the affected areas, helping provide sustenance for approximately 7,500 beneficiaries over three days. The World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting local and national authorities to respond to the health needs of the affected population and has deployed two basic modules of the interagency emergency health kits to provide crucial aid.
UNICEF is dispatching critical emergency supplies to the affected areas and supporting response efforts to reach the most vulnerable children and families. As of 5 November morning, UNICEF distributed 1,067 sets of tarpaulins and 1,300 pieces of blankets to the affected population, with additional sets dispatched (3000). To avoid disease outbreaks, UNICEF is providing Water Sanitation and Hygiene supplies consisting of hygiene kits - bucket, mugs, water purifier (Piyush) and temporary toilets for the displaced populations in the two most affected districts.
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has deployed medical supplies and other supplies for women and girls to ensure that their basic sanitation, menstrual hygiene and sexual and reproductive health needs are met in the midst of the disaster. Recognising protection needs of the affected communities, UNFPA in collaboration with other agencies also focuses on ensuring gender-based violence response and referral mechanisms are in place while mobilising response workers, including counsellors and community-based psychosocial workers.
UNDP has committed resources for early recovery, including deploying human resources to the Provincial Emergency Operation Centre for vital information management. Preparations are underway for the use of drones to assess earthquake damage and deployment of structural engineers and volunteers for assessing damaged structures.
UN Women is collaborating with women's groups to support Community Kitchens and provide relief packages. The agency is gearing up to provide essential supplies for women and children, thermos units, water purification equipment and support for pregnant women.
IOM is providing collaborative assistance to the Provincial Government for response and has deployed human resources to support the Provincial Emergency Operation Centre with information management. Shelter and NFIs are planned to be distributed to support the displaced population in close coordination with federal and provincial ministries and local levels.
The UN emphasizes the importance of a unified and rapid response to alleviate the suffering caused by this crisis. The collaboration with the government and local authorities remains steadfast in ensuring effective and efficient aid delivery to the affected regions.

Title: The UN and Government of Nepal Calling for Renewed Ambition and Action for the Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 16 August 2023
The Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission and the United Nations in Nepal, jointly kicked off the SDGs Acceleration Visioning workshop to rally for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap for people and planet adopted by member states in 2015.
Ahead of the SDG Summit in September, the SDG Acceleration Visioning Workshop aims to review the status of the SDG Progress in Nepal and identify priority areas for SDGs acceleration and outline roadmap for strategic actions. It also aims to launch nationwide campaign on SDGs to mobilize multi-stakeholders, including provincial and local governments, private sector, civil society, and development partners to ramp up efforts to accelerate progress on SDGs.
“The Government of Nepal is passionately internalizing the SDGs through the current 15th plan and its regular programs and policies. Nepal have identified key areas that hold the potential to catalyze economic transformation, leading us towards SDG attainment and irreversible graduation from LDC status.” Said Dr Min Bahadur Shrestha, Vice Chair of the National Planning Commission. “Our focus is on enhancing production and productivity within our economy, generating skilled human capital, and creating inclusive employment opportunities including a robust emphasis on quality education, accessible healthcare systems, sound infrastructure, responsible urbanization, social empowerment, inclusivity, social security, increased capital expenditure, biodiversity preservation, and effective governance.” Dr Shrestha added.
For the first time in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, geopolitical tension, global economic slowdown, and lingering COVID-19 effects globally. At halftime towards the deadline of 2030, the promise of the SDGs is in peril with just 12 percent progress globally. This means that people and the planet are in deep crisis, and hence, the renewed commitment on the SDGs is more needed now than ever before. This workshop is therefore expected to outline the national commitment of Nepal.
Speaking at the workshop, the UN Resident Coordinator in Nepal Ms. Hanaa Singer Hamdy said, "The SDG progress is not about lines on a graph. It is about healthy mothers and babies; children learning the skills to fulfil their potential; and parents who can feed their families.  It is about a world in which everyone enjoys human rights and human dignity." She further added, "The road ahead to achieve the SDGs globally and in Nepal is still a bit steep. But it is one we can, must and will achieve- together – and for the people we serve from all parts of this incredibly beautiful country."
The National Vision for SDG Acceleration that will be prepared through consultative process based on the outline coming from this workshop will be presented to the global leaders as Nepal's commitment at the 2023 SDG Summit being held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 18-19 September. The summit will reaffirm collective commitments of the world leaders to the Goals and the promise to leave no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the world back on track to achieving the SDGs.

Title: An Evidence-Based Workshop on Prevalence of Digital Violence and Hate Speech in Nepal
Content: 21 March 2023
The UN Resident Coordinator Office in Nepal and UNESCO Kathmandu successfully organized an evidence-based workshop with government and civil society leaders to highlight the status of digital violence and hate speech in Nepal and galvanize efforts to combat and mitigate it.
The workshop is a part of UN Nepal’s long-term goal to foster discussion on the causes and consequences of hate speech and promote information integrity in the hope of encouraging a collective effort to widen preventive measures and early warning actions on hate speech and disinformation in the country.
Speaking at the program, the UN Resident Coordinator Designate in Nepal, Ms. Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, said, “creating safer online experiences is crucial in the climate of aggressive digitalization. When groups in society use online platforms to attack and propagate hurtful content, it causes backlash, harm and can turn violent and undermine social cohesion. To make a difference we need effective partnerships between government, civil society, and tech companies. A partnership that prioritise protection over profits. We need laws, police and courts willing to create consequences for illegal activity. We need to create strong alliances that address the issues beyond regulation, involving the private sector, civil society, and communities so digital literacy and awareness of the impact of hate speech goes hand in hand with improved internet access.”
Sharing the lessons from the 2022 elections in Nepal, Honorable Dr. Janaki Kumari Tuladhar, Commissioner, Election Commission Nepal expressed, “The Election Commission Nepal has partnered with social media company Meta to counter disinformation and hate speech during the 2022 election. The Commission has launched voter education campaigns via social media and door-to-door outreach, urging voters to fact-check information related to elections. However, the issue of hate speech and disinformation extends beyond elections, and there is a need to cultivate critical thinking skills for accessing accurate information online. The Election Commission and Ministry of Communications and Information Technology should collaborate to tackle this issue in Nepal.”
The workshop provided space for dialogue between government, civil society, development partners and other practitioners who shared experiences, discussed lessons, and proposed future actions to mitigate hate speech and misinformation.
“The Government of Nepal wants to regulate the media without restricting freedom of expression. Self-regulation of individuals on the online and offline platform is more important than ever in the rapidly evolving digital media,” said Dr Baikuntha Aryal, Secretary of Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. “We are open to collaborate with civil society, media and development partners to work together on strengthening digital literacy of Citizens,” he added.
In response to the alarming trends of growing racism, intolerance, violent misogyny and hatred around the world, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres launched the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech in 2019.
The Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech sets out a comprehensive strategic guidance for the United Nations system to address hate speech at the national and global level.  It aims to both address root causes and drivers of hate speech and effectively respond to the impact of hate speech on societies.

Title: Joint Statement
Content: 05 March 2023
By the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, the Government of Lao People’s Democratic Republic, and the Government of Nepal as a part of the side event on the margins of the Fifth United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries on Sustainable and smooth transition for the Graduating Cohort of 2021.
1. As the Graduating Cohort of 2021, we, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, the Government of Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the Government of Nepal underline our common commitment to sustainable and inclusive national development despite the challenging circumstances. We are confident that the global economic recovery will enable the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to attain at least 7 per cent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth per annum in line with the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). And we are committed to pursuing sustainable graduation from the LDC status with the ambition to move sustainably towards higher levels of prosperity and equality that leaves no one behind with support from the international community and partner countries.
2. We are aware that the continuing impacts of the recent pandemic, the geopolitical tensions, and the resultant economic uncertainties, more frequent and intense climate-related crisis, among others, have exacerbated the underlined structural vulnerabilities of the LDCs, including the graduating ones, reversing their development gains in some areas and impacting their abilities to pursue sustainable development. These existing and emerging challenges have affected and may continue to challenge our preparations for smooth, irreversible and sustainable graduation.
3. We take graduation seriously, and as such we are developing Smooth Transition Strategies (STS) that identify the necessary steps by all stakeholders for a successful graduation process. We are also committed to utilizing the existing or new inclusive consultative mechanisms to ensure that the transition is smooth, sustainable and engages a wide spectrum of voices across our respective countries.
4. However, we recognize that graduation is not the end goal for our national development endeavors. It significantly represents the remarkable achievements made by our governments over the past years, with support extended by the international community.
5. Against this backdrop, to successfully manage the transition of graduating countries, especially in the context of global challenges, we call up on our international community and development partners, including multilateral development banks and international financial institutions to extend necessary support to the graduating LDCs in the spirit of the Doha Programme of Action that calls for international solidarity and reinvigorated global partnership
6. More specifically, we call upon the international community and development partne ent on the margins of the Fifth United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries on Susrs for: By the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, the Government of Lao People’s Democratic Republic, and the Government of Nepal as a part of the side event on the margins of the 5th United Nations Conference on Leference on Least Develop Democratic Republic, and the Government of Nepal as a part of the side event on the margins of
7. In the context of the shocks to development that the world is contending with, it is incumbent upon all of us to stay the course with the global call to rescue the SDGs and get back on track to building a better world that “leaves no one behind”, and the success of the Graduating Cohort of 2021 in reaching the thresholds for graduation is a major milestone and shows our common commitment to this progress. However, maintaining the progress throughout the transition, and ensuring that the graduation is sustainable and irreversible, requires continued and concerted support measures from the international community and development partners along with our collective endeavor and commitment to implementation of the Doha Programme of Action.

Title: JOINT PRESS RELEASE : National Gender Equality Programme Launched
Content: 08 February 2023
"Empowered Women, Prosperous Nepal” (Shashakta Mahila, Sambridhha Nepal) will contribute to the full realization of human rights and agency of Nepalese women, girls and people of diverse genders
The Government of Nepal, the Delegation of the European Union in Nepal and the United Nations launched a four-year joint programme to advance gender equality and contribute to the empowerment of women and girls to realize the national vision of a prosperous and happy Nepal (vision 2030).
Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Senior Citizens, Ms. Bhagwati Chaudhary, the Director for the Middle East, Asia and Pacific at the Directorate-General for International Partnerships of the European Commission, Mr Peteris Ustubs and Ms Elke Wisch, UNICEF Representative to Nepal on behalf of the UN Resident Coordinator and the UN team, jointly launched the programme at a ceremony held in Patan today. The event was attended by representatives from the Government of Nepal, Heads of agencies of the United Nations, Head of Missions/Ambassadors of development partners and EU Member States, and civil society organizations.
"Empowering women is crucial for the prosperity of Nepal. In the 21st century, we must strive to eliminate discrimination against women and girls. We are honored to be a part of the collaborative effort between the EU and UN agencies towards this goal," said Chaudhary, Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Senior Citizens.
The programme, titled “Empowered Women Prosperous Nepal” (Shashakta Mahila, Sambridhha Nepal) ultimately seeks to strengthen equal rights and opportunities for women and men by engaging with men and boys, families, and communities to exhibit more gender-equitable behaviors, as well as support for positive social and gender norms that promote Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment (GEWE), resulting in increased agency and voice of women and girls.
“Nepal is at a strategic crossroad- with a recent, strong and democratic constitution bringing a very ambitious reform to a federal system, and at the verge of graduating from Least Developed status. And these two important milestones for Nepal’s development rest on Nepal’s capacity to use its potential to the fullest, which means using all hands and all hearts to the betterment of the country. Nepal has not only the opportunity, but the necessity, to count on all of its people, including women and men in all their diversity to make these ambitions happen,” said Director Peteris Ustubs.
The programme aims at addressing the formal and informal barriers to development that women and girls face in Nepal. It will also acknowledge the intersecting vulnerabilities, formal and informal forces that combine to leave half of Nepal's vital forces behind and ensure that women, men, girls, and boys, in all their diversity, have equal access to economic, labor, and social rights.
“Women and girls account for half of Nepal’s population and represent half of the country’s potential to realize a prosperous and happy Nepal! The Constitution of Nepal commits to equal opportunity and protection for women and girls. It will take a ‘whole of society’ approach – with government at all levels, civil society, private sector and development partners working together – to achieve this great aspiration.” said Ms Wisch. “With men and boys at the forefront to tackling the social norms that continue to drive discrimination against women and girls, and joining efforts to promote gender equality in their families and communities, together we can create a more inclusive and equal society.”
The programme, with a total budget of US$19.5 million, will be jointly implemented by four UN agencies (ILO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UN Women), in three provinces, namely Madhesh, Karnali and Sudurpaschim from 2023 to 2026 in collaboration with federal, provincial and local governments. The programme has been designed following an in-depth situation analysis and extensive consultations with wide range of government bodies, civil society organizations and other stakeholders.

Title: International Holocaust Remembrance Day marked in Nepal
Content: 27 January 2023
For the ninth consecutive year, the United Nations Nepal together with the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, Embassy of Israel and Delegation of the European Union observed the 78th International Holocaust Remembrance Day in Nepal today.
The 2023 commemoration centered around a memorial ceremony at Boudhanath Stupa where representatives of the four agencies lit 108 butter lamps in memory of the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jewish children, women, and men, as well as the Roma and Sinti, the people with disabilities, LGBTIQ+ and countless others who perished during the Holocaust.
On behalf of the United Nations, Ms. Elke Wisch, UNICEF Representative in Nepal reading the UN Secretary General’s statement emphasized, “As we mourn the loss of so many and so much, we also recognize that the Holocaust was not inevitable. No genocide ever is. Today and every day, let us resolve to never again remain silent in the face of evil – and to always defend the dignity and rights of all.”.
The theme for this year’s Holocaust Remembrance Day is "Home and Belonging" highlighting the humanity of the victims and survivors, whose very belonging was questioned in places they previously called home.
In Nepal, the commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Day focuses on paying tribute to the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and reaffirms its unwavering commitment to counter antisemitism, racism, and other forms of intolerance that may lead to group-targeted violence.
Following the recitation of the memorial prayer at the ceremony, Ms Dana Fisher, Chargé d'affaires of the Embassy of Israel said, “The holocaust happened during WWII was a crime against humanity as a whole. Our message today is to promote values of tolerance, respect for others and standing up to any form of violence. Only by educating on the importance of these values, humanity will be able to prevent the reoccurrence of these atrocities and influence our world for the better.”
“The Holocaust was a crime of unprecedented scale and brutality, and it is our duty to ensure that it is never forgotten. On this Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the victims of the Holocaust and pledge to work towards a world where such atrocities never happen again.” shared H.E Dr Thomas Prinz, German Ambassador to Nepal
Speaking at the memorial ceremony on behalf of the EU Delegation to Nepal, Dr. Joelle HIVONNET, Deputy Head of Delegation, said, “On this day, may we remember that the European Union was built on the ruins of the Second World War, as a peace project, so that the Holocaust could never be repeated. May we also remember that genocides always begin with the stigmatisation of one community by hateful politicians who demonise and de-humanise some of their fellow human beings for the sake of power.”
During the ceremony, in honour of the victims of the Holocaust, students of Kathmandu Pragya Kunja played “Violin of Hope” a beautiful holocaust themed music.

Title: 16 Day of Activism Against Gender Based Violence
Content: 01 December 2022
Gender-based violence (GBV) is a serious and widespread violation of human rights worldwide. Statistics tell us that in Nepal, GBV affects more than one in four women and girls in their lifetime.
Violence disproportionately affects women and girls who face multiple forms of discrimination based on disability, caste, or ethnicity, limiting their access to protection, treatment, and justice.
This year, on 30 November, the United Nations in Nepal and International Development Partners, marked 16 Day of Activism Against Gender Based Violence Campaign at the Dhangadi Sub-Metropolitan Office together with the Ministry of Social Development of the Sudurpaschim Province and representatives from Embassies, development partners civil society, and the women’s movement.
Speaking at the event, Mr. Ganesh Singh, Acting Secretary of the Ministry of Social Development, Sudurpaschim Province, urged everyone to unite to end gender-based violence.
This event served as a platform to mobilize key stakeholders to take action to prevent and respond to gender based violence  against women and girls by strengthening comprehensive essential services to survivors of violence;  investing in reliable data collection on GBV;  increasing programming on addressing gender discriminatory norms; and strengthening protection mechanisms to prevent and eliminate violence and discrimination against women’s rights advocates/activists in line with international standards.
Speaking on behalf of the United Nations in Nepal and as Co-chair of the International Development Partners Group, Elke Wisch, UNICEF Representative in Nepal, “Gender-based violence continues to undermine the rights, dignity, security and autonomy of women, girls as well as LBGTIQ+ persons particularly those from marginalized communities. Beyond violating the rights of each individual, neglecting women and girls undermines half the potential for progress, prosperity and well-being for all. It will therefore require a ‘whole of society’ effort to break down the silence and tackle the culture of acceptance to achieve zero tolerance for violence against women, girls and other marginalized community members.
Representing Bilateral Development Partners and Head of Cooperation, European Union Partner’s Group Co-Chair Dr. Marco Gemmer opined “We all, including men and boys, have our roles to play as individuals and beyond our mandates. It is not enough to not be involved of the violence- we need to champion the message that we will not accept, condone or let pass any kind of violence, and it is our obligation to speak up if we observe any instead of being silent. We need to be part of the change of these norms that also hurt us, by limiting how and what we -regardless of gender- should, can and want to be.”
The event, streamed live on Facebook, featured an interactive play advocating for the creation of safe spaces for survivors of violence from marginalized backgrounds whose needs are not met by existing systems. The event also featured a panel discussion featuring Sabitra Ghimire, Chair - Dalit Women Rights Forum, Sajina Pariyar - Child Club Member, Nirang Chaudhari - Sudurpaschim Samaj and Dr. Jagadish Bisht from the One Stop Crisis Management Center at the Seti Hospital in Dhangadhi, where the panelists called for greater action and resources to be committed to end the scourge of GBV in Nepal.

Editor’s Note
The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is an international campaign which takes place each year. It commences on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10 December, Human Rights Day. It was originated by activists at the first Women's Global Leadership Institute in 1991 and is coordinated each year by the Centre for Women's Global Leadership. It is used as an organizing strategy by individuals and organizations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of violence against women and girls.
As a unifying theme running global activities, the UNiTE campaign has utilized the colour orange to represent a brighter future, free from violence against women and girls. For the past years, the UN Country Team (UNCT) in Nepal has been marking 16 days campaign with awareness building and advocacy campaigns across Nepal. Some of the key activities undertaken were ‘oranging’ monuments and provincial buildings, engaging audience across Nepal through films, social media, and radio campaigns.

Title: Equalize! Unite to end the inequalities holding back the end of AIDS
Content: 30 November 2022
The AIDS response is in danger. Inequalities are the reason why.
UNAIDS new report Dangerous Inequalities shows that unequal access to rights, services, science and resources is holding back the end of AIDS. Dangerous Inequalities unpacks the impact on the AIDS response of gender inequalities, of inequalities faced by key populations, and of inequalities between children and adults. It sets out how worsening financial constraints are making it more difficult to address those inequalities.
Gender inequalities and harmful gender norms are holding back the end of the AIDS pandemic. Gender based violence is increasing women’s risks of HIV infection and constraining the access of women living with HIV to life-savings services. In areas of high HIV burden, women subjected to intimate partner violence face up to a 50% higher chance of acquiring HIV.  “The world will not be able to defeat AIDS while reinforcing patriarchy,” said UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima. “We need to address the intersecting inequalities women face.
In areas of high HIV burden, women subjected to intimate partner violence face up to a 50% higher chance of acquiring HIV. Across 33 countries from 2015-2021 only 41% of married women aged 15-24 could make their own decisions on sexual health. The only effective route map to ending AIDS, achieving the sustainable development goals and ensuring health, rights and shared prosperity, is a feminist route map. Women’s rights organizations and movements are already on the frontlines doing this bold work. Leaders need to support them and learn from them.”
The effects of gender inequalities on women’s HIV risks are pronounced. One study showed that enabling girls to stay in school until they complete secondary education reduces their vulnerability to HIV infection by up to 50%. When this is reinforced with a package of empowerment support, girls’ risks are reduced even further. Harmful practices (stigma and discrimination, exclusion, hate speech, violence) in many communities discouraging people from seeking care. Discrimination and stigmatization against and criminalization of key populations are costing lives and preventing the world from achieving agreed AIDS targets. The recent Stigma Index 2.0 study in Nepal shows that more than 5 percent of the people living with HIV generally avoid going to local facilities to seek HIV and other related services.
A survey done in 2020 showed that there has been a decline in new HIV infections among people who use drugs in Nepal. However, among other groups, including men who have sex with (MSM), transgender persons (TG) and sex workers (SW) there is a slight increase in new HIV infections. Facing an infectious virus, failure to make progress on key populations undermines the entire AIDS response.
Over 68 countries worldwide continue to criminalize same sex relations—making people afraid of visiting facilities where they could receive prevention, testing and treatment services that could save their lives and break the cycle of infection. Progress in the HIV response is obstructed by punitive laws against key populations. The report shows that the AIDS response is being held back by inequalities in access to treatment between adults and children. While over three quarters of adults living with HIV are on antiretroviral therapy, just over half of children living with HIV are on the lifesaving medicine.
This has had deadly consequences. In 2021, children accounted for only 4% of all people living with HIV but 15% of all AIDS-related deaths. Closing the treatment gap for children will save lives. These dangerous inequalities are undermining the AIDS response and jeopardising the health security of everyone. But this is not a counsel of despair. It is a call to action. Inequalities in health are not inevitable—countries have the power to overturn laws that criminalize and marginalize entire communities, they can challenge gender-based violence and protect children by investing in education and health.
All over the world, people are mobilizing to challenge the injustices that keep people away from lifesaving HIV treatment, care and prevention services. The evidence is clear — protecting the safety and human rights of marginalized people expands access to HIV services, accelerating progress in the response to HIV by increasing the number of people on treatment, widening access to prevention tools and reducing new infections. New investments to address HIV-related inequalities are urgently needed. At a moment when international solidarity and a surge of funding is most needed, too many high-income countries are cutting back aid for global health.
In 2021, funding available for HIV programmes in low- and middle-income countries was US$ 8 billion short. Increasing donor support is vital to getting the AIDS response back on track. As the new report shows, donor funding also helps catalyse domestic funding: increases in external HIV funding for countries from PEPFAR (the United States Government) and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) during 2018-2021 were correlated with significant increases in domestic funding from national governments. Low- and middle-income countries should no longer be kept waiting for access to health technologies. Innovations in health are global public health goods. Millions of lives are at stake. 650 000 people died of AIDS-related deaths in 2021 and there were 1.5 million new HIV infections—1 million above the 2020 target of 500 000.
  
Together, it is possible to end AIDS by 2030 but only if governments act now to equalize access to HIV services for everyone. Tackling inequalities will not only help the marginalised. It will help everyone.

Title: Anticipating and Responding to Intense and Unseasonal Climate-Driven Disasters
Content: 13 October 2022
UN Emergency Fund assists communities in Nepal before peak monsoon floods
Unseasonal rains have hit communities in the West of Nepal and have pushed vulnerable people into humanitarian need. In an innovative approach to early warning, early humanitarian action, and disaster risk management amidst the global climate crisis, UN agencies in Nepal have acted on predictive analytics and meteorological forecast data to pre-emptively mitigate and respond to worst likely impacts on flood-affected communities in the Karnali River Basin.
On 07 October, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) authorized three UN agencies to spend a total of $3.2 million to support communities ahead of peak flood impact as part of the activation of a pre-agreed anticipatory action framework.
Recipients of these funds enabled the three participating agencies – the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) – to communicate early warning messages, distribute cash and comprehensive relief package (food and non-food items, energy saving cooking device, solar radio, clothes, and services such as legal and psycho-social counseling).
In addition, essential items, such as hygiene, dignity and health kits are distributed to facilitate access to essential items and critical health and protection services, including through the deployment of emergency medical teams and rapid response teams, community psychosocial workers, gender advisors and monitoring specialist. Recognizing the specific impacts of disasters on women and marginalized groups, the allocation seeks to address a broad range of their needs across all phases of the response.
The anticipatory allocation from the CERF in Nepal is the latest example of anticipatory humanitarian action. Developments in data and predictive analytics make it increasingly possible to anticipate when a disaster is about to strike and take necessary action in advance. This approach offers a potentially more dignified, swifter, and (cost-)effective way to responding to the humanitarian needs of people caught in the global climate crisis.
Launched as a pilot in Nepal, the anticipatory action framework have four UN agencies – UNFPA, UNICEF, UN Women, and WFP – in partnership with the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) and national NGOs and in close collaboration with the federal, provincial and local authorities, who will provide collective anticipatory humanitarian action to people at risk of predicted severe monsoon flooding in Nepal. This pilot will aim to provide life-saving assistance to over 80,000 people across 23 flood prone municipalities (“palikas”).
On 02 October, a high probability of severe flooding was forecast for the following weeks in the historically affected Karnali river basin in the west of the country, with likely humanitarian consequences across 6 municipalities. On 07 October, forecasts reconfirmed the severity of the projected shock, setting into motion the distribution of goods and services aimed at mitigating the humanitarian impact on the most vulnerable households ahead of peak flooding. Nepal is highly vulnerable to climate-related shocks and stresses, including monsoon flooding. In some years, flooding is more intense and surpasses the ability of communities to cope, leading to death and the destruction of infrastructure, livelihoods and homes, leading to acute and urgent humanitarian needs. Anticipating and acting before the natural disasters hit can save lives and livelihoods.
Marked every 13 October, the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (IDDRR) in 2022 is focusing on “Target G” of the Sendai Framework: “Substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to people by 2030.”

Title: Four peacekeepers from Nepal honoured posthumously at United Nations ceremony on UN Peacekeeping Day 2022
Content: 30 May 2022
UN Headquarters observed the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on Thursday, 26 May 2022. Secretary-General António Guterres lay down a wreath to honour the nearly 4,200 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948 and presided over a ceremony at which the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal was awarded posthumously to 117 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their life serving under the UN flag last year.
Among the peacekeepers who were honoured posthumously four are from Nepal:  NCE Pitambar Thapa of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL); Private Dipendra Osti, who served with the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS); Police POA Umesh Kumar Mehattar; who served with the UN-AU Mission in Darfur (UNAMID); and Mr. Jhank Nath Regmi who served in a civilian capacity in the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA).
Nepal is the 2nd largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys more than 5,700 military and police personnel to the UN operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, the Middle East, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, and the Western Sahara.
During a special ceremony, the Secretary-General awarded the “Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage” posthumously to Captain Abdelrazakh Hamit Bahar of Chad, who served with the United Nations Integrated Multidimensional Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). The medal is named for a Senegalese peacekeeper who was killed in Rwanda in 1994 after saving countless civilian lives. This is the second time the medal has been awarded since the inaugural medal was presented to Captain Diagne's family in his honour in 2016.

The Secretary-General also awarded the ‘2021 Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award’ to Major Winnet Zharare, a Zimbabwean military observer, who served with the UN Mission in South Sudan. Created in 2016, the Award “recognises the dedication and effort of an individual peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.”

In his message, the Secretary-General said: “Today, we honour the more than one million women and men who have served as UN peacekeepers since 1948.  We pay tribute to the nearly 4,200 heroes and heroines who sacrificed their lives in the cause of peace. And we are reminded an age-old truth: peace can never be taken for granted. Peace is the prize. We are deeply grateful to the 87,000 civilian, police and military personnel now serving under the UN flag who are helping to realize the prize of peace worldwide.”
The theme for this year’s observance is “People. Peace. Progress. The Power of Partnerships.” According to the Secretary-General, “Around the globe, UN peacekeepers work with Member States, civil society, humanitarians, the media, the communities they serve and many others, to foster peace, protect civilians, promote human rights and the rule of law and improve the lives of millions of people.”
Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said: “Every day, UN peacekeepers work to protect vulnerable people in the world’s most fragile political and security situations. The dangers they face are greater than ever, with increasing global tensions, ever-more complex threats from terrorist attacks to organized crime and the use of Improvised Explosive Devices as well as a surge in mis and disinformation targeting our missions and the communities we serve. Despite these challenges, peacekeepers persevere alongside our many partners in the collective pursuit of peace. Today, we thank them for their tremendous contribution and remember with great sorrow our colleagues who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving the cause of peace.”

The International Day of UN Peacekeepers was established by the General Assembly in 2002, to pay tribute to all men and women serving in peacekeeping, and to honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace. The General Assembly designated 29 May as the International Day of UN Peacekeepers in commemoration of the day in 1948 when the UN’s first peacekeeping mission, the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), began operations in Palestine. Since then, more than 1 million women and men have served in 72 UN peacekeeping operations.

Title: International Holocaust Remembrance Day marked in Nepal
Content: 27 January 2022
The United Nations Nepal together with the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, Embassy of Israel and Delegation of the European Union observed the 77th International Holocaust Remembrance Day in Nepal today. This is the eighth consecutive year they jointly honor the memory of the six million Jews and millions of other minorities murdered during the Holocaust.
In Nepal, the commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Day focuses on generating awareness and empowering youth to stand up for human rights, challenge discrimination and foster tolerance, solidarity, and action for lasting impact. On 26 January, as a prelude to this year’s observance, the UN, the three embassies and Yuwalaya, an organisation working for/with adolescents and youth, organized the Countering Hate Speech workshop for youth.  Six dozen youth from seven provinces in Nepal participated in the workshop and explored ways of addressing hate speech online.
In 2022,  this day has a focus on – Memory, Dignity and Justice, because the writing of history and a conscious act of remembering brings dignity and justice to the victims and sheds light on the stories the holocaust tried to erase. This year’s observance was graced by Mr. Ephraim Eisenman, a 77-year-old Holocaust Survivor who shared his story of exceptional courage and resilience.
Speaking at the ceremony, Richard Howard, the UN Resident Coordinator a.i said, “we call upon everyone to have a discussion on how we learn from the past to build our societies today, to work together to build communities that thrive in their diversity and communities in which equality and justice are the guiding light. It is that, for which we must strive.”
H.E. Mr. Hanan Goder Goldberger, Ambassador of Israel to Nepal, recited the memorial prayer and said Six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. Such event should never be forgotten and should never happen again. We must promote values like tolerance, acceptance of the other, nondiscrimination and democracy.
H. E. Dr Thomas Prinz, German Ambassador to Nepal, quoted one of the Holocaust survivors and said, “Saul Friedländer in the German Parliament once expressed his hopes that we “continue fighting for tolerance and inclusivity, for humanity and freedom, in short, for true democracy.”  I think this is exactly what we have to do.”
Likewise, Ms. Nona Deprez Head of the EU Delegation to Nepal expressed, "we will never accept or ignore Holocaust denial, and will combat firmly any kind of antisemitism, intolerance, harassment or violence against any person or community based on ethnic origin, religion or belief.”
During the ceremony, in honour of the victims of the Holocaust, musicians from the Kathmandu Jazz Conservatory created a beautiful fusion of Nepali folk music using the Sarangi and classical pieces from the Hungarian dance and the Oscar-winning Schindler’s List.

Title: Government of Nepal Launched SDGs in Mithila Postal Stamp
Content: 29 December 2021
Kathmandu, Nepal – For the first time in the history of Philatic and Postal Stamp Management, the Government of Nepal, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, issued 17 postal stamps portraying the SDGs in Mithila painting on 29 December 2021.
Hon’ble Minister of Information and Communications Technology Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, Dr Baikuntha Aryal Secretary of Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Indu Ghimire, Director General of Department of Postal Service jointly marked the first day of the issuance of the postal stamps by launching the “SGDs in Mithila” along with 14 other stamps highlighting Nepal’s natural and cultural diversity. Robert Kasca, the UN Resident Coordinator a.i. participated in the event.
“The SDG Postal Stamps reinforce Nepal’s commitment towards achieving SDGs and enhances the awareness of Nepal's art sector,” said Hon’ble Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, Minister of Information and Communications Technology.
The SDGs in Mithila original paintings, which are now issued as stamps, were created by local renowned women artists of Janakpur in 2018 as a collaborative effort between the UN in Nepal and the Janakpur Women’s Development Center.
“The issuance of the SDGs postal stamps not only highlights the UN’s effort to localize the SDGs in Nepal but symbolizes Nepal’s commitment and readiness to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The UN in Nepal lauds the efforts of the Government of Nepal to accelerate progress,” said Robert Kasca, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. in Nepal.
With the intent of using indigenous art practices to make the SDGs accessible and understandable to all people, the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office began localizing the 17 SDGs icons into local art forms. After the creation of the 17 SDGs icons as Mithila art, the paintings also travelled to ‘Art for SDGs: the Mithila Heritage’ exhibition organized by the Permanent Mission of Nepal to the United Nations in New York and the Mithila Festival at the United Nations Headquarters in New York in 2019.

Title: Nepal must now deliver on promise of social justice - UN human rights expert
Content: 09 December 2021
Nepal has succeeded in reducing multidimensional poverty by 12.7 percent between 2014 and 2019, and its Human Development Index has improved, as have indicators related to health and education. But significant gaps remain,” the UN expert said.
“Women are still lagging on a number of indicators. Though banned, caste-based and ethnicity-based discrimination remain a reality in social life, and it is a major factor explaining the perpetuation of poverty. Land issues remain unresolved, despite the efforts to accelerate the rehabilitation of former bonded laborers and to ensure landless Dalit benefit from land redistribution.”
Poverty reduction owes more to remittances than to proactive Government anti-poverty policies, De Schutter said. "A quarter of the decline in poverty can be attributed to outmigration only, with estimates showing that, without remittances, poverty would have increased in Nepal,” he said. Remittances in Nepal were 10 times larger than foreign aid and 2.5 larger than total exports only in 2017. “It is clear that much more needs to be done by the Government to meet its own target of reducing multidimensional poverty to 11.5 percent by 2023-2024,” the expert said.
“The Government should ensure its skills and training programs reach the poorest families. While public works programs such as the Prime Minister’s Employment Program have considerable potential, in practice the program has yet to deliver on its promise of providing 100 days of work per person per year.
“In the country, 80 percent of workers are informal, which exposes them to higher rates of abuse, largely because the Government lacks the ability to enforce minimum wage legislation in the informal sector. Although informal workers should also contribute to and benefit from the Social Security Fund, there is currently no plan to include them in the program.”
De Schutter’s fact-finding mission began on 29 November, just weeks after the UN General Assembly voted a resolution inviting Nepal, along with Bangladesh and Lao People’s Democratic Republic, to prepare for graduation from the status of Least Developed Country (LDC) to that of an emerging economy. The country will benefit from a five-year transition period. “Graduation from LDC status is a major milestone for Nepal,” said De Schutter. “Poverty reduction must be at the heart of the country’s transition strategy to ensure that no groups are left behind.”
The UN expert met with communities who suffer from intersecting forms of deprivation. Most were landless daily wage laborers working in agricultural or informal jobs and struggling to send their children to school. Many were from historically disadvantaged and discriminated groups including Dalit, Madhesi, and Indigenous people, as well as women. “The stark inequalities resulting from the deeply entrenched norms and values of the Nepali caste system continue to perpetuate disadvantage today,” De Schutter said.
Women suffer the brunt of a historically patriarchal society, earning almost 30 percent less than men, suffering from higher rates of informality, owning only 19.7 percent of homes and land, and enduring a 17.5 percent literacy gap compared to men, the UN poverty expert noted. "Nepal can and must do better,” he said.
Children experience the worst forms of deprivation because of the poverty their families face, he added. Over one million children work in Nepal, and in rural areas over a fifth of children do.
“During my mission, I met with countless families whose children, especially girls, engaged in agricultural or domestic work,” De Schutter said. “Wealth inequality is a major factor: over 20 percent of children in poverty work, compared to only five percent of children from rich families.
“The Government must take child poverty seriously and take the necessary steps to end child marriage and labor and improve quality of and access to education,” he added.
During his mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Bagmati, Karnali, Lumbini provinces, as well as Province 2.

Title: Commemoration of International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women
Content: 30 November 2021
Kathmandu, 25 November 2020— Survivors of gender-based violence and gender rights activist in Nepal have called for inclusive approaches and comprehensive reforms to eliminate gender-based violence prioritizing the most marginalized women and girls.
On the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and start of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence, survivors, gender equality activists and representatives from the UN, development partners, and the government came together to commit to take action to end gender-based violence now! The event, streamed live from Patan Museum Courtyard, gave center stage to the stories of GBV survivors as well as to gender equality activists to present a joint statement calling for inclusive and comprehensive reforms to eliminate gender-based violence.
Jenny Khadka, an acid-attack survivor, emphasized everyone’s role in preventing gender-based violence. Ashmita Badi, a poet from Surkhet reiterated how patriarchy stands in the way of a world free of violence. Sharmila Thapa, Nurse and a Member of the Trade Union questioned normalization of  GBV at the workplace. Similarly, Babita Rai, Feminist Writer shared about sexual harassment and urged for a world free of violence. Lastly, Kathak dancer Subima Shrestha portrayed the grief and perseverance of Gauri Bista, a survivor of domestic violence and women’s rights activist from Doti, through her dance in the song written by Bista herself. Through their stories, the advocates called for urgent action to change discriminatory social norms, policies and laws to prevent gender-based violence.
In the joint statement, Shova Maya BK, Disabled Women’s Rights Activist, Kala Swarnakar, General Secretary, Feminist Dalit Organization, Nagma Khan, Queer Rights Activist, Prakriti Bhattarai, Chairperson, Political Literacy for Women, and Dorje Gurung, Educator and Activist, called for action from the government, multilateral and bilateral organizations to:
- Repeal constitutional and legal provisions on legal identity and citizenship to address existing gender discriminatory provisions.
- Amplify efforts to end violence against women and girls with intersectional identities (such as caste/ethnicity, religion, geography, disability, gender and sexual minority) through interventions and policy reform tailored to their specific needs.
- Strengthen and intensify response services to GBV through establishment of fast track courts, well-functioning multi-sectoral support system (e.g., health, legal aid, shelter homes, psychosocial support, interpretation services) and increase access to these services for service-seekers focusing on needs of women and girls from marginalized communities.
“Across the globe gender-based violence continues with impunity, survivors’ stories silenced while perpetrators evade justice. Today we say, enough with the silence. Stop the Violence Now.” said Sara Beysolow Nyanti, UN Resident Coordinator, International Development Partner’s Group Co-chair and representing multilateral development partners.
Speaking at the event, Excellency Nona Deprez, European Union Ambassador, Development Partner’s Group Co-chair and representing bilateral development partners expressed, “Ending gender-based violence is non-negotiable. Nepal has worked really hard to have a strong legal framework to combat GBV, which is a real achievement but there is still so much work to be done. It is important to break the cycle of violence”.
During the programme, Under-Secretary Ram Hari Sharma from Ministry of Home Affairs shared that the Ministry has initiated discussions to formulate law related to acid attack as the previous ordinances related to acid attack issued has become ineffective. Dipti Karki, Deputy Superintendent of Police also shared her commitments to end violence against women and girls.
Wrapping up the commemoration event, the UN Country Team lit up Patan Durbar Square Museum and Dharahara in orange, the official colour of the UNITE campaign, that symbolizes hope and a country free of violence.

Editor’s Note
The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is an international campaign which takes place each year. It commences on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10 December, Human Rights Day. It was originated by activists at the first Women's Global Leadership Institute in 1991 and is coordinated each year by the Centre for Women's Global Leadership. It is used as an organizing strategy by individuals and organizations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of violence against women and girls.
As a unifying theme running global activities, the UNiTE campaign has utilized the colour orange to represent a brighter future, free from violence against women and girls. The UN Country Team (UNCT) in Nepal has marked 16 days campaign with awareness building and advocacy campaigns across Nepal. Some of the key activities undertaken were ‘oranging’ monuments and provincial buildings, engaging audience across Nepal through films, social media, and radio campaigns. In Nepal, the UN Country Team (UNCT) has marked the campaign during the past years, including ‘oranging’ of Patan Darbar Square (2016), Lumbini (2017), Provincial Parliament Buildings (2018), Women’s March in Janakpur (2019), and an online dialogue on ‘The Role of Media in Changing Mindsets: One story of gender-based violence is one story too many’ (2020).
The cases of gender-based violence’s have been increasing annually as per the reports from Nepal Police.[1]According to the three years study done by Nepal Police from 2018- 2021 total 8571 cases of sexual violence (mainly rape, attempt to rape, child sexual abuse), 209 cases of child marriage, 38737 cases of domestic violence have been registered across Nepal. Review  the status of limitations of sexual abuse of children to ensure cases can be brought against offenders.
A study[2] highlighted that gender-based violence and gender equality funds are not currently operational. Those that are functioning to a degree – such as the GBV Elimination Fund and the Rehabilitation Fund – exist at the federal level and not at the provincial or local level, which restricts women’s access to these funds. In this context, there is an urgent need to make funds available and ensure that women have access to essential services, including gender-based violence services.[3] There is an urgent need for gender responsive budgeting and tracking allocations for gender equality and for achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 5 – Gender Equality. A coordinated, multi-level and multi-sectoral approach is recommended to prevent and respond to the potential increase in gender-based violence in Nepal[4].

Title: Nepalese peacekeeper serving in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) receives United Nations Woman Police Officer of the Year Award
Content: 08 November 2021
Superintendent Malla currently serves as the Chief of the MONUSCO Police Health and Environment Unit, which she helped establish in the country’s capital, Kinshasa. The unit is responsible for implementing policies and procedures concerning the health and well-being of personnel as well as United Nations Police environmental initiatives. Her contributions have added direct significance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and past outbreaks of Ebola virus disease, as well as natural and humanitarian crises such as the volcanic eruption in Goma last May, during which her unit alerted the local population and UN staff of precautionary measures.
“She helped establish and now leads MONUSCO’s Health and Environment Unit, enhancing the safety and welfare of our peacekeepers by mitigating the risks from COVID-19 and other threats,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. “And she represents something far larger — the many contributions of women police officers in advancing peace and security around the world. Through her work, Superintendent Malla embodies the best of the United Nations.”
A medical professional by training, Superintendent Malla helped develop guidance for preventing and mitigating the spread of COVID-19. She has organized over 300 awareness sessions this year on COVID-19 prevention as well as environmental protection for the local population, Congolese authorities and UN staff. As the MONUSCO Police’s focal point on COVID-19, she also been disseminating information about the vaccines and promoting vaccination efforts.
“I am honored to receive this award, and I hope it will encourage more young women in my country and around the world to pursue careers in policing, which is still too often viewed as “man’s work’,” said Superintendent Malla.
The United Nations Woman Police Officer of the Year award was established in 2011 to recognize the exceptional contributions of women police officers to UN peace operations and to promote the empowerment of women.
“Like many peacekeepers during this challenging time amid the pandemic, Superintendent Malla has gone above and beyond the call of duty to serve local communities,” said United Nations Police Adviser Luis Carrilho. “Together with her team, her efforts to raise awareness about public health and natural risks have ultimately made her colleagues and the Congolese people safer—a core function of policing.”
Superintendent Malla’s previously served with the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) from 2016 to 2017, where she was a member of the Formed Police Unit’s medical team. She joined the Nepal Police in 2008 as an inspector.
The award will be presented during the 16th United Nations Police Week from 8 to 12 November. At this annual event, heads of UN Police components and police experts from peacekeeping operations, special political missions and regional offices and United Nations senior leadership discuss performance, conduct and discipline, protection of civilians, conflict prevention, sustaining peace and other topics and priorities affecting United Nations policing.
About 7,300 UN police, almost 27% of whom are women, are currently deployed in 14 United Nations peace operations around the world where they work to enhance international peace and security by supporting host countries in conflict, post-conflict and other crisis situations.
As of today, UNPOL has already achieved the 2025 targets set out in the Department’s Uniformed Gender Parity Strategy for all categories of personnel. Women police officers comprise 30% of individual police officers and 15% of members of Formed Police Units. Women police hold 40% of professional posts at UN Headquarters and 33% in the field. Women also lead half of UN Police components in UN peace operations.

Title: Nepal among the first countries in Asia to receive COVID-19 vaccines from COVAX Facility
Content: 07 March 2021
Today, Nepal received its first consignment of COVID-19 vaccine doses shipped through the COVAX Facility, a partnership between CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO, made possible through generous donor support from governments, international organizations, foundations and the private sector. The delivery of COVAX-procured vaccines to Nepal is part of a historic step towards ensuring equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally, in what will be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history.
The goal of the COVAX Facility is to supply Nepal with enough doses to vaccinate 20% of the population depending on funding availability. Under the first COVAX allocation, the COVAX Facility will deliver 1.92 million vaccine doses to Nepal by the end of May 2021, in support of the Government of Nepal’s nation-wide vaccination campaign.
Today, the first COVAX shipment of 348,000 doses of AstraZeneca ‘Covishield’ vaccines manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), together with 350,000 syringes and 3500 vaccine safety boxes arrived in Kathmandu before being distributed to provinces and municipalities across the country.  COVAX-supported vaccines provide a critical contribution to the Government of Nepal’s National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) target to vaccinate roughly 22 million people, among them refugees, migrant returnees and other migrant populations. With the generous contribution of the Government of India, Nepal was able to commence the vaccination campaign and to date, 429,705 people have been vaccinated.
The COVAX Facility is generously funded by partner governments, including the Governments of Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Norway, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union as well as foundations and corporations
The arrival of the COVAX supplied vaccines will boost Nepal’s vaccination efforts as it coincides with the launch of the second phase of the vaccination campaign which targets those who are most vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19 including the elderly and people with comorbidities. The second phase will also target teachers, as part of the expanded group of frontline workers.
Ongoing public health measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 will continue to be critical alongside vaccination. This includes adhering to testing and quarantine measures, mask wearing, hand hygiene, and physical distancing of at least two meters.
Representatives of the COVAX technical and funding partners joined the Minister of Health and Population, His Excellency Hridayesh Tripathi, in welcoming the global COVAX contribution to Nepal’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu.
Development partners congratulated Nepal for being among the first countries in the world to have launched COVID-19 vaccination efforts in January 2021. They reiterated their solidarity with Nepal, as exemplified by the arrival of the first COVAX vaccine contribution.
Nepal’s development partners are committed to working with Nepal through the pandemic recovery period to ensure that no one is left behind. Supporting the vaccination of everyone living in Nepal through COVAX will go a long way to restoring normalcy, preventing the loss of social and economic gains made and paving the way for socio-economic recovery.

Notes to Editors
List of donor pledges to the Gavi COVAX AMC is available here.
Interactive funding tracker for the ACT Accelerator, which includes details of funding for COVAX, can be found here.
About COVAX
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, and others. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.
CEPI is focused on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio: investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.
Gavi is focused on procurement and delivery for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. The COVAX Facility is the global pooled procurement mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines through which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all 190 participating economies, using an allocation framework formulated by WHO. The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies and providing volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates. The Gavi COVAX AMC is the financing mechanism that will support the participation of 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Facility, enabling access to donor-funded doses of safe and effective vaccines. Gavi is fundraising for the COVAX AMC, and funding UNICEF procurement of vaccines as well as partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery, including support cold chain equipment, technical assistance, syringes, vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery. UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) will be acting as procurement coordinators for the COVAX Facility, helping deliver vaccines to COVAX AMC participants and others.
WHO has multiple roles within COVAX: It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL)/prequalification programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states. It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination.  WHO leads, along with UNICEF, the support to countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines. The Country Readiness and Delivery (CRD) workstream includes Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional, and country-level to provide tools, guidance, monitoring, and on the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines.  Along with COVAX partners, WHO is also developing a no-fault compensation scheme as part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments.
UNICEF is leveraging its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world and working with manufacturers and partners on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as freight, logistics and storage. UNICEF already procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunization and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund, UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19 vaccines for COVAX. In addition, UNICEF, Gavi and WHO are working with governments around the clock to ensure that countries are ready to receive the vaccines, with appropriate cold chain equipment in place and health workers trained to dispense them. UNICEF is also playing a lead role in efforts to foster trust in vaccines, delivering vaccine confidence communications and tracking and addressing misinformation around the world.
About CEPI
CEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017, to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI has moved with great urgency and in coordination with WHO in response to the emergence of COVID-19. CEPI has initiated 11 partnerships to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus. The programmes are leveraging rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI as well as new partnerships.
Before the emergence of COVID-19, CEPI’s priority diseases included Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya virus. CEPI also invested in platform technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (Disease X).
About Gavi
Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance is a public-private partnership that helps vaccinate half the world’s children against some of the world’s deadliest diseases. Since its inception in 2000, Gavi has helped to immunise a whole generation – over 822 million children – and prevented more than 14 million deaths, helping to halve child mortality in 73 developing countries. Gavi also plays a key role in improving global health security by supporting health systems as well as funding global stockpiles for Ebola, cholera, meningitis and yellow fever vaccines. After two decades of progress, Gavi is now focused on protecting the next generation and reaching the unvaccinated children still being left behind, employing innovative finance and the latest technology – from drones to biometrics – to save millions more lives, prevent outbreaks before they can spread and help countries on the road to self-sufficiency.

About the ACT-Accelerator
The Access to COVID-19 Tools ACT-Accelerator, is a new, ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders in March and launched by the WHO, European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.
The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organisation, but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organisations to end the pandemic. It is a framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around the table with the goal of ending the pandemic as quickly as possible through the accelerated development, equitable allocation, and scaled up delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and economies in the near term. It draws on the experience of leading global health organisations which are tackling the world’s toughest health challenges, and who, by working together, are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against COVID-19. Its members share a commitment to ensure all people have access to all the tools needed to defeat COVID-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.
The ACT-Accelerator has four areas of work: diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and the health system connector. Cross-cutting all of these is the workstream on Access & Allocation.

Title: Holocaust Education and Remembrance in Nepal
Content: 27 January 2021
The outreach program began with a memorial ceremony hosted by the United Nations Resident Coordinator Ms. Sara Beysolow Nyanti, at the UN House. The ceremony - organized following COVID-19 safety protocols - was attended by their excellencies the Ambassadors of Germany and Israel and the Head of the EU in Nepal.
Speaking at the memorial ceremony, the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Ms. Sara Beysolow Nyanti said “remembering accurately and teaching about the Holocaust is vital in countering hatred. This has never been more important than today, a time when antisemitism, bigotry and racism are rising with devastating and violent consequences for people and communities.”  “Through our week-long virtual outreach program, I call on all generations especially youth to use your voice to stand up for human rights, challenge discrimination and antisemitism by remembering the need to foster tolerance, solidarity and empathy.” Ms Nyanti added.
This year’s International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust is being celebrated under the theme “Facing the Aftermath: Recovery and Reconstitution after the Holocaust”. It focuses on the measures taken by people in the aftermath of the Holocaust to begin the process of recovery and reconstitution of individuals, community, and systems of justice. The theme encourages a discussion of how measures taken in the past could contribute in how we rebuild societies today.
Resonating with the global theme, the outreach program will highlight the significance of standing up for justice to stop  the rise of antisemitism and racism, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which we have seen a rise in hate speech and stigmatization  against the COVID-19 patients and their family members. It will emphasize our collective need to stand up against injustice and say “never again”.
After reciting the Yizkor prayer in honor of all those who suffered during the Shoah, the Ambassador for Israel, Hanan Goder said, "Today we remember the victims of the Holocaust. Six million Jews were murdered by Hitler and his collaborators because of ideology that could not respect the other and could not appreciate tolerance." 

He also said, "The message for us today is that we all must denounce all forms of Racism and Antisemitism and most important: we must remember! Remember the victims and all those that courageously stood against the evil of the Nazi ideology."
During the memorial ceremony, six candles representing the six million victims of the Holocaust were lit followed by an observance of one-minute of silence.
On the occasion, German Ambassador to Nepal Roland Schäfer said, “As a German, I am still haunted by the faces of my missing Jewish brothers and sisters. Those who are not there, who could not finish their lives, have children and continue, are as important to us as those who survived. No family, no country, no society can live while forgetting the ones who are missing. That’s why this week is so important, also in Nepal.”
EU Ambassador to Nepal Nona Deprez said, “Today millions in Nepal and all around the world remember those millions who lost their lives in the most horrible event of history. Ensuring this genocide is not forgotten, and educating new generations on the responsibilities of citizenship, care and engagement, are crucial for preventing such atrocity from happening again in the future.
With the support of Higher Institutions and Secondary Schools' Association Nepal (HISSAN) and V4Action Volunteers – the online volunteering network of youth established by the UN in Nepal, the virtual outreach program on Holocaust has set a target to reach out to more than 35 hundred youth from 7 provinces Nepal within a week’s time.

Title: Sara Beysolow Nyanti is the new United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal
Content: 26 January 2021

"I am truly delighted to start my tenure as the UN Resident Coordinator in Nepal. This is a crucial time for the UN and the government as it relates to containing the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring a coordinated response that is not only medical but addresses the socio-economic challenges as well. I am committed to our joined-up efforts to provide immediate and effective humanitarian support to Nepal in relation to not only the COVID 19 response, but to an overall effective emergency preparedness and response system.  On behalf of the UN in Nepal, I express my commitment to support the government of Nepal and the stakeholders in pushing the envelope to build back not only better, but greener, and differently. Nepal’s aspiration of graduation from being a least developed country is one that the UN shares, and our support in this area will remain a priority. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  at the heart of everything we do, I would like to reiterate the UN in Nepal’s focus on internalizing the SDGs for stronger engagement with provincial and local governments in order to achieve the global agenda with a focus on gender equality," said the UN Resident Coordinator Nyanti.

Title: Oped : The challenges people with disabilities face
Content: 03 December 2020
Richard Howard
The year 2020 has thrown unprecedented challenges at all of us, both in Nepal and globally. The pandemic has also impacted people disproportionally. Persons with disabilities that make up 15 percent of the world population, or one billion, are among the hardest hit by Covid-19. One in every five women is likely to experience disability in her life, while one in every 10 children is living with a disability. Of the one billion population of persons with disabilities, 80 percent live in developing countries. These numbers provide a backdrop for thinking about our response to Covid-19 and how we make a dedicated effort to ensure that people with disabilities are not left behind. We must ensure their inclusion in our response and recovery efforts.
Some disabilities are not visible. Chronic pain, mental illness, chronic fatigue are a few types of invisible disabilities that control people’s lives but do not show in obvious ways. These are people who are regularly told that their disabilities are not real, are made up for sympathy or only imagined and could not possibly be a real medical condition since they walk free from canes or crutches, have functioning limbs, and can seemingly move their bodies just like the rest of us. Society needs to be built so that it is accessible to everyone, including those with less visible disabilities.
Nepali society, like most societies, should promote greater understanding and increased accessibility for people with disabilities, who are often treated differently or excluded from the opportunities and conversations open to others. They are pressed to navigate a world that is not built for them. Kindness, compassion and consideration are a good start to ensure that we see and support those who may struggle and suffer in normal times and in times of crisis.
When this pandemic passes, the world must be a different place, and it is a chance to reimagine a society in which people with disabilities have better lives; where they do not have to fight to be seen and included, and where they are not merely an afterthought. People with disabilities should participate in our response and recovery from Covid-19 at all stages, and they should hold us accountable to deliver on our promises.
On this International Day of Persons with Disabilities, I hope that we can all begin to envision a society that everyone can participate in, one that changes how we see and interact with disabilities as equal partners, particularly those with invisible disabilities. It is a chance to build back better and challenge inequalities at every step.
A big step in the right direction is to break the silence, speak up and wipe away the biases held against people with disabilities, to banish the stereotypes, and slowly dissipate the stigma facing people with disabilities. These changes start with each of us making a commitment. There are myriad ways in which the world can transform to remove obstacles for people with disabilities to access the opportunities the rest have, from access to economic opportunity and healthy workspaces to accessible infrastructure and health services.

Title: UN Nepal Joint Statement on Bardibas Incident
Content: 26 November 2020
We urge the relevant authorities to urgently follow due process and ensure that the perpetrator is held accountable.
This incident happened on the eve of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaign and has highlighted the critical need to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.  The campaign calls on governments, civil society and individuals to speak out and act to bring about the changes within our society and culture that perpetuates gender-based violence, at times with impunity. When incidents do occur, due process should be followed and perpetrators held accountable for their actions.
The UN in Nepal pledges its full support to prioritise and adopt actions to address the needs of victims and survivors of violence and ensure that our collective response and recovery efforts uphold their rights, including their right to live a life free from violence. Every survivor of GBV must be able to receive the full range of care that she or they need and deserve, including urgent medical attention and access to follow-up health services, psychosocial care, and protection and justice services. These services must be informed by continuous data collection to improve delivery and safety standards.
While holding perpetrators to account is critical at this stage, the UN would like to stress the fact that gender-based violence can be prevented. Doing justice to this little girl requires action to protect all women and girls in Nepal from violence.
We urge demonstrators and security forces to raise their voice responsibly and to show restraint to avoid a further escalation of the situation.

Title: Statement on International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and launch of 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence
Content: 25 November 2020
This annual international campaign takes place at a sombre time for the global community, amidst a pandemic that has exacerbated existing inequalities and disparities. We see a spike in violence against women and girls around the world ¬– at exactly the time as resources have been diverted to the COVID-19 response and services have become scarcer and less accessible. In Nepal, where even before the crisis, national statistics painted a grim picture of the prevalence of violence against women and girls in the country, emerging data and reports from actors on the front line indicate that violence has intensified.
This year’s campaign highlights vulnerabilities faced by women and girls, and sexual and gender minorities, particularly those already marginalized and exposed to greater risks, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. It is a call to action to prioritise and adopt actions to  address their needs  and to ensure that our collective response and recovery efforts uphold their rights, including their right to live a life free from violence. Every survivor of GBV – where ever she/they live ¬– must be able to receive the full range of care she/they need and deserve, including urgent medical attention and access to follow-up health services, psychosocial care, and protection and justice services; and these services must be informed by continuous data collection to improve delivery and safety standards.
2020 is an important milestone for women and girls’ rights and gender equality as the UN turns 75 and as the world marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action – the most progressive blueprint for gender equality and the empowerment of all women, everywhere.  An inspiration across generations, the Beijing Declaration is at the core of the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals and the commitment to leave no one behind.
As we mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and launch the 16 Days of Activism, let us stand together against violence and speak out wherever and whenever we see it.  Let us commit to take action to ensure that the global pandemic does not derail progress on gender equality and let us each play our role in delivering a brighter and equal future for all.

Title: UN and DFID partner to support COVID-19 response and disaster preparedness and response in Nepal
Content: 24 August 2020
The COVID-19 pandemic is having far reaching impacts globally including in Nepal, which is already vulnerable to natural disasters - the compounded impact goes beyond just the health crisis.  This package of support will enable the UN to reach those impacted by COVID-19 and at the same time, prepare for any crisis Nepal may face in the future, in support of the Government.
In Nepal as of 20 August, more than 29,645 people have been tested positive for COVID-19 and 126 people have lost their lives because of the virus. Likewise, as of 19 August, floods and landslides triggered by the monsoon rain have killed 241 people 88 have gone missing.
Beyond supporting the Government of Nepal’s response to both COVID-19 and monsoon-related crises, the UN is also working to develop national and local disaster management capacity through its cluster co-leadership role. It is committed to jointly plan and prepare for emergency response in Nepal this year and beyond.
The UK has been a longstanding partner of the UN in Nepal. Under these new programmes, the UK will provide financial and technical support to tackle the outbreak of COVID-19 and scale up the UN’s ability to prepare effectively for future emergencies.
Key activities will include: support to Covid 19 contact tracing teams, health screening monitoring and data management, supporting telemedicine, providing personal protective equipment for frontline health service providers, ensuring health facilities can continue to provide sexual and reproductive health services, providing psychosocial support to survivors of gender based violence, supporting more than 35,000 children and pregnant and lactating women to prevent malnutrition, provide warehousing at 3 Humanitarian Staging Areas across the country and transport for key supplies, and supporting water and sanitation in health and quarantine facilities.
“This is a welcome step towards the commitments made by members states, including by Nepal, to the UN Secretary-General’s reform agenda which reaffirms the role of the UN Resident Coordinator in country-level coordination to deliver collective responses to the national needs and priorities by bringing the UN system together,” said Valerie Julliand, United Nations Resident Coordinator. “As the UK joins forces with the UN, together we are working on responding to the crisis and also addressing the inequalities & vulnerabilities in social, political & economic systems in Nepal,” Valerie added.
The UK support the UN agencies in preparedness both in Nepal and globally. In addition to this support, the UK endorses the role of the UN Resident Coordinator to lead on coordinating emergency preparedness and response on behalf of the international community with the Government of Nepal in the absence of a presence of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  This includes humanitarian advisory capacity, coordination, data analysis and a common service for accountability to affected populations.
Lisa Honan, Country Director for DFID Nepal said, “Nepal has suffered a great deal because of natural hazards including the corona virus. UK funded programmes continue to work with the government to strengthen its response as well as implement a green recovery from the pandemic. We are confident that our support to the UN will help improve the response to the pandemic in Nepal as well as improve preparedness for future natural hazards.”

Title: Joint Press Statement on integrating Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) during COVID-19 response
Content: 08 July 2020
All actors involved in the COVID-19 response need to continue to respect the right of all people, especially women and girls, youth, minorities and marginalised groups, to be safe from discrimination, sexual exploitation and abuse while receiving assistance, including as they stay at quarantine and isolation centres or receive health services and treatment.
As seen in previous crises, women and children in particular face heightened risks. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception.  Between 11 March and 6 June 2020, 624 cases of violence against women and girls were reported. Indeed, there have been concerning allegations of sexual abuse in quarantine centres, places where women should feel safe to spend their quarantine before returning to their families and their community. We must have zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse, we must treat every allegation seriously and pursue appropriate action to resolve it.
In cases where sexual exploitation or abuse does occur, it is essential that victims have access to safe and conﬁdential reporting channels and services, as well as to justice and legal remedy. When children are victims, the approach must consider the best interest of the child and engage with the family and caregivers as appropriate.
Protection from sexual exploitation and abuse must be integrated into the response to COVID-19 as a central part of coordinated humanitarian action and development assistance. We encourage everyone engaged in the COVID-19 response – Government, private sector, civil society, communities, frontline workers, security forces and volunteers – to respect and protect those who are vulnerable and marginalized, and create a safe environment for both the service users and providers without fear of sexual exploitation and abuse. The responsibility to end gender-based violence lies with all of us, families, religious and political leaders, the police, civil society, the judicial committees, the justice system, and with the press.

Title: Press Statement - UN Support to COVID-19 response
Content: 04 June 2020
The effects of the global pandemic are unforeseen and have often come suddenly. The return of large numbers of migrants has led to pressure at the border points and on transit and quarantine centres. The UN in Nepal has, at the request of the Government, assessed the conditions in the quarantine centres as well as provided support where possible. Part of the ongoing assessment of the situation and the humanitarian response require the UN to verify changes in the situation, support UN offices outside Kathmandu, deliver supplies as well as meet with the provincial and local authorities.
Wherever the UN works across the world, some of our key roles are to provide assistance and relief on the basis of needs, demonstrating solidarity, as well as giving everyone a voice. UN teams, together with various international partners that work in support of the Government, have been allowed to move for essential travel during the ongoing lockdown, following WHO and Government protocols.
COVID-19 poses questions to how we conduct our work and no decisions are taken lightly, including on the use of resource, which is why when the UN undertakes travel, there is a careful consideration of the risks as well as the costs. In this current context, the UN has received generous support from private partners, such as Yeti Airlines that has provided the transport to the UN and other humanitarian partners at cost price.
The UN will continue to work with the Government of Nepal to support the country both through the COVID-19 pandemic and the recovery phase.

Title: UN Regional Centre For Peace And Disarmament To Hold Regional Seminar On Gun Violence And Illicit Small-Arms Trafficking From A Gender Perspective
Content: 03 March 2020
The seminar gathers Members of Parliament (MPs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) from 17 States of Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Pacific, as well as international experts and UN officials engaging in arms control and gender issues. The seminar concludes the efforts of three preceding sub-regional workshops organized in the framework of UNRCPD’s programme on Women, Peace and Security, the purpose of which is to strengthen and promote women’s participation in the field of preventing and combating illegal flows of small arms and light weapons (SALW), their misuse and gun violence.
Through specific thematic sessions and practical exercises, the seminar provides the opportunity for participants from the Asia-Pacific region to share and discuss their experiences during and since the sub-regional workshops, and to brainstorm possible ideas for joint initiatives between MPs and NGOs to address gun violence and illicit small arms trafficking from a gender perspective. During the event, participants will discuss a compendium with outcomes of the sub-regional workshops in order to consolidate inputs, findings and lessons learned. It will serve as a guiding manual for future planning at the national and regional level.
The seminar will also serve to raise awareness on the practical application of key international arms control instruments, such as the Arms Trade Treaty and the United Nations Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons, and their linkage with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Women, Peace and Security Agenda.
The workshop is funded by the European Union as part of Council Decision (CFSP) 2018/2011 of 17 December 2018 which supports gender mainstreamed policies, programmes and actions in the fight against small arms trafficking and misuse, in line with the Women, Peace and Security agenda.

Title: Holocaust Education and Remembrance in Nepal
Content: 27 January 2020
“Understanding our history connects us to the essential human values of truth, respect, justice and compassion. As these values are still being threatened from all sides, we must reaffirm them more strongly than ever and stand every day and everywhere against antisemitism, bigotry and hatred of all kinds”, says the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Ms. Valerie Julliand.
This year marks both the 75th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War and the establishment of the United Nations. Acknowledging 2020 as the milestone year, the theme for Holocaust Remembrance Day is “75 years after Auschwitz - Holocaust Education and Remembrance for Global Justice".
Resonating with the global theme, remembrance and education about the holocaust were at the center of the school outreach programme in Nepal. Various orientation sessions about the Holocaust were conducted amongst the students of higher secondary level as a part of their Social Studies curriculum benefiting around 500 students.
During the school outreach program students were briefed about the horrors that can emerge from discrimination and intolerance and were urged to stand for injustice and “never again” repeat the acts of genocide anywhere in the world.
“The purpose of this international day of remembrance is therefore not only to pay tribute to the victims of the Holocaust, but also to encourage us to learn from it so that such horror will never happen again. It's more important than ever at a time that we are witnessing a worrying revival of antisemitism, with social networks as its main vector, where anonymity and lack of control encourage all forms of hate speech and Holocaust denial”, says the Chargé d'affaires of the Delegation of the European Union to Nepal, Mr. Bashkim BITUCI.
In order to amplify the awareness about the holocaust, the UN and the three diplomatic missions mobilized 35 youth volunteers pursuing their bachelor’s and master’s degrees to facilitate the school outreach programs.
Prior to the school outreach program, the volunteers were briefed about the history of the holocaust over a period of three days. They also had the unique opportunity to interact with the UN Resident Coordinator, the Ambassadors of the German and Israel Embassies and the European Union Delegation to Nepal over a one on one Q & A session.
"One of the darkest realities in the history of mankind is the Holocaust. Since the theme this year is Holocaust education, together, we must educate our future generation and continue our fight against antisemitism, discrimination and intolerance. We must remember not to repeat the history itself. Our joint responsibility is not over yet." opined the Ambassador of Israel to Nepal, H.E. Mr. Benny Omer.
The month-long observation concluded with a memorial ceremony hosted by the German Ambassador, H.E. Mr. Roland Schafer. The memorial ceremony, attended by the representatives of the Nepali Government, the diplomatic community and civil society, the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Ms. Valerie Julliand and the Chargé d’affaires of the delegation of the European Union, Mr. Bashkim Bituci shared their remarks on the victims of the Holocaust. Likewise, H.E. Ambassador for Israel, Mr. Benny Omer, recited the Yizkor prayer in honor of all those who suffered during the Shoa.
After thanking the UN Volunteers for their work in the Nepali schools, H.E Mr Roland Schäfer added, “all democratic governments currently face the challenge to find the right balance between banning hateful content and preserving the freedom of speech. Anywhere, and in Nepal, governments are well advised to listen very carefully. Listen to the young people who need to be protected from discrimination and at the same time need to express their opinion freely. Listen to the experts who all over the world, work on carefully crafted laws and trying to protect citizens from both pitfalls.”

Title: New Year’s Babies: Over 1,500 children will be born in Nepal on New Year’s Day - UNICEF
Content: 01 January 2020
“The beginning of a new year and a new decade is an opportunity to reflect on our hopes and aspirations not only for our future, but the future of those who will come after us,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “As the calendar flips each January, we are reminded of all the possibility and potential of each child embarking on her or his life’s journey—if they are just given that chance.”
Fiji in the Pacific will most likely deliver 2020’s first baby. The United States, its last. Globally, over half of these births are estimated to take place in eight countries:
Each January, UNICEF celebrates babies born on New Year’s Day, an auspicious day for child birth around the world.
However, for millions of newborns around the world, the day of their birth is far less auspicious.
In 2018, 2.5 million newborns died in just their first month of life; about a third of them on the first day of life. Among those children, most died from preventable causes such as premature birth, complications during delivery, and infections like sepsis. In addition, more than 2.5 million babies are born dead each year.
Over the past three decades, the world has seen remarkable progress in child survival, cutting the number of children worldwide who die before their fifth birthday by more than half. But there has been slower progress for newborns. Babies dying in the first month accounted for 47 per cent of all deaths among children under five in 2018, up from 40 per cent in 1990.
UNICEF’s Every Child Alive campaign calls for immediate investment in health workers with the right training, who are equipped with the right medicines to ensure every mother and newborn is cared for by a safe pair of hands to prevent and treat complications during pregnancy, delivery and birth.
“Too many mothers and newborns are not being cared for by a trained and equipped midwife or nurse, and the results are devastating,” added Fore. “We can ensure that millions of babies survive their first day and live into this decade and beyond if every one of them is born into a safe pair of hands.”
