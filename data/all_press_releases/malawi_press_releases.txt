Title: UNITED NATIONS AND MALAWI GOVERNMENT SET TO SIGN UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION FRAMEWORK 2024-2028
Content: 22 November 2023
Both the Government of Malawi and the United Nations reaffirm their commitment to work hand in hand, ensuring full accountability to the people of Malawi to deliver on the promises outlined within the Cooperation Framework.
(Lilongwe, Malawi – 22 November 2023) The Government of Malawi and the United Nations will sign the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2024-2028 on 23 November 2023. The framework signifies a commitment to accelerate sustainable development efforts in Malawi, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the national development plan, Malawi 2063.
The Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in Malawi, Rebecca Adda-Dontoh, highlighted the significance of this pivotal moment, stating, "The signing of a Cooperation Framework represents a bold new commitment to strengthen partnerships to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and national development priorities. It also represents renewed hope in our collective resolve to do all we can to positively transform the lives of the people we serve, leaving no-one behind, while protecting the planet for the generations to come."
Despite facing challenges like climate-induced disasters, health crises, and geopolitical conflicts, Malawi remains resolute in achieving the SDGs by 2030 and the goals of Malawi 2063. The framework aims to regain development momentum, leveraging six critical transitions across food systems, energy access, digital connectivity, education, jobs, and climate change.
Embedded within the framework are guiding principles of inclusivity, human rights, gender equality, resilience, sustainability, and accountability.
Both the Government of Malawi and the United Nations reaffirm their commitment to work hand in hand, ensuring full accountability to the people of Malawi to deliver on the promises outlined within the Cooperation Framework.
The upcoming signing of the UNSDCF marks a pivotal moment in the journey towards sustainable development in Malawi, heralding renewed hope and a strengthened commitment towards a brighter and more inclusive future for all.

Title: UNITED NATIONS IN MALAWI ADVOCATES FOR DECENT WORK FOR ALL AND SUSTAINABLE YOUTH EMPLOYMENT AMIDST NATURAL DISASTERS ON WORLD LABOUR DAY
Content: 01 May 2023
While we acknowledge the efforts of the Government of Malawi to create jobs and generate wealth, it is important to ensure the decency of the jobs created.
On Labour Day, we applaud the contributions of workers to our society and economy. We also recognize all those whose efforts have advanced the rights of workers in Malawi and around the world.

I am honoured to bring you a message of solidarity and goodwill from the entire UN system in Malawi. This year's theme, “Natural Disasters a Threat to Livelihoods and Decent Work: Creating Decent Jobs and Extending Social Protection is key to Sustainable Recovery,” resonates strongly with all of us.

As we celebrate worker’s contributions, including those in the informal economy, we acknowledge the criticality of labour to achieving social and economic development. The African Union's Agenda 2063 and the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognize the importance of decent work in achieving sustainable development.

While we acknowledge the efforts of the Government of Malawi to create jobs and generate wealth, it is important to ensure the decency of the jobs created. Decent work can be summed up as "Promoting Jobs, Protecting People." We should create opportunities for everyone to get work that is productive and delivers a fair income, rights at work, social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration. We should also ensure equal opportunities for women, men, young people and persons with disabilities in the workplace.

Without a doubt, climate-related shocks have set back Malawi’s growth trajectory. We are still tallying the impact of Cyclone Freddy, that devastated the southern region, including on jobs and social protection. The cyclone traumatized the nation, caused loss of life and livelihood, displacement, damage to infrastructure and property, disruptions to supply chains and markets, and overall has increased vulnerability to poverty and food insecurity. This has left a huge gap in terms of employment and small-scale businesses that will need to be rebuilt.

In the face of this, however, there are glimmers of hope. The strong leadership of the Government of Malawi in coordinating the relief and response must be commended. Ordinary Malawians have rallied to render support to their brothers and sisters. Countries in the region have come to the assistance of their neighbour. Development partners, NGOs and the international community are re-programming development support for Malawi. The UN pledges its support to implementation of the national response plan and the eventual recovery plan, to prioritize medium and long-term recovery interventions.

The commemoration of Labour Day calls us to reflect on the country’s development challenges and collectively plan how we can co-create home-grown solutions to recover better and build sustainable livelihoods for all.

On this day, I challenge all of our partners – in the Government, private sector, civil society, academia, the development community – to reaffirm their commitment to support national efforts to end child labour, reduce youth unemployment, enhance social protection for the most vulnerable and promote the creation of decent work for all to accelerate development and rescue the Sustainable Development Goals in Malawi.

Title: ONE MONTH AFTER THE PASSAGE OF CYCLONE FREDDY, THE WORLD NEEDS TO  STEP-UP SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES RAVAGED BY THE DISASTER IN MALAWI
Content: 14 April 2023
Malawi is one of the countries that have been hardest-hit by the increased rainfall accompanying tropical cyclones in Southern Africa as a result of human-induced climate change
(Lilongwe, 14 April 2023): One month after the passage of Tropical Cyclone Freddy—which swept through 15 districts in southern Malawi, destroying lives, livelihoods and homes—communities ravaged by the storm still require urgent assistance and support as they strive to survive the aftermath of the devastating floods and mudslides.

“In the weeks since this tragedy struck, I have been absolutely inspired by the many people who have helped their neighbours and fellow Malawians impacted by Tropical Cyclone Freddy,” said the United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator, Rebecca Adda-Dontoh. “In support of these incredible communities and the Government-led response, 60 UN agencies and non-governmental organizations have provided life-saving assistance to people affected by the disaster. However, much more remains to be done.”

Since 12 March, close to 230,000 people have been reached with vital assistance and support, including food for the most vulnerable people, safe water and sanitation facilities and hygiene services, access to health care, including sexual and reproductive health, and emergency shelter, such as tents and tarpaulin. This has included the airlifting of relief, especially food, to areas that remain cut off or difficult to reach by road. However, with humanitarian partners’ Flash Appeal for Malawi less than 11 per cent funded, there are critical gaps in the response and additional contributions are urgently required for humanitarian partners to scale-up assistance, in support of the Government-led response. Humanitarian partners in Malawi are committed to a response that places people at the centre and have zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse.

“Despite our best efforts, tens of thousands of people are still without adequate shelter. We also need to step-up the provision of clean water, sanitation and hygiene, especially in light of the cholera outbreak. And we need to ensure that women and children, in particular, are protected from violence, exploitation and abuse, given the many risks generated by this crisis,” said Ms. Adda-Dontoh. “Our response in the first 30 days was made possible by the support of the international community, who have so far generously contributed US$7.6 million. I am today calling on donors to redouble their support to fill the critical shortfalls in funding so that we can do even more in the month ahead.”

Malawi is one of the countries that have been hardest-hit by the increased rainfall accompanying tropical cyclones in Southern Africa as a result of human-induced climate change, according to a recent research. Yet, the country contributes just 0.04 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Tropical Cyclone Freddy—which killed over 1,000 people—is a devastating reminder of the human cost of the global climate crisis.

Title: The United Nations and Humanitarian Partners Call for US$70.6 Million to Provide Life-Saving Assistance to People in Malawi affected by the passage of Cyclone Freddy

The passage of Cyclone Freddy left a trail of devastation across 15 districts in southern Malawi.
The United Nations and Humanitarian Partners Call for US$70.6 Million to Provide Life-Saving Assistance to People in Malawi affected by the passage of Cyclone Freddy

(Lilongwe, 01 April 2023): The United Nations and humanitarian partners in Malawi are calling for US$70.6 million to assist 1.1 million people affected by the passage of the Tropical Cyclone Freddy weather system in the Southern Region in March 2023, in support of the Government-led response.

“Freddy’s passage has caused death, destruction, displacement and devastation on a horrifying scale at a time when Malawians were already facing high levels of food insecurity and a cholera outbreak,” said the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Malawi, Rebecca Adda-Dontoh. “Humanitarian partners continue to support the Government’s relief efforts following Cyclone Freddy, but the needs are truly enormous, with some Traditional Authorities in Nsanje and Phalombe Districts still unreachable by road,” Ms. Adda-Dontoh added.

The revised Malawi Flash Appeal outlines the contribution of humanitarian partners to the Government-led responses to floods and cholera in Malawi. The Flash Appeal aims to  provide an integrated response—including shelter, nutrition, health, water, sanitation and hygiene, and protection—for those hardest-hit by the crisis, while ensuring communities are at the centre of the response.

“I visited displaced people in Blantyre and was inspired by their incredible resilience and determination to move forward, despite the tragedy they have endured,” the UN Resident Coordinator said. “Malawians have themselves mobilized to support one another in this time of tremendous need and we must step-up our solidarity as the international community.”

The passage of Cyclone Freddy left a trail of devastation across 15 districts in southern Malawi. At least 676 people have died, and this figure is expected to rise in the days ahead, while 659,278 people were displaced in 747 camps, according to the Government.

The Flash Appeal requirements for the Freddy response come on top of the $45.3 million called for earlier this year by humanitarian partners for the cholera response, bringing the total revised Flash Appeal to $115.9 million. Malawi continues to face its deadliest cholera outbreak in recent history and health concerns are rising following the passage of Cyclone Freddy.

The UN and its partners in Malawi urgently call on donors to fund the revised Flash Appeal and enable them to work swiftly in support of the Government-led response to assist communities affected by the passage of Cyclone Freddy and the cholera outbreak.

Title: MALAWI: UN RELEASES US$5.5 MILLION TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES RAVAGED BY FLOODS
Content: 19 March 2023
Nearly 363,000 people are displaced and sheltering in over 500 camps across flood-affected areas of Malawi, and the death toll has risen to 447, with at least 282 people still missing.
(Lilongwe, 19 March 2023): The Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Martin Griffiths, has released US$5.5 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to assist people affected by the Tropical Cyclone Freddy weather system in Malawi, as the devastating toll of floods and mudslides in the country’s Southern Region continues to rise.
Speaking after visiting flood-affected areas on 16 March, the United Nations Resident Coordinator for Malawi, Ms. Rebecca Adda-Dontoh, said: “The destruction and suffering that I witnessed in southern Malawi is the human face of the global climate crisis. The people I met with—many of whom have lost their homes and loved ones—have done nothing to cause this crisis. We, as the United Nations, stand in full solidarity with the people of Malawi at this tragic time and we call on the international community to do the same.”
Nearly 363,000 people are displaced and sheltering in over 500 camps across flood-affected areas of Malawi, and the death toll has risen to 447, with at least 282 people still missing, according to authorities on 18 March. Some 75,000 hectares of cropland has been flooded, just as farmers were about to harvest the only crop of the year. These figures are expected to rise in the days ahead as further information becomes available, especially in areas where people remain trapped by the flood waters and full information is not yet available.
The Government of Malawi is leading the response, with support from humanitarian partners. More than 1,500 people have been rescued from isolated locations and, as flood waters begin to subside, assistance is being dispatched to the hardest-hit districts.
“People are traumatized, and many have lost their homes, their belongings and their livelihoods,” said Ms. Adda-Dontoh. “In support of the Government-led response, through this CERF grant, we will aim to assist those who have been hardest-hit with life-saving and life-sustaining assistance, including water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), shelter and vital non-food items, food, healthcare and prevention of gender-based violence and child protection risks.“
Southern Malawi was affected after Tropical Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique on 11 March and moved over land as a tropical depression, bringing torrential rainfall, devastating floods and mudslides to Malawi from 12 March. Malawi is also still facing its deadliest cholera outbreak in recent history, and there is a high risk that the disease could spread in flood-affected areas

Title: UN MALAWI CALLS FOR URGENT ACTION TO SUPPORT PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE TROPICAL CYCLONE FREDDY
Content: 14 March 2023
The United Nations commends the Government of Malawi for its leadership of preparedness and response measures and calls upon partners to step up efforts to assist people in the districts most affected by the cyclone.
(Lilongwe, 14 March 2023) In the wake of the declaration of a State of Disaster in the Southern Region by the President of the Republic of Malawi, Lazarus Chakwera, the United Nations in Malawi is calling for urgent coordinated support for the people impacted by the destruction caused by Tropical Cyclone Freddy.
Tropical Cyclone Freddy has created an unprecedented crisis in Malawi.
The United Nations commends the Government of Malawi for its leadership of preparedness and response measures and calls upon partners to step up efforts to assist people in the districts most affected by the cyclone.
The UN has been rapidly mobilising support to address immediate needs pending a multi-sectoral assessment. Technical and financial support provided by the United Nations to establish an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been critical in strengthening humanitarian coordination among Government, NGO and development partners. Furthermore, several UN Agencies have deployed personnel to the affected areas to support coordination of response and assessment efforts in information management and logistics.
UN is providing critical logistical support, including transportation for search and rescue operations as well as to ferry humanitarian workers, equipment and supplies to communities that have been cut off by flooding and landslides, as well as medical supplies and equipment to improve water and sanitation infrastructure to address immediate health needs, including preventing the spread of Cholera.
Protection of the most vulnerable populations and prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse remain central to the work of the UN, including in humanitarian response.  To this end, UN Agencies are providing food and non-food items such as shelter materials, tents and dignity kits to displaced people.
The UN stands with the people of Malawi and encourages national authorities, civil society, the private sector, political parties, the media, traditional leaders and religious leaders to ensure that at all times the rights and dignity of affected populations are respected.
The longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, according to the World Meteorological Organisation, Freddy has left a trail of destruction and continues to cause extensive damage and loss of lives from torrential rains and strong winds in ten Districts, namely Nsanje, Chikwawa, Mulanje, Thyolo, Phalombe, Chiradzulu, Mwanza, Blantyre, Zomba and Neno.
Over the past three days, Cyclone Freddy has claimed the lives of more than 190 people and injured dozens more overstretching the health sector that is already overwhelmed by the worst Cholera outbreak in two decades. The full extent of the impact of the cyclone will be known when a multi-sectoral assessment is conducted.
The United Nations extends sincere condolences to the people of Malawi who have lost loved ones and property.

Title: The United Nations and Humanitarian Partners Call for $45.3 Million to Provide Life Saving Aid to People Devastated by the Cholera Outbreak in Malawi
Content: 20 February 2023
The appeal—which calls for US$45.3 million for the next five months—comes as the numbers of cholera cases and deaths in Malawi have increased exponentially since the beginning of January 2023
(Lilongwe, 20 February 2023): The United Nations and humanitarian partners in Malawi today launched a Flash Appeal to assist 4 million people, including 56,000 refugees and asylum seekers, who have been hardest-hit by, and are at highest-risk of, cholera, in support of the Government-led response.
The appeal—which calls for US$45.3 million for the next five months—comes as the numbers of cholera cases and deaths in Malawi have increased exponentially since the beginning of January 2023, worsening what is already the deadliest cholera outbreak in the country’s history.
“Despite all the efforts taken since the first cholera case was reported in Malawi nearly one year ago, the situation remains of grave concern. Every day, the number of cases increases, and more people die,” said the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Malawi, Rebecca Adda-Dontoh. “However, the good news is that, while cholera is highly transmissible, it is also easily treatable when cases are caught early and preventable when communities have access to clean water and good sanitation.”
The Malawi Cholera Flash Appeal—which is launched to coincide with Government of Malawi’s Cholera campaign—aims to address the most immediate needs of people impacted by the outbreak through an integrated response that brings together health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), while ensuring communities are engaged, prepared and supported to respond to and reduce cholera. Acknowledging that the outbreak has taken a devastating toll on the hardest-hit communities, the Flash Appeal also calls for support to essential health, nutrition, education and protection services in affected and high-risk locations.
Remarking at the launch of the Flash Appeal, Ms. Adda-Dontoh said, “I had the privilege of joining His Excellency President Chakwera and Honourable Minister of Health in visiting three cholera treatment centres in Lilongwe last week, where I spoke with health-care workers who requested more support to treat the endless flow of patients they are receiving. When left untreated, cholera can kill in less than twelve hours, but with simple IV fluids, most patients are rapidly on the road to recovery. No one should die of cholera in 2023 and the world can, and must, step-up to help Malawians in their time of need.”
The current cholera outbreak, which started in March 2022, has affected all 29 districts of Malawi and is the largest outbreak in the country in the past two decades. The number of cases increased dramatically at the start of the rainy season in November 2022 and, as of 18 February 2023, nearly 45,000 cases had been reported, including nearly 1,450 deaths. Experts anticipate that, unless urgent, intensified action is taken to scale-up the response, between 64,000 and 100,000 cases could be reported in the next three months.
The UN and its partners in Malawi urgently call on donors to fund the Flash Appeal and enable them to work swiftly in support of the Government-led response to contain the outbreak and prevent further, avoidable, loss of life.

Title: UNITING THE WORLD AGAINST CORRUPTION FOR DEVELOPMENT, PEACE, AND SECURITY
Content: 09 December 2022
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cannot be realised without transparent, accountable, and ethical public institutions.
Lilongwe – 9 December each year marks the commemoration of International Day against corruption. This year’s commemoration marks the twentieth anniversary of the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).
The theme for this year’s commemoration is ‘Uniting the World Against Corruption for Development, Peace and Security’ and is translated locally as ‘Fight Corruption, Protect Malawi’s future.’
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cannot be realised without transparent, accountable, and ethical public institutions. The SDGs make a direct link between the negative impact of corruption on the attainment of peaceful, just, and inclusive societies. SDG 16 and its targets to reduce bribery, strengthen institutions, and increase access to information are not only valuable aspirations, but they are also necessary conditions for the achievement of all 17 goals as reflected in this year’s theme showing the link between anti-corruption and peace, security, and development.
Malawi continues to face significant challenges in many sectors of its development – challenges that threaten its collective prosperity and social cohesion. The plague of corruption is intertwined in most of them. Corruption has negative impacts on every aspect of society and is profoundly intertwined with social and economic development and undermines democratic institutions, the rule of law and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. Thus ‘Fight corruption and Protect Malawi’s future’.
The UN commends the Government of Malawi for prioritising the fight against corruption and drawing attention to the negative impacts of corruption and urges the Government to continue to do more to empower anti-corruption institutions and strengthen accountability, transparency and ethics systems and mechanisms in public institutions.
The UN commends the Anti-Corruption Bureau and its Director-General for bringing renewed drive and energy to the fight against corruption and encourages Malawians to stand and support the ACB to ensure it is successful in the fight against corruption.
The UN also commends civil society, the media, and Malawians for taking an active stand against corruption. Tackling corruption is the right and responsibility of everyone, and only through cooperation and the involvement of each and every person and institution can Malawi overcome the negative impact of corruption.
We all have a role to play in uniting against corruption.

Title: UNHCR urges Malawi authorities to reconsider relocation decision
Content: 28 November 2022
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, deeply regrets the decision taken by the GoM to proceed with the executeion of its directive to relocate refugees living in rural and urban centres back to Dzaleka camp. The refugee agency is urging the authorities to reconsider its decision which will have disastrous consequences on many refugee lives.
Lilongwe, 25 November 2022 - UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, deeply regrets the decision taken by the Malawi government on Thursday 24 November to proceed with the execution of its directive to relocate refugees living in rural and urban centres across the country, back to Dzaleka camp. The refugee agency is urging the authorities to reconsider its decision which will have disastrous consequences on many refugee lives.
Some 8,000 refugees living in rural and urban locations are expected to return to the already congested Dzaleka camp, which presently accommodates 56,425 refugees. Dzaleka was originally established to accommodate up to 12,000 refugees.  Relocating several thousands refugees back to the camp will have dire consequences on the provision of critical basic services such as health services, education, and protection programmes.

“The relocation means that children will have to leave their schools and breadwinners to abandon their employment or small businesses and return to a camp where they will be dependent on humanitarian assistance,” says KOUAME Cyr Modeste, UNHCR’s Representative in Malawi.

UNHCR is also very concerned about the extremely tight deadlines given to refugees for their relocation. Refugees living in rural areas have been given until 30 November 2022 and those living in urban locations until 1 February 2023 to relocate to Dzaleka camp.

While UNHCR applauds the government’s offer of Luwani settlement as an alternative to Dzaleka camp, time and significant financial resources are needed to make it habitable with the installation of basic services such as water, sanitation, repairs to roads and other facilities. UNHCR and its partners are fundraising to develop the settlement even as the refugee agency faces critical funding challenges to its operations globally.

Critical underfunding is already impacting current service provision to refugees and asylum seekers in Malawi. As of 31 October 2022, UNHCR had only received 29 percent of the USD 22.9 million required to adequately support refugees and asylum-seekers this year alone, in Malawi. This has crippled UNHCR’s ability to meet the protection and livelihood needs of the people it serves.

Relocating self-sufficient and productive refugees and asylum-seekers to Dzaleka will not only lead to loss of livelihood but will compel them to rely on humanitarian agencies which are all facing critical funding shortfalls.

Therefore, UNHCR appeals to the Government of Malawi to allow refugee families to remain in rural or urban settings where they can continue their education, be employed and operate their small businesses. Alternatively, UNHCR appeals to the Government for the time required to ensure essential services are in place before relocating refugees to Luwani settlement.

UNHCR appreciates the Government of Malawi’s efforts to ensure the protection, safety and security of all refugees and asylum-seekers.

Title: Achieving an AIDS-free future: African leaders are championing sexuality education at the International AIDS Conference
Content: 01 August 2022
“In sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent girls and young women are three times as likely to acquire HIV as adolescent boys and young men” declared Caroline Ngonze from UNAIDS ‘Education Plus’ initiative.
MONTREAL, Canada, 1 August 2022 — At the 24th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2022) held in Montreal, UNESCO and Frontline AIDS hosted a session where African leaders championed sexuality education and challenged misinformation to work toward an AIDS-free generation. Young advocates, representatives from African governments and CSOs made the case on why Comprehensive Sexuality Education should remain a priority for HIV prevention efforts and health and wellbeing for young people in Sub-Saharan Africa.
“Every week, 4900 girls and women aged 15-24 in Sub-Saharan Africa acquire HIV. Each one of these infections could be prevented if young people had accurate information about how HIV is transmitted, alongside the services they need to make safe and empowered choices” stated Patricia Machawira, Regional Advisor and manager of the programme Our Rights, Our Lives, Our Future for UNESCO.
Comprehensive Sexuality Education is empowering young people around the world to build agency, develop skills, knowledge and attitudes required for preventing HIV, reducing early and unintended pregnancies, and eliminating gender-based violence. It is empowering young people to make informed and safe decisions about their bodies and their lives.
Nyasha, a young advocate called for governments to endorse the ESA commitment, “We can no longer wait, waiting means governments accept that young girls continue to acquire HIV”. Botswana ministry of health representative and South Africa ministry of education representative shared their experience championing CSE as a way to enhance the health and wellbeing of young people and positioned themselves as leaders of the CSE while encouraging other countries to endorse the Eastern and Southern Africa commitment.
The session comes almost a year after the Eastern and Southern Africa ministerial commitment was renewed in December 2021 to continue to advance education and health for the well-being of adolescents and young people. The ESA commitment is a strategic platform that brings together Ministries of Education, Health, Gender and Youth to strengthen Sexual and Reproductive Health and HIV prevention efforts. It is convened by SADC and EAC Secretariats with support from UNESCO, UNFPA, UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNWOMEN, WHO and MIET Africa.
“In sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent girls and young women are three times as likely to acquire HIV as adolescent boys and young men” declared Caroline Ngonze from UNAIDS ‘Education Plus’ initiative. Child marriage, as well as gender-based violence, also remain unacceptably high. 40% of girls and 30% of boys in Eastern and Southern Africa agree that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife.
It is a fact that every child will one day have life-changing decisions to make about their well-being, relationships, families, and life goals. Yet, many grow up not having even the basic knowledge and skills
to make these decisions carefully. Comprehensive Sexuality Education aims to equip children and young people with knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that will empower them to realize their health, well- being and dignity; develop respectful social and sexual relationships; consider how their choices affect their own well-being and that of others; understand and protect their rights throughout their lives.
An AIDS-free generation is within reach, the time to act is now!

Press Release
UN Headquarters will observe the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on Thursday, 26 May 2022. Secretary-General António Guterres will lay a wreath to honour the nearly 4,200 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948 and will preside over a ceremony at which the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal will be awarded posthumously to 117 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their life serving under the UN flag last year.
Among the peacekeepers to be honoured posthumously are three from Malawi who served with the UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO):  WO1 Mcdonald Kufa Kangoni, Private Chitenji Kamanga, and Corporal Maxwell Nyirenda.
Malawi is the 30th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys 771 military and police personnel to the UN operations in Abyei, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, South Sudan and Western Sahara.
During a special ceremony, the Secretary-General will award the “Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage” posthumously to Captain Abdelrazakh Hamit Bahar of Chad, who served with the United Nations Integrated Multidimensional Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). The medal is named for a Senegalese peacekeeper who was killed in Rwanda in 1994 after saving countless civilian lives. This is the second time the medal has been awarded since the inaugural medal was presented to Captain Diagne's family in his honour in 2016.
The Secretary-General will also award the ‘2021 Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award’ to Major Winnet Zharare, a Zimbabwean military observer, who served with the UN Mission in South Sudan. Created in 2016, the Award “recognises the dedication and effort of an individual peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.”
In his message, the Secretary-General said: “Today, we honour the more than one million women and men who have served as UN peacekeepers since 1948. We pay tribute to the nearly 4,200 heroes and heroines who sacrificed their lives in the cause of peace. And we are reminded of an age-old truth: peace can never be taken for granted. Peace is the prize. We are deeply grateful to the 87,000 civilian, police and military personnel now serving under the UN flag who are helping to realize the prize of peace worldwide.”
The theme for this year’s observance is “People. Peace. Progress. The Power of Partnerships.”  According to the Secretary-General, “Around the globe, UN peacekeepers work with Member States, civil society, humanitarians, the media, the communities they serve and many others, to foster peace, protect civilians, promote human rights and the rule of law, and improve the lives of millions of people.”
Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said: “Every day, UN peacekeepers work to protect vulnerable people in the world’s most fragile political and security situations. The dangers they face are greater than ever, with increasing global tensions, ever-more complex threats from terrorist attacks to organized crime and the use of Improvised Explosive Devices as well as a surge in mis and disinformation targeting our missions and the communities we serve. Despite these challenges, peacekeepers persevere alongside our many partners in the collective pursuit of peace. Today, we thank them for their tremendous contribution and remember with great sorrow our colleagues who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving the cause of peace.”
The International Day of UN Peacekeepers was established by the General Assembly in 2002, to pay tribute to all men and women serving in peacekeeping, and to honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace. The General Assembly designated 29 May as the International Day of UN Peacekeepers in commemoration of the day in 1948 when the UN’s first peacekeeping mission, the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), began operations in Palestine. Since then, more than one million women and men have served in 72 UN peacekeeping operations.

Title: Malawi launches Education Plus Initiative at the High-level Intergenerational Dialogue on Generation Equality and Women’s Leadership
Content: 07 April 2022
This week at the high-level intergenerational dialogue on generation equality and women’s leadership, the Malawi Government will join the United Nations to launch the Education Plus Initiative in Malawi in line with the continental efforts.

PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT
Malawi launches Education Plus Initiative at the High-level Intergenerational Dialogue on Generation Equality and Women’s Leadership.
WHEN:          Friday, 8th April 2022.  9:00 am
WHERE:       Bingu International Conference Center (BICC), Lilongwe, Malawi.
WHY: Adolescent girls and young women in Malawi continue to experience multiple marginalizations, face unequal gender power dynamics and remain at a greater risk of acquiring HIV. They are 2.5 times more likely than their male peers to acquire HIV, and more than 51% of new HIV infections in the country are among this group.
Despite progress over the years, only 27% of girls enrol in secondary school, only 13% will attend, and less than 5% will complete secondary education.  The country still has a high rate of teenage pregnancy – 29% of adolescent girls aged 15–19 are already mothers or pregnant with their first child and the proportion keeps increasing. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has compounded these vulnerabilities and calls for a renewed comprehensive response and action to guarantee girls’ and young women's health and education rights today. Adolescent girls in Malawi are especially at risk of never returning to school, and digital divides bar many from remote learning.
The pandemic has heightened the risk and vulnerability to gender-based violence, child marriage, maternal mortality, unintended pregnancy, HIV and other sexual and reproductive health consequences. One in five girls has been sexually abused before they reach 18 years.
Adolescent girls and young women also shoulder the burdens of unpaid care and domestic work, further reducing their chances of ever returning to school. There are limited opportunities for skilling for the many who are out of school. The loss of livelihoods over the last two years threatens to entrench and trap millions in cycles of poverty and extreme vulnerabilities.
Malawi is not alone; many countries in sub-Saharan Africa are disproportionately affected by the AIDS epidemic. Every week, approximately 4 200 adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa acquire HIV. In 2020, five in six adolescents aged between 15-19 newly acquiring HIV in the region were girls. And an estimated 23 300 adolescent girls and young women died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2020, making it the second leading cause of death of adolescent girls and young women after maternal mortality.
Evidence shows that education provides protective advantage for girls in reducing their risk of HIV infection. Completion of secondary education by adolescent girls has reduced HIV infection by up to one-half in some countries. In response, five UN agencies - UNAIDS, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF and UN Women - launched the Education Plus initiative at the Generation Equality Forum in 2021.
WHAT: This week at the high-level intergenerational dialogue on generation equality and women’s leadership, the Malawi Government will join the United Nations to launch the Education Plus Initiative in Malawi in line with the continental efforts.
The new five-year game-changing initiative calls for political action and leadership to step-up policies and investments that work best for adolescent girls’ and young women’s agency and for countries’ growth and prosperity. Through the initiative, government leaders, development partners, civil society, community and young women leaders are coming together in a renewed push for free access to quality secondary education for all girls and boys by 2025 while providing a Plus package to protect health rights and deliver on gender equality and the empowerment of girls and young women in Africa.
In addition to universal secondary education, the initiative calls for universal access to comprehensive sexuality education; fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and rights; freedom from gender-based and sexual violence; school-to-work transitions, and economic security and empowerment.

Title: Humanitarian partners seek $29.4 million to assist people hardest hit by Tropical Storm Ana in Malawi in support of the Government-led response
Content: 04 March 2022
The Flash Appeal brings together the most time-sensitive and critical response activities of 44 partners
(Lilongwe, 4 March 2022) - Humanitarian partners in Malawi have launched a Flash Appeal that urgently seeks US$29.4 million to provide vital assistance to 542,000 people who have been hardest hit by Tropical Storm Ana for the next three months, in support of the Government-led relief efforts.
Tropical Storm Ana passed through many districts in southern Malawi in late January 2022, leaving behind devastation and destruction. Over 990,000 people were affected by the storm, according to Government figures. The Flash Appeal focuses on the six hardest-hit districts of Chikwawa, Nsanje, Phalombe, Mulanje, Chiradzulu and Balaka, where an estimated 680,000 people are in need of life-saving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance and protection.
The Flash Appeal brings together the most time-sensitive and critical response activities of 44 partners—the Malawi Red Cross, seven national NGOs, 26 international NGOs and 10 UN agencies—and all of the work carried out under the appeal will directly complement the Government of Malawi’s ongoing relief efforts.
“We have worked hard to ensure that this appeal is prioritized and principled, and we are confident that the activities planned are those that are most urgently needed to deliver immediate relief to the people who need it most,” said the UN Resident Coordinator a.i., Shigeki Komatsubara.
“While we are conscious that humanitarian support is not a long-term solution to the recurrent climatic shocks that continue to increase in frequency and intensity in Malawi, we are faced today with an urgent need to act swiftly to save the lives and livelihoods of those whose homes and crops have been upended by Tropical Storm Ana,” he added.
Expressing appreciation for the solidarity already shown by the international community in response to Tropical Storm Ana—including the $3 million allocated by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support urgent humanitarian actions—the UN Resident Coordinator a.i. called for further support to the people of Malawi at this extremely challenging time.

Title: Norwegian Minister Tvinnereim and IFAD President Houngbo visit Malawi in wake of storms to discuss climate resilience and hunger
Content: 25 February 2022
“My urgent call is to step up investments in adaptation and resilience to ensure that climate change does not deepen hunger and poverty,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD, ahead of the visit.
Rome, 25 February 2022 – With Malawian farmers still reeling from tropical storms that devastated crops and livelihoods in recent weeks, Norway’s Minister of International Development and the President of the UN’s International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) will visit the country to meet its leaders and small-scale farmers to discuss the impacts of climate change, and ways to build resilience.
“Extreme weather events have increased globally and have recently wreaked destruction in Malawi – and it is the small-scale farmers who are feeling the brunt of it.  My urgent call is to step up investments in adaptation and resilience to ensure that climate change does not deepen hunger and poverty,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD, ahead of the visit.
“Food security is a main priority in Norway’s development policy because it is essential to fight inequality, poverty and hunger,” said Anne Beathe Tvinnereim, Norway’s Minister of International Development. “IFAD’s projects and programmes enable small-scale farmers and fishermen to produce enough, safe and healthy food in climate-smart ways. Therefore, I am looking forward to a joint field visit with President Gilbert Houngbo to IFAD projects in Malawi. Norway will strengthen our partnership with IFAD and will top-up our core contribution significantly for 2022-24.”
Arriving on 27 February for a three-day visit, Tvinnereim and Houngbo will meet with Malawi’s President Lazarus Chakwera, the Minister of Agriculture, Lobin Lowe, and the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, Sosten Alfred Gwengwe, to discuss investments in climate change resilience to achieve zero hunger and poverty targets in the country by 2030.
They will then travel to an IFAD-supported project to discuss the challenges of climate change and COVID-19 directly with small-scale farmers, particularly women, to see how targeted investments have built their resilience and boosted their food security, nutrition and gender equality. While in the country, they will also meet Rudolf Schwenk, United Nations Resident Coordinator (ad interim), the United Nations Country team, development partners and Farmers’ Organizations representatives working in Malawi.
Malawi is a relatively small country with an estimated population of about 19 million people, 83 percent of whom live in rural areas. Agriculture remains the backbone of the economy, accounting for almost a quarter of Malawi’s GDP. However, many small-scale farmers battle to earn a decent living, with 70 percent of the country’s population living below the poverty line of US$1.90 per day.
With improved processing technologies and farming methods, small-scale farmers can feed a growing population while restoring degraded ecosystems and reducing agriculture's carbon footprint. When they have access to weather forecasting information and disaster preparedness, they are more resilient to severe climate events, such as the tropical storms that resulted in a declaration of a state of emergency in the country last month. This requires increased investments in small-scale farmers, who are often the poorest and most marginalized rural people.
Since 1981, IFAD has financed 14 rural development programmes and projects in Malawi at a total cost of $653.67 million, with an IFAD investment of US$ 350.48 million. This has directly benefited more than 2 million rural households.

Press Statement on COVID-19 Situation Update as of 16 December 2021
GOVERNMENT OF MALAWI
PRESS STATEMENT
COVID-19 SITUATION UPDATE AS OF 16 TH DECEMBER 2021
In the past 24 hours, Malawi has registered 475 new COVID-19 cases, 40 new recoveries and one new death. 458 of the new cases are locally transmitted; 205 from Lilongwe, 130 from Blantyre, 55 from Mzimba North, 16 from Salima, 10 from Zomba, eight from Mzimba South, seven from Rumphi, four from Neno, three each from Dowa, Nkhata Bay and Thyolo, two each from Balaka, Mangochi, Mchinji, and Nkhotakota, and one each from Dedza, Karonga, Machinga, Mulanje, Mwanza and Phalombe districts. 17 of the new cases are imported; 12 identified at Mwanza border and their destination districts are still under investigation, three from Lilongwe, and two from Machinga districts. The new death is from Blantyre and was not vaccinated.
Cumulatively, Malawi has recorded 63,408 cases including 2,311 deaths (Case Fatality Rate is at 3.64%). Of these cases, 2,759 are imported infections and 60,649 are locally transmitted. Cumulatively, 59,040 cases have now recovered (recovery rate of 93.11%) and 232 were lost to follow-up. This brings the total number of active cases to 1,825. In the past 24 hours, there were two new admissions and six new discharges in the treatment units. Currently, 12 active cases are currently hospitalised; four from Blantyre, three in Lilongwe, two in Mzimba North, and one each in Zomba and Phalombe districts. The new admissions are not vaccinated.
On testing, in the past 24 hours, 1,773 COVID-19 tests were conducted. Of these, 1,040 tests were through SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Diagnostic test while the rest were through RT-PCR test. The positive cases out of the total number tested (past 24 hours) translates to a positivity rate of 26.79% and the weekly positivity rate (seven days moving average) is at 15.2%. Cumulatively, 456,392 tests have been conducted in the country so far. On COVID-19 vaccination, a total of 1,600,509 vaccine doses have been administered in the country so far. Cumulatively 956,800 and 359,868 people have received the first dose and second dose of AstraZeneca vaccine respectively whilst 283,841 have received Johnson and Johnson. Over the past 24 hours, 10,109 and 2,913 people have received first dose and second of AstraZeneca vaccine respectively. Cumulatively, 643,709 people are fully vaccinated.
Let me now inform fellow Malawians that due to the progressive increase of cases observed in the country, the Presidential Task Force on Coronavirus, in collaboration with the Emergency Operation Centre on COVID-19 (EOC) has now indicated that the country is now in Level 2 of the pandemic. This calls for stepping up the recommended preventive measures including use of face masks in open places, observance of social distance, frequent washing of hands and use of sanitizers. And as we are going into the Christmas festive season where different groups gather to share some quality moments, the Presidential Task Force has also revised guidelines for public gatherings as follows:
Please take note that where necessary, an enforcement officer may order a gathering to disperse and may use reasonable force to cause the gathering to disperse. May I call upon all Malawians to adhere to the guidelines on public gatherings to reduce and stop the current rapid transmission of the virus within our communities.
No one is safe until everyone else is safe. Get Fully Vaccinated! Wear Face Mask! Protect yourself. Protect your loved ones. Protect everyone.

Title: Malawi marks 2021 International Volunteer Day with first country launch of the fourth United Nations State of the World’s Volunteerism Report
Content: 07 December 2021
In Malawi, the ArtGlo initiative, showcased in the Report, illustrates how young people living with HIV collaborate with state authorities and use art to sensitize public officials to the health issues they are facing.
Lilongwe: The fourth State of the World’s Volunteerism Report (SWVR) ‘Building equal and inclusive societies’ presents new evidence on volunteer–state partnerships. The flagship Report of the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme was launched in Malawi today to mark the International Volunteer Day. This was the first country-level launch of the Report following a global launch at the United Nations (UN) headquarters in New York on 2 December 2021.
The Report reveals that cooperation between volunteers and governments helps build collaborative decision-making.
Increasing inequalities worldwide call for a new type of social contract with a renewed emphasis on inclusion. It is time for a global reset. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres has spelled out the need for a New Social Contract that creates equal opportunities and respect the rights and freedoms of all.1
Every seventh person in the world is a volunteer. Despite the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic, global interest in volunteering has not waned, and volunteering in communities has endured despite limited mobility and resources. While restrictions have prevented many people from volunteering in person, many have switched to volunteering online.
The Report draws on case study research from several countries, including Malawi, and concludes that, the monthly number of volunteers aged 15 years and older amounts to over 850 million worldwide. And the average monthly volunteer rate – defined as the share of working-age persons (15 years or older) that volunteer in a month – amounts to almost 15%.
“In Malawi, the ArtGlo initiative, showcased in the Report, illustrates how young people living with HIV collaborate with state authorities and use art to sensitize public officials to the health issues they are facing. In so doing, youth volunteers help shape health priorities. By serving as mediators between communities and state authorities, they act as bridge-builders,” said Kyoko Yokosuka, UNV Deputy Executive Coordinator while launching the Report.
This research comes at a crucial moment as countries start to build forward from the pandemic and institutions need to engage volunteers as key partners.
“We do dramas and songs which helps people from our communities understand the dangers of violence,” a young volunteer from ArtGlo initiative in Malawi said in the Report.
The Report identifies three models to highlight volunteer-state relationships – deliberative governance, co-production of services and  social innovation – and offers policy recommendations. Decision makers are encouraged to:

Title: ILO, MCTU partner for trade union action to accelerate elimination of child labour
Content: 01 December 2021
International Labour Organization (ILO) and Malawi Congress of Trade Unions partner for trade union action to accelerate the elimination of child labour
Lilongwe: The International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU) have entered into a new partnership to strengthen trade union action in the fight against child labour in Malawi, with a focus on tea and coffee supply chains in the country’s Chitipa, Mulanje, Mzimba, Ntchisi, and Thyolo districts. The partnership, which is valued at almost MWK 170 million (equivalent to more than USD $200,000) has been established under the ILO’s ‘Accelerating action for the elimination of child labour in supply chains in Africa’ (ACCEL Africa) project which is funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The Netherlands.
“MCTU’s strategic vision is of a society where workers enjoy their rights, have access to social justice and equality and where conditions of work help to eradicate poverty and vulnerability. As MCTU, we look forward to leveraging this partnership to further enhance our ongoing efforts to build the capacity of our affiliated trade unions, especially those representing workers in the formal and informal sectors, as well as smallholder trusts, associations, and cooperatives, in the targeted tea and coffee-growing communities to identify and address child labour and its root causes. We will do this through sensitisation and awareness-raising campaigns for workers as well as by providing support to trade unions for effective social dialogue and collective bargaining with employers to reach and sign agreements that protect children from child labour and ensure decent working conditions for parents and caregivers”, said MCTU Secretary General Mr. Madalitso Njolomole.
“This new partnership will also allow us as MCTU to better support organisation and unionisation of estate, plantation, and informal sector workers in tea and coffee growing areas into trade unions. In addition, the partnership will see MCTU scaling-up our work advocating and lobbying for stronger laws, policies and regulations relating to child labour, such as the long-pending draft National Child Labour Policy, and for their effective implementation and enforcement. At the same time, the partnership will see MCTU continue calling for ratification by Malawi of important international labour standards, especially the ILO Violence and Harassment Convention, which recognizes the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including gender-based forms”, emphasized Mr. Njolomole.
“As the ILO, we recognize that trade unions have unique and vital roles to play in the fight against child labour, including through campaigning for the ratification and effective implementation of international labour standards through strong laws and policies. Trade unions can also bargain with employers collectively on behalf of workers for improved working conditions for adult workers, reducing the incentive for families to resort to child labour. Trade unions can also contribute to ending child labour by influencing national socio-economic policies for decent work through effective engagement with government and by participating in international campaigns against child labour, such as Alliance 8.7, World Day Against Child Labour, and the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour”, said Mr. George Okutho, the Director of the ILO Country Office for Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) brings together governments, employers and workers of 187 countries to set labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes promoting decent work for all women and men. Malawi has been a member of the ILO since 1965.
The Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU) is Malawi’s national trade union federation. Founded in 1995, MCTU has a paid-up membership of approximately 150,000 workers and has 26 trade union affiliates. MCTU is affiliated to the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and the Southern Africa Trade Union Coordination Council (SATUCC). MCTU has contributed to the implementation of several ILO child labour projects over many years.

Title: World Aids Day Message from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
Content: 01 December 2021
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL MESSAGE ON WORLD AIDS DAY

On this World AIDS Day, we focus attention on the inequalities that drive HIV and AIDS.
It is still possible to end the epidemic by 2030.  But that will require stepped up action and greater solidarity.
The United Nations General Assembly recently adopted a bold new plan to accelerate progress, including new targets for 2025.
To beat AIDS – and build resilience against the pandemics of tomorrow – we need collective action.
That includes harnessing the leadership of communities to drive change, combatting stigma, and eliminating discriminatory and punitive laws, policies and practices.
We must also dismantle financial barriers to health care and increase investment in vital public services to achieve Universal Health Coverage for everyone, everywhere.
This will ensure equal access to HIV prevention, testing, treatment and care, including COVID-19 vaccinations and services.
Together, let us recommit to end inequalities and end AIDS.

Title: Situation of the Coronavirus Pandemic in the Country and Review of Rules and Guidelines in the Context of Evolving Regional and Global Situations
Content: 29 November 2021
The Taskforce has resolved to tighten some of the preventive measures in line with the level of the epidemic at which we are.
The Presidential Task Force on Coronavirus through the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre on COVID-19 (EOC) has been closely monitoring the trend of the pandemic in our country, in the region and in the world.
Our current statistics indicate that we have remained at level 1 of the pandemic, as defined in the Public Health (Corona Virus and COVID-19) (Prevention, Containment and Management) (Amendment) (No3) Rules, 2021, since the first week of October 2021. We believe these positive strides in our country are a result of our collective efforts to implement proven pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions since the first cases were reported in April 2020.
I would therefore like to sincerely thank all citizens and inhabitants that continue to comply with the recommended interventions and measures, in particular, use of face masks in public places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water, or use of alcohol based sanitizers, keeping social distance, avoiding crowded places, and most importantly, getting vaccinated against COVID-19 for those that are eligible.
I am pleased to report too that there has been corresponding low levels of cases and deaths in our neighbouring countries, and region, until lately, reducing the threat of imported cases. I can only ask fellow Malawians and all inhabitants to be even more vigilant in observing the recommended rules and regulations as announced at the last press statement of the Taskforce. I can confirm that these rules and guidelines remain in force.
Fellow Malawians, the favourable internal outlook notwithstanding, we have become aware of reports of increasing COVID-19 cases and deaths in some regions of the world, notably in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and in the last week, in parts of the Republic of South Africa.
In addition, as reported by the Secretary for Health on Friday 26 November, there is a new SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) variant of concern in the world, christened Omicron by the World Health Organisation, that has been identified in some Southern African countries including South Africa and Botswana. The variant has many mutations and is therefore expected to show increased ability to cause severe disease, re-infection and possible vaccine resistance compared to other variants of concern.
In line with its mandate, and in light of these developments, The Presidential Taskforce on Coronavirus met on Friday 26th November 2021 to review the status of the pandemic and the adequacy of the measures that are currently in place. The Taskforce has resolved to tighten some of the preventive measures in line with the level of the epidemic at which we are.
Therefore, by the powers invested in me through the Public Health (Corona Virus and COVID-19) (Prevention, Containment and Management) (Amendment) (No3) Rules, 2021; I hereby announce the following new or additional measures within the level 1 status that we are at.
B.1 Requirement for entry into Malawi
In addition to a negative PCR based COVID-19 Certificate that is no older than 72 hours at time of arrival:
B. 2 Adjusted COVID-19 Vaccination age limits
Current vaccination age eligibility policy in the country is for those aged 18 years and above.
Informed by growing international evidence and practice, and advice from local Immunization Experts Group, age eligibility for use of Pfeizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine is hereby extended to cover all those aged 12 years and above. But let me stress, this extension is only for Pfeizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine for the time being, until further expert advice is available and announced regarding other vaccines.
B. 3 Timeframe for the new measures
All these new measures will remain in force until 31 December 2021, or as may be further advised, as the situations may dictate.
I wish to call upon all relevant government ministries and department responsible for the areas concerned in implementing the new and additional matures, to facilitate with minimum delay the operationalization of the new measures accordingly. Meanwhile, the taskforce will continue to monitor the situation of the pandemic in the country, and the evolving broader global and regional trends, and make necessary further recommendations to contain the pandemic in the country as the situations will demand.
No one is safe until everyone else is safe. Get Fully Vaccinated! Wear Face Mask! Wash your hands frequently, avoid crowded places, and observe social distancing. Protect yourself. Protect your loved ones. Protect everyone.

Title: On violence against women and girls, right policies and programmes bring results
Content: 25 November 2021
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL VIDEO MESSAGE MARKING THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Violence against women and girls continues to be the most pervasive and pressing human rights issue in the world today.
It is both an abhorrent crime and a public health emergency, with far-reaching consequences for millions of women and girls in every corner of the globe.
The latest figures from UN Women confirm that during the COVID-19 pandemic, levels of violence against women and girls have increased.
Across 13 countries, almost half of all women reported that they or a woman they know began to experience gender-based violence during the pandemic.
Almost a quarter of women reported that household conflicts had become more frequent. A similar proportion said they felt less safe at home.
Violence in any part of society affects us all. From the scars on the next generation to the weakening of the social fabric.
We can draw a straight line between violence against women, civil oppression and violent conflict. From rape and sexual slavery used as tools of war, to the thread of misogyny that runs through violent extremism.
But violence against women is not inevitable. The right policies and programmes bring results.
That means comprehensive, long-term strategies that tackle the root causes of violence, protect the rights of women and girls, and promote strong and autonomous women’s rights movements.
This is the model that the United Nations has built through its partnership with the European Union, the Spotlight Initiative.
Last year, in partner countries, we saw a 22 percent increase in prosecution of perpetrators. Eighty-four laws and policies were passed or strengthened. And more than 650,000 women and girls were able to access gender-based violence services, despite restrictions related to the pandemic.
Change is possible.
Now is the time to redouble our efforts so that together, we can eliminate violence against women and girls by 2030.

Title: UN Resident Coordinator Maria Jose Torres completes tour of duty in Malawi
Content: 12 November 2021
“With stronger determination, commitment, concerted efforts, and a whole-of-society approach, it is possible to achieve the SDGs in Malawi," said Torres.
The United Nations Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres, has completed her tour of duty in Malawi after almost four years of leading the UN System in support of efforts to achieve national development priorities and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the country.
Torres started her mission in January 2018 and her last day of work in Malawi is 12th November 2021. She expressed gratitude for the great cooperation between the Government of Malawi and the UN System that has resulted in multiple areas of work where results are visible from food security, disaster response, COVID-19 response, climate action to elections, gender equality, girls’ education, human rights, and the governance agenda, to mention a few.
“I am delighted to see Malawi’s vision to become a middle-income country by 2063 and the robust partnerships created with the national institutions, the civil society and the Development Partners,” said Torres. “The UN is fully engaged to ensure we leave no one behind in accelerating efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Malawi.”
She said enhancing multisectoral approaches in line with the recently launched Malawi 2063 First 10-Year Implementation Plan (MIP-1) would be essential to undertake transformative initiatives and consolidate gains on climate action, agro-industry transformation, urbanization and pushing for the digital agenda.
“In this regard, strong and dedicated investments in human capital development, particularly on women and youth empowerment, the public sector reforms, and the creation of an enabling environment to expand private sector investment, are key to success.
“With stronger determination, commitment, concerted efforts, and a whole-of-society approach, it is possible to achieve the SDGs in Malawi. It will take everyone’s contribution,” said Torres.
She also thanked Development Partners for the support they have rendered to the UN System and for their strategic engagement over the four years.

Title: Statement by Minister of Health announcing change from Level 2 to 1 on COVID Response on 8 Oct 2021
Content: 08 October 2021
It is worth pointing out that there is also a corresponding decline in the level of the epidemic in our neighboring countries and in the rest of the region
Good Afternoon, and welcome to this press conference that has been called to update you members of the press, and all Malawians, on the status of the corona virus pandemic in the country, and the steps that have been agreed upon by the taskforce at its recent meeting.
As has been communicated several times before, the Presidential Task Force on Coronavirus, working with the Emergency Operation Centre on COVID-19 (EOC), continues to closely monitor the trend of the pandemic in the country. And available data indicates that since the end of August, we continue to observe a downward trend in the number of new COVD-19 cases, those admitted to treatment units, those passing away from the disease and the proportion of those testing positive for the virus, the positivity rate.
On COVID-19 statistics, as of 7th October 2021, Malawi has recorded a total of 61,648 cases including 2,287 deaths, giving us a Case Fatality Ratio of 3.71%. Of these cases, 58,992 (95.7%) were locally transmitted. Cumulatively, 56,208 cases have now recovered (recovery rate of 91.2%).
Currently, there are 2,921 active cases, 15 of which are hospitalized in our treatment units across the country. Let me point out at this stage that we are observing that the majority of those with severe disease and those dying from COVID-19 are not vaccinated. The country has been recording a positivity rate of below 10% since 28th August and less than 5% from 20thSeptember to date, and the seven-day moving average is at 2% as of 7thOctober 2021.
It is worth pointing out that there is also a corresponding decline in the level of the epidemic in our neighboring countries and in the rest of the region.
Regarding COVID-19 vaccines, as of 7th October 2021, a total of 1,092,540 vaccine doses had been administered in the country and cumulatively, 503,916 people were fully vaccinated.
I have therefore called this press conference to announce that on the basis of the available data, we are now at level 1 of the Coronavirus pandemic in the country as classified in the Public Health (Corona Virus and COVID-19) (Prevention, Containment and Management) (Amendment) (No3) Rules, 2021.
This is good news, and the positive strides can be attributed to the collaborative efforts of all Malawians towards the fight.
Distinguished members of the press, Ladies and Gentlemen, at this level, just like at all other levels, there are a number of measures that are supposed to be observed and reinforced. And I call upon all of you in the media to help communicate these measures to the public so that we can continue to keep the pandemic in check.
I must emphasize that our behaviours in the COVID-19 fight are key to success or failure, as we have observed that as more people relax in adhering to the recommended preventive and containment measures, such as travel, failure to mask and to adhere to physical distancing policies, the more we have been recording an increased number of new cases, those admitted in treatment units and those dying from the disease. And this has been true during the past three waves of the pandemic in our country. Now that the cases are declining, we need to continue to adhere to the preventive and containment measures in order to reduce further and stop the spread of the virus amidst us to avoid further disruptions to our social and economic lives due to the pandemic.
At a general level, we need to strictly adhere to the  proper wearing  of masks, observing physical/social distancing and stepping up our handwashing practices and getting vaccinated for those that are aged 18 years and above. The vaccine, let me emphasize, is the best tool we have to help in reducing the risk of developing severe disease, risk of hospitalization and deaths due to COVID-19 while the other preventive measures will help to prevent spread of, and contracting the virus. Let me inform the nation that we have adequate stocks of COVID-19 vaccines in all our vaccination sites and let me appeal to those that have received a single dose of AstraZeneca and are due for the second dose to get their second dose so that they are fully vaccinated, and those that have never received any COVID-19 vaccine to utilize the opportunity to go get vaccinated.
At this juncture, members of the press, Ladies and Gentlemen, let me inform the nation that having moved to level 1 of the pandemic, as measured by the steadily declining COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country, in addition to the general public health measures which must be strictly observed and enforced, the following specific guidelines will apply:
Members of the Press, Ladies and Gentlemen, in closing, I would like to emphasize the need for all of us to strictly adhere to the prescribed level 1 measures as these will help to suppress and stop
the further transmission of the virus in our country. The easing of the restrictions should not cause us to relax as the risk of the virus spreading among us remains high as long as most Malawians are not vaccinated. Failing to strictly adhere to these measures that have been put in place will result in resurgences of the cases and this will lead to stricter measures to be instituted. Let us work hard collectively to ensure that we reduce the new confirmed cases further, and get our social and economic lives back to normal.
Thank you so much for your attention.

Background
Peace is at the heart of sustainable development. A peaceful environment is important for development. When there is no peace, business and development operations are disrupted while social problems such as poverty, hunger and inequality are worsened.
Peace is not just the absence of war. True and lasting peace goes together with justice, equality, dignity, inclusiveness, human rights, and freedoms for all people. Treatment of all humans as equals regardless of race, gender, beliefs, age, geography, or any other status is a key foundation of peace.

Title: ILO, TUM partner to eliminate child labour through school improvements and access to education
Content: 01 October 2021
The project aims at accelerating the elimination of child labour in global supply chains in Africa.
Lilongwe, 1st October 2021 – The International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Teachers Union of Malawi (TUM) have entered into a new partnership to accelerate the fight against child labour in Malawi through school improvements and better access to education. The partnership, valued at more than MWK 150 million (circa. USD 185,000), has been established under the ILO ‘ACCEL Africa’ project, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The Netherlands. The project aims at accelerating the elimination of child labour in global supply chains in Africa. The new partnership provides for ILO technical and financial support to TUM for school improvements and better access to education for child labourers and children at risk of child labour in tea and coffee growing communities in five districts in the country, namely Chitipa, Mulanje, Mzimba, Ntchisi and Thyolo.
“This partnership comes at a critical time, as COVID-19 has contributed to rising rates of school dropouts, including because of the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic, as well as periodic school closures. Some of the children who have dropped out of school as a result have become involved in child labour. As TUM, this is something that gravely concerns us. Indeed, the TUM Statement of Professional Ethics and Code of Conduct for Teachers identifies child labour as a crosscutting issue that our organization needs to play a role in addressing,” said Mr. Charles Kumchenga, the Secretary-General of TUM.
“Through this new partnership, the International Labour Organization will provide technical and financial support to the Teachers Union of Malawi to implement innovative solutions to address child labour, including rollout of the ILO’s Supporting Children’s Rights through Education the Arts and the Media (SCREAM) programme in 20 primary schools in the five targeted districts. The partnership will also enable TUM to support access to education for at least 1,000 child labourers and children at risk of child labour,” said Mr. George Okutho, the Director of the ILO Country Office for Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) brings together governments, employers and workers of 187 countries to set labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes promoting decent work for all women and men. Malawi has been a member of the ILO since 1965. The Teachers Union of Malawi (TUM) represents and aims to unite all teachers in Malawi, and is an affiliate of the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU).

Title: Recovering with lasting peace
Content: 21 September 2021
Homes, schools, workplaces, and communities should be safe spaces for everyone – both physically and emotionally.
Every year, September 21 is International Day of Peace – a day devoted to promoting peace. This year, as we continue to heal from Covid-19, the day offers an opportunity to think creatively and collectively about how to help everyone recover better, how to build resilience to shocks, and how to transform our world into one that is more equal, just, equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and healthier.
For decades, peace and stability have been key cornerstones of Malawi’s development. The Malawi Vision 2063 further recognises that sustainable development will not happen without peace, and expresses an aspiration to maintain a peaceful Malawi that attracts and retains investors; provides access to justice and effective remedies; and ensures efficient, effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. This demonstrates that peace is one pre-condition for Malawi’s prosperity.
As we commemorate the International Day of Peace, we must not only stop conflicts and violence, but increase our commitment to address their root causes to recover better from Covid-19 and build lasting peace.
In line with this year’s theme for the day, ‘Recovering better for an equitable and sustainable world’, this is the time for everyone to promote peace with one another, in families, in communities, across the nation and beyond, and with the planet.
Covid-19 has hit the underprivileged and marginalized the hardest, with girls and women being among the most affected. To recover with lasting peace, we must sustain efforts to keep girls and women free from all forms of violence through community-led actions such as those fighting gender-based violence, ending child marriages, and promoting access to protection and justice services.
Homes, schools, workplaces, and communities should be safe and peaceful spaces for everyone – both physically and emotionally. No one should live with fear of persecution or abuse – both offline and online. Making our spaces safe and peaceful for everyone creates conditions for all of us to prosper together and allows the vulnerable people to realize their human rights.
In Malawi, persons with albinism continue to face multiple threats to their lives. All of us should stand strong in solidarity with persons with albinism, contribute to eradicating all forms of discrimination and violence they face, and promote their equal access to socio-economic opportunities.
Sustainable recovery also means making peace with the planet. While the world is still reeling from the effects of Covid-19, climate change is not on pause. What we need is a green and sustainable economy that produces jobs, reduces emissions, and builds resilience to climate change impacts in order to build lasting peace.
It is pleasing to note that, in the lead up to the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), Malawi held a National Green Climate Conference in August this year. The conference generated concrete proposals for boosting climate change mitigation and adaptation in Malawi, including by creating a green economy, easing pressure on natural resources, and increasing women participation through a Women Network in Climate Action launched at the conference. At the conference, President Lazarus Chakwera called on all players to rally together and be part of Malawi’s ambitious climate action.
An important opportunity also exists in the ongoing process to establish the Malawi Peace Commission, whose mandate will be to implement the peace policy – a framework for peacebuilding and conflict transformation that fosters collaborative partnerships between the government, civil society, and different actors for sustainable peace in the country. The commission should become a robust and ineradicable fabric of the Malawian society.
Finally, as we recover from Covid-19 and celebrate peace, let us all stand up against acts of hate online and offline. Let’s spread compassion, kindness, and hope in the face of Covid-19. We are all confronting a common enemy to humankind.
We are not each one’s enemy. Differences in ideas, tribe, race, religion, gender, or any other characteristic, should not result into discrimination, exclusion, abuse, violence, or conflict. We must thrive together in diversity – a key element of a functioning democracy.

Title: UN launches the first regional online portal to bring together all African countries with data and evidence on sustainable development
Content: 13 September 2021
The new data portal looks into the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and breaks them down into their 169 targets and 231 indicators.
Addis Ababa, 13 September 2021 – Measuring and evaluating progress on the Sustainable Development Goals in Africa became much easier as a group of regional UN entities launched the first online data portal that brings together statistical data harvested across all countries on the continent.
Today, 17 regional UN entities, under the Africa Regional Collaborative Platform (RCP), unveiled the Africa UN Data for Development Platform. This is the first platform to serve as a one-stop-shop repository that captures high-quality data and evidence on the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs from all the African countries. It is also the first of its kind to raise the profile of statistical progress toward the African Union vision – Agenda 2063.
“With barely nine years left to achieve the SDGs, making use of common and harmonized data is essential to accelerate progress. The launch of this new platform marks a milestone in actions towards the Agenda 2030 and the African Union 2063 Agenda. Reliable and collective data will allow all actors to make the best possible evidence-based policy action to accelerate the SDGs, strengthen collaboration, avoid unnecessary duplication and make sure that we can address gaps, really leaving no one behind,” said Assistant Secretary-General Ahunna Eziakonwa, Director of the Regional Bureau for Africa at the UN Development Programme, who also serves as Vice-Chair of the Africa RCP, at the virtual launch event.
The new data portal looks into the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and breaks them down into their 169 targets and 231 indicators, allowing everyone to track progress at the granular level. It is open to all users, including policymakers, planners, programme managers, development partners, private sector organizations, civil society groups, academic institutions, researchers, students, media outlets and many others.
According to the statisticians at the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), among the 169 targets set out in the SDGs, only 30 percent of them are quantifiable. For the rest of the unquantifiable targets, the online platform goes ahead to propose target values by using a pragmatic and ambitious approach. It identifies the region’s outstanding countries and sets their average rate of change as the region’s target rate.
“Presenting comprehensive, practical data sets will especially help us, government civil servants, to monitor progress, make sound decisions, and evaluate outcomes and impacts. This data platform is a long-awaited online tool for us to carry out in-depth analyses and progress assessments at the target and indicator levels, and link them with our national development plans,” said Dr. Saulos Chilima, Vice President of Malawi.
The new data engine also gives users the ability to classify the statistics by various dimensions, such as the eight regional economic communities recognized by the African Union, least developed countries, landlocked developing nations, and oil-producing, mineral-rich states. Additionally, it repackages the data by key thematic issues. For example, users can categorize SDG indicators by agriculture, energy and health, allowing them to not only analyze the specific progress at the country level but also examine the convergence, similarities and differences among a variety of subregional blocs and topics.
“Africa is a continent with great potential and clear aspirations as articulated in the Africa Union’s Agenda 2063. The transformation requires quality, timely and disaggregated data to guide targeted investments and ensure that the desired returns in its human capital development, environmental sustainability, economic transformation and prosperity for all,” stated Oliver Chinganya, Director of the ECA Africa Centre for Statistics.
Building on the existing infrastructure developed by ECA, the Africa UN data portal consolidates statistics from platforms and technological tools available at UN entities. Without reinventing the wheel, the UN regional group, also known as Opportunity/Issue-based Coalition (OIBC) 1, came up with a new way of bringing data to users, strengthening the “whole-of-UN” approach to provide one common space where everyone can easily find critical evidence.
“The aim is to reduce the burden on countries in terms of responding to data needs and avoid repeated data requests from various organizations. This portal brings fragmented data from member states into one place, and this information can also be used by UN agencies and other partners,” said Dr. Bannet Ndyanabangi, Regional Director ad interim of UNFPA East and Southern Africa, and OIBC 1 co-convener.
The data portal is expected to be used in progress reports on the SDGs and other sustainable development documents. It can also be used to prepare speeches and presentations for senior leadership of governments and institutions as well as to stimulate policy conversations, for instance, for voluntary national reviews and other policy discussions around sustainable development agendas, particularly to facilitate deep analyses. The portal can also be cited by media outlets, research institutions, and other organizations to conduct further studies.

Title: Statement by Minister of Health announcing Level 2 of the COVID Response on 11th Sept 2021
Content: 11 September 2021
It is noted that there has been a progressive downward trend on the number of new confirmed COVD-19 cases - Minister of Health
GOVERNMENT OF MALAWI PRESS STATEMENT

The Presidential Task Force on Coronavirus, in collaboration with the Emergency Operation Centre on COVID 19 (EOC), continues to closely monitor the trend of the pandemic in our country. On Thursday 9th September, the Taskforce met to review the situation of the pandemic in the country, and the public health and other measures that are in place to contain the epidemic.
It noted that there has been a progressive downward trend on the number of new confirmed COVD-19 cases, those admitted to treatment units, deaths and positivity rates over the past three weeks. It was also observed that the number of patients recovering from the disease is increasing, and has now reached approximately 82%.
As communicated last time, our experts have come up with five alert levels and thresholds for the pandemic so as to provide guidance on the measures to be instituted at each level. Alert level 1 represents the lowest magnitude of cases, admissions and deaths, while level 5 represents the highest magnitude of cases, admissions and deaths.
Based on this characterization and recent data, I would like to inform the nation that we are now in Level 2 of the pandemic. On this basis, the following measures will take effect with immediate effect to ensure that we continue to suppress further the spread of the disease in our communities:

Title: Malawi launches new decent work programme
Content: 08 September 2021
The Malawi Decent Work Country Programme II is demand-driven and reflects our joint commitment to contribute to Malawi’s national priorities.
Launch of the Malawi Decent Work Country Programme II
Lilongwe, 8 September 2021 – Malawi’s Deputy Minister for Labour, the Honourable Vera Kamtukule, presided over the launch today of the country’s second Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP-II, 2020 – 2023). The DWCP-II envisages a Malawi that has gainful, secure and human rights-based employment opportunities for work for youth, women, and men.
In particular, the DWCP-II stands to make a concrete contribution a labour market in Malawi that is more productive and delivers a fairer income, provides better security in the workplace, ensures effective enjoyment of the rights freedom of association and collective bargaining for workers to express their concerns and participate in the decisions that affect their lives, ensures equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men, and offers improved quality and coverage of social protection for workers and their families.
Accordingly, the three key priority areas of the Country Programme are employment promotion and the creation of sustainable jobs; the ratification and application of International Labour Standards (ILS) and Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (FPRW); and enhancing and extending the coverage and quality of social protection.
“On behalf of the International Labour Organization, and the United Nations in Malawi, I would like to congratulate the Ministry of Labour for its leadership in this milestone moment in the excellent cooperation between the ILO and the UN, the Government of Malawi and the non-government social partners represented by the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions and the Employers Consultative Association of Malawi”, said George Okutho, Director of the ILO Country Office for Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique.
“The Malawi Decent Work Country Programme II is demand-driven and reflects our joint commitment to contribute to Malawi’s national priorities as set, amongst others, out in Malawi Vision 2063, the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy, the Abidjan Declaration on the future of work in Africa and United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework”, said Mr. Okutho.
“In order to ensure that the Country Programme is effectively carried out, we propose that the Government of Malawi, through the Ministry of Labour, quickly mobilize a Tripartite Technical Working Group to spearhead implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the programme. Malawi can count on the ILO for support to ensure the effective implementation of this second national Decent Work Country Programme”, said Mr. Okutho.

Title: United Nations urges strengthening of international transit systems to build resilience to future pandemics in Landlocked Developing Countries
Content: 17 August 2021
When the world locked down and borders closed throughout the globe, the LLDCs found themselves in a desperate situation.
Enhancing efficiency in transit systems and in operations at international borders are needed if the world’s Landlocked Developing Countries are to be able to build back better and be resilient to future pandemics and emergencies, says a new report launched today by the United Nations.
The report, “Impact of COVID-19 and responses in Landlocked Developing Countries”, written in collaboration with the International Think Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), demonstrates how Landlocked Developing Countries’ lack of territorial access to the sea and global markets expose them in unique ways to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“When the world locked down and borders closed throughout the globe, the LLDCs found themselves in a desperate situation with limited access to global markets, food and medical supplies and therefore were left behind in their efforts to fight the pandemic” said Mr. Courtenay Rattray, United Nations High-Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. “This cannot be allowed to happen again. This group of countries is in dire need of more efficient transit systems to ensure secure and uninterrupted flows of goods and services when needed most. They must be supported to respond and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The report calls for open cross-border transport networks for goods and services, expedited passage of medical supplies and coordinated safety measures at border crossings so that the world’s Landlocked Developing Countries can better face future crises.
Mr. Dulguun Damdin-Od, Director of Operations and Research Coordinator of the International Think Tank for LLDCs, added that “Borders are the Landlocked Developing Countries’ only gateway to the rest of the world and it must be ensured that those gates can be opened in times of crisis. LLDCs cannot be excluded in our global vision for a better, more sustainable future.”
Landlocked Developing Countries suffer debilitating hurdles in their efforts to import and export goods. The pandemic made this problem stark with LLDCs struggling to access tools necessary to prevent the spread of the coronavirus but also the near-impossible challenge of importing vaccines.
In fact, by June 2021, 1% of global COVID-19 vaccine doses had been distributed in LLDCs, in a group of countries home to 7% of the world’s population. Only by prioritising vaccinations – the report states - the world be able to accelerate the LLDCs’ economic recovery and rebuild what was teared down by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Landlocked Developing Countries rely heavily on their neighbours – known as transit countries - to access international trade. The global shutdown caused a spike in prices of food and medical supplies which was multiplied in the LLDCs, as they had no direct access to commodity sources.

Title: UN expresses concern over death of a person with albinism
Content: 17 August 2021
The UN is engaging relevant authorities to better understand the circumstances surrounding investigations on this case.
The United Nations in Malawi is deeply saddened by reports that the remains of a man with albinism have been found near Blantyre. Several of his body parts, such as his limbs, had been removed. The 20-year-old man, Ian Muhama from Mulanje, was reported missing by his relatives at the end of July.
The UN is engaging relevant authorities to better understand the circumstances surrounding investigations on this case.
Once again, the UN calls on the Government to fully implement the National Action Plan on Persons with Albinism. Urgent action is required to ensure that persons with albinism are able to fully access their human rights and that this criminal practice is fully eliminated in Malawi.
UN Resolution A/RES/72/140 on Persons with Albinism, adopted unanimously by the UN General Assembly on 19 December 2017, refers to the need to address the root causes of discrimination and violence against persons with albinism through ongoing awareness-raising and social behaviour change campaigns. In addition, an effective justice system is required to hold perpetrators of these crimes accountable.

Title: United States’ Johnson and Johnson Vaccines Arrive in Malawi
Content: 07 August 2021
We are excited to receive yet another consignment of over 300, 000 doses of COVID 19 vaccine. This is timely - Minister of Health.
Lilongwe, Malawi: Today, Malawi received 302,400 doses of Johnson and Johnson vaccine donated by the U.S. government through the COVAX facility, bringing the total vaccine doses the country has so far received through the United Nations-led facility to 854,400.
The donation is part of the U.S. government’s global vaccine-sharing strategy, which aims to provide at least 80 million vaccine doses to countries most affected by the pandemic, including at least 25 million with African countries.
Since July 1, 2021, there has been an exponential increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Malawi, with an average of approximately 500 new cases and 12 deaths per day, which are double the numbers in June. Meanwhile, vaccination rates remain extremely low, with less than 1 percent of the population vaccinated.
The additional COVID-19 vaccines will help protect Malawians from COVID-19, reduce barriers to building back the country’s economy, and urgently fill the supply gaps in order to vaccinate vulnerable and at-risk populations. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the U.S. government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has provided nearly $37 million (approximately 32 billion  MWK) to the COVID-19 response in Malawi to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality through testing, clinical care, surveillance, and support of an efficient and effective vaccination program.
“The United States is proud to affirm our partnership and friendship with the Government of Malawi through the donation of these vaccines. As the world’s largest donor to COVAX, we are doing this with the singular objective of saving lives,” said U.S. Embassy Chargé d'Affaires  Jeremey Neitzke.
“We are excited to receive yet another consignment of over 300, 000 doses of COVID 19 vaccine. This is timely,” said Minister of Health, Hon Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, MP.
The UN recently facilitated the delivery of 192,000 doses through COVAX, which added to the 360,000 doses previously received through the facility in March, and continues to closely work with partners to get more doses into Malawi.
UNICEF is leading the procurement and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility in the largest, most complex ground operation in the history of immunization. In Malawi, apart from supporting the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, UNICEF continues to support the Government of Malawi’s immunization programmes through planning, cold chain management, demand generation, and training health workers.
“As many countries still face vaccine supply challenges, this donation from the U.S. Government is an important way to close the supply gaps and ensure the most vulnerable - healthcare workers, teachers, the elderly, and those in hard-to-reach areas, are protected from COVID-19. For all of us, these doses represent more than just protection. They represent hope for the children of Malawi and an opportunity for them to continue their education, access critical services, hug their friends and family, and simply be children,” said UNICEF Malawi Deputy Representative Margarita Tileva.
The U.S.-made Johnson and Johnson vaccine can be stored under conventional vaccine storage conditions, enabling distribution to far-flung areas, where populations can be fully protected with a single dose. This support is critical to controlling the pandemic, slowing the emergence of new variants, and helping to restart the global economy.

Title: Immediate steps are needed to avoid falling further behind on fighting child labour
Content: 16 June 2021
The theme of the June 12th World Day Against Child Labour this year is “Act now: end child labour!”
Urgent action is needed to eliminate child labour in all sectors of society. A recent global United Nations (UN) child labour report shows that progress has stagnated in the past years.
During the commemoration of the World Day Against Child Labour 2021 today in Lilongwe, United Nations Resident Coordinator Maria Jose Torres said that, despite several strides, there is an urgent need for all stakeholders, including national authorities, employers, trade unions, civil society, and local leaders, to step up efforts to end this human rights violation against children in Malawi.
“We have only four years left to go to achieve Target 8.7 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which calls for an end to child labour in all its forms by 2025,” said Torres. “New estimates on child labour call on us to take stock of where we stand in the global effort to end child labour as the current situation is alarming.”
The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF, as co-custodians of SDG Target 8.7, launched new Global Estimates on Child Labour last week, showing that progress against child labour worldwide has stalled for the first time in two decades. Some 160 million children are in child labour globally, amounting to almost 1 in 10 of all children worldwide. Nearly half of all those in child labour are in hazardous work.
In Malawi, the most recent National Child Labour Survey, conducted in 2015, found that 38 percent of children aged 5 to 17 years are involved in child labour, amounting to 2.1 million children, more than half of whom are engaged in hazardous work. The proportion of working children no longer in school was noted to be higher for girls, and girls were more likely than boys to start working before the age of 10.
“As an Alliance 8.7 Pathfinder Country, Malawi is expected to go further and faster to achieve SDG Target 8.7. The UN stands ready to support Malawi to accelerate action to eliminate child labour in line with the country’s international commitments, including as a Pathfinder Country,” said Torres.
Deputy Minister of Labour Vera Kamtukule said government is taking necessary actions to end child labour.
“We are empowering our district and regional labour officers to ensure that they are going in all sectors to smoke out child labour and forced labour. We are doing this together with other stakeholders to ensure effective inspections,” said Kamtukule.
Several UN agencies are supporting government to eliminate child labour in Malawi. ILO is implementing the ACCEL programme to accelerate elimination of child labour in tea and coffee supply chains, as well as a project to address decent work deficits, including child labour, in the country’s tobacco sector. UNICEF is responding to child labour by supporting access to basic services, strengthening national child protection systems and promoting social change. FAO is working with communities to improve food security and livelihoods for an enabling environment that supports children’s access to education and contributes to sustainable reduction of child labour in agriculture. As many of the victims are recruited by human traffickers, UNODC is working with government to establish its domestic legal and policy framework on trafficking in persons, as well as providing training to key sectors, including judicial officers and criminal justice practitioners to identify, investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate involved in trafficking of children for labour exploitation.

ABOUT UN THE TECHNOLOGY BANK
The UN Technology Bank is a new global organisation, dedicated to enhancing the contribution of science, technology and innovation for sustainable development in the world’s 46 least developed countries. Least developed countries (LDCs) are low-income countries confronting severe structural impediments to sustainable development. They are highly vulnerable to economic and environmental shocks and have low levels of human assets.
The UN Technology Bank supports national and regional technological efforts in least developed countries, reinforcing partnerships across sectors and helping nations identify and use appropriate technologies to transform their economies and improve livelihoods.
NOTE TO EDITOR
The core mission of UN Technology Bank is to support LDCs to strengthen their Science, Technology and Innovation capacities, including the capacity to identify, absorb, develop, integrate and scale up the deployment of technologies and innovations, including indigenous ones, as well as the capacity to address and manage intellectual property rights issues to enhance their Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) capacity.
The UN Technology Bank provides LDCs with a voice to chart their own development through:
Since end of 2018, The UN Technology Bank has directly implemented projects and activities in the LDCs and also serves as a knowledge hub connecting LDCs’ STI needs, available resources, and key STI actors who can respond to these needs. It facilitates LDCs access to existing technologies and fosters joint initiatives with relevant partners within and outside the UN system including the private sector.
All UN Technology Bank activities are designed to complement, rather than duplicate, projects already undertaken by other UN agencies or development partners. The UN Technology Bank leverages existing initiatives within the UN system and beyond to implement its programme of work and promote STI in the LDCs.
The UN Technology Bank works to support the establishment and strengthening of the capacities of Academies of Science in LDCs so they can play a critical role of advising governments on STI policy development and implementation in order to address socio-economic challenges and promote development. The programme is critical for incorporating science, technology and innovation in national development programmes towards the achievement of the SDGs. Moreover, it supports the establishment of a virtual platform to promote dialogue and information exchange between policymakers and scientists to ensure the involvement of academies of science in national policy debates and the national commitments under the 2030 Agenda.
In 2020, the Angola Academy of Science was launched followed by Lesotho and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2021. The launch of Academy of Sciences in Malawi will be followed by the Central African Republic, Cambodia, Chad, Liberia, Niger, Sierra Leone and Solomon Islands during 2021. Support will also be provided to existing academies of sciences in particular on enhancing their strategic planning and resource mobilization strategies to enhance their sustainability and ability to fully contribute to national development programmes.
The Academies of Science are important sources of current and emerging leaders in science, engineering and medicine, as well as advocates for Science, Technology and Innovation (STI), and can advise and help connect their respective government and research communities.
The Academy of Sciences in Malawi is an independent organization intended to promote science and engineering and strengthen their influence in Malawi. The academy will contribute to the implementation of the Malawi 2063 – strategic and development goals, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education's Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSTI), National Planning Commission, and the National Commission of Science and Technology.
The objectives of the Academy are:
African academies have an important role to play in supporting SDGs and Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa 2024 (STISA-2024), including:

Title: Malawi’s Ministry of Labour pledges to accelerate efforts for the eradication of child labour
Content: 01 April 2021
The Deputy Minister of Labour, Malawi, Honourable Vera Kamtukule has joined the African Union and its Member States, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and other stakeholders in adding her voice in pursuit of the global target to eliminate child labour in all its forms by 2025.
Lilongwe, 1 April 2021 – The Deputy Minister of Labour, Malawi, Honourable Vera Kamtukule has joined the African Union and its Member States, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and other stakeholders in adding her voice in pursuit of the global target to eliminate child labour in all its forms by 2025.
On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Malawi, the Deputy Minister pledged that Malawi will move faster than the rest in achieving Target 8.7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which calls for immediate and effective measures to eradicate child labour, forced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking. She was speaking at the African regional launch of the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour, organized by the African Union with the support of the International Labour Organization (ILO) on Wednesday 31 March 2021.
“Malawi is privileged to be one of the few countries on the African continent to have been admitted as a Pathfinder Country under the Alliance 8.7 initiative. This means that Malawi has pledged to move faster than the rest in achieving Target 8.7 of the Sustainable Development Goals, so that others may learn from us. Furthermore, as a member of the International Labour Organization, Malawi, has ratified all eight of the fundamental international labour conventions and has further ratified the Forced Labour Protocol”, stated the Deputy Minister.
“In order to fulfil this role, we are undertaking a number of initiatives and actions. Amongst others, we launched in June 2020 the new National Action Plan on Child Labour and the National Child Labour Mainstreaming Guide. These frameworks are particularly useful in involving more stakeholders in our national efforts to eradicate child labour. In addition, we are in the final stages of developing the Labour Market Information System that will enable systematic collection and reporting of administrative data, including in respect of child labour, forced labour and human trafficking”, elaborated the Deputy Minister.
She explained that the recently launched Malawi Vision 2063 emphasises access to education for every child up to secondary school level, which would help in the reduction of child labour, adding that the Government’s flagship programme of Community Technical Colleges was expanding access by youth of legal working age to technical and vocational training, thereby improving employability of youth in decent work.
The Deputy Minister added: “The Government is moving towards the abolition of the tenancy labour system used in tobacco growing, which is associated with serious decent work deficits, including child labour”.
Director of the International Labour Organization’s Country Office for Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique, Mr. George Okutho, said that the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour, 2021, declared by the United Nations General Assembly, is a historic opportunity to reaffirm commitments, take action and inspire broad partnerships to preserve the progress made on child labour and related issues such as social justice, inclusion and the reduction of inequalities.
“Child labour is widespread in Malawi. The most recent National Child Labour Survey, conducted in 2015, shows that 38 percent of children aged between 5 and 17 in Malawi are involved in child labour, the majority of whom are working in the agriculture sector, and approximately half of whom are engaged in hazardous child labour”, said Mr. Okutho.
“In 2021, while fighting child labour, forced labour, human trafficking and modern slavery, Malawi and the global community will need to address the challenges posed by COVID-19”, added Mr. George Okutho.
In February 2020, African Heads of State adopted the African Union Ten Year Action Plan to Eradicate Child Labour, Forced Labour, Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery in Africa (2020 – 2030).
The Action Plan provides an immediate framework for mobilizing African Union institutions, Member States, Regional Economic Commissions (RECs) and other partners on the continent to scale up efforts and accelerate progress towards the achievement of the African Union Agenda 2063 and SDG Target 8.7.
The ILO is a United Nations agency founded in 1919 that brings together governments, employers and workers of 187 countries to set labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes promoting decent work for all women and men. Malawi has been a member of the ILO since 1965.

Title: A new specialized business financing vehicle for SMEs in Malawi
Content: 09 March 2021
One of the targets for the programme in Malawi is to integrate 75,000 small-scale producers as investees in the supply chains to increase their incomes and, in turn, expand the country’s revenue base.
A new Joint Programme funded by the United Nations Joint SDG Fund, which last week announced a US$41 million allocation for accelerating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in four countries, will create a new business financing vehicle in Malawi.
The specialized structured blended finance vehicle, the first of its kind in Malawi, will catalyze strategic financing by providing patient and flexible capital solutions to transformative and inclusive business models that drive the achievement of the SDGs in the country.
“This is an exciting and ground-breaking initiative that will directly impact mobilization of additional resources for Malawi to support poverty reduction by increasing investments in agriculture, manufacturing and service supply-chains,” said UN Resident Coordinator Maria Jose Torres.
“The whole idea of the programme is to de-risk investments, facilitate access to finance for businesses as well as increase productivity by focusing on guaranteeing capital access for the most impactful investments in the production chain.”
In reducing poverty and hunger, the Joint Programme will support businesses at different levels of growth in the country’s severely undercapitalized productive sectors, working with the private sector to increase productivity using technology and innovation. The programme will also promote gender equality by supporting businesses in which women are significantly represented in boards, management, staff, suppliers, or buyers.
One of the targets for the programme in Malawi is to integrate 75,000 small-scale producers as investees in the supply chains to increase their incomes and, in turn, expand the country’s revenue base.
With a total funding of US$8 million (about MK6.2 billion) from the Joint SDG Fund, the programme is anticipated to leverage an estimated US$28 million in co-financing and US$20 million in private investment.
“We will also provide technical assistance to accelerate growth and reduce associated risks and costs to businesses. With this programme, we are opening opportunities for job creation for youth and women, and boosting Malawi’s growth,” said Torres.
Malawi is among four countries that were selected from 155 proposals from over 100 country applicants across the globe in the $41 million portfolio of the UN’s Joint SDG Fund. The other countries are Fiji, Indonesia and Uruguay. UN Country Teams, in partnership with Governments, engaged senior finance experts to create in-depth approaches and solutions to SDG acceleration.
With sincere appreciation for the contributions from the European Union and Governments of Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Kingdom of Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and our private sector funding partners, this milestone marks a transformative movement to achieving the SDGs by 2030.
Three UN agencies, namely UNDP, FAO and UNCDF, will jointly work with the Government of Malawi to implement the Joint Programme.

Title: Malawi receives first shipment of COVAX COVID-19 vaccines
Content: 05 March 2021
The only way out of this crisis is to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are affordable and accessible to all countries - UNICEF Malawi Representative Rudolf Schwenk.
Today, Malawi received 360,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine shipped via the COVAX Facility, a partnership between CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO. This is a historic step to ensure equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally, in what will be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history. The delivery is part of a first wave of arrivals in Africa, and the first tranche of allocations for Malawi, that will continue in the coming months and year through the COVAX Facility.
The COVAX Facility shipped 360,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from Serum Institute of India from Mumbai, India, to Lilongwe, Malawi, arriving on the evening of 5 March. The arrival in Lilongwe marks a milestone for Malawi in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic which has claimed over 1000 lives and created a heavy burden on health facilities.
The Government of the Republic of Malawi has also received 360,000 bundled syringes and 3,625 safety boxes for safe disposal of syringes for COVID 19 vaccination through the COVAX Facility. An additional 2.1 million syringes and 21,600 safety boxes have been dispatched by sea for Malawi arriving mid-March.
The Government of the Republic of Malawi has identified priority groups who will be among the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. These include health care workers, including those working in the private sector, who are at higher risk of COVID 19 infection than the general population due to the nature of their work, and more likely to be affected by COVID-19. Also included in phase one are police, immigration, Malawi Defence Force, teachers, prison warders, prisoners, those 60 years and above, and people with underlying conditions.
“The COVID-19 vaccine has come at a right time as it will be used as an added tool to the strategies that my Ministry has put in place to reduce and stop the spread of COVID-19 in our country. The COVID-19 vaccine will be rolled out to help to reduce deaths, the risk of hospitalization and severe diseases from COVID-19. I would like to request those that are eligible to receive the vaccine in the first phase to ensure that they utilize this opportunity and get vaccinated,” said Honourable Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, MP, Minister of Health.
The WHO Malawi Representative Dr. Nonhlanhla Dlamini said “WHO congratulates Malawi for preparing the country for the deployment of the vaccines whose arrival we have witnessed today. To achieve the timely and successful introduction, it took a multisectoral collaboration across many sectors. WHO reiterates the purpose of the COVAX facility which is to ensure fair and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines regardless of a country’s wealth status. The deliveries mark the start of what will be the largest, most rapid and complex global rollout of vaccines ever known in history.”
“Now that the vaccines are in the country, it is of utmost importance to start vaccinating the intended recipients and WHO is more than ready to continue providing the necessary support for this important endeavour” she added.
“The only way out of this crisis is to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are affordable and accessible to all countries. Vaccination should be available all around the globe and people from less wealthy countries should not be left behind in the race to be protected. At UNICEF, we are committed to making this happen. As the largest vaccine buyer in the world, UNICEF is coordinating and supporting the procurement, international freight, and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines for the COVAX Facility. It is a proud moment for everyone, and I must congratulate the Government of Malawi – especially the Ministry of Health – for the tireless work that went behind the scenes to make this happen and protect the people of Malawi,” said UNICEF Malawi Representative Rudolf Schwenk.
For several months, COVAX partners have been supporting governments and partners in readiness efforts, in preparation for this moment. They have been especially active in working with some of the world’s poorest countries: those that will benefit from the Advance Market Commitment (AMC), an innovative financial mechanism to help secure global and equitable access for COVID-19 vaccines. This includes assisting with the development of national vaccination plans, support for cold chain infrastructure, as well as stockpiling of half a billion syringes and safety boxes for their disposal, masks, gloves and other equipment to ensure that there is enough equipment for health workers to start vaccinating priority groups as soon as possible.
In order for doses to be delivered to COVAX Facility participants via this first allocation round, several critical pieces must be in place, including confirmation of national regulatory authorisation criteria related to the vaccines delivered, indemnification agreements, national vaccination plans from Advance Market Commitment participants, as well as other logistical factors such as export and import licenses.
As participants fulfil the above criteria and finalise readiness preparations, COVAX will issue purchase orders to the manufacturer and ship and deliver doses via an iterative process. This means deliveries for the first round of allocation will take place on a rolling basis and in tranches.
COVAX is co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), working in partnership with UNICEF as well as the World Bank, civil society organisations, manufacturers, and others. COVAX is part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
COVAX has built a diverse portfolio of vaccines suitable for a range of settings and populations, and is on track to meet its goal of delivering at least 2 billion doses of vaccine to participating countries around the globe in 2021, including at least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses to the 92 lower-income COVAX Facility participants supported by the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment.

Title: UN Rallies Towards Wall Street with Launch of Historic SDG Investment Portfolio
Content: 01 March 2021
Malawi will reduce poverty, hunger and inequality by creating jobs and supporting small businesses in the country’s severely undercapitalized agricultural sector.
Today, the United Nations Joint SDG Fund announces a US$41 million portfolio to catalyze strategic financing to accelerate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The allocation expands the Joint SDG Fund’s investments to date to US$223 million, encompassing programming in 112 countries for Integrated Social Protection and SDG Investments.
Fiji, Indonesia, Malawi and Uruguay were selected from 155 proposals from over 100 country applicants across the globe. UN Country Teams, in partnership with Governments, engaged senior finance experts to create in-depth approaches and solutions to SDG acceleration. Convergence Blended Finance led the evaluation process with participation from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Rockefeller Foundation, Bamboo Capital, among others.
“Our dream is to bring together Wall Street and the rapidly increasing focus on ESG, impact investing, and investor excitement on the SDGs. The Joint SDG Fund is the vehicle to make this dream a reality. The Fund provides catalytic grants to unlock private capital towards blended financing of SDG investments.” Amina Mohammed, Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations
Each of the four programmes combine public and private money to invest in achieving the SDGs. Fiji will conserve and protect coastal reefs, marine life ecosystems while empowering local communities who rely on reefs for their survival. Indonesia will create a new generation of financial products to combat climate change by transitioning towards low impact energy and empowering the creation of women led small businesses. Malawi will reduce poverty, hunger and inequality by creating jobs and supporting small businesses in the country’s severely undercapitalized agricultural sector. Uruguay will combat climate change by helping transition the country's transportation and industry sectors to green energy while reducing poverty and providing affordable access to innovative clean technologies. These four programmes alone are anticipated to leverage an estimated US$4.7 billion in additional finance.
“Thanks to the support of the Joint SDG Fund, the UN team is better equipped to support the alignment of private investments to the SDGs, through the establishment of a national ecosystem for impact investment. Without a doubt, it changes the way we work.” Mireia Villar Forner, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Uruguay
The Joint SDG Fund is also developing an impact-first portfolio of 12 additional countries that will receive support to further develop their proposals, including access to global SDG financing leaders in commercial banks, impact investing firms, development finance institutions and access to tailored coaching programmes.
The portfolio will focus on diverse country typographies and impact areas: four Small Island Developing States, five Least Developed Countries and one Fragile State. In Kenya, an impact bond will finance sexual and reproductive health for adolescents. Suriname will develop its pineapple value chain to be more sustainable and affordable while Rwanda will fund health clinics powered by solar panel energy impacting the lives of people in rural communities and creating employment.
“Our model fosters blended finance and a joint effort in the public and private sector, where corporates play an active role, beyond the provision of cash. The private sector can improve the sustainability of the impacts in the longer term. For this, we need cooperation with the leaders in development.” Marie-Laure Bourat, Co-Founder of Social Impact Solutions at Société Générale
These diverse projects all have one critical element in common, their ability to leverage multi-million dollar grants from the Joint SDG Fund into billions for sustainable development and shift the conversation from funding to financing to advance equitable solutions.
With sincere appreciation for the contributions from the European Union and Governments of Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Kingdom of Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and our private sector funding partners, this milestone marks a transformative movement to achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Title: ​​​​​​​Facing Multiple Crises, Africa’s Most Vulnerable Nations Call on International Community for Greater Support
Content: 26 February 2021
The conclusion of the Africa Regional Review meeting, hosted by the Government of Malawi, kicks off a series of meetings and events leading to the  the landmark Fifth UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC5) taking place in Doha, Qatar in early 2022.
The COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, trade barriers and debt distress are some of the major challenges debated at a high-level meeting of ministers from the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) of Africa and Haiti this week.
Over the past five days, leaders of African nations and Haiti, development partners, civil society, private sector and representatives of the United Nations deliberated over progress by Africa’s least developed countries (LDCs) in achieving sustainable development, and what new policies and support measures are required to build a resilient future.
“The LDC members’ GDP shrank by 1.3 per cent in 2020, thereby increasing the number of poor households and worsening inequality between and within countries, with disproportionate effects on women,” said Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera, opening the meeting. "The Pandemic has exposed our limitations in the fields of science, technology and innovations, which has laid bare the digital and technological divide between nations.”
Across the LDCs, the pandemic is projected to force an additional 32 million people into poverty. For Africa’s LDCs, the pandemic has jeopardized hard-won development gains. In  the  three  years  prior to  the  pandemic,  African  LDCs   achieved   steady   real  average  GDP  growth  of  3.9  per  cent – slightly above the global average of 3.4 per cent. However, as a result of the  pandemic,  projections indicate  real  GDP  growth  of  African  LDCs  to  contract by 1.5 per cent in 2020.
Besides impacts on economies, previous gains made in gender equality, poverty reduction and reducing inequalities are at risk, putting additional pressure on already vulnerable nations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
A declaration agreed at the conclusion of the week, recognised that “a successful, renewed and strengthened global partnership that effectively addresses the special needs of African LDCs will contribute to the cause of peace, prosperity and sustainable development for all.” Furthermore, the declaration affirmed the commitment by African LDCs to strengthen healthcare systems, bolster research and development, empower women and provide a rapidly growing youth population with greater prospects for a decent life. They also called for the immediate establishment of a global stimulus package to address the impacts of COVID-19 and on development partners to support them in achieving global development goals.
“My take-away from the past five days is there is a tremendous sense of hope expressed by leaders from Africa and Haiti, and the inspiring youth representatives, of the sheer determination to forge ahead towards a more resilient and prosperous future,” said the UN High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing Sates Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu.
The conclusion of the Africa Regional Review meeting, hosted by the Government of Malawi, kicks off a series of meetings and events leading to the  the landmark Fifth UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC5) taking place in Doha, Qatar in early 2022.
The conference will set the development agenda for the LDCs for the coming decade and occur as they redouble their efforts to achieve the Global Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
“We are very confident this conference will enormously contribute to meeting the needs of these countries and supporting their journey towards achieving their development goals over the next ten years,” said Soltan bin Saad Al-Muraikhi, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Qatar and host of the LDC5 Conference.
The coming months will see a similar regional review meeting for LDCs in the Asia and Pacific region and the commencement of inter-governmental negotiations on the next programme of action for the LDCs which is expected to be adopted in Doha next year.

Title: Malawi receives 360,000 syringes as part of the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines under COVAX
Content: 26 February 2021
Although the first deliveries are being transported by air, most of the syringes and safety boxes will be transported by sea due to the large amount of space they take up as cargo.
Malawi has received 360,000 bundled syringes and 3,625 safety boxes (for the safe disposal of syringes) for COVID-19 vaccination. This is part of the work by the COVAX Facility to provide vaccines to all participating countries. COVAX is a global collaboration co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, and includes UNICEF, which leads on procurement and delivery, as well as getting countries ready to receive vaccines.
“In this global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, syringes are as vital as the vaccine itself,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “It is critical to have adequate supplies of syringes already in place in every country before the vaccine arrives so that the vaccine can be administered safely. This would allow immunization to start immediately and help turn the tide on this terrible virus.”
An additional 2,160,000 syringes and 21,600 safety boxes for Malawi have also been dispatched by sea and are expected to arrive mid-March 2021. Although the first deliveries are being transported by air, most of the syringes and safety boxes will be transported by sea due to the large amount of space they take up as cargo.
Globally, UNICEF will be supplying up to 1 billion syringes and 10 million safety boxes to countries in 2021 to ensure they are ready for COVID-19 vaccinations. In order to meet the demand for these vital supplies, UNICEF created a stockpile of almost half a billion syringes in its warehouses in Copenhagen and Dubai in preparation for the broader rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in 82 low- and lower middle-income countries.
UNICEF has been working with airlines, logistics operators and freight forwarders to ensure the syringes are treated as priority freight.
Even before COVID-19, UNICEF was already the largest single vaccine buyer in the world, procuring over 2 billion vaccines annually in order to reach almost half of the world’s children under 5. In addition, the agency procures and supplies around 600-800 million syringes for regular immunization programmes annually.

Title: As a global crisis continues, Africa’s most vulnerable nations set development priorities for an equitable and resilient future
Content: 19 February 2021
Without strong and purposeful governance that aspires towards structural transformation and sustainable development, economic and social outcomes in these LDCs will remain weak.
As multiple crises swirl, from COVID-19 to climate change and debt, Africa’s 33 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are gathering to assess the state of their development goals and agree how best to get back on track.
Hosted by the Government of Malawi from 22 to 26 February, LDC ministers will meet virtually and discuss common priorities to feed into the landmark Fifth UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC5) in early 2022, at which the next decade's development agenda for LDCs will be set.
“The least developed countries may be among the weakest and poorest of the global family, but we represent a vast reservoir of untapped potential,” said H.E. Lazarus Chakwera, President of Malawi.
“Ahead of us, is a critical opportunity to reshape the development landscape to one that is equitable and leaves no one behind. As we pave the way towards the Fifth UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries, the Africa Regional Review meeting is the moment to voice our collective vision for the conference and agree our common priorities for a resilient and prosperous future.”
The meeting brings together LDCs from Africa and Haiti, development partner countries, international financial institutions, the UN and civil society for five days of meetings and thematic discussions. Topics under discussion will range from overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and tackling the climate crisis to strengthening trade and building more peaceful and inclusive societies which includes the full participation of women and youth.
Global turmoil wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic forms the backdrop to this meeting, which was originally intended to take place in person in March of 2020.
The pandemic has been particularly challenging for LDCs and their economies. Commodity prices have fallen dramatically and disruptions are widespread in manufacturing value chains. International tourism, a major lifeline, has come to a standstill. The result has been a sharp reduction in GDP growth, placing economies and livelihoods on the brink of ruin. Together with widening deficits, unsustainable debt, and a drop in Foreign Direct Investment and remittances, the impacts of COVID-19 have led to an increase in poverty and will jeopardize hard won development gains for years to come.
The UN High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu said: “We may be in the midst of a global health and economic crisis, but Africa’s LDCs have long been on the frontlines of the fight against poverty and other global crises. The international community needs to live up to its promise to support LDCs in achieving global goals and to make sure that the next development agenda for LDCs is truly transformational.
Before COVID-19, African LDCs and Haiti had been making progress in implementing the Istanbul Programme of Action from 2011, though from very low baselines and with large variations across the 34 countries. Both man-made and natural crises remain prevalent and risk derailing progress. High and recently increasing poverty rates, inequality, civil strife and political instability are widespread.
Without strong and purposeful governance that aspires towards structural transformation and sustainable development, economic and social outcomes in these LDCs will remain weak.

Title: Malawi SDG Acceleration Fund approves new programmes and allocates additional MK3 billion to fight COVID-19
Content: 16 February 2021
The Malawi SDG Acceleration Fund supports three Joint Programmes to improve health systems, keep girls in school, and build community resilience, and has allocated additional MK3 billion to fight COVID-19.
Malawi’s Sustainable Development Goals Acceleration Fund (SDG-AF) was set up in 2019 by the Government of Malawi, development partners, and the United Nations (UN) to accelerate progress towards national attainment of the SDGs.
At its meeting on February 5, the Fund’s Steering Committee, co-chaired by the Secretary to Treasury Chauncy Simwaka and the UN Resident Coordinator Maria Jose Torres, endorsed three Joint Programmes that address the core of national priorities, decentralizing implementation to the district level and ensuring services reach the last mile.
Each programme is multisectoral and involves multiple government ministries and UN agencies, focusing on girls’ education, building resilient livelihoods for the poor and vulnerable, and improving access to basic healthcare. The combined budget of the three Joint Programmes for the next four years is up to US$130 million (about MK101 billion). These programmes are financially supported by the Fund, thanks to the contributions of its donors: United Kingdom, Norway, Canada, Flanders, Ireland, Romania and the UN.
“These programmes represent strategic partnerships between the Government of Malawi, including local authorities and communities, and the UN, thanks to the support of development partners in a step towards accelerating the SDG agenda in the next 10 years as outlined in the Malawi 2063 Vision,” said Simwaka.
At the meeting, the Committee activated the Fund’s Humanitarian Window to help tackle the second wave of COVID-19 in support of the Government Response Plan. Through the window, the Fund has allocated an additional MK3 billion to support national efforts to fight COVID-19.
“The new contribution, this time thanks to support from Canada, will strengthen Malawi’s response to tackle the pandemic and its adverse socio-economic effects by ensuring that vulnerable groups such as women and girls are not left behind in the response,” said Torres.
At the meeting, Canada was welcomed as a new donor to the Fund. The chairs also highlighted the important support from Norway and the United Kingdom to implement the three approved joint programmes.
Senior Government representatives who attended the meeting came from the Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Economic Planning and Development, and Public Sector Reform; Office of the President and Cabinet; Ministry of Local Government; National Planning Commission; Department of Disaster Management Affairs; Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Health. The UN was represented by heads of FAO, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, and WFP, led by the Resident Coordinator.

Title: Violence against persons with albinism must stop
Content: 03 February 2021
Only by addressing the root causes of discrimination and violence against persons with albinism can these abhorrent crimes be stopped.
Press Release
Lilongwe, 3rd February 2021
The UN Malawi condemns the killing of a 26-year old man with albinism, Saidi Dyton, who was murdered last week in Mangochi for his body parts. The UN applauds the quick action by police that led to the arrest of the three suspects and calls for additional efforts to arrest the fourth suspect.
“Despite years of fighting for the rights and safety of persons with albinism, this murder shows there is much more work to be done to ensure that persons with albinism can live safe and meaningful lives in this country,” said UN Resident Coordinator Ms Maria Jose Torres.
The UN calls on the Government to ensure adequate financial resources are made available to fully implement the National Action Plan on Persons with Albinism. Only by addressing the root causes of discrimination and violence against persons with albinism can these abhorrent crimes be stopped. Ongoing awareness-raising and social behaviour change campaigns are needed, as well as effective and timely justice systems to hold perpetrators of these crimes accountable.
The United Nations Country Team in Malawi stands ready to provide any technical advice necessary to achieve these goals.

Title: Secretary-General's condolence message to Malawi over loss of two Ministers due to COVID-19
Content: 13 January 2021
Press Briefing Note
Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General
Turning to Malawi, I just wanted to say that the Secretary-General has learned with great sadness of the untimely passing of the Minister of Transport and Public Works, Sidik Mia, as well as the Minister of Local Government, Lingson Belekanyama.
The Secretary-General expresses his condolences to the families of the Ministers, all Malawians who have died due to complications related to COVID-19, President Lazarus Chakwera, the Government and the people of Malawi.
And just to tell you what we are doing on the ground in Malawi in relation to the pandemic: The UN team, which is led by the Resident Coordinator Maria Jose Torres Macho, continues helping with national and local efforts to tackle the pandemic. WHO (World Health Organization), UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) and other partners have installed an oxygen plant to generate more than 1 million litres of oxygen per day to support COVID-19 case management in one of the country’s main hospitals.
The UN team is also working to improve access to clean water and sanitation, as well as working to save lives and livelihoods, reaching 1.7 million people through cash transfers.
The UN continues to help with communications campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus, through door-to-door efforts, mobile vans, community drama sessions and social media efforts. Through the Spotlight Initiative, we are also tackling gender-based violence and we are concerned by an increase in girl pregnancies and child marriages.

Title: ILO and ECAM collaborate to fight child labour in Malawi
Content: 15 December 2020
The action programme, valued at more than MWK 73 million (almost USD $100,000) has been agreed this week under the ILO’s Accelerating Action for the Elimination of Child Labour in Supply Chains in Africa (ACCEL Africa) project, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The Netherlands.
Lilongwe, 15 December 2020 -- The International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Employers Consultative Association of Malawi (ECAM) have signed an action programme to mobilise the country’s private sector in the fight against child labour in Malawi.
The new action programme will see ECAM establish a National Employer Taskforce Against Child Labour, promote child labour elimination policies and practices across the private sector, and facilitate more and better Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) investments by companies to address the root causes of child labour in supply chains.
“The Employers’ Consultative Association of Malawi (ECAM) is proud to be part of the ACCEL Africa project. Malawi being an Alliance 8.7 Pathfinder Country, this new action programme will help to show the commitment of business in the country to come up with practical solutions to reduce the prevalence of child labour in Malawi”, said Mr. George Khaki, Executive Director of ECAM.
“We plan to spur employers to devise innovative ways of tackling child labour, especially in the agriculture sector and associated value chains where child labour is prevalent. COVID-19 is likely to see more children in Malawi drawn into child labour due to loss of incomes by breadwinners. This makes our new action programme especially important”, added Mr. Khaki.
The action programme, valued at more than MWK 73 million (almost USD $100,000) has been agreed this week under the ILO’s Accelerating Action for the Elimination of Child Labour in Supply Chains in Africa (ACCEL Africa) project, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The Netherlands.
“Through this action programme, we are pleased to be supporting ECAM to strengthen the capacity of Malawi’s private sector to improve compliance regarding child labour, especially in the country’s tea and coffee supply chains”, said Mr. George Okutho, Director of the ILO’s Country Office for Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique.
Child labour is widespread in Malawi with the most recent National Child Labour Survey (NCLS 2015) showing that 38 percent of children aged 5 – 17 are involved in child labour, the majority of whom are working in the agriculture sector, and approximately half of whom are engaged in hazardous child labour.
The Employers Consultative Association of Malawi (ECAM) promotes, guides, and protects the interests of employers in Malawi in the areas of labour, employment, and related socio-economic issues. ECAM was registered in 1963 under the Trustees Incorporation Act as an employers’ trade association representing all subscribing employers. ECAM is a member of the International Organization of Employers (IOE) and the SADC Private Sector Forum. ECAM has a direct membership of 250 organizations which includes six associations, and collectively represents more 277, 000 members.
A United Nations agency founded more than one hundred years ago in 1919, the International Labour Organization (ILO) brings together governments, employers and workers of 187 countries to set labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes promoting decent work for all women and men. Malawi has been a member of the ILO since 1965. The ILO is implementing a portfolio of projects in Malawi relating to child labour, social protection, skills, and HIV/AIDS in the workplace, within the framework of the country’s second Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP).
Tea is Malawi’s second-largest export after tobacco, accounting for around 7% of Malawi’s exports, valued at MWK 70,140 million in 2017, while coffee exports from Malawi amounted to MWK 2,117 million in 2017, according to the 2019 edition of ‘Malawi in Figures’ published by the Government of Malawi.

Title: Stand up for Human Rights
Content: 10 December 2020
Only actions that close equality gaps in our societies and advance human rights can ensure a full recovery to build back a society that is more resilient, more robust, just, and sustainable.
In 1948 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was ratified, setting out fundamental human rights to be universally protected. Drafted by representatives from all parts of the World, the Declaration was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in France on 10 December 1948.
Seventy-two years later, the UDHR holds the Guinness World Record as the most translated text in the world. Yet, far too many people remain unaware of their basic human rights. December 10th is the day designated as International Human Rights Day to raise awareness of the fundamental rights that belong to every human as a birth right.
This year’s Human Rights Day comes as the world is addressing the tragedies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has shaken our world and exposed our weaknesses, particularly the gaps in human rights. The Human Rights Day 2020 is a call to action, a call for all of us to build a new world, post COVID-19, that respects and protects our fundamental human rights.
It is therefore appropriate that the theme for Human Rights Day 2020 is Recover Better-Stand Up for Human Rights. It asks us to build back better by ensuring that human rights are central to recovery efforts. What does this mean in practice? It means, ending discrimination; reducing inequalities; encouraging participation of all people and communities in governance and society; and intensifying our commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The months of the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed the human rights gaps in our economic and social systems in unprecedented ways: children not accessing their right to education; communities with inadequate access to comprehensive healthcare; stigma and neglect affecting the elderly; persons living with disabilities subject to discrimination and exclusion; increased violence against women, girls and children; and a massive loss of jobs and economic opportunities. Malawi registered a shocking spike in teen pregnancies and early marriages as a result of an elongated school closure.
Malawi in 2020 presented the Universal Periodic Review to the Human Rights Council and became a member of this organ, which are two remarkable achievements. This has already set the path for Malawi institutions and civil society to recover better with human rights central to the acceleration of the SDGs, which can hopefully make its way to the current visioning exercise for 2063.
Only actions that close equality gaps in our societies and advance human rights can ensure a full recovery to build back a society that is more resilient, more robust, just, and sustainable.
Together, we need to create robust health and social protection mechanisms; address environmental devastation; strengthen governance institutions; ensure the application of inclusive policies, fight corruption, and end all forms of discrimination so that these mechanisms are accessible to all.
Human rights are the answer to this human crisis because they yield fair and resilient societies. The EU and the UN are partners globally and stand for human rights. we are ready to continue supporting Malawi in this endeavor.

Title: Corruption is ultimate betrayal of public trust
Content: 09 December 2020
This is an opportunity for all stakeholders to reflect on ways of improving anti-fraud culture in our activities, partnerships and with the communities in which we operate.
On today’s International Anti-Corruption Day, the United Nations in Malawi underlines the need to root out corruption if Malawi is to recover better from COVID-19 and accelerate progress to achieve sustainable development by 2030.
UN Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres, said, while corruption impacts every country, it is the poor who are hurt the most as it hinders their access to essential services as well as opportunities to prosper together.
“Malawi should vigorously deal with the endemic corruption that has potential to ruin efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and undermine democracy and the rule of law,” said Torres.
Human rights violations, impunity, market distortions and organized crime all surge when corruption thrives. This erodes quality of life, threatens human security and exacerbates human suffering.
“Preventing corruption means that every dollar spent on development activities actually brings the intended impact of transforming lives and communities. A robust and unbiased fight against corruption therefore contributes to reducing inequalities and eradicating poverty,” said Torres.
The UN commends those in Malawi who have shown their determination to fight corruption and calls for increased independence, empowerment and support to institutions such as the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and the Ombudsman.
To win the fight against corruption, more robust systems for accountability, transparency and integrity are needed; businesspeople must act responsibly; and a vibrant civic space and open access to information should be guaranteed. A change in behaviour to uproot a culture of corruption and instill positive values are essential.
On this occasion, the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, has said: “Corruption is criminal, immoral and the ultimate betrayal of public trust… I urge all governments and all leaders to be transparent and accountable, and to use the tools provided by the United Nations Convention against Corruption.”
International Anti-Corruption Day was designated to raise awareness about the need to deal with corruption, to mobilize political will and resources to address corruption, and to celebrate and reinforce achievements in the fight against corruption.
This is an opportunity for all stakeholders to reflect on ways of improving anti-fraud culture in our activities, partnerships and with the communities in which we operate.
The UN has zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption.

Title: New partnership between the Government of Norway and the International Labour Organization to improve working conditions in Malawi’s tobacco sector
Content: 09 December 2020
The new project, entitled ‘Addressing decent work deficits and improving access to rights in Malawi’s tobacco sector’, and valued at almost USD $2 million, will be implemented over four years through to 2024.
Lilongwe, Tuesday 8 December 2020 – The Government of Norway and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have today signed a partnership agreement for a new development cooperation project to improve working conditions and access to rights in Malawi’s tobacco sector.
The overall objective of the new project is to support the Government of Malawi and employers’ organizations and workers’ organizations in the country to effectively address decent work deficits in the tobacco sector and ensure access to fundamental principles and rights at work as a means to improve livelihoods, incomes and food security. The new project, entitled ‘Addressing decent work deficits and improving access to rights in Malawi’s tobacco sector’, and valued at almost USD $2 million, will be implemented over four years through to 2024.
“Today marks an exciting new moment in our joint efforts to promote decent work for all in Malawi. The renewed cooperation that we are initiating today is built on the strong foundation established by the ILO’s global integrated strategy to address decent work deficits in the tobacco sector and is further framed by the Alliance 8.7 global multistakeholder action platform to eliminate modern slavery, child labour, forced labour, and human trafficking, for which Malawi is a pathfinder country”, said the Director of the ILO Country Office for Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique Mr. George Okutho at the signing ceremony for the project held today. “Implementation of this new project will benefit from synergies with the ILO’s existing portfolio of development cooperation projects in Malawi, including especially our ACCEL Africa child labour project”, elaborated Mr. Okutho.
Mr. Ørnulf Strøm, Minister Counsellor, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Development Cooperation of the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Lilongwe, speaking at the signing ceremony, said that: “The Government of Norway is proud to be commencing this new chapter in our longstanding partnership with the ILO. This new project is well aligned to the strategic priorities of development cooperation between Norway and Malawi, which include a focus on the agriculture sector and respect for human rights, as well as with Norway’s global development cooperation priorities regarding the elimination of modern slavery and child labour.”
Tobacco accounts for approximately 60 per cent of Malawi’s exports and approximately 10 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Estimates suggest that Malawi’s tobacco sector directly employs more than 600,000 people.
A United Nations agency founded more than one hundred years ago in 1919, the International Labour Organization (ILO) brings together governments, employers and workers of 187 countries to set labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes promoting decent work for all women and men. Malawi has been a member of the ILO since 1965. The ILO is implementing a portfolio of projects in Malawi relating to child labour, social protection, skills, and HIV/AIDS in the workplace, within the framework of the country’s second Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP).
Norway’s engagement in development cooperation with Malawi dates back more than 20 years. The Royal Norwegian Embassy in Lilongwe was formally opened in 1999. Today, Malawi is among Norway’s main development partners, in terms of programmes and their volume. Norway’s priority sectors in Malawi include agriculture, health, education and governance.

Title: Better disability inclusion is needed to recover better from COVID-19
Content: 03 December 2020
The future cannot be like the past, and that is what ‘building back better’ should be all about.
Today, on International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the United Nations in Malawi highlights the vital need for Malawi to do more to ensure the full and equal participation of persons with disabilities in all aspects of society and development.
UN Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres, said over 10 per cent of Malawians who live with at least one type of disability continue to suffer disproportionate challenges in accessing education, health services and dignified sources of income.
“Every day, persons with disabilities face barriers, not just due to their individual characteristics, but also due to harmful cultural practices and physical or institutional environments that result in vulnerability and exclusion,” said Torres.
In particular, the UN strongly condemns the recent cases of killings and exhumations of remains of persons with albinism. Such attacks, desecration of tombs, as well as continued harmful beliefs that generate discrimination, exclusion and violence against persons living with albinism, must stop.
“Greater efforts are required to dispel harmful beliefs, bring perpetrators to justice and create circumstances that facilitate full and effective participation of all persons living with disabilities, including persons living with albinism,” said Torres.
The UN also acknowledges the multiple challenges faced by women and girls living with disabilities, particularly the threat of sexual violence.
COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us that protection, response and recovery efforts cannot be effective unless everyone is equally valued and included. Sadly, the voices and needs of persons living with disabilities have been largely absent from the pandemic response, which reinforces already existing discrimination and inequalities.
As we look forward, both on how to manage this pandemic and recover from it, consultation with persons living with disabilities must be part of shaping our common next steps.
Only through the adoption of a human rights approach will we achieve equitable, sustainable and resilient societies that are able to prevent and respond rapidly to future public health emergencies and other crises to ensure that ‘no-one is left behind’. The future cannot be like the past, and that is what ‘building back better’ should be all about.
The 2020 theme of International Day of Persons with Disabilities is Building Back Better: Towards a Disability-Inclusive, Accessible and Sustainable Post-COVID-19 World.

Title: The 26th ICSOE Meeting of Southern Africa Elects a New Bureau
Content: 29 October 2020
The meeting concluded with an outcome document which proffered recommendations and appealed to member States, United Nations and development partners to pull together resources to strengthen the national and regional macroeconomic environment, create a platform for the implementation of the AfCFTA in Southern Africa, enhance the role of the private sector and build back better post-COVID-19.
Lusaka, Zambia, 29 October 2020 (ECA) - The 26th Meeting of the Inter-Governmental Committee of Senior Officials and Experts (ICSOE) of Southern Africa elected Lesotho as Chair, Malawi as Vice-Chair and South Africa as Rapporteur to lead the Bureau. Delegates and participants from Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe representing Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce, Economic Development, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Industry and Trade, participated in the 26th ICSOE.
The Minister of Finance, Kingdom of Lesotho, Honourable Thabo Sofonea, officially opened the ICSOE. The Hon Minister noted that the new Bureau was assuming responsibilities in a COVID-19 environment which had impacted negatively on socio economic issues in Southern Africa. He noted that, although the current response to the pandemic was through emergency health and economic mitigation measures, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms were required to restore external balance, preserve debt sustainability and stimulate inclusive growth over the medium-term.
The Hon Minister emphasized that to this end, the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho acknowledged the pivotal role the private sector, especially micro, small and medium enterprises played in the recovery process geared towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In line with the theme of the meeting, “Policies and strategies towards effective private sector led growth and job creation in Southern Africa,” Lesotho had over the years placed the private sector at the centre of economic development programmes and strategies in the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP). On international, continental and regional aspirations, the Hon Minister noted that, "The theme is also consistent with the global and regional development frameworks which include the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), African Union Agenda 2063, SADC Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) 2020-2030 and the SADC Vision 2050.”
In his capacity as a Special Guest, the Minister of Finance, Zimbabwe, Hon Prof. Mthuli Ncube,  noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had forced many countries to swiftly expand social safety nets to protect the vulnerable from the negative impacts of the pandemic. He advised that the Government of Zimbabwe had introduced, a food grant of ZWL$2.4 billion to cater for food needs of at least 1 million vulnerable individuals for a period of eight months. This included 200,000 micro-enterprise owners whose businesses had been disrupted by the lockdown. He further noted that the pandemic had forced the Government to look more seriously at domestic solutions to addressing the requirements to deal with the fallout.
Some of the domestic initiatives include: the launch on 2nd April 2020 of the Domestic and International Humanitarian Appeal for assistance with a budget of US$1.8 billion for COVID-19 support in conjunction with the United Nations; implementation of the Vulnerable Farmers Input Support Programme, which provides free agricultural inputs to its beneficiaries; last but not the least, assistance to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to quickly resuscitate their businesses and recover from the effects of COVID-19 through the SME Development Corporation, the Women’s Bank, and the Empower Bank to enable them support small businesses to access working capital.
On behalf of the out-going Chair, Eswatini, Mr. Sibonginkhosi Christopher Mavuso, Promotional Officer, Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Trade commended ECA SRO-SA for providing technical assistance to member States on accelerating the domestication of regional industrialization despite the exigencies of the COVID-19 pandemic which reduced physical engagements with member States. He further applauded the Secretariat for facilitating the ICSOE for member States to dialogue on private sector issues, including micro, small and medium enterprises.
Prior to the opening, Mr. Sizo Mhlanga, Director, ECA Sub-Regional Office for Southern Africa (SRO-SA) in his welcoming remarks, noted that the pandemic had affected the capacity of some countries to meet debt-servicing obligations and thus accelerated the onset of debt unsustainability. He noted that the COVID-19 crisis had indeed highlighted the need for accelerating the building of productive capacities and the implementation of national and regional industrialization strategies as well as improving and strengthening the business environment to unleash opportunities for the Southern African private sector in the sub region and the rest of the continent.
While echoing the observations of the adverse impacts of the pandemic on the local economy including on employment, government finances and other socio-economic development parameters, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in the Kingdom of Lesotho, Mr. Salvator Niyonzima, acknowledged the sterling efforts by the Government as well as by the development partners community in addressing the fallout from the pandemic. He assured Delegates of continued technical support to member States from the United Nations Family.
The representative of the COMESA Secretary General, Ms. Providence Mavubi, Director, Industry and Agriculture called for continued strengthening of collaboration amongst member States, Regional Economic Commissions (RECs), and development partners towards   ongoing regional efforts to implement inclusive industrialization policies placing the private sector at the citadel of regional economic growth and job creation. She underlined the support provided by both the COMESA industrialization policy, the local content policy and the micro, small and medium enterprises framework in anchoring private sector growth.
The representative of African Union-SARO, Ms. Myranda Lutempo, Senior Policy Officer alluded to the need for all regional activities to be implemented on a continental level to ensure sustainability. Ms. Lutempo advised that the African Union Commission was promoting economic integration and private sector development through several key flagship projects under Agenda 2063.  She also acknowledged the “critical role that the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector played in inclusive economic growth and sustainable job creation”.
The meeting concluded with an outcome document which proffered recommendations and appealed to member States, United Nations and development partners to pull together resources to strengthen the national and regional macroeconomic environment, create a platform for the implementation of the AfCFTA in Southern Africa, enhance the role of the private sector and build back better post-COVID-19.

Title: ECA SRO-SA to Convene a Virtual Two Days Meeting of the ICSOE
Content: 27 October 2020
The Meeting will also discuss how to ensure that both the formal and informal private sector effectively takes full advantage of the opportunities in technology and innovation to enhance trade in goods and services across national borders in the face of the opportunities offered by the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement.
Lusaka, Zambia, 27 October 2020 (ECA) – The Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) Office for Southern Africa will organize the 26th Meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee of Senior Officials and Experts (ICSOE) for Southern Africa virtually on the theme “Policies and Strategic Effective Private Sector Led Growth and Job Creation” from October 28 to 29, 2020.
The two-days Meeting which shall be presided over by the incoming Chair, the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, will focus on strategies and policies towards supporting the private sector as drivers of development, job creation, and growth in the region.
It will bring together senior government officials and experts in regional integration and trade in services and private sector development  from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) member States, representatives of the SADC and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Secretariats, representatives from the African Union Southern Africa Regional Office, academic and research institutions, civil society, professional organisations, financial institutions, the UN family and other ECA Divisions and Sub-Regional Offices.
Delegates and participants will discuss among other topics the private sectors’ role, including micro, small and medium scale enterprises, in supporting economic growth, creating decent and sustainable jobs and the role of member States in promoting the private sector to be more competitive and sustainable, thereby contributing to reducing unemployment, hunger and poverty.
Deliberations at the 26th  ICSOE of Southern Africa will not only enable delegates share experiences on how to fully exploit the potential of the private sector for sustainable development and job creation but will provide recommendations on how to strengthen the capacities of the private sector, improve on the competiveness of their services and products at the national, regional and international levels.
The Meeting will also discuss how to ensure that both the formal and informal private sector effectively takes full advantage of the opportunities in technology and innovation to enhance trade in goods and services across national borders in the face of the opportunities offered by the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement.
The ICSOE is part of ECA’s governance machinery, which meets annually to consider, provide guidance, endorse the formulation and implementation of the programmes of work in line with the priorities of each sub region, and proffer recommendations.

Title: 75 years of a united world
Content: 23 October 2020
The UN’s 75th anniversary is a reminder that the future that we want requires urgent and collective action.
Tomorrow marks the 75th anniversary of the United Nations (UN) and its founding charter. For 75 years, the UN has been a global organization with the acceptability, convening power and unparalleled normative impact. In this period, the resolve for all countries to come together to fulfil the promise of the nations has been remarkable.
The 75th anniversary comes at a time of great disruption for the world, compounded by an unprecedented global health crisis in the name of COVID-19, which has already had severe economic and social impact. These are times that remind us that a fight avails an opportunity for hopeful change and transformation.
Coincidentally, the 75th anniversary is being celebrated when the UN's Goal of October 2020 is Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions – the very first ideals of the UN when its founding fathers started it in the heat of a conflict.
It is encouraging that Malawi has and continues to be part of the UN’s 75 years of working for peace. Malawi is part of UN’s success stories in Rwanda, Kosovo and Ivory Coast where peacekeepers from Malawi contributed to bringing peace to conflict-ridden societies. Currently, peacekeepers from Malawi are also part of UN’s peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sudan, saving lives and helping to create conditions for better livelihoods in vulnerable communities.
In his UN 75th anniversary message, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterates the importance of stepping up the impetus for peace to achieve a global cease-fire as the clock keeps on ticking and stresses that: "Our founding mission is more critical than ever - to promote human dignity, protect human rights, respect international law and save humanity from war."
The Secretary-General also calls for ensuring peace with the planet through efforts on climate change, a message echoed by Malawi President Lazarus Chakwera in his special address on the environment on Monday this week. In the times of renewed optimism, it is the best time to join together to keep Malawi’s freshwater bodies and green forests a better habitation for the living species that Malawi treasures of. It is time to work closely with the communities to find clean energy alternatives, expand the use of smart agriculture techniques and generate more markets and more jobs under a “green label”. The science is clear, without preserving the ecosystems and deliberately reducing carbon dioxide emissions, humanity is facing an uncertain future.
The months of the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed the human rights gaps in our economic and social systems in unprecedented ways: children not accessing their right to education; communities have inadequate access to comprehensive healthcare; stigma and neglect affect the elderly; persons living with disabilities are subject to discrimination and exclusion; increased violence against women and girls; and a massive loss of jobs and economic opportunities.
In Malawi we have registered a spike in teen pregnancies and early marriages as a result of elongated school closure. There has also been a rise in cases of rape and sexual assault, as well as attacks on elderly people with horrific videos being shared on social media.
Since 1964 when the UN started operating in Malawi, the UN has been a critical partner to the Government of Malawi on programmes transforming people’s lives, and exchange of ideas, experience and values. While aligned closely with national priorities, over 20 entities of the UN have jointly worked with national authorities across 28 districts to ensure the food security of millions of Malawians; provide essential medicines to health facilities, increase Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) coverage; promote human rights for all persons living in Malawi and actively support the continued consolidation of democracy in Malawi.
The UN’s 75th anniversary is a reminder that the future that we want requires urgent and collective action. The COVID-19 disruptions are also providing a unique opportunity to realize that a more sustainable, peaceful and inclusive future is possible, but difficult decisions and actions are required from leaders.
UN family is encouraged to see Malawi embracing leadership positions in the multilateral systems, both in the regional Africa organizations and the UN. The work of Malawi as the chair of the Least Developed Countries, the upcoming Presidency of SADC and the recent election to the UN Human Rights Council, put Malawi in a powerful global position to promote and protect human rights, sustainable development and peaceful solutions to conflicts.

Title: Zero hunger, a pathway to peace
Content: 13 October 2020
WFP’s Nobel Peace Prize dedicated to partners fighting hunger in Malawi
The United Nations in Malawi congratulates the World Food Programme (WFP) for winning the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, and commends the existing partnerships with national authorities, the private sector and communities to effectively respond to food insecurity in the country since 1965.
The 2020 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to WFP on Friday, 9th October, by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for its efforts to combat hunger, fight the use of hunger as a weapon of war and improve conditions for peace across the world. In 2018, WFP and other UN entities promoted the passing of a groundbreaking UN Security Council Resolution 2417 that, for the first time, highlighted the link between conflict and food insecurity, indicating the world cannot end hunger if there is no peace.
“I am proud that WFP has received this prestigious award. It is a recognition of the hard work and dedication to side with those who suffer most to realize the right to food in peace and at war,” said Resident Coordinator Maria Jose Torres. “We dedicate the award to men and women in the forefront of efforts to ensure that zero hunger becomes a reality in Malawi.”
In Malawi, WFP provides assistance to people affected by climate shocks such as floods or drought. Moreover, the country hosts over 40,000 refugees and asylum seekers who receive WFP cash assistance to buy food in the local markets which contributes to their peaceful coexistence with the host communities.
WFP also works with other UN agencies as part of “One UN” to keep girls in school, to build resilience and to fight climate change in an integrated approach for smallholder farmers through cash for assets, climate advisories, crop insurance, village savings and loan schemes, as well as market access support – altogether providing graduation pathways out of food insecurity and poverty. WFP is currently working with the Government of Malawi to scale up this resilience-building approach.
Despite gains in defeating hunger over recent decades, food insecurity is on the rise in many countries. It is estimated there are some 690 million hungry people in the world. Globally in 2019, WFP provided food assistance to nearly 100 million people in more than 80 countries. In Malawi, more efforts are still required to end hunger as about 37 percent of under-five children are stunted, and smallholder farmers are impacted by recurrent climate shocks.
“When children receive regular meals in school to supplement their drive for education, when women and men receive food as they work on community asset projects to fight climate change, we help to build more resilient and stable communities,” said WFP Malawi Country Director Benoit Thiry. “Food assistance saves lives and it is a vital tool for promoting longer term development and stability.”
WFP is the world’s first responder on the frontlines of food insecurity and has been actively providing live-saving food assistance to the people of Malawi within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2019-2023.

Title: Shaping Peace Together
Content: 21 September 2020
Dialogue and exchanging of ideas avail an opportunity to deal with impunity that promotes violence against vulnerable groups such as women and persons with disabilities.
On 30th November 1981, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly declared the third Tuesday of September the International Day of Peace. In 2001, the UN General Assembly unanimously designated the day as a period of non-violence and cease-fire. For years, the International Day of Peace is observed around the World on 21 September.
This year’s celebration is unique as it has been demonstrated that humanity does not thrive under adversity. Rather, it faces common enemies that threaten "our health, security and way of life."
Covid-19 has pushed the world into disorder and reminded humanity that what happens in one part of the world can impact human beings everywhere. Covid-19 has already had serious social, economic and political impacts on all countries on the planet. This is a period that reminds us that global cooperation is the way to go to fight common threats to global peace – an embodiment of the purposes for which the United Nations was formed.
This year’s International Day of Peace is dedicated to nurturing dialogue and collecting ideas. The world is being rallied upon to unite and exchange thoughts on how to steer clear of the tide, heal the world, and make it a better place, hence the theme: “Shaping Peace Together”. Humanity is being called upon to celebrate the day by giving compassion, kindness and hope in the face of Covid-19. It is about coming together as people of the world to use the virus to counter discrimination or hatred.
The UN already designated 2020 as a year of listening and learning from people around the world, including Malawians. To mark its 75th anniversary, it launched a global conversation on how to build a peaceful and prosperous future that people want. One of the ways to join the conversation is by taking a one-minute UN75 online survey (www.un75.online). In Malawi, over 22,000 people have so far added their voices to the dialogue that runs until 31 December this year, calling for more jobs, more equality, better access to healthcare services, better access to quality education, improved environment and less conflict.
In Malawi, the International Peace Day is being commemorated under a localised theme: "Shaping Peace Together for Malawi", coming at a time the Covid-19 pandemic has already proved to be a threat to peaceful coexistence. Cases of discrimination and unequal access to the right to health have been reported. Implementation of Covid-19 preventive measures has proved challenging as some sections of the society have openly defied them as limiting their human and economic rights.
For Malawi, nurturing dialogue and exchanging ideas come at the right time when the country has just come out of elections and there is a new team in the Government. It is time to nurture dialogue over a culture of confrontation and divisions along cultural, religious or ethnic lines.
Dialogue and exchanging of ideas avail an opportunity to deal with impunity that promotes violence against vulnerable groups such as women and persons with disabilities. They also avail the opportunity to realize that, as a society, we need to support the right to protest while seeking to prevent violence. It is encouraging to note that most protests in Malawi are non-violent.
In line with the principle of leaving no one behind, dialogue and exchanging of ideas avail the opportunity to consider women as active social and economic agents that can make decisive contributions to community resilience, social cohesion and peaceful coexistence.
A moment for dialogue and exchanging of ideas could not have come at any better time than when the country is in the process of establishing the Malawi Peace Commission, whose mandate will be the implementation of the peace policy – a framework for peacebuilding and conflict transformation that fosters collaborative partnerships between the government, civil society and different actors for sustainable peace.
As we mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, our world is becoming ever more connected – a world in which, as the late Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld described: “the weakness of one is the weakness of all, and the strength of one is indirectly the strength of all.”
A culture of peace in Malawi will have, no doubt, a positive impact on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Malawi’s commitment to peace also has the potential to positively impact on the region and the global community to address the challenges upon us and, together, build a more peaceful, just and sustainable world.

Title: Patient safety, a top priority for all
Content: 17 September 2020
Increasing patient safety is possible if everyone contributes towards protecting health workers to deliver quality health care.
Globally, one in every 300 patients dies due to preventable medical accidents while receiving health care, resulting in 2.6 million patients losing lives due to unsafe health care every year. Thus, patient safety is a serious public health concern.
To increase public awareness, understanding and engagement on patient safety issues, and stimulate global solidarity and action to promote patient safety, the World Health Organisation (WHO) last year designated September 17 as World Patient Safety Day.
On this day, we celebrate patient safety because it is paramount to saving lives and contributes towards realisation of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number three which seeks to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all people at all ages.
Realizing quality healthcare requires that we do no harm to patients. This draws attention on the role of health workers to keep patients safe. Yet patients cannot be safe if healthcare workers are not safe.
The connection of patient safety to that of health workers is even greater during the COVID-19 pandemic: to keep patients safe, frontline healthcare workers must be safe. The theme for this year’s World Patient Safety Day, Health Worker Safety: A Priority for Patient Safety, is therefore casting light on this important link.
Nadu Morgan from Nkhoma in Lilongwe provides a perfect example. She has now recovered from COVID-19, thanks to the quality healthcare she received from health workers whose safety was strengthened to reduce their exposure to risks.
While more than 41,000 health workers have been infected with COVID-19 in Africa, it is reassuring that Malawi is among countries with lower COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers, and some African countries like Rwanda have even recorded no COVID-19 infections among health workers.
To protect healthcare workers from COVID-19 and contribute to enhanced patient safety, capacity building for personnel in the health sector is imperative. This is why the United Nations (UN), in collaboration with the Government of Malawi and other partners, has been training health workers on COVID-19  infection prevention, control, treatment and other areas. Such capacity building needs to be sustained.
A better working environment with adequate provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) is also crucial to reduce the risk of infection among healthcare workers. Together with partners, the UN has been providing essential supplies, including PPEs that are contributing to keeping healthcare workers and the people of Malawi safe from COVID-19. It is essential for all healthcare workers to access and properly utilise the PPEs to keep themselves and patients safe.
Besides, provision and utilisation of critical technical guidance on COVID-19 is vital to enable healthcare workers provide quality care to patients and manage COVID-19 cases effectively. The health workforce has a responsibility to follow and implement the provided guidance and protocols. Any laxity by one healthcare worker puts all health personnel and patients at risk.
Other solutions for patient safety in hospitals are as simple as instituting quality control systems in health facilities to help identify and fix gaps in healthcare services. For example, after a Quality Management Unit was established in Sierra Leone, deaths among children in 13 high burden hospitals dropped from 15.6 percent in 2017 to 9.6 percent in 2019.
Better collaboration, engagement and communication among the health personnel, patients, professional associations, local communities and other relevant stakeholders also improve patient safety and strengthen health care systems. This requires efficient and transparent incident reporting mechanisms to learn from mistakes with no-fault and no-blame handling of adverse incidents.
As WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, has said in her World Patient Safety Day message, patients and their families must also be enabled to take preventive, systematic measures to participate in improving the safety of care and to reduce risks to all individuals, with special attention to at-risk groups, including people with disabilities and older people.
COVID-19 is not over yet. We must continue to practice all recommended measures to prevent a second wave of high COVID-19 infections.
It is also time for partners and national authorities to improve the resilience of the country’s health system to be able to cope with any health crisis.

Title: UN commends bringing into operation of the Access to Information Act
Content: 14 September 2020
With this milestone, Malawi becomes a role model to other countries in the region and beyond.
The United Nations in Malawi appreciates Malawi Government’s swift gazetting of the date to operationalise the Access to Information Act from 30th September this year.
The Act represents an important step forward on good governance and human rights. After about 17 years of advocacy for the Act by key stakeholders, the operationalisation of the law is a significant step towards achieving the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development (SDGs), namely target number 10 of SDG 16 which seeks to ensure public access to information. With this milestone, Malawi becomes a role model to other countries in the region and beyond.
“Accessing information is a human right, which means that ordinary citizens should be able to get information as an entitlement and not as a favour,” said the UN Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres. “Moreover, the right to information in accessible formats, including for persons with disabilities, linguistic minorities and the rural poor is important to ensure an inclusive democracy and governance for all persons in Malawi.”
The Act will also be essential in the fight against corruption. In this regard, the UN commends the Whistle-Blower provisions in the Act, which protect disclosure of confidential information where it is in the public interest, particularly where it exposes corruption, abuse of public office and human rights violations.
The UN also recognizes the role of the Malawi Human Rights Commission to independently monitor the implementation of the Act and to raise awareness on its effective use. The UN calls upon the Government to ensure adequate funding for the Commission to be able to fulfill this role.

Title: Youth say health biggest concern for the future
Content: 28 August 2020
Taking a longer view of global priorities, 32 percent of the respondents say better access to health care services is what they want to see most in the world in the next 25 years. This is followed by good environment and more jobs at 14 percent each.
A recent poll on the mobile-based platform, U-Report Malawi, has shown that many young people think health is the biggest concern for the future and should be the main priority as the world continues to fight COVID-19.
U-Report, which allows young people to share their views on various issues through regular opinion polling, currently has over 224 000 participants called U-Reporters from across Malawi. As part of commemorating the 75th anniversary of the United Nations this year, a poll adapted from the UN75 online survey was sent out to U-Reporters to share their thoughts on current and emerging global trends and spark ideas for building the future they want by 2045.
Out of the 21 057 who participated in the poll, 60 percent say the international community should prioritize health to recover better from the COVID-19 pandemic while 18 percent mention education.
Taking a longer view of global priorities, 32 percent of the respondents say better access to health care services is what they want to see most in the world in the next 25 years. This is followed by good environment and more jobs at 14 percent each.
Almost half of the respondents (49 percent) think that diseases will be the biggest threat affecting people’s future while 16 percent cite climate change as their main concern for the world’s future.
About 8 in 10 (79 percent) of those who participated in the poll say it is essential for countries around the world to work together to manage emerging trends that threaten the world’s future while 44 percent acknowledge that COVID-19 has changed their views on the need for cooperation between countries.
Launched by the UN Secretary-General, the UN75 Initiative aims to listen to people across the world on shaping a better future for all.
During COVID-19, UNICEF has used the U-Report digital platform to reach young people in Malawi with messaging on COVID-19. Poll results reflect the views of registered U-Reporters, who may not be representative of the entire population in Malawi.

Title: Important milestone towards the protection of survivors of sexual violence in Malawi
Content: 17 August 2020
Further to this judgement, it is now important that national authorities ensure a prompt, effective and impartial investigation so that all persons suspected of crimes in this case are subjected to criminal processes.
The High Court’s judgement in favour of the 18 women and girls who reported incidents of rape and sexual assault by police officers in October 2019 in M’bwatalika and Mpingu, Lilongwe, is a step forward to address sexual crimes in Malawi. The Women Lawyers Association have played a pivotal role in bringing the case to the attention of the High Court and reinforcing the Constitutional right of survivors of sexual violence to access justice and effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered.
Further to this judgement, it is now important that national authorities ensure a prompt, effective and impartial investigation so that all persons suspected of crimes in this case are subjected to criminal processes. Moreover, the survivors should be provided necessary support and assistance.
The UN reiterates its commitment to continue supporting the Government and the people of Malawi to uphold human rights, in particular to work together to end violence against women and girls throughout the country. Violence against women is an obstacle to the achievement of equality, development and peace.

Title: UN and partners scale up Covid-19 response in Malawi
Content: 03 July 2020
“This virus is a threat to all of humanity, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, faith, gender, age, tribe, political affiliation or other status. Despite these enormous efforts, more needs to be done to keep everyone safe from Covid-19 and help those hardest hit by the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic in Malawi,” says Maria Jose Torres, UN Resident Coordinator.
Lilongwe
In view of the current surge in cases of Covid-19 (1 402 cases) affecting almost all districts in Malawi, time is of the essence for the newly elected Government to lead a “one country approach” to the pandemic. The United Nations and its partners, in collaboration with national authorities, stand ready to further step up efforts guided by human rights standards to fight the pandemic and protect the country’s 18 million people.
“This virus is a threat to all of humanity, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, faith, gender, age, tribe, political affiliation or other status. Despite these enormous efforts, more needs to be done to keep everyone safe from Covid-19 and help those hardest hit by the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic in Malawi,” says Maria Jose Torres, UN Resident Coordinator.
Since March, a risk communication and community engagement campaign has regularly reached more than 15 million people with support from UN and partners. Messages have been broadcast by media houses, including community radios, with the active involvement of Malawian artists, the faith community, traditional authorities, academia, Parliament, political parties and the teaching community.
To control the spread of the virus, testing, contact tracing and quarantine of contacts or suspected cases and isolation of confirmed cases have been essential. Malawi has moved from zero testing capacity to having forty-one (41) Covid-19 testing centres, which have since conducted more than 14 500 tests, thanks to support from the UN and development partners, through Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).
More than 4.8 million units of essential supplies for fighting the pandemic have been mobilised, including testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers and other frontline service providers. The UN’s support to coordinate all supplies has helped to get the supplies faster as global supplies are under much demand. A current critical shortage is oxygen for intensive care units (ICUs) in central hospitals. The UN and partners have also provided training for more than 122 000 health workers and community facilitators, who are on the frontline of the Covid-19 fight. Moreover, since June, the UN Humanitarian Corridor is operating in Malawi, bringing into the country critical relief and humanitarian personnel.
At least 26 000 people who have entered Malawi during the Covid-19 period, including returnees, have been screened for the virus at the Points of Entry and been assisted with shelter, food, protective items and onward transportation to their final destinations. Reintegration and community surveillance support in communities of return have also been provided. Six isolation and emergency treatment centres across Malawi have been set up by national authorities with support from the UN and partners.
Following closure of schools in March, an emergency education radio programme for six million primary school students and digital learning for more than 15 000 secondary school students to continue learning have been supported. Currently, the UN is supporting development of necessary guidelines for children’s safe return to schools in the coming weeks.
The UN and partners have stepped up efforts to ensure no one is left behind and jobs are protected, through a social protection scheme that stands to benefit up to 850 000 vulnerable households in urban and rural settings. Also, more than 700 community protection workers and women rights promoters are dealing with cases of violence against children, women, adolescent girls and persons with albinism. Refugees and migrants are another vulnerable group the UN is supporting in the response. The role of Malawian youth as 'change agents' in mitigating the impact of Covid-19 as well as 'building back better' is also part of the response.
The Government of Malawi has requested more than US$ 345 million through its National Prevention and Response Plan as well as the Emergency Appeal to respond to Covid-19, of which 43 per cent has been mobilized so far. Moreover, the UN has reprogrammed US$ 50.2 million of its current resources. UN pool funds have also provided a further US$2 million.
The European Union (EU), Ireland, Germany, Norway, The Global Fund, UKAid, USAID and World Bank are some of the main partners with the UN response and in support of the national efforts to contain and respond to the Covid-19 crisis. Some 28 NGOs - national and international - also work with UN agencies in the response.
Within the framework of One UN, several UN offices are supporting the response in various ways that reflect their respective mandates and specialized expertise. They include the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), International Labour Organization (ILO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), International Trade Center (ITC), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UN Women, World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office (UNRCO) and World Health Organisation (WHO).

Title: Malawi commemorates World Day Against Child Labour 2020
Content: 12 June 2020
The COVID-19 health pandemic and the resulting economic and labour market shock are having a huge impact on people’s lives and livelihoods. Unfortunately, children are often the first to suffer.
On Friday, 12 June 2020, Malawi joins the work in commemorating World Day Against Child Labour (WDACL) with a focus this year on the impact of COVID-19 on child labour, under the slogan: COVID-19: Protect Children from Child Labour, now more than ever!
“The COVID-19 health pandemic and the resulting economic and labour market shock are having a huge impact on people’s lives and livelihoods. Unfortunately, children are often the first to suffer. The crisis can push millions of vulnerable children into child labour. Globally, there are an estimated 152 million children in child labour, 72 million of which are in hazardous work. These children are now at even greater risk of facing circumstances that are even more difficult and working longer hours”, said Mr. George Okutho, Director of the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s Country Office for Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique.
“In Malawi, the most recent National Child Labour Survey (NCLS), conducted in 2015, found that 38 percent of children in Malawi aged 5 – 17 years are involved in child labour, amounting to 2.1 million children, more than half of whom are engaged in hazardous work. For comparison, the 2002 NCLS estimated that there were 1.4 million children engaged in child labour, representing 37 percent of the 5 – 17 age group. Taken together, these findings indicate that the incidence of child labour in Malawi (in terms of the number of children in child labour) has increased by approximately 50 per cent during the 13-year period between 2002 and 2015. Meanwhile, the prevalence of child labour (in terms of the proportion or percentage of children in Malawi who are engaged in child labour) also increased slightly between 2002 and 2015, remaining at more than one-third of children in the country”, said Mr. Okutho.
In support, the ILO is implementing the ‘Accelerating action for the elimination of child labour in supply chains in Africa’ (ACCEL Africa) project in Malawi. “The ACCEL Africa project aims to accelerate the elimination of child labour in Malawi by supporting the country to improve and enforce policy, legal and institutional frameworks that address child labour and by institutionalising innovative and evidence-based solutions that address the root causes of child labour in supply chains, including in tea supply chains”, explained Mr. Minoru Ogasawara, Chief Technical Advisor, ACCEL Africa Project, ILO. The ACCEL Africa project is supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.

Title: Humanitarian community appeals for $140.1 million to support immediate Covid-19 response in Malawi
Content: 20 May 2020
“The UN and its partners recognize that the situation is evolving rapidly in Malawi, and those living under the poverty line, the most vulnerable and at-risk communities could be hit the hardest," says UN Resident Coordinator Maria Jose Torres.
Lilongwe: The Humanitarian Country Team in Malawi has launched an Emergency Appeal that brings together the United Nations and non-governmental organisations immediate response to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the country.
The Appeal urgently seeks US$ 140.1 million emergency funding for UN agencies and NGOs to support Malawi Government’s preparedness and response efforts for the next six months from May to October 2020, targeting 7.5 million people. This will complement the National Covid-19 Preparedness and Response Plan launched on 8th April.
UN Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres, said the Appeal provides for targeted humanitarian assistance and protection to those most in need on top of supporting public health actions which are core to containing the spread of Covid-19.
“The UN and its partners recognize that the situation is evolving rapidly in Malawi, and those living under the poverty line, the most vulnerable and at-risk communities could be hit the hardest.
“The situation calls for urgent strengthening of the state of preparedness and response across the country, with a strong focus on the local level and the urban and peri-urban areas, to avert escalation of the Covid-19 spread and worsening of the pandemic’s socioeconomic effects on the people of Malawi,” said Torres.
On behalf of the NGO consortium, Save the Children Country Director, Kim Koch, said the needs in the Appeal aim to save lives and prevent loss of livelihoods.
“The Emergency Appeal emphasises on continued delivery of basic essential services and protection of livelihoods of the most vulnerable communities,” said Koch. “The Appeal will ensure that access to essential health care, education and protection services is safeguarded.”
Principal Secretary and Commissioner for Disaster Management Affairs, Wilson Moleni, said the continuity of humanitarian operations in the country will be critical to Malawi’s efforts to contain the pandemic and ensure better recovery.
“Malawi Government is working around the clock to ensure the virus is suppressed and that the most vulnerable people are protected,” said Moleni. “The contributions of development partners and the humanitarian community have been prepared in a coordinated fashion with the national institutions to strengthen the capacity to end the Covid-19 crisis and handle its socioeconomic fallout.”
Apart from focusing on the public health response and ensuring access to life-saving services, the Emergency Appeal for Malawi seeks to limit the secondary impacts of Covid-19 by ensuring support to vulnerable groups through various means, such as safety nets for those who lose income due to the public health measures or are unable to access adequate food and water.
Part of the targeted people are vulnerable persons living with HIV/AIDS, persons with disabilities, persons with albinism, single-headed households, street connected children, the elderly, those living in extreme poverty, pregnant women, refugees and migrants along border routes.
The Appeal also prioritises promotion of primary health care services, including sexual and reproductive health services and access to medical services for gender-based violence survivors.

Title: Tackling Covid-19 crisis together
Content: 29 April 2020
To win the COVID-19 fight, principles of peace, solidarity, rule of law, human rights and human dignity should remain part of our guiding compass.
Humanity is facing unprecedented crisis. We are fighting a common and invisible enemy: the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), that has left millions of people infected and hundreds of thousands of them dead.
Health systems, including some of the strongest in the world, have been left overwhelmed and struggling to deal with the pandemic. Beyond the health impact, COVID-19 is also ripping communities and societies; and crushing economies, jeopardising people’s livelihoods and wellbeing. All this devastation in less than five months, yet the battle is far from being won. Many experts are now speaking about a potential second wave in the cases in countries that are slowly overcoming the impact of COVID-19.
Since Africa’s first COVID-19 case was recorded in Egypt on 14 February, the cases on the continent have been rising to over 20 000 and close to 900 deaths. The SADC region accounts for 30 percent of Africa’s cases. Africa’s curve of infection is not peaking as fast as in other continents, at least for now. However, no time should be lost in terms of preparing the systems and societies for what could become the greatest challenge of this century.
COVID-19’s ferocity demands nothing less than a human rights and a whole of society approach, a business unusual approach. The virus does not discriminate by race, colour, gender, religion or any other status, and so discrimination must have no place in any response. If one person is excluded, the virus has an opportunity to persist. We cannot leave any one behind – we must seek special measures and protection for particular groups most at risk or disproportionately affected.
The UN Secretary-General António Guterres has been advocating for a three-pronged approach: i) to take decisive action to suppress the virus and alleviate suffering; ii) tackling the devastating socioeconomic consequences, with a focus on the most vulnerable people; and (iii) promoting better recovery.
Just like the rest of the world, Malawi is in a COVID-19-induced defining moment in human history. Since the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in Malawi on 2nd April, the country is now seeing the numbers rising quickly.
The United Nations has been working with the Government of Malawi, Development Partners, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and many other key actors in the society to encourage preparedness, strengthen the ability of national institutions to respond to the COVID-19 crisis and ensure that no one is left behind. The assistance has also aimed to improve coordination and coherence in the response. The National COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan is an important step in this direction.
We are all in this together. To effectively combat the pandemic, we all need to be part of the response. Government authorities and others in leadership positions need to be open, transparent, respon­sive and accountable to the people they are seeking to protect. Information should not just flow from the capital to local communities. It is essential that the local level is part of the decision making and that feedback mechanisms are in place to bring information back to decision makers.
We must constantly ask ourselves the questions: Are the measures actually working or are adjustments required? Are the measures bringing unintended consequences that need to be prevented or addressed?
The free flow of timely, accurate, simultaneous and factual information is essential. A free press, vibrant civil society organisations and an active Malawi Human Rights Commission are vital components of the pandemic’s response. Securing compliance depends on transparency and participation.
To win the COVID-19 fight, principles of peace, solidarity, rule of law, human rights and human dignity should remain part of our guiding compass.

Title: Malawi launches new Covid-19 workplace guidelines
Content: 28 April 2020
“The new Covid-19 Workplace Guidelines are informed by global standards including those of the International Labour Organization (ILO)," says Labour Minister Lilian Patel
Lilongwe: “Our message is clear: Safety and health at work can save lives and help stop the COVID-19 pandemic”, said Minister of Labour, Skills and Innovation Lilian Patel, M.P., Secretary-General of the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU) Mr. Denis Kalekeni, Executive Director of the Employers Consultative Association of Malawi (ECAM) Mr. George Khaki, and International Labour Organization (ILO) Country Director for Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique Mr. George Okutho in a joint statement to commemorate this year’s World Day for Safety and Health at Work, celebrated on 28 April each year.
Responding to the novel Coronavirus pandemic that is now affecting Malawi, the Ministry of Labour, Skills, and Innovation (MOLSI) yesterday (27 April 2020) issued new COVID-19 Workplace Guidelines that set out specific requirements for employers and employees to prevent workplaces from becoming a platform for transmission of the COVID-19 virus.
Amongst others, the guidelines require hand-washing facilities, office cleaning, shift working, physical distancing, teleworking, sick leave, phone and virtual meetings, provision of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at no cost to employees.
“Government through the Ministry of Labour, Skills and Innovation (MOLSI) enforces the Occupational Safety, Health and Welfare Act, which aims at guiding workplace owners and employers to establish and maintain a working environment that is conducive to safety, health and general welfare of employees and all persons lawfully present at the workplace.
“The new COVID-19 Workplace Guidelines are informed by global standards including those of the International Labour Organization (ILO) to which Malawi remains proudly committed. In November 2019, Malawi deepened our commitment by ratifying three new International Labour Standards (ILS) on Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), namely ILO Convention numbers 155, 184 and 187. These international treaties provide us with a valuable guiding light and benchmark OSH practices and standards here in Malawi. Building on these standards, we are currently compiling a new OSH Profile for Malawi that will help us to make recommendations to address any identified gaps,” said Patel.
Patel applauded His Excellency the State President, Professor Arthur Peter Mutharika for the timely announcement of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Recognising the importance of Public Health (Coronavirus Prevention, Containment and Management) Rules, 2020 issued announced by Minister of Health on 8 April 2020 pursuant to the Public Health Act, the Minister has commended the Special Cabinet Committee on Coronavirus for the good work achieved within a short period of time.
Patel noted with appreciation that the Public Health Rules designate a number of essential services including healthcare, law enforcement, defence, security services, utilities (water and sanitation, gas, and electricity), communication and media, agriculture and fishing, mining and quarrying, manufacturing and transport of food, health and hygiene products, legal and financial services, and the wholesale and retail of food and essential products such as sanitizers and disinfectant.
She said the COVID-19 Workplace Guidelines complement and reinforce the Public Health (Coronavirus Prevention, Containment and Management) Rules, 2020.
“The new COVID-19 Workplace Guidelines are just one part of the Government’s response how the novel Coronavirus pandemic stands to impact on the world of work in Malawi. The Employment and Labour Force Protection Cluster established under the Government’s National COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan will ensure that the labour force is protected throughout the crisis through enhancing Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) protections, developing needed skills, ensuring sound industrial relations, and expanding the quality and coverage of social protection.
“The new COVID-19 Workplace Guidelines were developed by the Ministry of Labour, Skills and Innovation through consultation with employers represented by the Employers’ Consultative Association of Malawi (ECAM) and with workers and trade unions through the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU) as well as businesses through the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (MCCCI) drawing upon the technical expertise of the International Labour Organization (ILO),” said Patel.
Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU) has welcomed the COVID-19 Workplace Guidelines - “Trade unions and workers’ organisations, including our affiliates representing workers have a key role to play in ensuring that workers remain safe on the job during the crisis, for example through workplace health and safety committees that include trade union representatives”, said MCTU Secretary-General Mr. Denis Kalekeni.
Employers Consultative Association of Malawi (ECAM) Executive Director Mr. George Khaki echoed his organisation’s support for the measures, saying: “As responsible business operators, our members are committed to complying with the national workplace COVID-19 health and safety measures and promoting international best practice guidelines such as those of the ILO and WHO”.
International Labour Organization (ILO) Country Director for Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique Mr. George Okutho said that: “Recognizing that governments, employers, workers, and the whole of society around the world face great challenges in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, the theme of this year’s World Day for Safety and Health at Work, celebrated on 28 April each year, is to address the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus in the world’s workplaces, and we have just launched a new global report and set of actionable tools on ensuring safety and health at work in the face of the pandemic.
"In Malawi, the ILO is supporting the Government, workers, and employers to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 by reinforcing the social protection and labour protection clusters of the National Preparedness and Response Plan and sponsoring rapid assessments of the impacts of the crisis on the labour market, so that the ILO can support our partners and the broader United Nations (UN) country team to target our responses for maximum impact. Ensuring meaningful social dialogue between government, workers and employers is essential for ensuring that action will be sustainable and effective”.

Title: Call for urgent action against “bloodsucker” mob justice attacks in Malawi
Content: 07 April 2020
Dangerous myths and misinformation are feeding these vigilante attacks, which constitute serious breaches of Malawian criminal law and human rights standards.
Lilongwe: The United Nations strongly condemns the alarming number of mob justice attacks against persons accused of being so-called “bloodsuckers” that are taking place across Malawi.
The media has reported five deaths in the past three weeks – two persons murdered in Mzimba around 23 March; two persons burnt to death in Chitipa around 25 March and one man murdered in Rumphi on 4 April. In addition, 10 separate violent attacks were reported during the same period in Kasungu, Ntchisi, Dowa, Mchinji, Karonga and Nkhata Bay. These attacks included violent assaults on police officers and health workers, as well as the destruction of buildings and vehicles.
Dangerous myths and misinformation are feeding these vigilante attacks, which constitute serious breaches of Malawian criminal law and human rights standards. The UN Malawi commends efforts to date by authorities to arrest suspects of these criminal acts as well as local messaging to speak out against this senseless behaviour. However, much more is required to stop this situation from worsening.
The UN calls on national and local authorities to act urgently, including by conducting immediate investigations into all attacks; arresting and prosecuting alleged perpetrators; delivering social, psychological and medical support for victims; and rapid action to dispel the harmful beliefs that lead to these attacks. Members of Parliament can play an important role by countering misinformation in their constituencies, while religious and traditional leaders can send clear messages to their communities.
The UN remains committed to supporting national authorities and communities to address this situation.

Title: Concerted action is central to fighting Covid-19 in Malawi
Content: 04 April 2020
These are times to respect human rights across the spectrum, to enable the success of the public health response.
Lilongwe: The President H.E. Arthur Peter Mutharika confirmed three cases of COVID-19 in Malawi on 2 April.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented crisis throughout the world that requires extraordinary measures. The United Nations in Malawi acknowledges the wide-ranging preparedness and response measures announced and currently under implementation by the Government of Malawi since the declaration of a state of disaster on 20 March 2020. The UN encourages everyone in Malawi to observe the recommended measures for prevention and containment of the pandemic.
The UN is providing decisive and coordinated support to Government efforts, together with development partners and non-government organizations, to strengthen the ability of Malawian institutions to respond to the COVID-19 crisis and ensure that no one is left behind. Technical advice provided by WHO has been critical to the design of Malawi’s national COVID-19 health sector plan, including establishing laboratory testing capacity and training public health specialists.
UNICEF has focused on buying medical supplies and equipment, as well as improving the water and sanitation infrastructure, to support the ability of Government and the humanitarian community to respond. WFP and FAO are seeking to ensure that food and necessary supplies are available and can reach even those most in need.
UNFPA is working on uninterrupted services for sexual and reproductive health, particularly maternal and new-born health care. UNICEF, WFP, UNFPA and UNESCO are collaborating to support adaptation of the education system, including with distance learning tools. Preventing major economic and social setbacks due to the pandemic has been core to the work of WFP, UNICEF, ILO and UNDP. These agencies are expanding temporary cash transfers and initiating measures to help protect jobs, businesses and incomes.
In parallel, the UN is supporting data collection to ensure fact-based information, as well as sensitization campaigns to counter false beliefs and misinformation. UNICEF has helped Malawi to develop guidelines for schools and engage with Paramount Chiefs to distribute information. UNDP has supported political parties, through the Centre for Multiparty Democracy, to promote a better understanding of the impact of the virus and how to prevent its spread.
Protection of the most vulnerable population groups and prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, remain central to the work of UN Women, UNICEF, UNAIDS, ILO, IOM, UNHCR, and UNFPA.  This includes support to refugees in camps, migrants at the borders, persons living with HIV/AIDS, persons living with disabilities, persons with albinism, single-headed households, the elderly, and those living in extreme poverty.
The UN calls on everyone in Malawi to work together to ensure that this crisis does not become a human tragedy. These are times to respect human rights across the spectrum, to enable the success of the public health response. The UN stands with the people of Malawi and encourages government authorities, civil society, academia, the private sector, trade unions, political parties, the media, traditional leaders and religious leaders to all respond with solidarity and respect, across racial, religious, gender and political lines.

Title: UK Aid provides K1.7 billion for Covid-19 response in Malawi
Content: 27 March 2020
“We recognise the need to act fast, to help Malawi prepare for the threat of Covid-19. This is why we have provided £1.8 million with immediate effect, to set up emergency treatment units and rapid response teams, and critically, to boost public health messaging,” said Head of DFID in Malawi, David Beer.
Lilongwe: The UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) has provided approximately 1.7 billion kwacha (£1.8 million) to UNICEF to strengthen Malawi’s capacity to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in the country. Although Malawi does not have confirmed cases at the moment, so far the Covid-19 outbreak has affected 197 countries with over 18,000 deaths, and over 400,000 confirmed cases as of 26 March 2020, according to the World Health Organization. There are 1,808 confirmed cases in Africa across 39 countries. Malawi’s neighbors, Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania all have reported cases.
With this UK Aid funding, UNICEF is supporting the Ministry of Health to improve airport and border screening capacity; train health workers to respond to a potential outbreak; and equip emergency treatment units with medical and intensive care supplies as well as water and sanitation facilities so that they are ready to treat potential cases. DFID has also helped set up the testing facility in the national Public Health laboratory in Lilongwe.
Head of DFID in Malawi, David Beer, said “We recognise the need to act fast, to help Malawi prepare for the threat of COVID-19. This is why we have provided £1.8 million with immediate effect, to set up emergency treatment units and rapid response teams, and critically, to boost public health messaging. I call on all Malawians to follow official advice, especially on handwashing and social distancing.”
“In the absence of effective treatment, raising awareness of the risk factors for Coronavirus infection and the protective measures individuals and communities can take, is the only way to reduce human infection.  Thanks to DFID through UNICEF for this very timely support to the Malawi Government,” said the Secretary for Health and Population Dr Dan Namarika.
“There is no vaccine or specific antiviral medicine to treat this virus. The best course of action is to avoid infection. UNICEF is supporting the Ministry of Health and Population to develop contingency plans and communication materials. The support from DFID is timely and will assist our ongoing collaborative effort with the Government of Malawi to prevent the virus from spreading in Malawi,” said UNICEF Malawi Representative Rudolf Schwenk.
Misinformation has cropped up all over the world including in Malawi since COVID-19 began spreading. UK Aid funding will also help ensure that citizens will receive accurate, reliable information about what to do to protect themselves.

Title: UN condemns recent attack against a woman with albinism in Mzimba
Content: 24 February 2020
An effective justice system is required to hold perpetrators of these crimes accountable.
Lilongwe: The United Nations strongly condemns the recent attack on Tafwauli Ngona, a 92-year-old woman living with albinism in Mzimba, during which two of her toes were amputated. The UN commends the Malawi Police Service for its swift investigation into this case that led to the arrest of three suspects.
In the lead-up to the elections in Malawi last year, we saw a spike in the number of attacks and killings against Malawians with albinism – attacks that stem from root causes such as the negative mystification of albinism, stigma, poverty and harmful practices.
As political contestations heighten after the Constitutional Court decision, this attack raises concerns for the safety of persons living with albinism. The UN calls on the Government to ensure adequate financial resources to fully implement the National Action Plan on Persons with Albinism.
UN Resolution A/RES/72/140 on Persons with Albinism, adopted unanimously by the UN General Assembly on 19th December 2017, refers to the need to address the root causes of discrimination and violence against persons with albinism through ongoing awareness-raising and social behaviour change campaigns.
In addition, an effective justice system is required to hold perpetrators of these crimes accountable. The United Nations Country Team in Malawi stands ready to provide any technical advice necessary to achieve these goals.

Title: UK provides MK57.2 billion to build resilience of 1.2 million Malawians against climatic shocks
Content: 30 December 2019
With this contribution, Malawi is implementing a new joint resilience programme, known as Promoting Sustainable Partnerships for Empowered Resilience (PROSPER).
Lilongwe: the Malawi Government, in collaboration with the United Nations and an NGO-private sector consortium led by Concern Worldwide, welcomes a contribution of MK57.2 billion (£59 million) from the UK Government for a multi-year joint programme aimed at strengthening the resilience of 1.2 million vulnerable people in the country against climatic shocks such as droughts and floods.
With this contribution, Malawi will implement a new joint resilience programme, known as Promoting Sustainable Partnerships for Empowered Resilience (PROSPER), which will support people living in extreme poverty and hunger in four districts of Balaka, Chikwawa, Mangochi and Phalombe.
The programme seeks to improve vulnerable people’s ability to adapt to climate change through various interventions such as diversified agricultural production, improved productive assets and enhanced access to weather information, among others.
The programme also aims to increase access to finance and markets, and support an enabling environment for small-scale enterprises to improve livelihoods of marginalised groups in line with Malawi’s National Resilience Strategy.
Department for International Development (DFID) Country Director, Mr David Beer, in his remarks said, “The UK Government is committed to assisting the people of Malawi to exit out of poverty and hunger while building their resilience to climatic shocks.”
Acting Chief Director for the Department of Economic Planning and Development in the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development, Mr Peter Simbani, said when droughts and floods strike, it is the most vulnerable people who are hit the hardest by the damage to or loss of their crops, livestock and livelihoods.
“The timely support from the UK Government will therefore prevent vulnerable households from sliding deeper into poverty and hunger as the programme will build and enhance systems that will help them withstand the devastating impact of climatic shocks,” said Simbani.
The four targeted districts have some of the lowest development indicators, the highest levels of vulnerability and poverty, and are among the hardest hit by extreme weather events. As a result, these districts experience recurrent cycle of hunger as underscored by recent findings of the 2018 Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC) Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Report.
UN Resident Coordinator, Ms. Maria Jose Torres, said, under the programme, the UN and the Concern Worldwide-led consortium will support implementation of a range of social protection, economic development and resilience-building interventions in the four districts. She said the programme is a concrete example of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17 on partnerships for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
“Building resilience of the poor and vulnerable people will ultimately break the cycle of poverty, hunger and recurrent humanitarian assistance in Malawi,” said Ms Torres. “We are very grateful to the UK Government for its steadfast support which will enable the UN and its partners to help Malawi break this cycle.”
Concern Worldwide Malawi Country Director, Mr. Yousaf Jogezai, added: “The programme will deliver comprehensive packages of activities tailored to the capacities and needs of poor households. Concern and our partners will link proven approaches from our work at community and district level, with innovations in resilience building and market systems development to achieve transformative change.”
Malawi’s exposure to cyclical climatic crises is compounded by underlying household vulnerability to food insecurity, low economic development, and seasonal patterns of production and consumption that exacerbate the impacts of weather-related shocks. These conditions prevent the country from achieving its poverty reduction targets.

Title: Youth need to stand up for human rights
Content: 10 December 2019
A world with diminished human rights is a world that is stepping backwards into a darker past, when the powerful could prey on the powerless with little or no moral or legal restraint.
On 10 December, we celebrate the heart of why the United Nations was formed – Human Rights. The foundation of the United Nations in 1945 remains just as relevant today: Respect for human dignity in the form of inalienable human rights is the key to sustainable and equitable development that sustains peace. These goals can only be achieved if we stand together and work together to respect the rule of law, to fight corruption and to ensure the equality of all persons: men, women and children, irrespective of their race, religion, gender or other status.
The theme of Human Rights Day this year is “Youth Standing up for Human Rights”. It celebrates the positive role that Youth play in driving political, economic and social transformation. This theme is particularly pertinent here in Malawi, where 40% of the population is under the age of 15 and 67% under the age of 25. Let us take advantage of this youthful demographic to creatively propel Malawi into a peaceful, just and resilient country – the Malawi we want, and I dare say we deserve.
I would like to share with you the Statement by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to mark Human Rights Day 2019
GENEVA (9 December 2019) – This has been a year of tremendous activism – notably by young people. It is particularly fitting that this year we mark Human Rights Day during the crucial UN conference in Madrid to uphold climate justice. We owe a debt of gratitude to all those millions of children, teenagers and young adults who have been standing up and speaking out more and more loudly about the crisis facing our planet.
Rightly, these young people are pointing out that it is their future which is at stake, and the future of all those who have not yet even been born. It is they who will have to bear the full consequences of the actions, or lack of action, by the older generations who currently run governments and businesses, the decision-makers on whom the future of individual countries, regions and the planet as whole depends.
It cannot, of course, be left to young people alone to tackle the climate emergency, or indeed the many other human rights crises that are currently causing simultaneous turbulence in so many countries across the world. All of us must stand together, in solidarity, and act with principle and urgency.
We can, and must, uphold the painstakingly developed universal human rights principles that sustain peace, justice and sustainable development. A world with diminished human rights is a world that is stepping backwards into a darker past, when the powerful could prey on the powerless with little or no moral or legal restraint.
However, among the many human rights challenges that have been metastasizing during the first two decades of the 21st century, the global climate emergency presents perhaps the most profound planet-wide threat to human rights that we have seen since World War II. From the right to life, to health, to food, water and shelter, to our rights to be free of discrimination, to development and to self-determination, its impacts are already making themselves felt.
We have a duty to ensure young people’s voices are heard. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1948, was a firm commitment by States to protect the rights of everyone – and that includes making it possible for future generations to uphold human dignity, equality and rights.
All human beings have a right to participate in decisions that have impact on their lives. In order to ensure more effective decision-making, and to build greater trust and harmony across their nations, the leaders of every society should be listening to their people – and acting in accordance with their needs and demands.
Nothing summarizes these aims, the leitmotif of the international human rights system, more clearly and succinctly than Article 1 of the Universal Declaration, which states boldly and unequivocally that “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”
No country, no community, will be spared by the climate emergency, as it intensifies. Already, we are seeing the most vulnerable communities and nations suffering terrible damage. People are losing homes, livelihoods – and lives. Inequalities are deepening, and more people are being forced into displacement. We must act quickly, and with principle, to ensure the least possible harm is done to human beings, and to our environment.
Climate harms will not be halted by national borders – and reactions based on hostile nationalism, or short-term financial considerations, will not only fail: they will tear our world apart. The struggles for climate justice and human rights are not a political quarrel. This is not about left or right: it is about rights – and wrongs.
It is not just concerns about the accelerating climate crisis that have driven millions to stand up and demand action. In every region, people are finding their voice to speak up about inequalities and repressive institutions. I am inspired by the courage, clarity and principle of all these people, some of them very young indeed, who are standing up peacefully, in order to right the wrongs of our era and create greater freedom and justice. They are the living expression of human rights.
Policy-makers everywhere need to listen to these calls. And in response, they need to shape more effective, and more principled, policies.
We have a right to live free from discrimination on any grounds. We have a right to access education, health-care, economic opportunities and a decent standard of living. We – all of us – have a right to participate in decisions that affect our lives. This is about our future, our livelihoods, our freedoms, our security and our environment. And not just our future, but the future of our children, grand-children and great grand-children.
We need to mobilise across the world – peacefully and powerfully – to advance a world of rights, dignity and choice for everyone. The decision-makers understood that vision very clearly in 1948. Do they understand it now? I urge world leaders to show true leadership and long-term vision and set aside narrow national political interests for the sake of everyone, including themselves and all their descendants.
I thank you.

Title: Eliminating gender based violence is possible in Malawi
Content: 25 November 2019
Eliminating violence is not just an issue of rights and access to justice; but also, an accelerator of the development agenda for Malawi.
Every year, 25th November, is International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. The United Nations General Assembly designated the day for countries and individuals to reflect on violence against women across the world. This day also marks the beginning of a campaign aimed at eliminating all forms of Gender Based Violence, called 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence (GBV). The theme for the 16 Days of Activism this year is; Generation Equality Stands Against Rape.
The United Nations estimates that 1 in 3 women have experienced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, which may not even include emotional, financial and verbal abuse. The UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres describes violence against women and girls as, “A menace which takes many forms, ranging from domestic violence to trafficking, from sexual violence in conflict to child marriage, genital mutilation and femicide, and does not only harm the individual, but also has far-reaching consequences for families and the society.”
Eliminating violence is not just an issue of rights and access to justice; but also, an accelerator of the development agenda for Malawi. Denying the rights of women and girls, is not only wrong in itself; it has a serious social and economic impact that holds us all back.  There is increasing recognition that violence against women is a major barrier to the fulfillment of human rights and a direct challenge to women’s inclusion and participation in sustainable development and sustaining peace.
Despite advances in gender equality over the last decade, Malawi ranks 145/188 on the Gender Inequality Index (GII), reflecting high levels of inequality in reproductive health, women’s empowerment, and economic activity. Additionally, violence against women and girls and harmful practices remain serious, also, the country has a lot to do in terms of women empowerment. Currently, out of the 193 parliamentary seats in the National Assembly, 44 seats are held by women representing 22.79%, posing a challenge to maximum representation and deliberation of women and girls’ issues.
Although the country has achieved gender parity in primary school enrolment, the transition rate of girls to secondary school in Malawi remains low and the drop-out rate high. UN findings indicate that 9% of girls in Malawi are married by 15 years while 46% are married by the age of 18, ranking Malawi as the 11th country globally with high cases of child marriage. Much as key drivers include attitudes that accept and tolerate the practice, poverty (especially for girls in the rural areas) has resulted in girls being married off to improve family finances. In some instances, they have been given in marriage as repayment of debts. The country is also amongst countries that have higher average rate of school years for girls than other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The available data on education in Malawi indicates that 62% of girls that enroll in standard 1 proceed to standard 5 and only 29% remain in school to standard 8, reasons being marriage, pregnancy and family responsibilities.
Keeping girls in school is key to protecting them from early marriage and reducing their vulnerability to Sexual and Gender Based Violence- SGBV. Additionally, school-related SGBV is a barrier to the right of learners to safe quality education. Therefore, putting in place interventions that will keep the girls in school, will enable them stay focused, make good decisions about their sexual health rights and become reliable citizens of the country. A study conducted to determine the nature and consequences of school violence in rural Malawi found that domestic violence disrupts schooling for both girls and boys, but in different ways: girls who had ever experienced domestic violence were 20 percent more likely to drop out, while boys were more likely to be absent. According to the MDHS 2015-16, 38 percent of ever-partnered women aged 15-49 years experienced intimate partner physical and/or sexual violence at least once in their lifetime.
The Government of Malawi has shown great commitment to eliminate Gender Based Violence. Malawi is party to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The country’s Constitution also prohibits discrimination of persons in any form and obliges the State to promote gender equality. The Malawi Government has also adopted several policies and legal frameworks to address gender-based violence issues, including the National Gender Policy and National Action Plan to Combat Gender Based Violence in Malawi (2014-2020); Gender Equality Act, Domestic Violence Act, Deceased Estate: Wills and Inheritance Act among others. Although, this is the case, Sexual and Gender Based Violence remains a serious problem in Malawi.
Since January 2019, the United Nations in partnership with the European Union under the leadership of the Government of Malawi has embarked on a multi-year programme- The Spotlight Initiative; in six districts, namely Dowa, Ntchisi, Machinga, Nsanje, Mzimba and Nkhata-Bay to address Gender Based Violence and promote equality as stipulated in goal number 5 of the SDGs. In Malawi women constitute 51% of the total population and there are more than 5 million  girls under the age of 18. Accelerating the achievement of the SDG agenda by 2030 cannot ignore half of the population and cannot leave women and girls behind.
As UN Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed once said,” After all, ‘leaving no one behind’ is not a catch phrase. It is a call-to empower people, to give them a voice; to ensure inclusiveness and equality. Let’s empower our women and girls in Malawi to make irreversible the path to development and SDGs in Malawi.

Title: Religious tolerance and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms
Content: 05 November 2019
All forms of violence, including endangering lives and the destruction of private and public property are considered criminal and unacceptable.
Lilongwe: The United Nations is concerned by the violence that took place in Balaka on 4th November 2019 between Christian and Muslim groups, resulting in at least two persons being seriously injured.
Reports that the violence started after two girls were prevented from attending school at M’manga school for wearing a hijab are of particular concern.
The rights to freedom of expression and religion are fundamental rights that ensure human dignity and a functional democracy.
Preventing access to services such as education because students choose to wear an expression of their religion goes against these important human rights and international standards on freedom of education.
Section 36 (3)(c) (III) of the Education Act (2013) stipulates that: “the school or college shall not impose restrictions of whatever nature with respect to the admission of students, recruitment and appointment of staff.”
Such actions discourage girls from attending school, denying them the right to learn and actively participate in society, at a time when Malawi is focusing on ending child marriage and keeping girls in school.
All forms of violence, including endangering lives and the destruction of private and public property are considered criminal and unacceptable.
The United Nations calls on all Malawians to respect each other’s religious beliefs and engage in peaceful dialogue to resolve differences. We also call on State authorities to ensure that all people of Malawi are able to exercise their beliefs and cultural practices free from persecution and discrimination.

Title: Statement on Malawi Human Rights Situation by Spokesperson for UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Rupert Colville
Content: 11 October 2019
All allegations of misconduct by security forces should be investigated in a prompt, thorough, independent and impartial manner.
Geneva: We are very concerned by an increase in violent protests across Malawi, and the lack of a meaningful dialogue to halt the mounting tensions in the country.
Demonstrations started in the aftermath of the 21 May presidential elections, after some groups disputed the results. They subsequently spread as protesters also began airing economic and social grievances.
While initially peaceful, in recent weeks, some of the protests have become increasingly violent and have sometimes been met with excessive use of force. In some instances, security forces have resorted to the pre-emptive use of tear gas prior to the start of demonstrations. One demonstrator reportedly died after being arrested and beaten by Malawi Defence Forces, and another is in critical condition after being shot by live ammunition, reportedly by police forces.
A number of protesters have also been acting increasingly violently, and on Tuesday, a police officer was stoned to death during a spontaneous demonstration. We have also received reports of protesters looting shops and attacking Government buildings.
We remind the Malawian authorities of their obligation to respect the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and to distinguish between violent actors and peaceful demonstrators. We urge demonstrators to express their grievances peacefully, without resorting to violence.
We also remind the authorities that the use of force during demonstrations should only be applied in exceptional circumstances, in accordance with applicable international human rights norms and standards, including the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the case of violent demonstrations, law enforcement officials may use firearms only when less dangerous means are not practicable and only to the minimum extent necessary. In any event, intentional lethal force with firearms by law enforcement officials is prohibited, except as a last resort to protect against an imminent threat of death or serious injury.
All allegations of misconduct by security forces, including those resulting in death or injury, should be investigated in a prompt, thorough, independent and impartial manner.
We urge the Government and other relevant actors to urgently engage in a genuine and meaningful dialogue to address the political, social and economic grievances of the population, and reduce tensions. Otherwise, there is a serious risk the situation will spiral out of control.

Title: Standing strong in solidarity with persons with albinism in Malawi
Content: 13 June 2019
UN commemorates International Albinism Awareness Day on 13 June under the theme "Still Standing Strong".
Lilongwe: Today is International Albinism Awareness Day, a day designated by the United Nations General Assembly in 2014 to spread awareness about albinism worldwide. Albinism is a genetic condition that uniquely intersects colour and disability. In the last decade, hundreds of persons with albinism – including in Malawi – have been harassed, bullied, physically attacked and even killed due to misbeliefs about the condition.
The UN stands strong in solidarity with persons with albinism in Malawi and around the world. Still Standing Strong is the global theme for the Day this year.
This theme is a call to recognise, celebrate and stand in solidarity with persons with albinism, who live with a constant threat to their physical security and safety, simply because they are born with a different skin colour and for being who they are.
In the lead-up to the elections in Malawi this year, we saw a spike in the number of attacks and killings against Malawians with albinism – attacks that stem from root causes, including the negative mystification of albinism, stigma, poverty and harmful practices based on manifestation of belief in witchcraft.
In addition, in Malawi, persons with albinism have faced, and continue to face, discrimination and challenges in everyday life that seriously undermine their enjoyment of human rights, including the right to health, education, employment, the right to live in the community and political participation.  The 2018 Malawi Population and Housing Census Report, published earlier this month, indicates that the previously estimated figure of persons with albinism in Malawi (17,000) was a gross underestimation. According to the census report, there are 134,000 persons with albinism in Malawi today.
Therefore, today, we recognise, celebrate and encourage strength in the 134,000 Malawians with albinism, their family members as well as their fellows around the world who are commemorating this Day. We welcome the Government of Malawi’s preparation and adoption of the National Action Plan on Persons with Albinism.
The UN stands ready to work closely with the Government, other development partners and civil society organisations to implement this plan without further delay.
We look forward to seeing the written commitment in the plan become a reality in a manner that will bring about positive, concrete and lasting change in the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism in Malawi – beginning with the most fundamental rights: to life, and to security of a person.

Title: Eight fallen Malawian peacekeepers to be honoured on Peacekeepers Day
Content: 21 May 2019
Malawi is the 25th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN peacekeeping.
UN Headquarters Observes International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on 24 May
New York: UN Headquarters will observe the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on Friday, 24 May 2019. Secretary-General António Guterres will lay a wreath to honour all UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948 and will preside over a ceremony at which the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal will be awarded posthumously to 119 military, police and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their lives in 2018 and early 2019.
The Secretary-General will award the “Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage” posthumously to Private Chancy Chitete of Malawi. Private Chitete will also be awarded the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal. Seven other fallen Malawian peacekeepers will also be awarded the Hammarskjöld Medal: PTE Songera Benjamin, PTE Simplex Taferakaso, PTE Steve Kambalame, LT Aubrey Kachemwe, and CPL Jonathan Kapichira who served in the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO); Mr. Joseph Mwamadi, who was an international staff member in the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), and Mr. Kondwani John Gopani who was a UN Volunteer in the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).
In a video message to mark Peacekeepers Day, the Secretary-General said: “Today we honour the more than one million men and women who have served as UN peacekeepers since our first mission in 1948. We remember the more than 3,800 personnel who paid the ultimate price. And we express our deepest gratitude to the 100,000 civilian, police and military peacekeepers deployed around the world today and to the countries that contribute these brave and dedicated women and men.”
Malawi is the 25th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN peacekeeping. It currently contributes nearly 915 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Western Sahara.
The global theme for this year’s commemoration is ‘Protecting Civilians, Protecting Peace’. In his message, the Secretary-General said: “This year, the United Nations marks 20 years since the Security Council first mandated a peacekeeping mission to protect civilians. Peacekeepers protect men, women and children from violence every day, often at great personal risk.”
Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said: “UN Peacekeeping deploys to some of the most complex and difficult places, protecting some of the world’s most vulnerable. We are working in partnership with Member States to implement the Secretary-General’s Action for Peacekeeping initiative to strengthen peacekeeping, including to improve how we protect civilians, which is at the heart of our work. For hundreds of millions, peacekeeping is the last best hope and it needs all our support.”
The International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers was established by the General Assembly in 2002, to pay tribute to all men and women serving in peacekeeping, and to honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace. The General Assembly designated 29 May as the International Day of UN Peacekeepers in commemoration of the day in 1948 when the UN’s first peacekeeping mission, the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), began operations in Palestine.
While the Day will be marked at UNHQ on the 24th, UN missions and offices around the world will commemorate the Day on 29 May.

Title: Spotlight Initiative: A new partnership to end violence against women and girls in Malawi
Content: 16 May 2019
In Malawi, the initiative is being implemented in Nkhata Bay, Mzimba, Ntchisi, Dowa, Machinga and Nsanje districts in phases. The first phase is for two years and a funding of €20 million has been granted.
Lilongwe: The Malawi Government, United Nations, European Union and civil society have embarked on a new multi-year programme, called the Spotlight Initiative, focused on eliminating violence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and harmful practices.
The initiative supports targeted large-scale investments aimed at achieving significant impact in the lives of women and girls in six districts in the country. In addition to enabling a holistic approach to end violence against women and girls, the initiative promotes Agenda 2030’s guiding principle of “leaving no one behind” and build on the momentum of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) efforts especially Goal 5 on gender equality and women’s empowerment.
Critically, the initiative includes a comprehensive prevention strategy that addresses structural issues and linkages to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, and HIV and AIDS.
Malawi is among 13 countries globally and eight countries in Africa selected to receive part of the global grant of €500 million from the EU to implement the Spotlight Initiative. The other seven African countries are: Liberia, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda and Zimbabwe.
In Malawi, the initiative is being implemented in Nkhata Bay, Mzimba, Ntchisi, Dowa, Machinga and Nsanje districts in phases. The first phase is for two years and a funding of €20 million has been granted.
At the first Spotlight Initiative National Steering Committee meeting in Lilongwe on 16th April 2019, where officials from the UN, EU, Malawi Government, civil society and development partners discussed the programme, UN Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres, said the initiative emanates from a strong global commitment between the EU and UN to make a positive difference in the lives of women and girls.
“Violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread and devastating human rights violations globally,” said Torres. “With this initiative, Malawi can intensify efforts to eliminate this vice and improve the wellbeing of women and girls.”
Torres said Malawi was selected to be part of the new programme because of its achievements in establishing a strong legal framework for gender equality and existence of similar initiatives on which the country could build. She added the country cannot end violence against women and girls without a strong alliance involving local communities, government, civil society and development partners.
“Strengthening this alliance is the centrepiece of the Spotlight Initiative. For the initiative to be really transformative, it is paramount to establish strategic coordination of all initiatives working on elimination of violence against women and girls.” said Torres.
EU Ambassador to Malawi, Sandra Paesen, said the EU, UN and Malawi Government share similar values on gender equality and human rights, hence, the Spotlight Initiative will aim to lift up gender equality on the country’s development agenda. She said the Spotlight Initiative is an opportunity to be transformational in our approach to addressing SGBV and redefine the perception of women as victims.
“A very important milestone to realise sustainable development is collective local action to ensure gender equality by addressing negative stereotypes about gender roles and social norms that condone violence in society,” said Paesen. “A transformational approach will ensure that women are put first in all our efforts and decision making, and we further commit to full transparency of the Spotlight through regular publication of results and resources spent.”
With the advance funding for the Spotlight, Malawi engaged in early interventions focused on community outreach to initiate collaborative and inclusive national programmes. These early interventions included capacity building of service providers on integrated SGBV services and case referrals as well as the rehabilitation of two Community Victim Support Units in Mzimba and Ntchisi to ensure access to quality and survivor-centered services for victims of violence.
The Spotlight Initiative National Steering Committee is another early milestone in setting up the programme after the Civil Society National Reference Group to encourage systematic civil society engagement in the programme was established and wider consultations on the programme’s activities for 2019 was done.
Principal Secretary for Administration in the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC), Kiswell Dakamau, said the initiative is warmly welcomed as it complements other initiatives that are being implemented by Government in the area of violence against women and girls in the country. He said the initiative is in line with the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) III, which recognizes gender issues as critical to Malawi’s social development.
Further, Dakamau said OPC encourages all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to embrace the initiative to ensure that nobody is left behind in the national development of the country. He added the support from the initiative will also help strengthen monitoring and evaluation on violence against women and girls in the targeted districts so that local governments can determine whether their interventions are successful.
“To achieve impact in the lives of women and girls in Malawi, District Councils have to first know where they stand on violence against women and girls,” said Dakamau. “This programme will help us with this component as well.”
Principal Secretary for Ministry of Gender, Children, Disability and Social Welfare, Erica Maganga, said the Spotlight Initiative will trigger real transformation in the country to accelerate efforts towards elimination of violence against women and girls, including sexual gender-based violence.
As a flagship programme under UN Reform, which promotes coherence of the UN System, the Spotlight Initiative Malawi Country Programme will see four UN agencies, UN Women, UNFPA, UNICEF and UNDP, working together towards a common goal, in partnership with the Government, the EU and Civil Society Organisations.
The programme is built around six inter-connected and mutually-reinforcing pillars focusing on laws and policies, institutions, prevention and social norms, services, data, and women’s rights movement – driving innovation and transformative programming to end violence.

Title: UN responds to humanitarian needs, gradual shift to recovery and strengthening resilience
Content: 30 April 2019
UN Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres, said the UN and partners triggered their support to the response almost immediately after the floods had hit, including, using prepositioned relief supplies.
Lilongwe: United Nations agencies in collaboration with the Government of Malawi, national and international agencies have reached over 400,000 persons affected by the impact of Cyclone Idai.
The flood affected populations have received immediate life-saving relief support including food, medicine, shelter, protection services and other non-food-items such as water, sanitation and hygiene supplies.
In early March, heavy rains and flooding linked to the cyclone killed 60 people, displaced nearly 87,000 people and affected around 870,000 persons. The Government of Malawi declared a State of Disaster on 8th March and subsequently launched a Flood Response Plan and Appeal on 28th March to support life-saving humanitarian interventions in 15 affected districts.
The flood response plan appeal has received US$ 25.6 million funding contributions and pledges out of a total requirement of US$ 45.2 million. Based on lessons learnt from the 2015 flood response, early recovery efforts have been integrated in the response plan to reduce further risks and mitigate the impact of future shocks.
UN Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres, said the UN and partners triggered their support to the response almost immediately after the floods had hit, including, using prepositioned relief supplies.
Additional support to the Government of Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) includes facilitating coordination and information management to enhance the response operations. An Emergency Operations Centre is established in the Ministry of Homeland Security to facilitate coordination of field operations.
“We assisted the government to rapidly assess the immediate needs to inform the humanitarian response,” said Torres. “Beyond addressing the immediate needs, we are also supporting the Government to assess post-disaster recovery needs that will inform early to long term recovery interventions in the affected areas.”
A Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) has been undertaken by the Malawi Government, UN, World Bank and European Union to assess damages, losses and priority recovery needs and costs. The data and information collected will inform the Government’s flood recovery plan.
“In tandem with the emergency response, we are also working with all sectors to support the affected communities’ gradual transition to recovery. This includes the UN’s support to DoDMA’s decision to provide a return home package to displaced populations who have expressed interest to return to their homes. This move aligns well with the country’s national resilience building,” said Torres.
Within the framework of One UN, several UN offices, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UN Women, World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office (UNRCO) and World Health Organisation (WHO), are supporting the response in various ways that reflect their respective mandates and specialized expertise.
Below are more details on UN support to the response:
The Humanitarian Country Team, comprising humanitarian and development actors, continues to monitor the situation, in addition to supporting the Government of Malawi to address the current emergency through coherent planning for short-term interventions that meet basic needs, and medium -and long- term programming that increases the coping capabilities of communities and households.
These joint efforts reaffirm the shared commitment by the UN to strengthening the humanitarian-development nexus to achieve collective outcomes, improve community resilience, and ensure that no one is left behind.

Title: Malawi launches flood response plan, appeals for support
Content: 30 March 2019
Minister of Homeland Security, Nicholas Dausi, said the response plan will direct and coordinate support to immediate needs among the flood victims
On 28th March 2019, the Malawi Government, in collaboration with its partners, launched the Flood Response Plan to respond to diverse humanitarian needs from the floods that have devastated 15 of the country’s 28 districts.
The response plan covers interventions to meet immediate needs in food, shelter, health and nutrition, water and sanitation, and protection services in the affected districts. It targets 162,240 households, including about 87,000 displaced people in various districts.
Minister of Homeland Security, Nicholas Dausi, said the response plan will direct and coordinate support to immediate needs among the flood victims, saying more resources are, however, still needed to ensure an efficient response.
Of the required US$45.2 million for the response, Malawi Government and its partners have secured US$14.6 million, leaving a gap of US$30.6 million. The response plan is for immediate humanitarian needs for the initial three months.
“As we respond to the disaster, we should aim to provide durable solutions to the affected people to avoid a repeat of the same scenario in future,” said Dausi.
“The government, through the Department of Disaster Management Affairs and district councils, is working to ensure all affected people in need of assistance get the necessary relief support regardless of distance, location and terrain.”
Dausi commended the United Nations, development partners and other members of the humanitarian community, including NGOs, companies and individuals, for rendering prompt support during disaster.
UN Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres, said the occurrence of the disaster at the peak of the food insecurity lean season, coupled with chronic poverty in the affected districts, aggravated its impact, but the UN managed to mobilise as soon as the floods hit to provide swift support.
“As the UN, we are strengthening our capacity to support the government in the response. We have about 50 staff fully dedicated to the response and will, in the next few days receive additional surge staff for coordination,” said Torres.
“With any emergency, vulnerable populations, especially women and children, are at risk. Thus, we need to work together to ensure that we protect all vulnerable groups, ensuring child protection and preventing sexual and gender-based violence.”
Torres also said, on March 26th, the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, appealed to the humanitarian community – both national and international – to fully support the response plan to ensure its smooth implementation.
The response plan aims to ensure the intended activities are well aligned and synergized with ongoing resilience building programmes being implemented by government and development partners to maximize the gains and ensure sustainability of the interventions.
In early March, a severe weather system formed off the eastern coast of Mozambique and hit Malawi with heavy rains accompanied by strong winds before moving back to the Mozambique channel where it intensified into Cyclone Idai and then affected Malawi a second time.
The heavy rains for four days caused flooding across many districts in southern Malawi. The floods have killed 59 people, injured  672 and affected more than 869,900 people in 15 districts.

Title: UN supports humanitarian response to floods in Malawi and joins Govt in warning of additional flood risks
Content: 13 March 2019
“We are saddened that thousands of people have been affected by the floods and express our solidarity with the Government of Malawi and the victims of the floods,” said Torres.
Lilongwe: The United Nations in Malawi, collaborating with a wide range of partners, is supporting the Government of Malawi as it works to save lives and bring food, medicine, shelter and other vital supplies to people in flood-affected areas.
Four days of heavy rains and flooding in Malawi have caused at least 56 deaths and 577 injuries, with three more people still missing, according to official data. So far, the floods have affected over 184,000 households (more than 922,000 people) in 14 districts, displacing over 16,000 households, mainly in the Southern Region. On 8 March, the President of Malawi declared a State of Disaster in areas hit by the floods. Heavy rains have also devastated neighbouring Mozambique.
Under the guidance of the UN Resident Coordinator, Ms. Maria Jose Torres, the UN mobilised quickly and is working with the Malawi Government, through the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), to support a rapid needs assessment and reach those most in need with life-saving rescue and relief assistance.
“We are saddened that thousands of people have been affected by the floods and express our solidarity with the Government of Malawi and the victims of the floods,” said Torres. “The UN is closely working with DoDMA, NGOs and development partners to support an efficient and effective humanitarian response.”
While the relief operation has already started, the assessment teams are expected to provide a comprehensive needs analysis towards the end of the week.
Key concerns are emergency shelter, food assistance, clean water, protection of children, adolescent girls, women, the elderly and people with disabilities, prevention of diseases, access to essential health services, including reproductive health services, as well as protection against potentially increased risk of gender-based violence and human rights abuses.
With Tropical Cyclone Idai fast approaching Malawi over the next four days, more heavy rains and strong winds are expected, raising the likelihood of additional flooding.
According to the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services, Tropical Cyclone Idai is expected to make landfall in Beira, Mozambique, bringing with it heavy rainfall and strong winds from 14th to 17th March 2019, which could likely affect the southern parts of Malawi.
Torres said the UN is working with DoDMA to expand early warning messages to all vulnerable communities so that people move to high grounds, avoid crossing flooding rivers, and do not seek shelter under trees or weak infrastructure.
Within the framework of One UN, several UN offices, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UN Women, World Food Programme (WFP) and World Health Organisation (WHO), are supporting the response in areas such as evacuation, strengthening coordination, assessments, providing immediate humanitarian support and formulating early recovery interventions.
The UN remains committed to monitoring the situation and supporting the Government of Malawi to address this and any future emergencies.

Title: Humanitarian chief visits Malawi, urges for more action to address underlying causes of food insecurity
Content: 02 March 2019
An immediate food crisis has been averted, but the root causes of food insecurity and other humanitarian needs must be addressed.
Lilongwe: Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock today completed a two-days visit to Malawi, during which he met Government leaders and development partners and visited Salima district to hear the stories of Malawians struggling through the current lean season.
“I have been delighted to visit Malawi for the first time since I joined the UN, and I am extremely grateful to President Mutharika and senior members of the government for their warm welcome. We have had constructive and substantive discussions especially on food security, which remains a major preoccupation for many Malawians, and on a variety of other issues. I have also been pleased to see impressive work by aid organizations who have acted quickly to help beat back rising hunger in the period between harvests,” said Mr. Lowcock.
The Humanitarian Chief called for action to address the underlying causes of food insecurity in the country now that a combination of timely humanitarian assistance and above-average rainfall this year resulted in the improvement of the food situation.
“With an immediate food crisis averted, it is tempting to relax our efforts. But action is required to tackle the root causes of chronic food insecurity in Malawi,” said Mr. Lowcock. “Diversifying the agricultural economy, adopting more market friendly policies, building resilience to deal with the reality of a changing climate and recurrent droughts, and strengthening further the social protection system are real priorities”, he added.
“We also need to continue to deliver humanitarian assistance based on need for the remainder of the current lean season to give the most vulnerable people the best chance to recover.”
After projections at the end of last year showed that 3.3 million people would be severely food insecure in Malawi between January and March, Mr. Lowcock earlier released US$10 million from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).
Mr. Lowcock visited Salima to see first-hand the positive impact cash assistance and water, sanitation and health services financed from the CERF is having. With these funds, the World Food Programme, UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the UN Population Fund will be able to help over 683,000 people in nine districts over six months.
“CERF resources are especially prioritizing women and girls, who we know are especially vulnerable during periods of food insecurity. I met women who had been unable to put food on the table for their children but can now send them to school to learn with full stomachs, thanks to this assistance,” said Mr. Lowcock.
In addition to Government-provided maize, aid agencies have distributed cash in the hardest-hit districts, and supported treatment of severe acute malnutrition especially among children.
The most recent projections suggest that food production in 2019 will be better than last year. But Malawi faces a lean season every year, usually running from October to April, with millions of people across the country at risk of heightened food insecurity.
“The Government and development partners must do all they can now to ensure that each predictable lean season involves less suffering than the last,” said Mr. Lowcock. “That is key to the difficult but obtainable goal of ending recurring need in Malawi.”
Mr. Lowcock’s visit to Malawi follows a three-day mission to Zimbabwe where he saw first- hand the humanitarian effects of drought and economic shocks.

Title: Everybody plays a part in ending discrimination
Content: 01 March 2019
The rights of marginalised and vulnerable groups should remain high on the national agenda.
Lilongwe: Today, the 1st of March, is World Zero Discrimination Day. Under the leadership of the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), the UN has since 2014 dedicated 1st March as a day to renew global commitment to combat all forms of discrimination against people living with HIV and other vulnerable and marginalized groups.
The theme for the 2019 Zero Discrimination Campaign Day – “Act to Change Laws that Discriminate” – calls for urgent action to change discriminatory laws and policies that violate and threaten the rights of vulnerable and marginalized populations.
Our collective action is required to ensure that no population is left behind in our collective drive towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as Malawi implements the third Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS III).
In particular, there is need to address multiple and overlapping forms of discrimination. For instance, women who are disabled and HIV positive may face more discrimination and exclusion than others, hence the need for a multisectoral approach to end all forms of discrimination.
The UN congratulates the Government and people of Malawi for the effort at eliminating stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV through the enactment of HIV and AIDS Prevention and Management Act in 2018.
The Act seeks to ensure that all Malawians irrespective of age, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, political or religious affiliation have access to HIV prevention and treatment services in an environment free of stigma and discrimination.
The Act also provides stiffer punishment of MK5 million to MK10 million or five years jail term or both for various forms of stigma and discrimination by service providers. We must work together to ensure the full enforcement of the Act to promote and protect the rights of key populations, marginalized groups and people living with or affected by HIV.
The rights of marginalised and vulnerable groups should remain high on the national agenda. Every person, including persons with albinism, deserves full protection to guarantee their rights to life, education, health and opportunity.
Likewise, today we have an opportunity to highlight the importance of continuing to protect the rights of persons with disability, adolescents and young women, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups.
Malawi holds the legal obligation, under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights treaties, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other international obligations, to remove discriminatory laws and enact laws and policies that protect people from stigma and discrimination.
Everyone can play a part in ending discrimination. The Zero Discrimination Day 2019 campaign challenges us to make the difference.
