Title: Kenya’s Adolescents the Winners as United Nations Joint SDG Fund Doubles its Portfolio to $114 Million in Catalytic Impact Investments
Content: 15 February 2022
Nairobi — Today, the United Nations Joint Sustainable Development Goals Fund (JSDGF) in New York announced a historic expansion of its portfolio to five new markets across the globe with US $54.5 million in additional investments to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Selected from a global pool of submissions from over 100 countries, the proposals submitted by Kenya, Madagascar, North Macedonia, Suriname, and Zimbabwe emerged as the strongest, most impactful, and investment-ready to take public.
The investments constitute an ambitious and concerted response by the UN to the challenges of our generation: from health in a world still plagued by the COVID-19 pandemic to youth empowerment to climate change. Under the leadership of UN Resident Coordinators, implementation of these programmes will fuel the UN footprint in the five nations, ushering in a new generation of collaborative action across the UN, Governments, civil society, and private sector investors.
According to Dr. Stephen Jackson, the UN Resident Coordinator in Kenya,
“Vulnerable adolescent girls are amongst those at most risk of being left behind anywhere in the world.  Our programme on Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health will help Kenya reach vulnerable adolescent girls with Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) and HIV services to achieve gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment, reaching the furthest behind first. We’ll be helping Kenya blend public and private investment to push forward work in an area as delicate and sensitive as it is crucial to advancing Kenya’s youth”.
This announcement comes less than one year after the Fund launched its first investment of US $41 million in four transformative programmes in Fiji, Indonesia, Malawi, and Uruguay. In 2021, a US $17.9 million programme in Papua New Guinea was added, and with the addition of these five new programmes, the Joint SDG Fund’s Catalytic Investment portfolio will grow to US $114 million. The portfolio is expected to leverage US $5 billion toward the SDGs across the 10 programmatic countries.
In partnership with development banks and local financial institutions, Kenya’s newly created programme will support the scale up of the world’s first Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (ASRH) development impact bond in Kenya that promises to not only transform adolescent health outcomes in Kenya but also open up endless opportunities for private and public investment, in public health.
Recognizing the immense support in the implementation of the UN joint programme initiatives, the JSDGF is exceedingly grateful for the level of cooperation from the dynamic inter-agency team in Kenya comprising of the SDG Partnership Platform Kenya at UNRCO, UNFPA, WHO, UNAIDS,CIFF, Triggerise and KOIS, as well as the Government of Kenya through the Ministry of Health, Council of Governors, participating county governments.
The Fund also marks its sincere appreciation for the contributions from the European Union and Governments of Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Kingdom of Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and our private sector funding partners, this milestone marks a transformative movement towards achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Title: FAO and Kenyan Government sign action plan to mitigate drought in ASALs Counties
Content: 15 July 2021
Livelihood conditions have declined as a result of reduced access to pasture even as 56% of the ASAL counties reported increased trekking distances to water sources for livestock and domestic use. This is expected to get worse in the coming months hence the need for urgent anticipatory action

15/07/2021 Nairobi - Kenya: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Ministry of Devolution and the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) today signed the Anticipatory Action and Response Plan for Pastoral and Agropastoral Communities in ASAL Counties of Samburu, Isiolo, Turkana, Garissa, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir and Tana River.
This is in response to drought alert sent in June 2021 where 12 of the 23 ASAL counties were in the alert drought phase, while 16 reported a declining trend. This is an abnormal occurrence at the immediate end of the season.
‘Livelihood conditions have declined as a result of reduced access to pasture even as 56% of the ASAL counties reported increased trekking distances to water sources for livestock and domestic use. This is expected to get worse in the coming months hence the need for urgent anticipatory action,’ said Carla Mucavi - the FAOR Representative to Kenya during the signing.
‘The Government welcomes the support and collaboration of partners such as FAO in addressing this situation. This call for anticipatory action will go a long way in building the resilience of the communities in the affected Counties. Urgent action and a coordinated response is needed from donors and other concerned stakeholders before the situation deteriorates further,’ said the Cabinet Secretary for Ministry of Devolution and the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) Hon. Eugene Wamalwa.
The ASAL situation since 2020
The 2020 Short Rains Assessment established that the season had performed poorly. As of February 2021, 1.4 million people in ASAL counties were already experiencing acute food insecurity. This was aggravated by other factors including the COVID-19 pandemic, the desert locust invasion, food commodity price spikes, and livestock diseases.
Since then, the long rains in March-May 2021 have also under-performed. The onset of the season was late, the amount of rainfall was below normal in most ASAL counties, and its distribution in both space and time was poor.
Current drought indicators
An estimated two million people in ASAL counties are now in need of assistance. This figure is likely to rise as the situation worsens. There is a severe deficit of vegetation in Isiolo county and in Lagdera sub-county of Garissa, while the rest of Garissa and Kilifi, Marsabit, Tana River, and Wajir counties report a moderate vegetation deficit.
The proportion of children at risk of malnutrition is already above average in seven ASAL counties (Embu, Taita Taveta, Makueni, Narok, Kjiado, Meru, Nyeri). In addition to that, families are now forced to cover longer distances to access water for domestic and livestock use as water sources have dried up.
Resources needed for drought mitigation
Kenya’s drought response plan requires a total of Kshs. 9.4 billion for the period July – November 2021: Kshs. 5.8 billion for food and safety net support and Kshs. 3.6 billion for non-food interventions.
FAO is seeking a total of USD 15,007,460 (Ksh 1,500,746,000 billion) to cushion livestock assets and vulnerable pastoral households against the adverse effects of the drought, to support water interventions for increased access to water for Livestock and domestic used to enhance access to food and nutrition. This includes basic needs by farming households and to strengthen the institutional and technical capacity of National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) for effective implementation of the early warning mechanism.

Title: Statement from the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima on the decision by the United States of America to support the TRIPS waiver for COVID-19 vaccines
Content: 06 May 2021
Support for waiving intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines
5 May 2021 I applaud the announcement from United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai supporting the waiving of intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines.
This is the kind of global leadership the world desperately needs as we witness horrific scenes in countries like India, where only nine in 100 people have been vaccinated. To date, more than 1.1 billion doses of vaccines have been administered globally, but more than 80% of those have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries, while just 0.3% have been administered in low-income countries.
We are in a race to vaccinate the majority of the world’s population to curb death tolls and before more potent variants of COVID-19 emerge, rendering current vaccines ineffective. The faster we can scale up global vaccine supply, the faster we can contain the virus and the less chance we will face a day when variants prove resistant to existing vaccines. As the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres has said “no one is safe until everyone is safe”.
The TRIPS waiver would enable the sharing of technologies, data, know-how, patents and other intellectual property rights across the world. The announcement of the US administration sends a powerful signal to the rest of the G7 and to the
European Union to also support the World Trade Organization TRIPS Waiver and inspire other countries to take a powerful stand in favour of people before profits. This remarkable position from the US government is a fundamental step towards a People’s Vaccine.
To ensure everyone, everywhere has access to a lifesaving vaccine, we also need to see a pooling of technology through the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool, as well as financing to help build a network of vaccine manufacturing in developing countries. These three actions can together build a sustainable system to vaccinate the world, reach the needed herd immunity and open the paths to make the world best prepared for future pandemics.
As we have learned from 40 years of fighting AIDS, equitable access to medical technologies is critical both for saving lives and for decreasing the impact of infectious diseases on people, communities and nations.
We are grateful to President Biden and his Administration for the generous humanitarian pledges made on COVID-19 and for today’s announcement.

Title: Joint statement by the Government of Kenya and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees: Dadaab and Kakuma Refugee Camps Roadmap
Content: 29 April 2021
Roadmap on the next steps towards a humane management of refugees in Kakuma and Daadab Refugee Camps
President Uhuru Kenyatta met today with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi in Nairobi to discuss issues surrounding refugees and asylum seekers in the region, as well as receive a briefing on the status of Kakuma and Dadaab refugees camps, following the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ meetings with Cabinet Secretaries Dr. Fred Matiang’i and Amb. Raychelle Omamo.
This meeting comes in the wake of the Government’s communicated intention to work toward the closure of the refugee camps in Kenya. A joint team comprising officials from the Government and the UN agency will therefore be formed to finalize and implement a roadmap on the next steps towards a humane management of refugees in both camps.
The roadmap, which was presented to the Government of Kenya in the beginning of April, includes voluntary return for refugees in safety and dignity, departures to third countries under various arrangements, and alternative stay options in Kenya for certain refugees from East African Community (EAC) countries.
“We are serious about completing the repatriation programme which we started in 2016, in full view of our international obligations and our domestic responsibility. We therefore reiterate our earlier position to close both Dadaab and Kakuma camps by 30 June, 2022,” said Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i.
The Government of Kenya and UNHCR agree that refugee camps are not a long-term solution to forced displacement and are committed to working together to find alternative solutions that are in line with the responsibility sharing principles and goals of the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR).
“I believe that the Government and people of Kenya will continue to show their generous hospitality towards refugees as they have done for nearly three decades, while we carry on discussions on a strategy to find the most durable, appropriate and rights-based solutions for refugees and asylum-seekers residing in the refugee camps in Dadaab and Kakuma,” said the UN High Commissioner.
“Closure of the camps must be seen as an aspiration. We are not chasing people away, but a camp is not a permanent thing. It is a place of limbo. No one should live in a place of uncertainty or indignity generation after generation. What we are now working on is how to achieve this cooperatively which is in line with Global Compact on Refugees,” said Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amb. Raychelle Omamo.
High Commissioner Grandi welcomed the government’s continued commitment to the GCR during this process. “I am reassured by the government’s assurances that they will continue to provide protection and services for asylum-seekers and refugees in Kenya while various solutions are pursued.”
Among the precursory activities contained in the government’s roadmap is a unanimous resolution that was recently endorsed by ambassadors and representatives from East African countries which have a mutual diplomatic relationship with Kenya when they met a delegation led by Interior Cabinet Secretary, Dr. Fred Matiang’i.
“Refugees from East African countries will be given the option of being issued a work permit for free so that they can integrate into Kenyan communities or return to their country of origin,’’ said Dr. Matiang’i.
Digital verification of Kenyans currently also registered as refugees is set to begin in due course. This will inform the issuance of appropriate documentation to Kenyan citizens and ensure their removal from the refugee database.
Kenya has shouldered the burden of sheltering refugees for almost three decades, and the swelling camps have overstretched their capacity to host populations. The government has also expressed grave concerns over the security of both Kenyans and refugees at the camp.
There are currently 433,765 refugees living in Dadaab and Kakuma camps.

Title: Country Level Food Systems Dialogues in Kenya
Content: 05 February 2021
In Kenya, the FSS will be an opportunity to elevate and deliver on the systemic challenges facing the production, transformation (processing, transportation, storage etc.) and consumption of food
Building healthier, more sustainable, and equitable food systems are recognized as a powerful and essential requirement to deliver on all SDGs. The term “food system” refers to the constellation of activities involved in producing, processing, transporting, and consuming food. Food systems touch every aspect of human existence.
The health of our food systems profoundly affects the health of our bodies, as well as the health of our environment, our economies, and our cultures. When they function well, food systems have the power to bring us together as families, communities, and nations. But too many of the world’s food systems are fragile, unexamined, and vulnerable to collapse, as millions of people around the globe experienced first-hand during the COVID-19 crisis. When our food systems fail, the resulting disorder threatens our education, health and economy, as well as human rights, peace and security. As in so many cases, those who are already poor or marginalized are the most vulnerable. Some countries and regions face unique circumstances, which can increase their vulnerability.
In 2021, UN Secretary-General António Guterres will convene a Food Systems Summit as part of the Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. With only 10 years remaining, many of the 17 SDGs remain far out of reach. In many cases, unsafe or unsustainable food systems are part of the problem. The UN Food Systems Summit will serve as a turning point in the world’s journey to achieve all the SDGs. We know what we need to do to get back on track: Scientists agree that transforming our food systems is among the most powerful ways to change course and realize the vision of the 2030 Agenda. Rebuilding the food systems of the world will also enable us to answer the UN Secretary-General’s call to “build back better” from COVID-19. We are all part of the food system, and so we all must come together to bring about the transformation that the world needs
The need is urgent, and our ambition is high. The UN Food Systems Summit will launch bold new actions, solutions and strategies to deliver progress on all 17 SDGs, each of which relies to some degree on healthier, more sustainable and equitable food systems.
The Summit will awaken the world to the fact that we all must work together to transform the way the world produces, consumes and thinks about food. “We believe in a world where healthy, sustainable and inclusive food systems allow people and planet to thrive. It is a world without poverty or hunger, a world of inclusive growth, environmental sustainability and social justice. It is a resilient world where no one is left behind.” Said  AGNES KALIBATA, Special Envoy for the UN Food Systems Summit

Title: Upholding Human rights is Key to Recovering Better from COVID 19
Content: 10 December 2020
the pandemic had thrived because poverty, inequality, discrimination, and other human rights failures have created enormous fragilities in the society
COVID 19 pandemic has greatly disrupted the world’s global economy and day today lives of individuals. It has not only affected the health sector, but it also the social, economic and development sectors. It has however had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups including frontline workers, people with disabilities, older people, women and girls, and minorities. While marking Human Rights day, Civil society Organizations noted that the pandemic had thrived because poverty, inequality, discrimination, the destruction of our natural environment and other human rights failures have created enormous fragilities in the society.
“We are witnessing increased cases of sexual gender based violence, police brutality and enforced disappearances continue calling for accountability while the space for civil society continue shrinking” said the Director of Kenya Human Rights Commission.
While delivering the message by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the UN Resident Coordinator, Siddharth Chatterjee said More than seven decades on, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides an essential framework for the world to “recover better” from the COVID-19 pandemic
“People and their rights must be front and centre of response and recovery. We need universal, rights-based frameworks like health coverage for all, to beat this pandemic and protect us for the Day and every day, let’s resolve to act collectively, with human rights front and centre, to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and build a better future for all”.
Civil society activities said the universal Human Rights Declaration remain relevant today as it was at its adoption by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1948, as the framework to guide States in promoting, protecting and fulfilling human rights for all people during these uncertain times.
“Like Climate change emergency, COVID19 reminds us that we are bound together as one humanity, we can build a world that is more resilient, sustainable, and just." said the Special Adviser to the UN Resident Coordinator, Ms. Li Fung.
Also present at the event held at the University of Nairobi were the UK special Minister for African Affairs, James Duddridge, the Chair of Working Group on Human Rights Defenders, Stian Christensen, Deputy Ambassador of Sweden Caroline Vicini who called for gender equality and rights of women to be upheld if the sustainable development goals are to be achieved. `
The theme of Human Rights Day 2020 is “Recover Better – Stand Up for Human Rights”, highlighting the need to build back better from the COVID-19 crisis by putting human rights at the heart of recovery efforts. This is a call to action and for unity of purpose to tackle discrimination, address inequalities, encourage participation and solidarity, and promote sustainable development for the benefit of all.

Title: Katiba at 10: a landmark Constitution and a blueprint for deepening democracy
Content: 27 August 2020
The Katiba is ground-breaking in many ways.  First and foremost, it was borne out of extensive consultation by a wide cross-section of Kenyans who debated intensely and passionately to ensure a real people’s constitution.
On 27 August 2020, we mark the tenth anniversary of the New Constitution of Kenya – a landmark social contract inspired by citizens’ desire for a country characterised by participatory governance, inclusive development, human rights and the rule of law.
The Katiba is ground-breaking in many ways.  First and foremost, it was borne out of extensive consultation by a wide cross-section of Kenyans who debated intensely and passionately to ensure a real people’s constitution.
As recognised in Article 1, sovereign power is now vested in the people of Kenya.  Further, it gives prominence to national values and principles of governance, including the rule of law, democracy, public participation, human rights, equality, social justice, accountability and sustainable development.  Giving life to these principles, the Bill of Rights recognises and protects a spectrum of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and serves as the framework for social, economic and cultural policies.
The Bill of Rights guarantees economic, social and cultural rights – such as the rights to health, housing, water, education, freedom from hunger and a clean environment.  The Constitution also provides for specific protections and affirmative action for children, youth, persons with disabilities, minorities and marginalised groups, to promote their participation, representation and equal enjoyment of rights.  The authority of courts to uphold the Bill of Rights, and apply international law as part of the law of Kenya, is a critical feature to enable the people to claim and seek enforcement of their constitutional rights.
The guarantees in the Bill of Rights bear an unmistakable closeness to most of the issues identified in the global sustainable development goals, while the Constitution itself also reflects the United Nations principles and the human-rights based approach and commitment to equality and non-discrimination which underpin delivery of the United Nations mandate.  It is an affirmation that good governance is both an enabler and a powerful impetus for sustainable development.
It is in this spirit of shared convictions that, over the past decade, the United Nations country team in Kenya has partnered with the Government and the people of Kenya to support implementation of the Constitution and to advance transformative governance, sustainable development and human rights for all.  Adopting a whole of society approach, the United Nations has worked with national and county governments, independent institutions, civil society, community-based organisations, communities, private sector and humanitarian and development partners in pursuit of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in Kenya.
Devolved government – a key innovation of the Constitution – has been an important aspect of cooperation.  The devolved system of governance brings the exercise of Government functions closer to the people, to improve delivery of services and enhance public participation.  By establishing 47 county governments and devolving functions such as pre-primary education, health, water and sanitation, agriculture, cultural activities and environment protection, the Constitution underlines counties’ responsibility to lead on social and economic development processes for their populations. County governments spend 41 per cent of their resources on social services. This has contributed to the improvement in the following indicators over the first five years of devolution (2013-2018): the percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel increased from 62% to 70%; the proportion of children engaged in child labour dropped from 34% to 13%; and the net enrolment for early childhood development and education increased by over 10%.[1]  The prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children reduced to 26% in 2014, from 35% in 2008.
To continue these development gains, it is essential to ensure adequate allocation of resources to social sectors, and for counties to have increased capacity for evidence-based planning, budgeting and efficient public spending in social sectors most relevant to populations in need.  The United Nations is supporting the devolution process by helping counties to build institutional, policy and legislative frameworks for development, including gender-responsive budgeting and gender mainstreaming, improved service delivery based on results-based management principles, inclusive participation and human rights-based approaches.
The country has weathered various storms in implementing the New Constitution, but a number of successes have been recorded.  A case in point is the constitutional remedy for the low participation of women in politics and decision-making, with the ‘two thirds gender rule’ brought in to ensure that no more than two thirds of the members of elective public bodies shall be of the same gender.  There have been some notable improvements over the past ten years, but heightened efforts will be needed to fully realise the rule.

During the 2017 elections, there was a 7.7% increase in the number of women elected, but they still comprised only 9.2% of those elected to County Assemblies, the Senate and Parliament.  Women currently account for 23% of Members of Parliament, including women representatives.[2]

Gender equality needs to be driven at national and county levels, through the implementation of laws and policies guaranteeing women’s political rights, and facilitating their effective participation and representation in development planning.  County Integrated Development Plans provide an opportunity to put in place a framework for equality and inclusion, to effectively address inequalities and close the gender gap.

As we enter a new decade of constitutional implementation, the United Nations family in Kenya remains committed to continuing efforts in partnership with the Government and the people of Kenya.  The next decade coincides with the timeframe for the Sustainable Development Goals and the Kenya Vision 2030.  To realise these goals, it is imperative to harness the potential of all – in particular, women, youth, persons with disabilities, minorities and marginalised groups – as envisaged by the Constitution.

Public participation and inclusion will strengthen the central role of the people in the implementation of the Constitution and driving forward sustainable development, transformative governance and the promotion and protection of human rights in Kenya.

In turn, this will accelerate efforts to address inequalities and ensure that the development agenda leaves no one behind.

Title: Harnessing the Potential of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) in Africa Development
Content: 13 August 2020
Digital technology and innovation can help us deal with complex global challenges and achieve sustainable prosperity for humanity and our planet. But they can also drive us apart and fuel inequality.
Digital technology and innovation at large is transforming our world. Faster internet, satellite data and imagery, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made our lives and economies unrecognizable from just a generation ago. These technologies can help us deal with complex global challenges and achieve sustainable prosperity for humanity and our planet. But they can also drive us apart and fuel inequality. As governments adapt to this rapidly-changing technological environment, so must UNDP if it is to remain a trusted and effective partner.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union (AU) 2063 Agenda are ambitious plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. The achievement of these goals would be enhanced by the full implementation of the AU’s 10-year Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa (STISA-2024) that considers science, technology and innovation as multi-function tools and enablers for achieving continental development goals. Regrettably, it is clear that the actions we are taking in terms of science, technology and innovation are not yet making an impact across critical  sectors  such  as  agriculture, energy, environment, health, infrastructure development,   mining,   security   and   water   among   others  that  contribute  to  Africa’s transformation, , nor at the scale and pace needed to achieve the 17 Goals. We all must join forces, with multi-stakeholder platforms as the one that TICAD represents for Africa, and leverage new opportunities in science, technology and innovation to create the continent we are all striving for.
The potential of STI in Africa rests on building and/or upgrading research infrastructures; enhancing professional and technical competencies; promoting   entrepreneurship    and    innovation; and providing an enabling environment for STI development across Africa. There are emerging opportunities to accelerate progress in this regard, particularly in terms of what is sometimes referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution – demonstrating the magnitude of the change –, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchains and machine learning are transforming societies, economies, public and private sector organizations, and individuals across the globe.
These emerging technologies have the potential to advance sustainable development and lead to greater development impact – while also presenting a risk to drive us apart and fuel inequality.  As such, mobilizing public,  private  and  donor resources to finance Research and Development and creating an enabling environment for multi-disciplinary   and   multi-sectoral   collaboration in open  Innovation  and  Entrepreneurship remains the key to accelerating  Africa’s  transition  to  an  innovation-led,  Knowledge-based Economy.
Fostering innovation for accelerated socio-economic gain is now a priority for UNDP in Africa and our organization has just launched its first Digital Strategy, which is a call to action and innovation both for UN and our network of partners.
Financing the SDGs – both through public and private resources – is at the core of UNDP’s efforts. As a systemic challenge, it demands the re-orientation of how public and private actors interact with each other to achieve the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental.
The required collective efforts by governments, the private sector, philanthropy and civil society as well as the necessary re-shaping of markets to become more inclusive, equitable and sustainable must make use of technological advances and innovative financing approaches, in particular financing schemes that combine the resources and technical expertise of both the public and private sector.
Turning to intra-African trade, which has recently received a boost through the ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and can promote inclusion and equality, digitization can lower barriers to entry and help connect Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with global markets and value chains, providing the necessary services to facilitate their exports, such as simplified payments and logistics.
With the right policies in place, e-commerce in Africa could reach 75 billion USD by 2025 and could be of particular benefit to MSMEs, which constitute more than 80 per cent of African enterprises. Overwhelming successes are already emerging, such as Jumia, the “African Amazon”, which has become the continent’s first unicorn being valued at over 1 billion USD. However, for trade to take full advantage of technology and innovation, African countries must first close the digital divide and increase access to technologies in order to ensure the broader adoption of digital technologies.
African governments need to pursue industrialization by combining physical and digital infrastructure improvements. Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution requires urgent investments in human capital development that is tailored to the changing needs of businesses. With the rise in new technologies and automation globally, the continent is primed to exploit such opportunities because of a young and more educated population. YouthConnekt Africa, a multi-dimensional youth empowerment programme implemented in approx. ten African countries, and the complementary YAS! Youth for Africa and SDGs initiative that focuses on youth entrepreneurship on the continental level, are clear examples of this approach that UNDP supports.
The possibilities that are emerging to advance sustainable development in Africa by strategically applying science, technology and innovation – in SDG financing and trade, and beyond. UNDP is committed to work together to ensure this digital revolution leads to revolutionary solutions to the complex problems facing our word, including Africa.

Title: The UN and International Community united in fighting COVID-19 in Kenya
Content: 20 March 2020

Nairobi: The Government of Kenya, United Nations and International Community convened today at the UN Complex in Nairobi to combine their forces in their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya.
The United Nations Country Team in Kenya is in lockstep with the UN Secretary General’s call to action and it continues to mobilize full support to the Government of Kenya in its fight against the virus on all fronts.
Siddharth Chatterjee, UN Resident Coordinator to Kenya, said: “This crisis can only be solved through partnerships and we stand with the Government of Kenya and its people to fight COVID-19 in Kenya.”
As the COVID-19 outbreak takes hold in Kenya, the United Nations Country Team has continued support from the preparation phase to the current response in the areas of strengthening the Emergency Operations Centre, Coordination and Leadership, Case Management, Laboratory management, Surveillance strengthening, Communications and Resource Mobilization and Procurement. Dr Rudi Eggers, WHO Representative to Kenya is a key member of the National Public Emergency Steering Committee chaired by the Principal Secretary of Health.
The World Bank country director for Kenya, Felipe Jaramillo confirmed that his bank has allocated US$60 million to finance efforts to fight coronavirus in Kenya.
The United Nations is providing intense technical support to the coordination pillar of the National Task Force that developed the Kenyan COVID-19 Contingency plan, which has become the basis of all response activities. The UN has initiated an Incident Management System, in some cases repurposing some staff to assist in the COVID-19 response activities. A total of 15 technical officers have been seconded to the Ministry of Health in order to boost capacity as the response activities go countrywide.
One of the major issues during such emergencies is the availability of technical guidelines on how things should be handled. United Nations has been able to support the MOH in training of 34 County Rapid Response Teams and provided guidelines and the necessary tools. Another group of 32 level 4-5 clinicians from 9 counties were trained on critical care case management while another 33 frontline workers from level 4-5 health facilities were trained on infection control. The UN also supported the training of Health Promotion officers from all 47 counties.  WHO training materials have been used in the roll-out of training to all health workers across the country.
“As indicated by the WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, governments must do all they can to prepare for an eventual outbreak and respond rapidly to contain and isolate these initial cases: time is critical now,” Dr Rudi Eggers says.
As of yesterday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Kenya stood at seven since the time the government confirmed its first case on the 13th of March 2020. The Government of Kenya has already stepped up measures in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
The United Nations Secretary General Mr. Antonio Guterres has said, “All of us face a common threat – the coronavirus – COVID 19. This pandemic is a call to action – for everyone, everywhere. It’s also a call for responsibility and solidarity – as nations united and as people united. As we fight the virus, we cannot let fear go viral. Let’s overcome this common threat together”.
The convening of the entire United Nations family in Kenya and nearly 30 Ambassadors and Heads of International Cooperation in person and remotely is an incredible show of support and solidarity with the Kenyan response to Covid-19.
The European Union Ambassador to Kenya, Simon Mordue, said,” We stand with Kenya in solidarity in these challenging times and are swiftly reviewing our support to ensure that funds can be urgently mobilized to support the government’s efforts in addressing the health and socio-economic consequence of Covid-19.”
Today’s convening clearly demonstrated that the people of Kenya can count on the United Nations Country team and International Community as their ally in this fight.
Dr. Rashid Aman, the Chief Administrative Secretary in the Ministry of Health, stated, “Given the speed and scale of spread of Covid-19 that we have seen globally, the entire globe must stand together in this fight against the pandemic and stronger nations must stand by the weaker nations for us to succeed. The Government of Kenya appreciates the UN Country Team, World Bank, EU, and other Development Partners from the International Community for their support and solidarity.”

Title: United Nations Country Team deeply distressed by rising cases of terror attacks on schools, teachers and learners, especially in the north-eastern regions of Kenya
Content: 15 January 2020
The United Nations Country Team in Kenya is deeply distressed by the rising cases of terrorist attacks on schools, teachers and learners, especially in the north-eastern regions of Kenya.  While we stand in solidarity with the affected communities, we reiterate that acts of terror and hate are even more egregious when they target innocent, unarmed civilians including children.
The bombings of schools and the killing of civilians violate international humanitarian law.  We wish to remind all armed groups that whatever their grievances, they must uphold their obligations and cease targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, including schools.  Key services and programmes, delivered by the government and other partners, for children and communities should not be targets of armed combat.
It is especially troubling that the most affected regions are already lagging behind in school attendance rates. We recognize that school staff who are traumatised by such incidents face the agonising dilemma of whether they should continue in the job under such threats.  Acts of terrorism should not be another reason for the children in those regions to slip further behind.
As the UN Country Team in Kenya, we are determined to entrench our engagement with National and County Governments to implement the pillars of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, including addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, building capacity to prevent and combat terrorism and ensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law as the fundamental basis for the fight against terrorism.
We commit to working with other stakeholders as we pursue the UN value of making children’s human and civil rights a lived reality for all children in Kenya.

Title: Enhancing partnerships for impact
Content: 25 November 2019
The 2018-2022 UNDAF for Kenya was officially signed and launched by the three UNDAF co-chairs, Cabinet Secretary National Treasury, Cabinet Secretary Devolution, planning and ASALs and the UN Resident Coordinator (RC) on 26th June 2018. The UNDAF was developed and is implemented within the context of Delivering as One, as a collective response of the UN agencies and the Government of Kenya to coherently, effectively and efficiently realize the national development priorities. The Cooperation framework is embedded on the country’s blue print for development, the vision 2030 and national priorities as outlined in the Medium-Term Plan (MTP) III, the Big 4 Agenda and the Sustainable development goals.
This UNDAF has three Strategic Priority Areas that are aligned to the three MTP III Pillars (Political, Social and Economic) of the Government’s Vision 2030 : 1) Transformational Governance encompassing respect for the rule of law, improved security, and effective implementation of devolution, 2) Human capital development comprised of education ,training and learning, health, Multi-sectoral HIV and AIDS response, access to safe water and sanitation, social protection, gender based violence and violence against children, access to adequate housing and strengthening capacities for addressing disaster and emergencies and 3) Sustainable and inclusive growth focusing on a competitive and sustainable economic growth that is increasingly resilient, green, inclusive, equitable, and creating decent jobs and quality livelihoods for all.
Through this framework, the UN in Kenya will in the coming five years, commit a total of Ksh.197 billion (approximately $1.9 billion) to support the government realize development needs of the country. 58% of the estimate budget (about Ksh.116 billion) will support human capital development contributing to two of the GOK Big Four Agenda, namely housing and universal health coverage. 27% (about Ksh.50 billion) will support sustainable development and growth contributing to the other two agendas of food security and manufacturing. The remaining 15% (about ksh.30 billion) will focus on transformative governance, which is a key enabler of the Big Four Agenda as well as the MTP III.
The UNDAF 2018-2022 is building on innovative approaches, strengths, lessons learnt, and efforts initiated by the UN, National and County Governments, and development partners in Kenya. As such, the new UNDAF speaks to and intend to advance the UN Secretary General’s agenda on repositioning the UN system. Regarding strategic change and reforms, the new UNDAF will make even greater strides towards, expanding public private partnerships for SDG realization; deepen integrated programming, supporting counties and bordering countries going to the furthest first, to enhance the roots of cohesion and socio-economic transformation.
The UNDAF results and common budgetary framework, bringing all UN agencies in Kenya to Deliver as One (DaO) responds to the UN Secretary Generals call for optimizing resources and improving the effectiveness of the UN’s response to countries and regions. The UNDAF integrates the global programming principles and approaches of: leave no one behind; human rights, gender equality and women’s empowerment; sustainability and resilience; and accountability towards realization of SDGs. This UNDAF will strategize social inclusion as a principle to address inequality and socio-cultural discrimination, which are perceived as some of the root causes of exclusion and vulnerability in the country.
Siddharth Chatterjee, UN Resident Coordinator to Kenya, lauded the Government of Kenya for its leadership at both national as well as county level and underscored the meeting demonstrated the strong partnership between the UN Kenya Country Team and Kenya’s County Governments for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals agenda in Kenya in order to leave no-one-behind. The Resident Coordinator highlighted that over the period 2018 – 2019 the UN had provided US $205 million catalytic support towards UNDAF programming in support of Kenya’s Big Four agenda and the achievement of Kenya’s Vision2030
H.E Wycliffe Oparanya, Chairman of the Council of Governors, and Governor of Kakamega, shared his deep appreciation for Kenya’s long-standing partnership with the UN, and encouraged the UN to continue to advance its programming at County and grassroots levels in order to address the root causes holding back Kenya’s social economic development.
The Governors expressed their deep appreciation for the continued support from the UN Agencies and encouraged the need to deepen the engagement with all counties.
The forum acknowledged the need for stronger engagement with County Governments moving forward through a well-structured framework for engagement to ensure better coordination and improve impact.

Title: With an injection of USD 7 million, the days of Water Hyacinth in Lake Victoria Basin are numbered
Content: 28 October 2019
Kisumu - A major partnership between The Embassy of Russia, the United Nations in Kenya and the County Government of Kisumu will see the over 14,000 hectares of the Water Hyacinth in Lake Victoria cleared following an injection of USD 7 million by the Russian government.
The partnership programme dubbed: Sustainable Management and Utilization of Water Hyacinth in Lake Victoria Basin will be launched today in Kisumu. This programme will be implemented in the next 3 years.
A variety of activities around the lake have led to large-scale pollution of the world’s second-largest lake, with one of the effects being the proliferation of the water hyacinth (Eichhorniacrassipes) in the bays, especially within Kenya. The fast-spreading hyacinth is currently estimated to affect over 14,000 hectares of the lake, and though has severe economic consequences.
The programme is to be implemented by the Kisumu County Government with technical support of the UN Kenya Country Team. Based on their comparative advantage and core-expertise, FAO and UNDP will deliver together technical support. FAO will handle sustainable land management and environmental policy aspects while UNDP will focus on the economic utilization aspects.
The project will seek to attract private sector interest especially in the converted products from hyacinth, to providing inputs, equipment, finance, and development of markets. The overall goal of the programme is to benefit an estimated 4.5 million people sharing the lake in the five riparian counties of Kisumu, Busia, Migori. Homa Bay and Siaya.
The programme will focus on initiatives that: Transfer knowledge and skills to the communities living around the lake region with a focus on youth and women. The initial focus will be on Kisumu County and expansion to all counties within the Lake’s catchment is planned to ensure enough impact.
“This programme is part of the Government of Russia’s support for Africa’s Sustainable Development, the African Union’s Agenda 2063, Kenya’s Vision 2030, and Big Four Agenda. We are looking forward to partner with the Government of Kenya and UN Kenya Country Team to realize Kenya’s potential in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals” said Russia Ambassador to Kenya Dmitry Maksimychev.
“As the UN Kenya Country Team, we are moving to the next practical steps after the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference held in Kenya in November last year. I am delighted that UNDP and FAO will deliver as one UN Kenya’s ground-breaking support to improving livelihoods of millions of Kenyans living in the Lake region. Without the strong leadership of the Government of Kenya and support of the Russian Embassy, this would never have been possible and I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the UN Kenya Country Team” said UN Resident Coordinator to Kenya Siddharth Chatterjee.
“My County Government is grateful to its partners who have come in to help us address the water hyacinth challenges in Lake Victoria Basin and to smartly turn this challenge around into an opportunity for economic growth and improved well-being of our people living in Kisumu and the wider Lake Region” said Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o.
“I would like to applaud the Government of Russia and the UN family in Kenya for launching this new partnership in Kisumu and for the people of Kenya. This programme is a clear illustration that our partners are in lock-step with the Big Four development priorities of the Government of Kenya. As the National Government, we are committed to supporting this partnership towards a highly impactful outcome” said Hon Wamalwa, Cabinet Secretary of the Ministry of Devolution and ASALs

Title: Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa Commends UN Kenya Support to National Development Priorities
Content: 29 March 2019
NAIROBI, Kenya - Devolution and ASALs Cabinet Secretary Hon. Eugene Wamalwa has said that the reforms being carried out by the United Nations are enabling the global agency to align its activities better and coordinate more effectively in delivering on national development priorities.
As the co-chair of the UNDAF National Steering Committee, Mr. Wamalwa was addressing the heads of UN agencies in Kenya at a retreat that is reviewing the UN Country Team’s achievements, one year since the launch of the 2018 – 2022 UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) in June 2018.

“It is almost two years now since we started walking the journey together to develop what has now become one among the best-in-class UNDAFs. The UNDAF and Delivering as One in Kenya is a result of UN member states’ desire for increased coherence in development partnership, and a specific request by the Government of Kenya for stronger accountability for results”.
He said that the Government recognizes the UN leadership for its determination to ensure every project responds and aligns to priorities such as President Kenyatta’s Big Four development agenda.
The CS pointed out the Kenya-Ethiopia cross-border programme as an example of programmes that are using innovative approaches to solve emerging threats.
“This is a programme that will transform our borders from centres of conflict to centres of resilience,” he said. A similar programme will be launched along the Kenya-Uganda border.
Through its Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, the European Union (EU), is supporting the €68 million Cross-Border programme that is covering the entire length of the Kenya-Ethiopia border, south-west Somalia and the cross-border area between Western Ethiopia and East Sudan.
Between 2018 and 2020, various stakeholders including IGAD, the UN and governments in the four countries will implement projects that aim to promote stability by building up local-level peace and security structures and provide investment to support the socioeconomic transformation of the areas through cross-border trade, greater resilience and diversified livelihoods.
“For decades, the people of the border regions of Africa have grappled with violent conflict, climate shocks and marginalization, with the communities finding themselves with little prospects, a widespread sense of exclusion that predisposes them to radicalization and extremism,” said Mr. Wamalwa.
UN Kenya Resident Coordinator Siddharth Chatterjee said that under the UNDAF, 21 UN agencies based in Kenya will raise & contribute about US$1.9 billion to implement the new UNDAF.
He said that the UN and the Government of Kenya, through its Strategic Plan for Devolution, have put in place various initiatives for integrating and transforming communities in ASALs and cross-border areas, aiming to unlock the potential of the regions and accelerate national development.
Chatterjee added that, “The reforms being advanced by the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres are very keen on the nexus between peace and development, and in Kenya we are frontloading development approaches in those regions that have previously been at the periphery, in line with the SDGs mission of leaving no one behind and reaching the farthest first.”

Title: Deputy President William Ruto Hails United Nations Support for Big Four Agenda
Content: 13 November 2018
The Deputy President of Kenya, Hon. William Ruto today met with the United Nations Country Team in Kenya to discuss implementation plans for the UN Development Assistant Framework (UNDAF 2018-2022) which was launched in June 2018.
The UNDAF 2018-2022 is a result of the intensive consultations with participation from different national stakeholders including line ministries, county governments, private sector and civil society.  Over 100 institutions were involved in the drafting and review led by the Treasury, Ministry of Devolution and ASAL, and the UN.  The UNDAF 2018-22 is designed to support the government to deliver on the new Mid-term Plan III, the Big 4 Agenda and Vision 2030.
Over the next five years, the UNDAF 2018 – 2022 will act as a blueprint for the UN’s support in Kenya that will see 21 specialized UN agencies including the World Bank and IMF based in country contribute Sh 190 billion (US$1.9 billion) towards Kenya’s development agenda, providing comparative advantage to national development.
“The Government appreciates the UN for ensuring that the current UNDAF has identified those sectors in which we can invest strategically for future generations particularly Kenya’s youth, who are key to the Big Four Agenda,” said the Deputy President.
Emphasising on the importance of devolution as a mechanism for ensuring shared prosperity in Kenya emboldened by the UN’s full support;  the Deputy President noted that, the demonstrated solid partnership between the UN and various arms of government in the development of the UNDAF 2018-22 sets a good model for future collaboration between development partners, and national and county governments that will ensure that no Kenyan is left behind.
UN Resident Coordinator Mr Siddharth Chatterjee said that the UNDAF is a commitment by the UN in Kenya not only to replace fragmentation with cohesion but also to support the Government in its pledge to move those at the periphery of development to the centre.
“We are determined that in our time, we must lay the foundations on which the hard work of the youth will be rewarded with the chance to lift themselves out of poverty. That is what reaping the demographic dividend is about,” said Mr. Chatterjee.
At the core of the implementation strategy of the UNDAF 2018-22 is the Delivering as One which focuses, on a deliberate move to entrench coherence in messaging and impact of all UN agencies in the country to leverage and optimise available resources for effectiveness.
In the Framework’s budget, 59% is expected to support human capital development programmes. These are programmes within which two of the President’s Big Four, Housing and Universal Health Care, fall. The other two, Food Security and Manufacturing, fall within the economic pillar of UNDAF and will take up 27% of the budget.  The remaining 15% will go to transformative governance, which is a key enabler of the national priorities.

Title: Eulid Kipchoge Honoured as UN Person of the Year 2018
Content: 24 October 2018
NAIROBI, Kenya - World Marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge was today honoured as the UN Person of the Year 2018, with the UN body paying tribute to his promotion of the values of hard work and discipline among an increasingly disillusioned youth.
Widely acknowledged as arguably the greatest marathoner of all time, Mr. Kipchoge recently smashed the world record in by 1 minute 18 seconds, but it is his constant message of hope in a nation of a predominantly youthful population faced by challenges such as unemployment and lack of role models that moved the UN in Kenya to make him the 16th recipient of the Award.
“I believe Mr. Kipchoge deserves this Award not just for his achievements on the marathon course, but because he has consistently sent out the message that with dauntless persistence, human beings have no limit to what they can achieve,” said Cabinet Secretary Amb. Monica Juma, who was the Chief Guest at the presentation ceremony held at the UN compound in Gigiri.
In celebration of the United Nations Day which has been observed on 24 October, the UN in Kenya has awarded and recognized individuals who best represent the ideals of the world body every year since 2002.
Amb. Juma said that young Kenyans form the largest segment of the population, but they are growing up in tough circumstances, which the Government and the UN are addressing through the current UN Development Assistance (UNDAF 2018-2022).
 
“When the youth go about seeing the dark side of things, our future as a nation is equally grim,” she said.
The UN Kenya Resident Coordinator Mr. Siddharth Chatterjee said that Eliud Kipchoge was chosen for bringing out in an inspirational way the UN’s commitment to exploiting the power of sport in achieving the global sustainable development goals.
“In a continent where young people feel that very little is going for them, this message of hope, backed by the testimony of a phenomenal rise through sheer grit, could not find stronger expression than through Mr. Eliud Kipchoge,” said Mr. Chatterjee.
“We believe that by tracing his achievements and the single-minded pursuit of his dreams, young people in Kenya today will be able to look into the future, see beyond the obstacles and decide that better times are within their grasp,” he said while congratulating Mr. Kipchoge for the Award.
Accepting the Award, Mr. Kipchoge warned the youth against the temptation of expecting a big break that will set them on the path of fame and fortune.
“It takes extreme effort and many years to reduce one’s time even by five seconds when running.  Lasting achievements are based on small increments in doing the right thing,” said the champion, who has won all but one of his races since he started running the marathon.
The Person of the Year Award was last year won by Ms Umra Omar of Safari Doctors, who was recognized for her work in delivering primary healthcare to marginalized communities in her home County of Lamu.
Other past recipients include First Lady Margaret Kenyatta for her Beyond Zero Campaign and three-time World Half-Marathon champion. Tegla Loroupe for peace-building programmes in conflict zones.

Title: Gender Equality is High Priority for UN Development Goals in Kenya
Content: 18 October 2018
In the 2018- 2022 UN Development Assistance Framework for Kenya, Gender equality is addressed in all the 3 priority areas and in 11 of the 14 outcomes. The UN’s support broadly covers areas related to women’s equal political participation and representation; education access for girls at all levels; addressing the specific vulnerabilities of young women and women to HIV/AIDS; responding to and preventing Gender Based Violence (GBV) including Female Genital Mutilation (FGM); ensuring that disaster risk reduction programmes meet women and girls’ needs and supporting women’s access to productive assets and economic opportunities in safe work environments.   This is aligned with the country’s equality agenda as spelt out in the MTP III, the constitution, sector strategies on gender and county gender plans.
The UN will also invest resources and technical assistance to address gender needs in flagship initiatives such as the Turkana Joint Programme; the Marsabit-Borana Cross-Border Programme and the SDG Philanthropy Platform. It will also invest in analysis to improve our understanding of the cost of gender gaps to the Big 4 focus areas. This will in turn support the government and other stakeholders in designing gender responsive interventions.
Development and implementation of stand-alone gender equality programmes that bring together several agencies to provide a multifaceted response to a particular issue such as the Government of Kenya – UN Joint Programme on the Prevention and Response to GBV.
The UN’s investment in gender equality in Kenya, is centred on a theory of change that seeks to:
•Create an enabling policy, legal, and institutional environment
•Promote social transformation to address the sociocultural drivers of gender inequality and
•Invest in women’s empowerment and women’s movements, to drive their full participation in Kenya’s social, economic and political development.
To achieve the above, the UN has set up a Gender Working Group (GWG) to coordinate and influence the UN System to Deliver as One on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment (GEWE). To ensure accountability of the UN Leadership to gender equality, the GWG provides technical support related to gender mainstreaming in the UNDAF.
The GWG also supports implementation of the recommendations of the UNCT SWAP-Scorecard by the UNCT and other key inter-agency groups. The GWG interfaces with other coordination mechanisms including the Government-led Gender Sector Working Group (GSWG) and the Development Partners Group on GEWE. Regular meetings are held to exchange information, mobilize resources and coordinate GEWE interventions by delivering as one

Title: Kenya and the UN agree on the next phase of the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF 2018-2022)
Content: 27 June 2018
The Government of Kenya and the United Nations has agreed on the next phase of the UN Development Assistant Framework (UNDAF) 2018-2022. In this new collaboration, the UN in Kenya has pledged to increase resources to a tune of USD $ 1.9 billion, from USD $1.2 billion previously allocated to the just concluded UNDAF 2014-2018. The new UNDAF 2018-22 was jointly signed on 27th June 2018,  by the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury and Ministry of Planning, Mr. Henry Rotich, Cabinet Secretary for Ministry of Devolution and Arid and Semi-Arid (ASAL) Areas, Mr. Eugene Wamalwa and the UN Resident Representative, Mr. Siddharth Chatterjee.
The UNDAF will focus on supporting the government’s development agenda and priorities; strategically on the following; Transformative Governance, Human Capital Development and Sustainable Development – with tangible impact projects across 14 outcomes.
The new UNDAF which has been highlighted by the UN Secretary General, António Guterres as one of the new-generation UNDAFs, strategically provides collective programmatic support and a comparative advantage to the Kenya’s development priorities; as it is aligned to President Kenyatta’s ‘Big 4 Agenda’ development agenda (housing, health, employment and manufacturing), the UN reforms agenda recently approved by member states; and, the SDGs.

The UNDAF was developed in an inclusive and participatory manner, with over 100 institutions involved in the discussions and review of the document. The intensive consultations involved participants from national and sub-national levels, including line ministries, state and non-state agencies, private sector and civil society, with the UN Country Team putting aside their individual mandates to make sure that the government priorities are echoed in a way that the framework envisions its’ support towards the delivery of the new Mid-term Plan III, the Big 4 Agenda, theVision 2030 in a spirit to ‘Leave No one Behind’

At the core of the implementation strategy will be the Delivering as One, in line with the UN reforms, as a deliberate focus to entrench coherence in approach, messaging and impact of all UN agencies in Kenya, while leveraging on available resources for effectiveness towards the realisation of inclusive, equitable and sustainable human and economic development.

“Agenda 2030, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals is an ambitious global undertaking, and the Government appreciates the partnership with the UN in Kenya as we focus on promoting inclusive growth and sustainable management of natural resources in the next five years,” said CS Henry Rotich.

UN Resident Coordinator Mr Siddharth Chatterjee noted that the rolling out of devolution, with its mission of progressive distribution of resources towards reaching the farthest first, set Kenya ahead in the SDG clarion call of Leaving No One Behind.

“This UNDAF is a commitment from the UN in Kenya to not only to replace fragmentation with cohesion within the UN system, but also to support the Government in its pledge to move those at the periphery to the centre, in order to achieve progress for all Kenyans,” said Mr. Chatterjee, UN Resident Coordinator to Kenya.

The Resident Coordinator added that, all the outcomes in this UNDAF, whose achievements will be evaluated every year, are designed to be strategic enablers and the UN in Kenya has its sleeves rolled up to support initiatives that will ensure that Kenyan families are protected from crippling medicare bills, that no Kenyan goes to bed hungry, there is access to affordable homes and manufacturing sector is expanded to provide more jobs for the youth.
