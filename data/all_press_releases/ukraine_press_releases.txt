Title: In Ukraine UN Human Rights Monitors Report the Highest Monthly Number of Civilian Casualties in Almost a Year

07 June 2024
Kyiv, 7 June 2024 – May saw a significant monthly increase in casualties with 31 per cent more civilians killed than in April marking the highest number of civilian casualties in nearly a year, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said today.
“Over half of the casualties in May occurred in Kharkiv city and region where Russian armed forces launched a new ground offensive on 10 May,” said Danielle Bell, the head of HRMMU. “The main reason for the high number of civilian casualties is the use of air-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas such as communities near the frontline and Kharkiv city,” she added.
Bell noted that attacks in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, have been particularly deadly but that no place in Ukraine was safe. In its monthly update on civilian harm, HRMMU said conflict-related violence killed at least 174 civilians and injured 690 in Ukraine in May, the highest number of civilian casualties since June 2023.
On 23 May, missiles struck a printing house in Kharkiv city, killing seven employees and injuring at least 21 civilians, mainly women. Two days later two air-dropped bombs struck Epitsentr, a large home improvement center, in Kharkiv city, killing 19 civilians and injuring 54, including many employees. On 31 May, multiple missiles hit a residential area in Kharkiv city, including a multi-story building, killing nine civilians and injuring at least 15.
“The attacks on a shopping center and printing house in Kharkiv city highlight the stark vulnerability of civilians engaged in everyday activities, where even routine tasks like buying supplies to repair damaged homes can result in the loss of life and loved ones,” said Bell.
HRMMU visited the sites of the attacks, documented the damage to civilian property and infrastructure, and verified the number and status of civilian casualties in these and other attacks.
One 45-year-old woman told HRMMU that she tried to seek shelter after a large explosion in her neighborhood shattered the windows in her ground-floor apartment around midnight on 30-31 May. Before she managed to leave the apartment, however, a second explosion caused a wall in her apartment to collapse, trapping her leg underneath rubble. A fire broke out in the building, but emergency workers managed to rescue her. As first responders took her to the hospital, she heard two more explosions in the neighborhood. She said that she felt lucky to be alive. The attack, however, killed several of her neighbors who lived on floors above her.
The intensification of hostilities in Kharkiv region has dramatically affected frontline communities, including by causing the near complete destruction of the town of Vovchansk. HRMMU conducted 92 interviews with evacuees who described massive attacks with artillery, aerial bombs and missiles that caused them to shelter for days in basements without basic necessities before risking their lives to evacuate. A couple who evacuated with their elderly parents said that Vovchansk was in ruins, with street-by-street destruction as the city came under fire.
HRMMU said in May the vast majority of civilian casualties (92 per cent), and damage to educational and health facilities (96 per cent) continued to occur in Government-controlled territory.
The rise in deaths and injuries was accompanied by intensifying attacks on energy infrastructure, forcing Ukraine to introduce rolling blackouts across the country, compounding the difficulties faced by millions of Ukrainians who have now lived through almost 28 months of war.
HRMMU documented 24 attacks on energy infrastructure (19 attacks in Government-controlled territory and 5 in territory occupied by the Russian Federation), destroying or damaging power generation plants and electricity substations and temporarily disrupting access to electricity and water supply. HRMMU also documented six attacks on railway infrastructure in Government-controlled territory in May.

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS ATTACKS IN KHARKIV CITY
I strongly condemn the attacks that hit the residential area of the Novobovarskyi district in Kharkiv late last night, killing and injuring people, including children, and causing significant destruction to residential buildings. The repeated strikes in the same area also affected rescue workers rushing to help affected people.
I extend my deepest condolences to the families impacted by the non-stop attacks by the Russian Federation’s Armed Forces.
The escalation of hostilities in Kharkiv and in other parts of Ukraine continues to devastate the lives of families, making humanitarian response efforts even more critical and difficult.
International humanitarian law strictly prohibits attacks on civilians or civilian infrastructure. Living in fear of air strikes at home, at work or while shopping is not normal.

Title: RUSSIA’S INVASION PLACES A GENERATION OF UKRAINIAN CHILDREN UNDER SEVERE STRAIN
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
31 May 2024
The United Nations in Ukraine condemns the severe violations of children's rights caused by Russia's invasion. More than two years since the escalation of the war, heavy hostilities continue to inflict immense physical, psychological, and emotional harm on children, disrupting their lives and jeopardizing their future.
“The most recent wave of Russian attacks in the Kharkiv Region underscores the dreadful cost of the war, and the horrors that the children of Ukraine are facing. Many have been killed or injured, and thousands forced to flee from their homes with nothing but the clothes on their backs and the profound stress from having witnessed a truly terrifying situation,” said Denise Brown, the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine. Since the escalation of the war in February 2022, the UN Human Rights Office has verified that over 600 children have been killed and more than 1,420 injured across Ukraine. However, the actual toll is likely much higher.
Children spend endless hours in bomb shelters due to indiscriminate attacks. In the two years since the escalation of the war, children in front-line communities spent between 3,000 and 5,000 hours – equivalent to four to seven months – in bomb shelters, creating stress and making life extremely difficult for them. Forced displacement compounds the risks they are exposed to, including separation from family, and increased risks of trafficking, exploitation, and abuse, which can, in addition, lead to severe stress and psychological trauma.
The war has severely impacted the education system in Ukraine. The persistent pattern of destruction that has marked more than two years of war forces many schools to adopt online or underground classes. The situation is particularly concerning in the front-line regions. In the current academic year, nearly 1 million children – a quarter of all Ukrainian children enrolled in school – have been unable to attend in-person learning, particularly affecting those with disabilities or special educational needs. Frequent air raid alarms and power outages have further disrupted their education, leading to significant learning losses and long-term implications for their development.
Access to health-care services has also been limited due to damage to health facilities and displacement of health workers, severely impacting children's health. Displaced families and those living close to the front line struggle to obtain necessary medical care, particularly for pregnant women and newborns. Additionally, disrupted vaccination efforts have increased the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.
The UN is supporting children in Ukraine
The United Nations in Ukraine, along with its partners, are working to assist children in Ukraine. In 2023, for example, the UN provided vital primary health care to over 5.1 million children and mothers and education services to over 2.5 million children and teachers. “The UN remains committed to supporting the people of Ukraine whose lives have been torn apart by the war. But no amount of aid will bring back what a generation of children is losing because of Russia’s invasion,” concluded Denise Brown.

Title: CIVILIAN CASUALTIES RISE AMID CONTINUED DEADLY RUSSIAN ATTACKS ON KHARKIV, UN HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORS SAY
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 May 2024
Kyiv, May 26, 2024  -  Recent attacks in Kharkiv city, including Saturday’s strike on a large shopping center, fit into a pattern of increasing civilian casualties in Kharkiv region and city, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said today.
Since Russian armed forces launched a ground offensive into Kharkiv region on 10 May, HRMMU has verified that  45 civilians have been killed and 189 injured in Kharkiv region and city.
Two air-dropped munitions struck the Epitsentr hypermarket in Kharkiv city during a busy shopping afternoon on Saturday, killing at least 16 and injuring 43, according to the local authorities. Several store employees were killed or injured. Search operations were continuing on Sunday.  Another attack Saturday afternoon near a café and barbershop in the city center reportedly injured 25 people.
“The Russian Federation’s intensified military offensive has resulted in significant civilian casualties over the past two weeks, especially in Kharkiv region and city,” said Danielle Bell who heads HRMMU. “The victims of the most recent attacks were employees of a hypermarket and a printing press, along with shoppers.”
HRMMU visited the site of the strike on the shopping center and other places recently attacked and collected information to verify the number of civilian casualties.
The  Epitsentr strike was the second attack causing multiple fatalities in Kharkiv city in just three days. On Thursday, a missile hit a printing plant, one of Ukraine’s largest, killing 7 employees and destroying more than 50,000 books. Over the past several days the residents of Kharkiv have lived with daily air-raid alerts amid intensifying Russian attacks.
The attacks on Kharkiv came on the heels of a ground offensive that triggered a wave of new displacement when Russian troops swept into several villages to the north of the city, with thousands coming to Kharkiv in search of greater safety.

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN STRONGLY CONDEMNS TODAY’S ATTACK ON A BUSY SHOPPING CENTRE IN KHARKIV CITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY

I am appalled and shocked by the terrifying news arriving from Kharkiv. This afternoon, in broad daylight as people - despite all the horrors they endure every day in this city - were trying to go about their day, their lives were shattered by yet another attack by the Russian Armed Forces. The strike hit a busy shopping centre with scores of civilian casualties and massive damage to civilian facilities.
This is utterly unacceptable.
These strikes by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation hitting civilians and civilian infrastructure must stop.
Intentionally directing an attack against civilian infrastructure is strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law.
Civilians must be protected.

Title: WHO Installs Modular Heating Units in Ukrainian Hospitals to Prepare for Winter
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 May 2024
The third year of war in Ukraine has severely impacted public health. While emergency health support is crucial, it is equally important to strengthen the health system to endure ongoing adversity. Preparing for the coming winter is essential to ensure that Ukraine's health-care system remains operational amidst prolonged adversity.
Thanks to a generous donation from the Government of Germany, the WHO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine (MoH), has started installing modular heating units in several hospitals prioritized by the MoH. The goal of this project is to enhance the resilience and efficiency of healthcare facilities by installing modern heating systems. These systems ensure uninterrupted healthcare services during winter and potential blackouts, providing a stable and safe environment for patients.
"In the face of ongoing missile attacks and bombings by Russia, we are actively working to ensure that our hospitals are protected and can operate without interruption under any circumstances. To achieve this, the work is ongoing to provide medical institutions with generators and energy equipment such as solar panels, boiler houses, wells, and more. Thanks to our collaboration with partners, we have successfully installed modular boiler rooms in hospitals across the Chernihiv region. These heating installations will enable medical institutions to heat their facilities and be prepared for potential challenges effectively. We aim to support our medical institutions, enhance their sustainability, and ensure that patients receive uninterrupted medical care." -  said Dr Victor Liashko, Ukraine’s Minister of Health.
As part of a larger initiative to install eight units, two modular heating units have been installed this week in hospitals in the Chernihiv region. These units serve as alternative heating systems for the entire hospital and are crucial for over 54,000 people across multiple districts in the Chernihiv region.
"Modular heating units will support hospitals amid emergency conditions, which are a daily reality for some regions. This initiative provides relief to local communities by ensuring their central hospitals will be heated and functional during the third winter of war in Ukraine, despite continued attacks on public infrastructure. The availability of high-quality health services and medicines offers a sense of security and normalcy, giving people the confidence to stay in their homes," said Dr. Emanuele Bruni, WHO Incident Manager in Ukraine.
The first installation was in the Kharkiv region, where public infrastructure is at high risk of continued attacks. Another unit is being installed in the Odessa region, and four more are in the preparation stage.
Each installation requires significant infrastructure work to connect it with the entire hospital system. Hospitals can choose between firewood heating and pellet systems, depending on their preferences and available fuel types. Firewood heating units are cheaper and simpler but require manual fuel loading and large storage space. In contrast, pellet systems are fully automated, more powerful, require less storage space, and have a longer burning period.
"Germany remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting Ukraine through this challenging period. By supporting the provision of modular heating units to hospitals, we aim to ensure that essential healthcare services remain uninterrupted during the harsh winter months. This initiative not only addresses immediate needs but also strengthens the long-term resilience of Ukraine's health system in the face of ongoing adversity", said the German Ambassador to Ukraine Martin Jäger.
The Government of Germany is providing a generous financial support for this project.

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS ATTACKS IN KHARKIV CITY AND REGION, KILLING AND INJURING CIVILIANS
I am deeply disturbed by the news from Kharkiv City and the Kharkiv Region, where, yet again, attacks by the Russian Armed Forces killed civilians, caused injuries, and destroyed homes, businesses, transport and other civilian infrastructure.
My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones due to the strikes.
These appalling attacks in the Kharkiv Region have been going on for almost two weeks non-stop. Thousands of civilians, including older people and people with disabilities, have been forced to flee, leaving their entire lives behind. People who were seeking safety have faced, once again, the trauma of seeing homes destroyed and people injured or killed.
UN and humanitarian partners support evacuated people and those affected by strikes, providing urgent assistance.
Yet, the war across Ukraine continues to ruin lives and deepen humanitarian needs. International humanitarian law is clear — the safety of civilians and civilian infrastructure must be guaranteed.

17 May 2024
"Leave No One Behind: Equality, Freedom and Justice for All"
On this International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, the UN in Ukraine celebrates the Ukrainian LGBTIQ+ community and human rights defenders who are working tirelessly to promote and build a future where equality, freedom and respect for the human rights and dignity of all members of society are a reality.
The theme of this international day ‘Leave No One Behind: Equality, Freedom and Justice for All’ is a strong reminder to all of us that all Ukrainians, in all their diversities, including the LGBTIQ+ community must have equal rights in civil, political, social, and cultural aspects of life. LGBTIQ+ people are also volunteers, teachers, doctors, activists, fundraisers, and aid workers who are taking upon themselves the huge task of supporting the people of Ukraine whose lives have been upended by Russia’s invasion.
Despite undeniable progress, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people still face persistent discrimination, violence, and marginalization here and across the world. Russia’s invasion has heightened the challenges, particularly for those living in occupied territories. LGBTQI+ people were forced into displacement, faced more obstacles in accessing essential services and were exposed to increased risk of violence, including conflict-related sexual violence.
Even during these difficult times, Ukraine has taken necessary steps to strengthen the legal framework to recognize and protect the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, including legislative initiatives to address discrimination and hate crimes and to recognize same-sex partnerships. On behalf of the UN in Ukraine, I commend these initiatives and strongly encourage Ukrainian lawmakers to make every effort to approve these national laws that recognize same-sex relationships and diverse gender identities. Ukrainian prosperous and peaceful future must be one where discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity has no place.
The UN is also determined to also continue ensuring that our programmes in Ukraine, either humanitarian aid or projects to promote recovery from the devastation caused by the war, take into consideration the specific needs of all Ukrainian people, including the LGBTIQ+ community. We are working to ensure no one is left behind in Ukraine’s journey towards recovery.
But breaking all barriers to ending marginalization, injustice, discrimination, and violence requires a collective effort. We will continue working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Ukrainian people, civil society organizations, and the Government to build a world of peace, respect, dignity, and human rights.

This comes a day after I came back from Kharkiv, where I saw the appalling consequences of the intensified attacks by the Russian Federation's Armed Forces on thousands of people who had to flee for their lives, leaving everything they own behind. Many are older people who fear they will never be able to go back.

Title: FORUM TO FOSTER AN INCLUSIVE AND COMMUNITY-DRIVEN RECOVERY OF UKRAINE BRINGS TOGETHER NEARLY 500 PEOPLE IN KYIV TODAY

10 May 2024
The Inclusive Community Recovery Forum brought together nearly 500 people in Kyiv today, including Government officials, local authorities, civil society organizations, community leaders, and national and international development partners. Participants engaged in robust discussions, sharing insights and best practices to facilitate a journey towards a recovery from the devastation caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that is community-driven and inclusive.
Organized by the Government of Ukraine, the Government of Germany, and the United Nations, the forum marked an important milestone towards the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Berlin, scheduled for June 2024, offering communities across Ukraine the opportunity to identify recommendations for the upcoming discussions.
Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to cause immense human suffering, death and widespread destruction, the Ukrainian people have taken upon themselves the colossal task of ensuring their communities can get back on their feet and recover from the massive impact of the war. The Government of Ukraine is leading this process.
Throughout the day, the forum discussed ways to enhance collaboration between government, civil society, and development partners, as well as promoting social inclusion and cohesion within communities. From rebuilding infrastructure to promoting gender equality, combating discrimination, and advancing economic recovery, participants showcased their remarkable commitment to building a brighter future for Ukraine.
Amongst other discussions, the group stressed the need for and presented examples of initiatives to ensure that the voices of women, people with disabilities, and marginalized groups – including the Roma and LGBTQI+ community are heard, and their specific needs are taken into consideration.
UN's support to recovery in Ukraine
In 2023, the UN in Ukraine scaled up its support to recovery efforts across the country, implementing over US$500 million worth of initiatives and programmes ranging from supporting small businesses, repairing homes, schools, and hospitals to building new energy infrastructure and beyond. This is more than twice the previous year’s amount and brings the total expenditure to nearly $703 million since the UN started the implementation of the Transitional Framework in September 2022.
Throughout the year, the UN and partners ensured the installation of new heating, water, and energy infrastructure that served 6 million people; supported more than 2,100 small and medium businesses; repaired nearly 1,000 schools; trained almost 320,000 people with skills to help them find new jobs; cleared almost 200,000 square metres of land of mines, explosives and debris; in addition to providing essential services, including primary health care to over 5.1 million women and children. To support long-term recovery, the UN further provided integrated policy advice and technical assistance to the Government, local authorities, communities and civil society organizations, including women-led groups on issues such as environment, agriculture, access to justice, human rights and gender equality.
The work was possible thanks to donors who contributed, between 2022 and 2023, nearly $1.1 billion of the total $1.9 billion the UN requested for our recovery programmes in Ukraine.

"The humanitarian situation in Ukraine is deteriorating because of the heavy and escalating hostilities that are ravaging front-line communities. This new intensification of Russian attacks has a direct and immediate impact on the people of Ukraine. People have to flee, their homes are destroyed, their communities are bombed.
As we provide emergency assistance in front-line areas, we are also moving towards recovery in some of the regions of Ukraine where the situation allows. It means we go beyond bringing supplies to provide services. And we are working closely with the Government to ensure that the national systems, which were already strong but suffered the impact of the war, become stronger to help communities recover from the devastation caused by Russia’s invasion."

Title: UN Human Rights Monitors Alarmed by Intensifying Attacks on Ukraine’s Power Grid, Railway System
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
29 April 2024
Kyiv, 29 April 2024 – The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) today expressed concern over the mounting civilian toll of intensifying attacks by the Russian Federation armed forces against Ukraine’s electric power infrastructure, as well as a new pattern of attacks on the railway system.
Since March 22 human rights monitors have documented four waves of attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure that have struck at least 20 facilities, killing 6 civilians and injuring at least 45.  This past Saturday alone missile attacks damaged four thermal power plants critical for electricity generation, two of them located in western Ukraine, hundreds of kilometers from the frontline.
During the past weeks, attacks on railway facilities across Ukraine killed at least 11 civilians and wounded dozens in several regions of Ukraine, including Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Donetsk and Cherkasy.
“These attacks have caused civilian deaths, and they also jeopardize essential services such as power generation and rail transport, further compounding the risks and harm affecting the civilian population of Ukraine," said the head of HRMMU Danielle Bell.
“Attacks on the railway system threaten a key mode of transportation that people in Ukraine depend on for personal travel and transport of essential goods, particularly given the restriction on all air traffic and limited access to seaports,” she added.
HRMMU says the civilians killed and wounded in the recent attacks, including railway and power station workers, were either on the infrastructure or in its immediate vicinity.
Last week alone saw three attacks affecting railway facilities resulting in deaths and injuries, it said. On 25 April, in Udachne, Donetsk region, a missile strike damaged railway infrastructure, killing 3 railway employees and injuring another 4 just hours after another missile damaged railway facilities in Smila, Cherkasy region, reportedly injuring several people. At least another 11 civilians were injured in a separate missile attack in Balakliia, Kharkiv region which damaged the railway station and a train that had just arrived. The week before 8 civilians were killed in attacks impacting railway facilities in the cities of Synelnykove and Dnipro.
Power outages frequently occurred in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on energy infrastructure, affecting millions of households across the country, and also leading to interruptions to the water supply. Rolling power cuts were implemented in some areas such as Kharkiv impacting education schedules, particularly for students who rely on online learning.

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN STRONGLY CONDEMNS ATTACKS IN DNIPRO CITY AND OTHER PARTS OF THE REGION
I vehemently condemn the attacks by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which today hit Dnipro City and other parts of the Dnipro Region, east of Ukraine, bringing new suffering to the people of Ukraine.
Strikes occurred today's early morning, damaging homes and killing and injuring dozens of people. This came just two days after a deadly attack in Chernihiv City, north of the country, and once again, there are reports that children were among those killed.
Aid workers in Dnipro are already on the ground, helping the affected people.
The attacks are yet another example of a grave and reprehensible disregard for human life. International Humanitarian Law protects civilians and civilian infrastructure.

Title: UN Ukraine Annual Recovery Results Report 2023
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 April 2024
At a Glance
In 2023, the UN in Ukraine scaled up its support to recovery efforts across the country, implementing over US$500 million worth of initiatives and programmes ranging from supporting small businesses, repairing homes, schools, and hospitals to building new energy infrastructure and beyond. This is more than twice the previous year’s amount and brings the total expenditure to nearly $703 million since the UN started the implementation of the Transitional Framework in September 2022.
Throughout the year, the UN and partners ensured the installation of new heating, water, and energy infrastructure that served 6 million people; supported more than 2,100 small and medium businesses; repaired nearly 1,000 schools; trained almost 320,000 people with skills to help them find new jobs; cleared almost 200,000 metres2 of land of mines, explosives and debris; in addition to providing essential services, including primary health care to over 5.1 million women and children. To support long-term recovery, the UN further provided integrated policy advice and technical assistance to the Government, local authorities, communities and civil society organizations, including women-led groups on issues such as environment, agriculture, access to justice, human rights and gender equality.
The work was possible thanks to donors who contributed, between 2022 and 2023, nearly $1.1 billion of the total $1.9 billion the UN requested for our recovery programmes in Ukraine. In 2024, more support is required to enable the UN to continue implementing activities to promote inclusive community recovery and investments in human capital, ensuring that all people in Ukraine can contribute to and benefit from recovery efforts.

Title: SAUDI ARABIA SUPPORTS 140,000 UKRAINIANS WITH HOT MEALS THROUGH THE UN WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 April 2024
KYIV/RIYADH – The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief) contributed $10 million to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to support Ukrainians affected by the war with daily hot meals in 1,200 institutions across the country.
The agreement was signed between HE Dr Abdullah Al Rabeeah, Royal Court Advisor and Supervisor General of KSRelief, and WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain.
Saudi Arabia’s donation will help provide 50 million meals for residents in institutions supported by WFP, such as hospitals, shelters for internally displaced persons, orphanages, psychiatric and geriatric facilities, and other public or private organizations caring for the most vulnerable Ukrainians. Many of these institutions have faced increased strain and budget shortfalls because of the war and massive internal displacement.
“We’re grateful that KSrelief chose to support a vital component of our emergency programmes in Ukraine- which provides relief to the most vulnerable Ukrainians while also strengthening the local institutions and organizations that care for them,” said WFP Country Director a.i. in Ukraine, Marianne Ward.
"We are pleased to be part of this important emergency programme to respond to the urgent humanitarian needs of the affected population in Ukraine. KSrelief humanitarian assistance will provide lifesaving food assistance to the most vulnerable communities throughout the country," said Engineer Ahmed Al Baiz, KSrelief's Assistant Supervisor General of Planning and Development.
The contribution will enable WFP to procure and deliver approximately 7,600 metric tons of food commodities, including flour, pasta, buckwheat, oatmeal, peas, sugar, and oil – all of which are bought inside Ukraine to support the local economy and food systems. These commodities are then complemented by other foods bought directly by the institutions to prepare nutritious daily meals for residents and people under their care.
Over the next six months, WFP plans to provide food assistance to 210,000 vulnerable Ukrainians through its institutional feeding programme. The contribution from KSrelief will cover a significant portion, approximately 67 percent, of the programme's needs - supporting 140,000 Ukrainians.
In the last year WFP’s institutional feeding programme supported 460,000 Ukrainians in Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Chernivtsi, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Rivne, Sumy, Ternopil, Vinnytsia, Volyn, Zakarpattia, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr oblasts of Ukraine.
Institutional feeding is one of many ways WFP supports Ukrainians affected by the war- WFP also distributes food boxes in areas closest to the frontline, where food is hard to find or very expensive, distributes cash assistance to vulnerable Ukrainians across the country, and is supporting the safe release of mined agricultural land in the Kharkiv region to help farmers and food producers resume work. WFP also chartered 25 vessels to export Ukrainian grain to countries in need through the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the Grain From Ukraine initiative.

Title: JOINT STATEMENT BY THE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION ROMA GROUP AND THE UNITED NATIONS IN UKRAINE ON THE OCCASION OF INTERNATIONAL ROMA DAY
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 April 2024
OUR THOUGHTS AND SOLIDARITY WITH THE UKRAINE ROMA COMMUNITY
Today, on International Roma Day, the International Coordination Roma Group and the United Nations in Ukraine join communities across the world to celebrate Roma culture, history and language, and to draw attention to the challenges Roma people are faced with in their daily lives.
On this day, we would like to share our solidarity and support Roma communities in combating stereotypes and deep-rooted discrimination, many times exacerbated by multiple and combined forms of prejudices, such as those faced by Roma women and Roma who have been displaced because of Russia’s invasion. We also want to pay tribute to Roma leaders who are promoting Romani identity and protecting Roma rights. Across Ukraine, Roma activists, most often women, have taken on leadership roles to ensure humanitarian response reaches all those impacted by the war and are making remarkable contributions towards social cohesion.
Regrettably, Roma people still often face stigmatization, hate speech and prejudice, which not only violate their dignity and rights but severely hamper their access to essential services, including health, education, documentation, housing, education and public utilities. Young Roma women are especially vulnerable, and face heightened risks of violence and abuse, including gender-based violence and child marriage. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated these pre-existing problems and challenges faced by Roma communities.
Nevertheless, Roma are an important part of Ukrainian society and the country's rich multicultural historical heritage. Therefore, it is extremely important to ensure equal rights to all, ensure that no one will be left behind, and that Roma’s specific needs and challenges are taken into consideration.
Roma civil society, and especially women-led organizations, is now well placed to cooperate with local and regional authorities as they embark on ambitious plans for community-level early recovery and durable solutions to ensure people can take back their lives and recover from the devastation caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine.
To this end, we proudly support the work of Roma mediators and civil society organizations who have worked hard and effectively to reach the most discriminated Roma communities to support their empowerment, and access to rights and services. We welcome the adoption of the National Strategy for Roma Inclusion and the National Action Plan for Roma, calling for the full implementation and development of related local Action Plans. It must be a priority for authorities at all levels to support the meaningful and effective participation of Roma communities in decision-making on gender-responsive and inclusive recovery. These policy instruments are essential to place Roma inclusion high on the Ukrainian agenda and to support Ukraine's accession to the European Union.
The ICRG and the United Nations in Ukraine are committed to continuing to support and facilitate such initiatives and efforts that are in line with European and international human rights standards.
Opre Roma! Bahtalo Internacionalno Romano dives tumenge!

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNED ATTACKS IN KHARKIV AND ZAPORIZHZHIA
Not a day passes by without strikes by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, crushing the lives of people across Ukraine.
Yesterday and today, dozens of civilians in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia were, once again, killed or injured. And once again, first responders who rushed to help were also affected by a series of strikes.
It is unacceptable that places which are designated to help people in need – centres where those who have fled their homes live and receive support, or offices of aid organizations – are hit, hampering access to humanitarian assistance for those who depend on it.
I condemn this apparent pattern of continued attacks impacting civilians and civilian infrastructure. Civilians, aid workers and first responders helping war-affected civilians must be protected. International humanitarian law must be respected.

Remark of the Humanitarian Coordinator, Resident Coordinator to Ukraine, Denise Brown, at the Ukrainian Women's Congress "Path to Recovery: Women's Participation at the Local Level"
The situation in Ukraine is incredibly difficult. Russia’s invasion has set back women, girls, LGBTQI+ and Roma people's rights and equality.
The women of Ukraine are strong, determined, courageous and very focused. They are at the forefront of the front-line humanitarian response and are advocating for the recovery of their communities.
Together, we are working hard to elevate women’s voices. It feels hopeful.

Title: With Spring’s Arrival Ukrainian Farmers Face Deadly Danger from Mines the UN Says
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
04 April 2024
KYIV, 4  April 2024  –  The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission (HRMMU) today said 10 civilians died and 18 were injured in March alone in incidents involving mines and explosive remnants. Seven of the victims were agricultural workers.
“Ukrainian farmers face an elevated risk of death and injury as they begin their agricultural work during the spring season due to fields potentially being contaminated with mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW)," said Danielle Bell who heads HRMMU.
Since the onset of the full-scale armed attack in February 2022, HRMMU has documented 1,158 civilian casualties—360 killed and 798 injured—due to mines and ERW in Ukraine. The spring of 2023 saw a spike in such casualties, particularly affecting farmers engaged in cultivating their land.
HRMMU has warned that recent incidents herald a potential increase in mine-related incidents this year, mirroring last year's pattern. In recent weeks in the Kherson and Kharkiv regions—territories occupied by the Russian Federation in 2022 and reclaimed by Ukrainian armed forces in the fall of 2023—mines or ERW have killed three agricultural workers and injured four.
On 29 March, a 50-year-old man, a single parent who had lost his wife last year, was killed when his tractor triggered what appeared to be an anti-tank mine buried in a field in a village in the northern Kherson region. A resident who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter reported to HRMMU that the explosion dismembered the man and ignited the tractor. De-miners found another anti-tank mine in the vicinity following the incident. This tragedy left the man's 15-year-old son orphaned.
Today marks the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action, under the theme ‘Protecting Lives, Building Peace.” The high number of civilian casualties from mines and ERW in Ukraine in March highlights the increasingly dire threat ERW and mines pose to Ukraine’s civilian population, including farmers.
HRMMU said every effort must be made to meticulously map and mark the locations of mines and ERW, and to prioritize the demining of contaminated areas as swiftly as possible.

Title: UN Says Russia Continues to Torture, Execute Ukrainian POWs
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 March 2024
Kyiv, 26 March 2024 — The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) today published new findings about torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian captivity and a sharp rise in credible allegations of executions of captured Ukrainian POWs.
In a report on the human rights situation in Ukraine in December, January and February, HRMMU detailed findings from interviews with 60 recently released Ukrainian POWs.
“Almost every single one of the Ukrainian POWs we interviewed described how Russian servicepersons or officials tortured them during their captivity, using repeated beatings, electric shocks, threats of execution, prolonged stress positions and mock execution. Over half of them were subjected to sexual violence,” said Danielle Bell who heads HRMMU. “Most POWs also recounted the anguish of not being allowed to communicate with their families, and being deprived of adequate food and medical attention.”
The findings about the treatment and conditions in Russian captivity confirm previously established patterns of torture and ill-treatment, deaths in custody, incommunicado detention, enforced disappearances, and dire conditions of detention. Accounts from recently captured and released Ukrainian POWs show that such violations continue.
HRMMU also recorded credible allegations of the execution of at least 32 Ukrainian POWs in 12 separate incidents between December 2023 to February 2024, significantly more than in any previous period. HRMMU has independently verified three of the incidents.
In the report, HRMMU also shared findings from interviews with 44 Russian POWs in Ukrainian captivity, saying that while the POWs did make any allegations of torture at established internment facilities, several provided credible accounts of torture and ill-treatment in transit places after their evacuation from the battlefield.
In addition to the findings on POWs, the three-month report detailed continued violence against civilians in Ukrainian territory occupied by the Russian Federation, citing, among other violations, killings of civilians, arbitrary detention, and restrictions on freedom of expression.
In government-controlled territory, the report highlighted the Ukrainian government’s continued prosecution and conviction of individuals for activities conducted under Russian occupation that can be lawfully compelled by the occupying Power. It also cited incidents of violence against the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
Civilian casualties remained high during the three-month period, with conflict-related violence killing 429 civilians and injuring 1,374. A significant intensification of missile and loitering munitions attacks by the Russian Federation in late December and January caused a spike in civilian casualties in areas far from the frontline, while the overall civilian casualty numbers remained comparable to the previous period.

I am outraged by the magnitude of today’s attacks by the Russian Armed Forces on energy infrastructure across Ukraine.

Title: UN Human Rights Monitors Voice Alarm as Russia Renews Attacks on Power Grids in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 March 2024
Kyiv, 22 March 2024 – The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) today expressed alarm over the large-scale coordinated attack by the Russian Federation on energy infrastructure across Ukraine that left more than 1.5 million users without electricity across Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, Odesa, Donetsk, Sumy and Kirovohrad, and also disrupted water supply in some areas.
“This morning’s attack is the largest single-day attack in more than one year directly targeting Ukraine’s vital power and water infrastructure, with potentially devastating effect for the country’s civilian population,” said Danielle Bell who heads HRMMU.
Rescue operations continue across the country, following the onslaught of multiple types of missiles and drones launched throughout the early morning hours. So far five people have been reported killed and 25 injured in four regions, including at least two employees of energy facilities. Ukraine’s largest dam, located in Zaporizhzhia city was also damaged, but stable. One power transmission line feeding the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant lost power temporarily.
The attacks against power installations come one day after Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, came under a large-scale missile attack that caused injuries and damage across the city. Yesterday’s barrage of more than 30 missiles represented one of the largest attacks on Kyiv in recent months.
HRMMU cautioned that destabilizing the energy infrastructure across an entire country  would have an immense impact on the civilian population, potentially depriving them of services essential for their survival.

Title: UN REPORT DETAILS ‘CLIMATE OF FEAR’ IN OCCUPIED AREAS OF UKRAINE, AS THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION MOVES TO CEMENT CONTROL
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
20 March 2024
GENEVA (20 March 2024) – The Russian Federation has created a stifling climate of fear in occupied areas of Ukraine, committing widespread violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in an effort to consolidate its control over the population living there, according to a UN Human Rights Office report issued today.
The report, based on more than 2,300 interviews with victims and witnesses, details the measures taken by the Russian Federation to impose Russian language, citizenship, laws, court system, and education curricula on the occupied areas, while at the same time suppressing expressions of Ukrainian culture and identity, and dismantling Ukraine’s governance and administrative systems in these regions.
“The actions of the Russian Federation have ruptured the social fabric of communities and left individuals isolated, with profound and long-lasting consequences for Ukrainian society as a whole,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.
Although the Russian Federation began its occupation of Ukrainian territory in Crimea in 2014, the report focuses on the situation in the territory of Ukraine that fell under Russian occupation following the full-scale armed attack launched by the Russian Federation on 24 February 2022. From the onset, Russian armed forces, acting with generalised impunity, committed widespread violations, including arbitrary detention of civilians, often accompanied by torture and ill-treatment, in some cases amounting to enforced disappearances. While Russian armed forces initially targeted individuals perceived as posing a security threat, over time a wider net was cast broadly to include any person perceived to oppose the occupation.
Russian forces also used force to quash peaceful protests, restricted free expression, imposed strict controls on residents’ movements, and pillaged homes and businesses.
The occupying authorities shut down Ukrainian internet and mobile networks, TV and radio channels, with traffic re-routed through Russian networks, which allowed control over information accessible online and prevented the population from freely receiving information from independent news sources, families or friends. People were encouraged to inform on one another, leaving them afraid even of their own friends and neighbours.
The report notes that certain actions of the Russian Federation suppressing expressions of Ukrainian identity, have impacted children in particular. The Russian Federation replaced the Ukrainian curriculum with the Russian curriculum in many schools and introduced textbooks with narratives seeking to justify the armed attack on Ukraine. It has also enlisted children into youth groups to inculcate Russian expression of patriotism.
People in occupied territory have been pressured and coerced to take Russian passports. Those who refused were singled out by the occupying authorities, experienced harsher restrictions on their freedom of movement, and were progressively denied employment in the public sector, as well as access to healthcare and social security benefits.
The report also details the situation in areas recaptured by Ukrainian forces in late 2022, including Mykolaiv and parts of Kharkiv and Kherson regions, to which the UN Human Rights Office has subsequently had access.
“The invasion, occupation and subsequent recapture by Ukraine of these areas left behind damaged homes and infrastructure, land contaminated by mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW), pillaged resources, a collapsed local economy and a traumatized, mistrustful community,” the report says.
It notes that the Government of Ukraine has faced the challenge of rebuilding and restoring services in these areas. It has also had to contend with legacies of violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law during the occupation, including through a wide range of war crime investigations.
The report expresses concern that an overly broad and imprecise provision of the Criminal Code of Ukraine has led to people being prosecuted under charges of collaboration with the occupying authorities for actions that can be lawfully compelled by the occupying authorities under international humanitarian law, such as work to ensure essential services. Other prosecutions have been undertaken against persons who cooperated with occupying authorities under serious coercion or duress.
“Such prosecutions have tragically led to some people being victimised twice – first under the Russian occupation and then again when they are prosecuted for collaboration. This risk of potentially facing prosecution has sown fear among those who lived, or still live, under occupation and reinforces divisions,” the High Commissioner warned, urging Ukraine to revise its approach to such prosecutions.
The High Commissioner once again called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its armed attack against Ukraine and withdraw to internationally recognised borders, in line with the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly and with international law.-.
“Given the scale and depth of the violations suffered by those under occupation, a comprehensive approach to accountability that includes both criminal justice and wider measures promoting truth, and reparation, and which contributes to non-recurrence is needed. The international community should support Ukraine in all these aspects,” Türk said.

Title: Ukraine: UN Commission concerned by continuing patterns of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 March 2024
Two years after the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, civilian suffering is mounting as a result of Russia’s disregard for basic principles of humanitarian law and its human rights obligations, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine said in its report published on Friday.
The Commission found new evidence that Russian authorities have committed violations of international human rights and international humanitarian law, and corresponding war crimes, in areas that came under their control in Ukraine.
The Commission is concerned by the continued use of explosive weapons in civilian areas. The multiplicity of such attacks confirms a pattern of disregard by Russian armed forces for possible harm to civilians.
The report assessed the grave impact on civilians of the fighting in and the siege of Mariupol at the outset of the full-scale invasion. Satellite imagery provides indication of wide-spread destruction of whole urban areas of the city. Residents described unbearable suffering endured during relentless shelling and aerial bombardments which caused large-scale death, injury, and destruction. After emerging from shelters, civilians reported seeing dead bodies strewn on the streets and in the rubble of their homes. Data obtained by the Commission indicates that at least 58 medical infrastructure buildings and 11 power stations were damaged or destroyed in Mariupol.
More generally, recent indiscriminate attacks violating international humanitarian law committed by Russian armed forces have led to civilian casualties and the destruction and damage of civilian objects, including of protected objects such as hospitals and cultural property. Often, Russian armed forces failed to take feasible precautions to verify that the affected objects are not civilian.
”We are concerned at the scale, continuation, and gravity of violations and crimes that the Commission has investigated and the impact on victims and the affected communities,“ said the Chair of the Commission, Erik Møse.
New evidence strengthens the Commission’s previous findings that torture against civilians by Russian authorities in Ukraine and in the Russian Federation has been widespread and systematic.
The current report focuses on torture against Ukrainian prisoners of war and describes cases of horrific treatment of such prisoners in several detention facilities in the Russian Federation. Victims’ accounts disclose relentless, brutal treatment inflicting severe pain and suffering during prolonged detention, with blatant disregard for human dignity. This has led to long-lasting physical and mental trauma.
One Ukrainian soldier, who was detained and tortured by Russian authorities in several detention facilities, recounted his experience in the correctional colony in the town of Donskoy, Tula region, where he was repeatedly subjected to torture and left with broken bones, broken teeth and gangrene on an injured foot. “I lost any hope and the will to live,” the soldier said, adding that he had tried to kill himself but perpetrators subjected him to further beating. After his release, the soldier has been hospitalized 36 times.
Investigations found additional evidence concerning the unlawful transfer of children to areas under Russian control.
The report documents incidents of rape and other sexual violence committed against women and a girl in circumstances which also amount to torture. It also details incidents of torture with a sexualised dimension and threats of rape against male prisoners of war.
The report also describes a few violations of human rights by Ukrainian authorities against persons suspected of collaboration with Russian authorities.
The Commission strongly condemns all violations and corresponding crimes. Its current findings confirm the necessity to continue investigations, including to determine whether some of the situations identified may constitute crimes against humanity.
Finally, the Commission reiterates the importance of ensuring that perpetrators are identified and held accountable. Bringing perpetrators to justice is crucial but so is attending to the needs of victims. Therefore, the Commission also emphasizes the significance of other dimensions of accountability, such as truth, reparations, and guarantees of non-recurrence.
The report reflects the Commission’s findings during its second mandate. The Commission will present its report to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva early next week.

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS ATTACKS IN ODESA THAT KILLED OR INJURED SCORES OF CIVILIANS AND FIRST RESPONDERS
I am appalled by the horrible tragedy that struck Odesa City hours ago when scores of civilians and first responders were killed and injured in attacks by the Russian Federation.
My thoughts are with their families and with all the residents of Odesa who have already suffered too much from this war.
The attack came in the middle of a busy Friday and was immediately followed by another, impacting rescuers, including a health worker, who rushed to help.
The loss of lives and injuries inflicted on civilians and those selflessly risking their lives to save them is utterly unacceptable.
International humanitarian law requires the protection of civilian population, and launching an attack knowing that it would be disproportionate is a breach of this law.
The civilian toll of the Russian Federation's war on Ukraine continues to grow, all efforts must be taken to stop the deaths and suffering of civilians.

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS A STRIKE ON A RESIDENTIAL APARTMENT BUILDING IN KRYVYI RIH, DNIPRO REGION, CAUSING DOZENS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES
About an hour ago, an attack struck the city of Kryvyi Rih in the Dnipro Region, central Ukraine, damaging a multi-storey building and burying residents under the rubble.
Dozens of civilians, including children, are among the casualties. Humanitarian organizations are already on site, providing emergency support.
I am appalled to know that families were just getting together to have dinner and spend a quiet evening at home just to see their homes damaged and their loved ones hurt.
There appears to be a pattern of attacks across Ukraine and in front-line regions, impacting homes and civilian infrastructure, killing and injuring civilians who were just living their lives.
Russia’s war on Ukraine has exacted a devastating toll on the Ukrainian civilians, who continue to pay the highest price possible. International Humanitarian Law is clear: civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.

Title: IT IS TIME TO FURTHER SCALE UP SUPPORT TO PROMOTE THE RECOVERY OF UKRAINIAN COMMUNITIES RIPPED APART BY RUSSIA’S INVASION – UN

11 March 2024

The Vice-Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine, Oleksandr Kubrakov, and the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, jointly chaired today the second meeting of the Steering Committee for Community Planning, Durable Solutions and Recovery of Ukraine. The Committee is a platform to strengthen coordination and complementarity between humanitarian and recovery efforts in Ukraine. It will ensure that communities devastated by Russia’s invasion have the right support to get back on their feet.
“Humanitarian aid remains a lifeline for millions of people in Ukraine, particularly those living along the front line. However, where conditions allow, with the Government, we have transitioned from providing exclusively humanitarian assistance to supporting the recovery of communities ripped apart by Russia’s Invasion,” said Denise Brown. She added that it is time to further scale up this support, explaining that in some parts of Ukraine, like the Sumy and Mykolaiv regions, with the strong leadership of regional and local authorities, participation of civil society organizations, and support from the UN and the international community, people can start rebuilding their lives.
During today’s meeting, the Deputy Heads of Mykolaiv and Sumy Regional Administration presented their experience of transitioning from humanitarian aid to an approach that also integrates activities to promote economic and social recovery, creating the conditions for people to return and life to continue as before the war. The UN-led Community Recovery Fund is supporting some of these activities.

Title: Ukraine: Restoring scientific infrastructure will cost over $1.26 billion (UNESCO)
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 March 2024
Paris, 11 March 2024 – A study released by UNESCO estimates the cost of restoring Ukraine’s public scientific infrastructure at more than $ 1.26 billion. It reveals that 1,443 buildings and laboratories, as well as 750 pieces of scientific equipment, have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war in February 2022. Ukraine’s scientific community has experienced significant setbacks and a drop in scientific funding.
Read the full study here.
Before the Russian invasion, Ukraine was internationally renowned for its important contributions to fields like Computer Science, Nuclear Physics and Astronomy. From 2015 to 2019, the total volume of scientific publications (excluding social sciences, arts and humanities) increased by 45%. In AI and Robotics alone, Ukraine produced 6,214 publications between 2012 and 2019 (UNESCO 2021 Science Report).
According to the new study published today by UNESCO and the Junior Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, a total of 1,443 buildings belonging to 177 scientific institutions have been damaged or destroyed in the past two years. Restoring these buildings will cost more than $ 1.21 billion – including $ 980.5 million for universities alone as these have suffered the greatest losses.
The Kharkiv region's scientific infrastructure has been the most severely affected, with the highest damage costs borne by the Yaroslav Mudryi National Law University ($ 116.5 million) and the O. M. Beketov National University of Urban Economy ($ 104.1 million).
Much essential equipment has been destroyed or stolen
In addition to the buildings themselves, over 750 pieces of scientific and technical equipment have been damaged, with 643 items damaged beyond repair. This includes equipment used in a wide range of research activities. The total cost to restore this essential research equipment is estimated at $ 45.9 million.
The temporary occupation of territories by Russian forces is also having a major impact: 18 scientific institutes have had to relocate, some of which were conducting studies on local biodiversity and ecology which cannot continue remotely.
The situation around the Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants, near Zaporizhzhia, is of particular concern. Essential equipment for monitoring the state of the nuclear industry has been stolen or destroyed, including a unique radiological laboratory which controls radiation levels. The loss of this monitoring equipment represents a major security threat for the wider region.
A significant setback for Ukraine’s scientific community
The war has dispersed Ukrainian scientists across the country and even abroad, and their working conditions have deteriorated. In February 2022, the public research sector employed 88,629 researchers. Since then, 12% (10,429) of these researchers and professors from 524 institutions and universities have been forced to either relocate elsewhere within Ukraine (4,887) or abroad (5,542). Germany and Poland currently host the highest number of Ukrainian scientists in exile. The number of scientists employed by Ukraine’s public research sector has dropped by 4,958 (5,3%).
About 30% of Ukraine’s scientists are now forced to work remotely. This includes both emigrants and internally displaced personnel, such those forced to flee areas most affected by the bombardments: Kharkiv, Kyiv, Sumy, Dnipro, Odesa and the Zaporizhzhia region.
A growing lack of funds
Funding for science has also been significantly reduced. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, gross domestic expenditure on research and development shrank by 38.5% between 2021 and 2022, from $ 2019.5 million to $1242.1 million.
Since 2021, the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, representing 450 affiliated institutes, has seen a 48% reduction in its budget. This has forced the suspension of multiple research programmes and led to the weakening of many research groups and teams. Average monthly salaries have dropped by 39% and many researchers have been forced to work part-time.
Over the past two years, the displacement of scientists and budget cuts have affected Ukraine’s scientific output, including publishing activity, as well as the level of collaboration with member states of the European Union, members of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership and countries in Africa and Asia.
On 11 March, UNESCO is convening a meeting at its headquarters (Paris, France) at which scientists from Ukraine and beyond will discuss the study's findings with the Organization’s Member States, and consider the next steps in UNESCO's support for Ukraine.

THEY INSPIRE ME
The women of Ukraine, their determination, have truly inspired and encouraged me since the day I arrived in this country.
In each and every one of my many travels across Ukraine, whether it is to a war-torn community close to the front line or a town in the West where people fleeing the horrors of Russia’s invasion sought refuge, I see and hear stories of determination, hope and solidarity led by strong Ukrainian women. I am a witness to the fact that women in Ukraine – at all levels – refuse to give up and are relentless in their work to promote a better future for their country.
I have been inspired by women in leadership positions, both at the national Government and local level, like the women representatives I met in front-line towns like Kherson, Mylove or Orikhiv, who spare no effort and overcome tremendous challenges to bring some relief to their communities torn apart by the war. It motivates me to see that women are the backbone of the humanitarian response and work non-stop to help their communities under extreme hardship, like the doctor I met in Siversk, in the Donetsk Region. Despite all the risks, she decided to stay there, fearing not the bombs and missiles but the fact that it would be, otherwise, almost impossible for people in her community to access health care. I met so many mothers who had to learn how to support their children who could no longer go to school, at the same time as, with compassion, caring for the sick, the disabled, the elderly and filling the gaps left by a social system massively disrupted by the war.
I met in Kramatorsk, Kharkiv and Uzhhorod so many fierce and inspiring women leading organizations and movements advocating for the rights of the people of Ukraine, and striving to ensure no one is left behind, particularly the most vulnerable, including people with disabilities, the Roma or LGBTQIA+ community.
And again, they are taking up these massive challenges at a time when they face higher levels of unemployment, a larger and persistent gender pay gap, heightened risk of gender-based violence and obstacles to accessing essential services.
Women are as important at the decision-making tables as they are at the frontlines of their communities. For this reason, the UN is committed to continuing our efforts to support them and create platforms at different levels to ensure women have a leading role in Ukraine’s economic and social recovery.

Title: Ukraine Suffers Deadliest Attack For Children in Months UN Says
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
04 March 2024
Kyiv, 4 March 2024  - Twelve persons, nearly half of them children, died when a drone or its remnants struck a nine-story residential building in the southern city of Odesa on Saturday the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said today.
“The attack killed five children, the majority under age three, making it the deadliest incident for children in more than nine months,” said the head of HRMMU, Danielle Bell.
“At least three families suffered multiple losses, including a mother with her child, a father with his child, and parents with three children, demonstrating the continued horrendous impact of Russia’s war on Ukraine on civilians, particularly children and families who are among the most vulnerable to these long-range munitions,” she added.
HRMMU staff who visited the site shortly after the attack on Saturday found desperate relatives and rescue teams trying to reach family members buried under the rubble from the partially collapsed building. The team saw domestic items hurled out of the apartments by the force of the blast stuck on tree branches underneath. Survivors, who ran out of the building covered in blankets, anxiously waited outside to hear from the rescuers.
According to HRMMU, more than 10,000 civilians have been killed and over 20,000 have suffered injuries since the Russian Federation launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine more than two years ago but HRMMU cautions that the real number could be significantly higher. HRMMU says most of the casualties have been caused by explosive weapons with wide area effect such as missiles, drones, and artillery shells.

Title: Russian Federation’s decade-long occupation of Crimea marked by widespread violations
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
28 February 2024
Kyiv, 28 February 2024 – The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) has documented serious human rights and humanitarian law violations since the Russian Federation illegally annexed Crimea, an autonomous region of Ukraine, in 2014. These violations persisted throughout 10 years of occupation, as the Russian Federation consolidated its control over the peninsula.
In a report issued today, HRMMU said the Russian Federation has unlawfully imposed its citizenship, laws, and institutions on Crimea’s population across all spheres of life, suppressing opposition and dissent. The report cites examples of steps taken by the Russian Federation to restrict the civic space and limit fundamental freedoms. Crimean Tatar leaders, perceived as opposing the occupation of Crimea or the Russian Federation policies, were among those particularly affected by the measures.
While Crimean Tatars, who fled the peninsula in the wake of the illegal annexation, have been barred from returning to their homeland, many Russians have been resettled in Crimea, in an apparent attempt to change the peninsula’s demographic structure. Large-scale expropriations of public and private property have been implemented without compensation or regard for international law.
“Over the past decade, we have documented efforts by the Russian Federation to impose the Russian language, culture, and institutional framework on Crimea while at the same time taking actions to erase the peninsula’s rich cultural, linguistic, and religious heritage,” said the head of HRMMU, Danielle Bell.
The report says opposition to the efforts by the Russian Federation to consolidate its hold on Crimea has been met with harsh reprisals. Individuals who opposed or challenged the occupation were subjected to human rights violations, including enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment. HRMMU says it documented 104 cases of enforced disappearance and 55 cases of torture affecting pro-Ukrainian activists, journalists and Crimean Tatars.
The occupying authorities in Crimea have suppressed freedom of expression, including the expressions of minority cultures and identities, and severely curtailed the freedom of religion of minority groups, particularly those opposing official narratives, the report said.
“Our findings on the human rights situation in Crimea, which has endured Russian occupation for more than a decade now, are not only alarming but they are also a grim harbinger of the devastating and lasting impact Russian occupation may have on other occupied regions of Ukraine,” said Bell.

Title: Over 8 million women and girls in Ukraine will need humanitarian assistance in 2024
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 February 2024
Two years of Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine has taken thousands of lives, caused untold destruction, displaced millions, traumatized a generation, torn families and communities, and devastated the economy.
The total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine is estimated by the World Bank, European Commission, United Nations and the Government of Ukraine at USD 486 billion over the next decade. This war, like all wars, takes a bigger toll on women and girls, who disproportionally carry its burden.
Since the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion, an estimated 3,238 women and girls have been killed and 4,872 injured; while 56 per cent of approximately 4 million internally displaced are women. Predictions for this year are sombre, with women and girls accounting for 56 per cent of those expected to need humanitarian assistance (8 million women and girls). These continued attacks on women and their livelihoods are unacceptable.
As we mark this tragic two-year milestone, women in Ukraine face increased challenges in accessing security, justice, social services, mental, sexual and reproductive health services, employment, and other essential services. 72 per cent of people registered as unemployed are women. The war has also heightened the risks of gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, human trafficking, and intimate partner violence.
Amidst the unprecedented challenges of war, women have become the backbone of Ukraine’s economy. Currently, one out of every two businesses in the country is founded by a woman. In 2023 alone, Ukrainian women led the creation of over 10,000 new companies. Additionally, more than 62,000 women are serving in the military, including 43,479 on active duty and over 5,000 stationed at the frontline.
“As women continue to suffer the consequences of the war in Ukraine, they need support, security, and most of all, peace.  Their resilience throughout has been enduring and remarkable.  I reiterate UN Women’s solidarity and admiration for every woman in Ukraine who is supporting her family, community and country whether through the provision of humanitarian assistance, or leadership of contributing to recovery and reconstruction,” highlighted Sabine Freizer Gunes, UN Women Representative in Ukraine.
Women and women-led organizations are playing a significant role in providing humanitarian aid, supporting their communities and sustaining the economy.
“As an internally displaced person and professional psychologist, I have been helping other women to overcome their problems, including forced displacement, violence, and unemployment. In my role of coordinator for a project in the city of Sambir we organize a variety of activities, including psychological and psychotherapeutic groups, art classes, and English language lessons”, explains Anastasiia Pyrohova from Women's Perspectives, one of the 40 civil society organizations supported by UN Women.
UN Women works in Ukraine providing humanitarian response to more than 45,000 women and girls as well as 100,000 dependents indirectly supported in 2023 through life-saving humanitarian assistance, as well as psychological support, legal aid, and referrals to social services.  In 2023, UN Women disbursed USD 10.6 million to support women and women-led civil society organizations nationwide. UN Women also cooperates closely with the government and civil society to further advance laws and policies that support gender equality and women’s empowerment. Women are also being economically empowered through livelihood recovery support, skills development, business support, and access to employment as part of initiatives like the “Women's Entrepreneurship Expo”. Despite the ongoing violence, women in Ukraine are pushing forward to create a more gender-equal society and deserve our support.***

Title: Türk deplores horrific human cost as Russia’s full-scale invasion enters third year
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 February 2024
GENEVA (22 February 2024) – The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has exacted a horrific human cost, inflicting immense suffering on millions of civilians, UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said on Thursday.
Russia’s full-scale armed attack on Ukraine, which is about to enter its third year with no end in sight, continues to cause serious and widespread human rights violations, destroying lives and livelihoods,” he said.
In its latest report, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) has verified 30,457 civilian casualties since 24 February 2022 – comprising 10,582 killed and 19,875 injured, with the actual numbers likely to be significantly higher.
Millions have been displaced, thousands have lost their homes, and hundreds of medical and educational institutions have been damaged or destroyed, significantly impacting people’s rights to health and education. “The long-term impact of this war in Ukraine will be felt for generations,” said Türk.
This month marks not only two years since Russia’s full-scale armed attack, but also 10 years since it illegally annexed Ukraine’s Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.
Over the past two years, the UN Human Rights Office has documented widespread torture, ill-treatment and arbitrary detention of civilians by Russian armed forces. Summary executions, enforced disappearances and repression of the right to freedom of expression and assembly have also been documented in occupied territory.
In addition, interviews with over 550 former Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilian detainees by HRMMU have indicated the commission of serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by Russian armed forces, including summary execution and widespread torture.
Since 24 February 2022, the already dire human rights situation in occupied Crimea has worsened, with a crackdown on those criticising the occupation. The UN Human Rights Office will release a report on the decade-long Russian occupation next week.
“The ongoing Russian assault does not exempt Ukrainian forces from their own obligations to respect international human rights law and international humanitarian law,” said the UN Human Rights Chief. During the past two years, the Office has documented a number of violations committed by Ukrainian military and security forces, albeit a fraction of the scope of those perpetrated by Russian forces. Türk acknowledged that the UN Human Rights Office is continuously engaging with Ukrainian authorities to address these issues.
The High Commissioner called for all violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law to be thoroughly and independently investigated, and accountability and reparations to victims ensured.
He renewed his call on the Russian Federation to cease immediately its continuing armed attack on Ukraine, further to its obligations under international law and the UN Charter, and emphasised the urgency of achieving a just peace.
Türk also appealed again to the Russian Federation to allow the UN Human Rights Office and other independent international organisations full access to all those who have been deprived of their liberty in the context of the armed conflict.

Title: UNIDO and the Government of Ukraine launch industrial diagnostic study to guide Ukraine's recovery
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
21 February 2024
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), in collaboration with the Government of Ukraine, has today launched the UNIDO Ukraine industrial country diagnostics study at an event titled “Rebuilding Ukraine’s Industry” at the United Nations House in Brussels, Belgium.
Responding to the request of the Government of Ukraine, the diagnostic study is crucial for laying the groundwork for Ukraine’s sustainable industrial recovery. This launch marks a significant step towards the forthcoming transformative and cross-sectoral UNIDO green industrial recovery programme, which has so far garnered substantial support from European Union Member States, including Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, as well as Japan and Switzerland.
The launch event in Brussels served as a unique platform for key stakeholders from Ukraine, the EU, and UNIDO to discuss and strategize on the essential steps needed for the country’s future industrialization and green recovery. Attendees had the opportunity to engage in exchanges setting the stage for a collaborative effort towards rebuilding a resilient and sustainable industrial sector in Ukraine.
Mr. Gerd Müller, Director General of UNIDO, voiced the necessity of this study: “Ukraine needs our assistance to become strong and resilient. UNIDO brings its knowledge and services to support this effort. Our diagnostic study and our green industrial recovery programme tell us how to do this.” He reminded of the importance of coming together to create solutions, stating that UNIDO is “ready to partner with the EU to ensure a better future for Ukraine.”
H.E. Mr. Oleksandr Kamyshin, Minister of Strategic Industries of Ukraine, thanked UNIDO for the partnership and important work, concluding that “this study will help us create a strategic pathway towards resilient and EU-compatible green industry“. H.E. Mr. Vsevolod Chentsov, Head of the Mission of Ukraine to the European Union, added: “The study is full of information that will help Ukraine and the EU prepare evidence- and data-based interventions for Ukraine”.
In this regard, the launch event set the stage for continuing efforts to bring together the Government of Ukraine, the EU, and multilateral institutions to cooperate effectively for rapid improvements towards a strong and resilient economy.

Title: Updated Ukraine Recovery and Reconstruction Needs Assessment Released
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 February 2024
Joint Press Release by the United Nations, the World Bank Group, the European Commission and the Government of Ukraine

After almost two years of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, an updated joint Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA3) released today by the Government of Ukraine, the World Bank Group, the European Commission, and the United Nations currently estimates that as of 31 December 2023 the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine is $486 billion over the next decade, up from $411 billion estimated one year ago.
In 2024 alone, Ukrainian authorities estimate the country will need around $15 billion for immediate reconstruction and recovery priorities at both the national and community level, with a particular focus on supporting and mobilizing the private sector alongside restoration of housing, soft infrastructure and services, energy, and transport. The RDNA3 highlights that while some $5.5 billion of this funding has been secured, from both Ukraine’s international partners and its own resources, about $9.5 billion is currently unfunded.
"Despite the ongoing full-scale war, the Ukrainian government, with the support of international partners, continues to implement a rapid recovery program. The execution of the Third Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA3) allows us to approach this process more systematically. We are grateful to the World Bank and other partners for this work," said Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal. "We see that the needs for reconstruction have continued to grow over the past year. The main resource for Ukraine's recovery should be the confiscation of Russian assets frozen in the West. We need to start this process already this year. Concurrently, the Ukrainian government is creating conditions to attract private investments, which will accelerate the reconstruction process and transform our country on its path to the EU."
Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement Olivér Várhelyi said: “Russia’s war of aggression continues to have far-reaching consequences on Ukraine. The EU will continue to play a key role in addressing the short and medium-term challenges identified in today’s RDNA3 report. By making available the updated information, RDNA3 helps to further focus the recovery, reconstruction and modernization effort through Ukraine Facility and Ukraine Plan.”
The RDNA3, which covers damages incurred over a nearly two-year period from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, to December 31, 2023, finds that direct damage in Ukraine has now reached almost $152 billion, with housing, transport, commerce and industry, energy, and agriculture as the most affected sectors. Damage is concentrated in the Donetska, Kharkivska, Luhanska, Zaporizka, Khersonska, and Kyivska oblasts which are the same regions that suffered the greatest damage as reported in the previous assessment.
Across the country, 10% of the housing stock has been damaged or destroyed, prolonging displacement of Ukrainians from their communities. The destruction of the Kakhovka Dam and the hydropower plant in June 2023 has resulted in significant negative impacts on the environment and agriculture and exacerbated challenges already faced by people struggling to access housing, water, food, and health services.
The RDNA3 lists critical investment needs for short-term recovery and medium-term reconstruction. Where possible, the assessment considers and excludes the needs that have already been met through the state budget and support provided by partners and the international community.
The RDNA3 also highlights the continued need for reforms and policies that catalyze private sector involvement and ensure an inclusive and green recovery, as well as integrating project planning into the medium-term budget planning process.
“The last two years have seen unprecedented suffering and loss for Ukraine and its people,” said Antonella Bassani, World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia. “Yet, while this updated assessment documents the extensive damages and consequent needs, it is at the same time a testament to Ukraine’s resilience—demonstrating that the dedication and adaptability of its people have helped to already repair some of the damage and build towards recovery. As the Ukrainian authorities continue on their path towards economic recovery and ambitious reforms, we, the World Bank Group, remain deeply committed to working with them to secure a better future.”
The RDNA3 findings complement the priorities foreseen in reform and investment agenda of the Ukraine Plan that will lay the framework for implementing payments under the Ukraine Facility for the next four years by the EU. As Ukraine prepares for the EU accession process, these reforms and investments support the principles of “building back better” and the institutional capacity of national and subnational authorities.
Since the last assessment (RDNA2), the Government of Ukraine, with the support of its partners, has met some of the most urgent needs. For example, in the housing sector, according to the Government of Ukraine data, in 2023, $1 billion was disbursed toward housing sector recovery, with most being dedicated to the repair and reconstruction of damaged buildings. In the transport sector, more than 2,000km of emergency repairs were made on motorways, highways, and other national roads. In the education sector, local authorities rebuilt approximately 500 educational institutions and since January 2023, the share of educational institutions with bomb shelters has increased from 68% to 80%.
The RDNA3 also includes stronger data and analysis of the impact on vulnerable groups of people and on communities. It presents the case for investment in Ukraine’s human capital.
“The war is not over. The suffering is not over,” said Denise Brown, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Ukraine. “But communities in Ukraine are demonstrating significant courage and commitment in driving their own inclusive recovery processes and they need the continued support of their international partners. The future of Ukraine depends upon the people of Ukraine; this is where we need to invest.”
The overall costs reflected in the recovery and reconstruction figure of $486 billion—estimated over 10 years—include measures required for rebuilding for a modern, low-carbon, inclusive and climate-resilient future. The highest estimated recovery and reconstruction needs are in housing (17% of the total), followed by transport (15%), commerce and industry (14%), agriculture (12%), energy (10%), social protection and livelihoods (9%), and explosive hazard management (7%). Across all sectors, the cost of debris clearance and management (and demolition where needed) reached almost $11 billion.

Title: UNODC supports business integrity in the reconstruction and recovery efforts of Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 February 2024

Vienna, February 2024 – The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), with the support of the Siemens Integrity Initiative, announced the expansion of its Global Action for Business Integrity project to Ukraine.
Through collective action against corruption, Global Action for Business Integrity aims to strengthen legal frameworks, promote public-private dialogue and guide companies to develop compliance programmes to prevent and counter corruption involving the private sector.
Since 2021, the project has been active in Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan and has a global component, critical to upscaling effective approaches and disseminating good practices on business integrity in global policy. Ukraine becomes the project’s eighth implementation country.
While reform efforts in Ukraine are underway, corruption remains a major deterrent for both public aid and private investment. The private sector is key to a sustainable economic recovery and is expected to contribute significant funding and expertise to the reconstruction of Ukraine.

Technical assistance to achieve national anti-corruption priorities
In recognition of the importance of anti-corruption to the country’s recovery, Ukraine adopted its National Anti-Corruption Strategy 2021-2025 in June 2022. Technical assistance is required for Ukraine to achieve its anti-corruption priorities.
UNODC's support will be guided by its recently developed non-binding guidelines for strengthening international and multilateral cooperation against corruption during times of emergency and crisis response and recovery, and will be undertaken in accordance with the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Ukraine ratified the Convention in 2009.
Under the scope of the project, UNODC plans to conduct a gap analysis for Ukraine by reviewing international anti-corruption standards in the private sector, complemented by a report on anti-corruption practices in Ukraine’s private sector, and provide technical support to advance legislative reforms to strengthen business integrity. New draft laws will aim to reduce opportunities for corruption.
To improve public-private dialogue and strengthen anti-corruption measures, UNODC will also promote the use of digital tools in public procurement and reconstruction amongst the private sector and host a multi-stakeholder dialogue on legislative reforms.

UNODC-UN Global Compact e-learning tool
The UNODC-UN Global Compact e-learning tool, “Doing Business with Integrity” will be translated into Ukrainian and further guidance will be provided to companies and small and medium-sized enterprises seeking to adopt or implement anti-corruption programmes by developing a model code of conduct and be provided with a set of detailed and localized guidance. These measures will strengthen the understanding of corruption risks and allow companies to prevent and fight corruption more effectively.
Recognizing the enormous challenges facing the country, the United Nations in Ukraine has developed the Transitional Framework to support Ukraine in its efforts to strengthen its national systems and cope with the economic and social impact of the war. UNODC supports the implementation of the UN Transitional Framework and works with Ukrainian authorities to counter corruption.
The UNODC project Global Action for Business Integrity is funded by the Siemens Integrity Initiative.

Title: HOSPITALS MUST REMAIN A SAFE HAVEN FOR PEOPLE IN NEED

14 February 2024
HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS STRIKES THAT KILLED AND INJURED CIVILIANS AND DAMAGED A HOSPITAL AND OTHER CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE IN SELYDOVE, DONETSK REGION
I am deeply saddened and shocked by this morning’s news from Selydove Town in the Donetsk Region, eastern Ukraine, where yet another overnight attack on this war-torn town took more civilian lives and damaged a hospital, homes and nearby civilian infrastructure.
The news of reported casualties is appalling – a pregnant woman, a mother with her child, a six-month-old baby and other civilians, adults and children – lost their lives or were injured in this horrific attack. The hospital administration had to evacuate patients in the middle of the night – the second time in just a few months, as the same hospital was hit in November 2023.
These repeated attacks impacting vital health-care facilities are a stark reminder of the devastating impact that Russia’s war on Ukraine has on civilians, especially those seeking medical care. In 2024 alone, the World Health Organization verified a staggering 28 attacks impacting health personnel and patients, hospitals, medical transport and supplies across Ukraine.
Attacks on health care are an egregious violation of international humanitarian law and humanity as such. It is totally unacceptable that civilians seeking medical attention, already grappling with the physical and emotional toll of illness or injury, should also face violence and destruction.
Hospitals must remain a safe haven for people in need.

Title: Russian Federation Attacks on Kharkiv Kill Two Families
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
10 February 2024
Kyiv, Feb. 10 2024 — The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission today said the latest Russian attack on the eastern city of Kharkiv left two families dead, including three children.
"Last night’s casualties are the latest amidst a series of attacks on Kharkiv city,” said Danielle Bell, who heads the UN monitoring mission.  “Since December 29 we have verified 17 civilians killed and 168 injured in Kharkiv city alone, though actual numbers will be higher once the recent casualties are fully verified,” she noted.
Initial reports said seven civilians were killed Friday night including two men, two women and three young boys, aged seven months, four and seven years, when Russian Federation drones struck a fuel station in a residential area of Kharkiv, starting a fire that also injured at least three others and reportedly burned 15 residential homes to the ground.
The HRMMU offers its condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones in this attack and wishes a speedy recovery to those who were injured.
Since December 29, 2023, a total of 79 missiles and drones have directly struck residential areas of Kharkiv city on 15 separate days.  In addition to civilian casualties, the blast waves and fires from these missile and drone strikes have destroyed and damaged numerous homes and businesses throughout the city.
Between 24 February 2022 and 31 January 2024, HRMMU verified 10,378 civilians killed and 19,632 injured across Ukraine. These figures include 579 children killed and 1,284 children injured. HRMMU issued its most recent update on the protection of civilians in armed conflict on 7 February 2024.

Title: Civilian Casualties Mount in Ukraine Amid Intensifying Missile and Drone Attacks
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
07 February 2024
Kyiv, 7 February 2024 – The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) today expressed alarm over intensifying missile and drone attacks and mounting civilian casualties across Ukraine.
Earlier today, Russian armed forces launched dozens of missiles and drones against targets across Ukraine, including in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. The weapons or falling debris from their interception caused deaths, injuries and damage to civilian property and infrastructure. According to local officials, at least five civilians were killed and dozens were injured. Multiple homes were damaged or destroyed.
“Families and children injured and killed is the predictable and tragic result of using powerful explosive weapons against targets in large cities,” the head of HRMMU, Danielle Bell, said.
In Kyiv’s Holosiivskyi District weapon remnants struck an 18-story apartment building, causing a fire that gutted apartments on several floors and killed at least four civilians. Local residents interviewed by HRMMU said powerful explosions shook the neighborhood in the middle of the morning rush hour. One local resident who works in a kindergarten nearby said: “We knew there were rockets coming this way. We took shelter in the basement and hoped that they would not come here. But look at what happened!” He said  that he was still searching for a friend living on the first floor of the damaged building.
In Mykolaiv, a suspected missile struck an area with individual private houses, killing one local resident and causing significant damage to dozens of private houses.
In its monthly update on the protection of civilians, released today, released today, HRMMU reported the continued increase in civilian casualties attributed to widespread missile and drone attacks in urban areas across Ukraine.
In January 2024, HRMMU documented 641 casualties (158 killed and 483 injured), marking a 37% increase since November of 2023 after which the previously observed downward trend throughout 2023 was reversed. Concurrently, child casualties more than doubled during the same period, with 40 children killed or injured in January compared to 18 in November.
The proportion of children killed or injured tends to be higher in attacks occurring far from the frontline, as many families have evacuated from frontline communities. Almost two years into Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine, more than 10,000 civilians have been killed and nearly 20,000 injured.

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN DENOUNCES ATTACKS THAT DAMAGE CRITICAL CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS UKRAINE
I am deeply disturbed again by a harrowing wave of attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns this morning.
The attacks have led to a distressing number of civilian casualties and have massively disrupted essential services, including electricity, water and gas supplies, especially in Mykolaiv City and Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, when they are much needed this cold winter. Millions of people rely on these services for heating, cooking and transportation. They are critically important to ensure health and education facilities are functional.
Ukrainians should live without fear of attacks disrupting their lives.
Humanitarians have mobilized emergency response in Kyiv and Mykolaiv, delivering repair materials and psychosocial assistance to those affected.
Repeated attacks damaging civilian infrastructure and causing injuries and deaths to civilians indicate a concerning pattern of harm and international humanitarian law violations. Civilians must be spared from violence.

Title: WFP EXPANDS COMPLEMENTARY SOCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME IN UKRAINE TO PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 February 2024
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), as part of a programme developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Policy and with funding from Germany, will distribute complementary cash assistance to 310,000 people living with disabilities across the country.
The programme is designed to complement the government’s social assistance paid to the most vulnerable Ukrainians during the war while also supporting a sustainable transition from humanitarian response to more resilient national systems.
Since the programme was launched in August 2023, 400,000 pensioners living in areas of active or possible hostilities have received payments from WFP totalling US$28 million (UAH 1 billion).
In line with the decree of the Cabinet of the Ministers of Ukraine, WFP will now expand this complementary cash assistance – for at least 3 consecutive months – to adults with childhood-onset disabilities and children with disabilities.
As a result, WFP will distribute approximately US$21 million (UAH 800 million).
To be eligible for the complementary payment from WFP, people in these categories should meet additional conditions:
The payment from WFP is a top-up at a minimum of UAH 100. It is calculated as the difference between UAH 3,250 and the amount of social allowance a person already receives from the state.
“The war is having a lasting effect on Ukraine’s economy and continues to make life difficult for the most vulnerable families and those living near the frontline,” said Marianne Ward, WFP Country Director a.i. in Ukraine. “We are grateful to Germany, one of our major humanitarian partners, for enabling us to expand this programme and help more families make ends meet during this harsh winter.”
The complementary cash assistance from WFP is paid directly to the bank accounts of eligible recipients or delivered by the postal service for recipients without a bank account who already receive social assistance payments in this way. No registration with WFP or the Ministry of Social Policy is required.
“The synergy of actions of the Government, the Ministry of Social Policy and international partners enables additional financial support to Ukrainians who need it most. We are grateful to the humanitarian organizations that, during the war, continue to actively help Ukraine and complement social payments from the state with additional financial aid," said Ukrainian Minister of Social Policy Oksana Zholnovich.
The initiative is currently funded by Germany, the European Union, Norway and Sweden, with additional contributions from private donors.
Overall, since February 2022, WFP distributed more than US$550 million in cash assistance to Ukrainians. Cash assistance is one of many ways WFP supports Ukrainians – WFP also distributes food rations in areas near the frontlines, finances daily meals for schoolchildren and supports rural families with mine action programmes to recover productive agricultural land.

Title: THE RELENTLESS VIOLENCE AGAINST AID WORKERS MUST STOP

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS ATTACKS THAT KILL AND INJURE AID WORKERS.

I am profoundly distressed by the tragic news that two aid workers from the NGO HEKS/EPER were killed and others injured in an attack on 1 February in southern Ukraine.
My thoughts are with their families and colleagues during this absolutely horrific time.
I am shocked to hear that their vehicles were attacked in a manner similar to a tragic incident in Chasiv Yar Town, in the east of Ukraine just a week ago, when a humanitarian vehicle was hit, and an aid worker injured.
Last year, 50 aid workers were killed or injured in Ukraine, including 11 killed in the line of duty. Since the beginning of the year, this repeated pattern of attacks appears to have intensified. In January alone, five aid workers were injured.
This comes at a time when people in front-line areas are facing an extremely dire humanitarian situation with Russia’s invasion impacting every aspect of their daily lives.
International humanitarian law prohibits attacks on humanitarian workers and the repeated violations should be of grave concern to the world.

Title: UN and partners provided vital aid to 11 million people in war-ravaged Ukraine in 2023
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
30 January 2024
The United Nations and its partners provided approximately 11 million people in Ukraine with vital humanitarian assistance in 2023, informed today the Humanitarian Coordinator in the country, Denise Brown.
According to Denise Brown, assistance to people in communities close to the front line was one of the priorities for the humanitarian community in 2023, including through 107 inter-agency convoys that delivered much-needed supplies to families whose lives have been devastated by the war. “Entire communities along the front line are being pummeled daily, leaving millions with little to no capacity to provide for themselves, and dependent on humanitarian assistance. I visited nearly 30 of these war-torn villages and towns last year and could see how Russia’s invasion continues to cause massive destruction and decimate essential services for them,” explained Ms Brown.
Over the last months of 2023, the UN and its humanitarian partners stepped up efforts to provide critical supplies and services to ensure families can keep warm and safe during Ukraine’s bitter winter, when temperatures can drop to as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius. In total, nearly 1.7 million people were reached with solid fuel to ensure heating in areas without power, gas or water, as well as winter clothes, thermal blankets, and insulation of homes and centres hosting displaced people.
Throughout the year, humanitarians have also provided people in Ukraine with much-needed water and hygiene supplies, materials to repair homes, health or education services, food, cash and other services that included counselling, legal aid and even demining. “However, for another entire year, we were prevented from helping people in areas occupied by Russia, where humanitarian needs are direst and the response extremely limited,” regretted Ms Brown, adding that efforts will continue despite the repeated denial by Russian authorities.
The humanitarian response in Ukraine was possible thanks to the strong financial support from the international community and the efforts of almost 600 humanitarian organizations and their staff and volunteers across the country who are working to overcome tremendous challenges to reach people in need. “The close coordination with the authorities was also crucial and enabled our work,” added Denise Brown, who also noted that amongst other challenges, indiscriminate attacks destroyed over 55 aid facilities, killing at least 11 aid workers and injuring 35 in the line of duty in Ukraine in 2023.
The UN and partners will continue efforts to ensure the people of Ukraine will receive the same level of support in 2024. “To this end, funding will be crucial. The suffering of the Ukrainian people is not over, and our support is as necessary as ever,” concluded Denise Brown.

26 January 2024
HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS AN ATTACK THAT INJURED A HUMANITARIAN WORKER IN CHASIV YAR TODAY
I am outraged to know that a clearly marked vehicle of a Ukrainian humanitarian organization, Mission Proliska, was hit this morning in war-torn Chasiv Yar, in the Donetsk Region. The attack happened a few metres from where Proliska’s team was distributing much-needed relief supplies to civilians in the town. Regrettably, an aid worker was injured.
I was in Chasiv Yar just a few weeks ago, also delivering aid to civilians in this town completely devasted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. I know first-hand that civilians there have exhausted their scarce resources to face this devastation and I saw how the work carried out by volunteers, humanitarian organizations and local authorities is truly contributing to their dignity.
The work of humanitarian organizations must be protected. Yet, at least seven attacks have directly impacted facilities and assets in Ukraine since the beginning of the year. In the Kherson Region, where I was today, five humanitarian warehouses were damaged and burned to the ground in December alone. In 2023, on average, there were four incidents harming humanitarian operations in Ukraine every week.
Those supporting Ukrainians whose lives have been torn apart by Russia’s invasion must be protected. International humanitarian law must be respected.

Title: International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust "Recognizing the Extraordinary Courage of Victims and Survivors of the Holocaust" Statement by Volker Türk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights 27 January 2024
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 January 2024
This is a day of profound importance. We remember and honour the millions of victims of the Nazi Holocaust – children, women and men on whom atrocious suffering and injustice were inflicted by an abominable machinery of mass murder.
Some six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, 1.5 million of them children. Millions of other people from targeted groups were also murdered, including Roma and Sinti people; Slavs; people with disabilities; LGBTIQ+ people; members of resistance networks; and other opponents of Nazism.
Six extermination camps, at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Belzec, Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka, were equipped with machinery designed specifically for killing on a massive, industrial scale. About one million Jews were killed at Auschwitz alone. Millions more were imprisoned, abused and murdered in a vast network of thousands of other concentration camps, where they were forced into slave labour, including sexual slavery, and medical experimentation.
The scale of these crimes engaged many perpetrators. The Nazi concentration camps and death trains were staffed. The victims had often been identified to the police, and therefore sent to their deaths, by people whom they knew. Countless bystanders looked away from – or were indifferent to – what they must have suspected was extraordinary, inhuman brutality. The dehumanisation that enabled the Holocaust – the depth and scale of this failure of empathy and fellow-feeling for other human beings – is incomprehensible and terrifying.
It is our duty to seek answers to how these crimes could have been prevented. If we do not, they could happen again.
As part of this work, and in the face of genocide denial, it is essential to ensure accurate historical knowledge of the Holocaust, or Shoah, in all its appalling detail.
The testimony of survivors of the Holocaust is both essential to that work, and extremely painful. Simone Veil, who later became a magistrate and President of the European Parliament, entered Auschwitz-Birkenau at the age of 16. Until her death, in 2017, she spoke to schoolchildren and others about the brutality, terror, humiliation and enslavement that she, her family and so many others were forced to endure. She also recounted moments of tenderness and courage – encounters with other prisoners that were often deeply touching.
Austrian Holocaust survivor Helga Pollak-Kinsky spoke at the UN in Geneva about the adults – “carers, teachers, artists” – who helped children in the camps “to maintain our faith in ourselves and in humanity.” Viktor Frankl and many others have also spoken of the human bonds that were forged in these horrific conditions, and the ways in which those bonds of fellow-feeling helped individuals to retain their sanity, and survive the camps.
I pay tribute to the extraordinary courage and important lessons that so many survivors have brought to us. I admire their resilience. I thank them from the bottom of my heart for the humanity and selflessness of their testimony.
The world's horror at the Holocaust led directly to the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 75 years ago. It was also instrumental in the adoption of the European Convention on Human Rights and a host of international treaties that enshrine our equality, our dignity and our rights in the face of tyranny and destitution.
These are conventions and principles and values that must forever be upheld.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. Antisemitism and all forms of racism and racial or religious discrimination are intolerable. They are unacceptable. Today and forever, we must stand against dehumanisation. We must work to overcome indifference and strengthen our understanding of and empathy with others. The atrocious crimes of the Holocaust must never be forgotten.

I was having coffee at home this morning in Kyiv, my neighbours were getting ready for work, children preparing to go to school, when our homes started to shake because of a wave of airstrikes on the Ukrainian capital. The attacks caused damage to civilian buildings just next to the United Nations office in Kyiv. Homes were damaged and civilians – those I just mentioned who were only trying to continue with their lives despite the war – are now hospitalized.
In Kharkiv, our team on the ground told us that rescuers are trying to find people under the rubble of a residential building hit and the wave of aerial assaults also caused loss and destruction in the Dnipro Region.
These strikes are yet another bitter reminder of the devastation, suffering and distress that Russia’s invasion is causing for millions of people in Ukraine.
Brutal and indiscriminate attacks against civilians must stop.

Title: Casualties and Destruction from Wave of Russian Missile Attacks in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 January 2024
Kyiv, 23 January 2023 – The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) today (Tuesday) expressed alarm about a fresh wave of Russian missile attacks that shook several populated areas of Ukraine earlier in the day. HRMMU visited the scenes of the attacks in Kharkiv and in Kyiv to document their impact on civilians.
“Today before dawn countless people across Ukraine experienced another wave of attacks that brought more death, life-changing injuries, trauma, loss of property, and destruction,” said the head of the HRMMU, Danielle Bell.
Local authorities reported that seven people were killed and 86 injured as a result of the attacks in the cities of Kharkiv, Kyiv, Pavlohrad and other locations. The largest casualty number was reported from the eastern city of Kharkiv with six persons killed and 57 injured, including eight children.
In Kharkiv, HRMMU staff visited the site of an almost completely destroyed 5-storey residential building that appeared to have been directly hit by several missiles at around 7 am on 23 January. The building is located in a residential area in the central part of the city and the attack had shattered windows and doors of buildings in a large radius around the impact site.
In Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, HRMMU staff visited a residential area that was damaged during the attack, including a residential building, a school, a sports centre and a kindergarten. The damage appeared to have been caused by falling debris from intercepted missiles.
HRMMU spoke with several residents who were visibly shaken even hours after the attack.
A middle-aged woman who lives in one of the residential buildings most severely affected by today's strike in the Solomyanskyi district in Kyiv told HRMMU that she was seeking shelter in the corridor in her apartment when the attack struck. The attack broke windows and damaged furniture in her apartment but left her uninjured. “We were not wounded, we survived, but many in Ukraine were not so lucky this morning,” she told HRMMU.
Today’s missile barrage appeared to be the largest since a wave of Russian drone and missile attacks launched in late December and early January, in which hundreds of civilians were killed and wounded in the course of just 10 days. That spate of attacks represented an alarming reversal of an earlier trend that saw a steady decrease in civilian deaths and injuries throughout 2023.
More than 10,000 civilians have been killed and nearly 20,000 have been injured since Russia launched an all-out attack on Ukraine 23 months ago HRMMU says.

This is HRMMU's  latest report on casualty figures.

Title: In Ukraine, Civilian Casualties Soar Amid Russian Attacks, Reversing a Downward Trend the UN Says
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
16 January 2024
Kyiv, 16 January 2024 – The past weeks saw a steep increase in civilian casualties as the Russian Federation intensified missile and drone attacks across Ukraine, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said today. In the course of just 10 days between 29 December 2023 and 8 January, hundreds of civilians were killed or wounded in drone and missile attacks across the country, HRMMU said.
In a report released today, HRMMU notes a 26 per cent increase in verified civilian casualties in December compared with November, in an alarming reversal of a downward trend in casualties observed earlier in 2023. The actual increase is likely higher as some casualty reports are yet to be verified. The high number of civilian casualties observed in December continued into the first days of January. HRMMU said it was verifying reports of 86 killed and 416 injured.

"Civilian casualties had been steadily decreasing in 2023 but the wave of attacks in late December and early January violently interrupted that trend,” said Danielle Bell who heads the UN’s monitoring mission.

“These attacks sow death and destruction on Ukraine’s civilians who have endured profound losses from Russia’s full-scale invasion for almost two years now,” she added.

The recent wave of attacks started on 29 December with missiles and drones hitting populated areas across Ukraine.  While the most extensive attacks and the highest numbers of civilian casualties happened on that day and on 2 January, missile and drone attacks killed civilians across the country also on other days.

On 6 January, for example, a Russian missile attack on the small town of Pokrovsk and nearby Rivne village, located a relatively short distance from the frontline, left two families – six adults and five children – buried in the rubble when their homes were struck. Despite a days-long rescue and recovery effort, some of the bodies are still missing. In a separate attack just two days later in Novomoskovsk, the blast wave from a Russian missile strike injured 31 civilians, including eight passengers of a minibus which was destroyed during the morning commute.

The recent attacks came as temperatures across Ukraine dropped sharply with the arrival of extremely cold weather, making the already difficult situation even harder for vulnerable civilians. In Dnipro, an 81-year-old woman whose apartment was shattered by a Russian drone attack on 6 January told HRMMU she did not know how she would now survive the winter.

Remarks to the press at the joint OCHA-UNHCR launch of the 2024 Ukraine Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan and the Regional Refugee Response Plan for Ukraine
Geneva, 15 January 2024
As delivered
So right now it is good to be here with Filippo [Grandi] because we are launching, as you said, two response plans today to support the people of Ukraine through 2024.
One is for those who fled the war and are refugees which Filippo will speak to. And then the humanitarian plan for those in need who remain in the country. This is a normal process, you know, in places where there are large refugee outflows and where there are connections between the two plans. It is important that they synergize, and you can see that they are complementary.
Ukraine - you remember Ukraine? It has been quite a while since we have seen much about it. I think a year ago it would have been all Ukraine. And now for the last many weeks, we have heard very little about it. So, I am very glad we have got this opportunity today to talk about it, to launch it this morning.
Next month, we will enter a third year and an unexpected, in my view, a third year of full-blown war and occupation. It started, of course, ten years ago in the east of the country. But the escalation in 2022 rushed in a whole new level of death, destruction and despair and of course, of outflow of refugees. Forty per cent of the population will need humanitarian assistance this year. That is 14.6 million people, 40 per cent of the population in Ukraine will need humanitarian aid.  Four million people are internally displaced. That is in addition to those who are externally displaced. 3.3 million live in frontline communities in the east and south where the war goes on, under relentless bombardment. 3.3 million people living in the middle of war zones, of bombardment, of uncertainty about where the day will end. And that is really a shockingly high number even these days.
No place in Ukraine is untouched by the war and the wave of attacks that began just before the new year, as we saw, witness to this, to the devastating civilian cost of the war. Add to that the harsh winter, which is sweeping across Ukraine and ratcheting up people's need for lifesaving support, heating, proper shelter, warm clothes and a sufficient calorie intake because of the winter.
In the small towns and villages on the front lines, people have exhausted their own meager resources and rely on aid coming in through the convoys of our partners to survive. In the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, families live in damaged houses with no piped water, gas, or electricity in the freezing cold. Constant bombardments force older people to spend their days in basements. Children, terrified, traumatized, still have lived for the last [two] years under these circumstances, trapped indoors and many of them with no schooling.
Across Ukraine, homes, schools and hospitals are repeatedly hit. Basic services are not spared. Water, gas and power systems. Indeed, the very fabric of society, how we live, employment, schools, care centers, shopping, safety of access to those places daily, is under threat.
But it is worth taking a moment to remember that Ukrainians refuse to buckle under this extraordinary onslaught. And they refuse to resign. People step up for each other. Community spirit remains high. They volunteer to help deliver relief to those who cannot move, some warm shelter, care for children. No less than 60 per cent of our 500 humanitarian partners are Ukrainian organizations. So, 500 humanitarian organizations operating inside Ukraine, delivering aid inside Ukraine, more than half of them are Ukrainian organizations. A testament really to the community spirit and the patriotic spirit of many people in that country.
We aim to reach more than 8.5 million people this year with water and hygiene services, materials to repair homes, winter clothes, supplies and things that I have already referred to. The plan for 8.5 million focuses, as you know from the math, on the most vulnerable. Those who are close to the frontline are the top priority. And every day, convoys are sent out to reach those in danger, as are the convoys in danger. Aid will be delivered across the country to areas we can reach by these comprehensive programmes on these convoys, in partnership with local NGOs, local partners I referred to and complementing the Ukrainian government's own efforts.
And our relationship with the Ukrainian government remains steady, strong, supportive, and we act under their guidance, under their leadership and often under their direction. We are asking donors for US$3.1 billion in funding for 2024. More will be needed to support those who Filippo will refer to.
No one wants to depend on assistance from outsiders to cover life's basic needs. This is true across the world, whether in Gaza, Sudan or Syria or elsewhere. No one wants to depend on such assistance. But there is no choice for those 14 .6 million who need assistance, 8.5 million of whom we are targeting. They need your help. They need your funding because humanitarian aid remains the lifeline without which they will perish.
As the war continues unabated, without signs that I am aware of, of coming to some conclusion, and amid everything else happening across the globe, we must stay the course for the people of Ukraine. And it is a very sad reminder that today we are begging for attention for Ukraine, when for so many days and weeks and months of previous years we have had much greater attention to Ukraine and we begged for attention for places elsewhere, places are still needed like Sudan and so forth. But today, we beg for attention for the people of Ukraine, and we will be having a launch here, right after this meeting.
Thank you very much.

Title: With no let-up for war-affected Ukrainians, UN launches humanitarian and refugee plans to respond in 2024
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 January 2024
Geneva, 15 January 2024
The United Nations and partners today asked donors for a combined US$4.2 billion to support war-affected communities in Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees and their host communities in the region throughout 2024.Nearly two years since the war’s rapid escalation, 14.6 million people need humanitarian assistance in Ukraine – a staggering 40 per cent of the population. Some 6.3 million people have fled the country and remain refugees, mostly across Europe.
A recent wave of attacks underscores the devastating civilian cost of the war, while a bitter winter is ratcheting up the urgent need for life-saving humanitarian aid.
In front-line towns and villages, people have exhausted their meagre resources and rely on aid to survive. In the Donetsk and Kharkiv Regions, families shelter in damaged houses with no piped water, gas or electricity. Constant bombardments force people to spend their days in basements. Children cannot play outside, let alone attend school.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) coordinates the response inside Ukraine. This Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan requests $3.1 billion for 2024 and targets 8.5 million people. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, coordinates the Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP), which requests $1.1 billion and targets 2.3 million refugees and host communities.
In total, the two highly prioritized UN plans aim to support some 10.8 million people in Ukraine and the region."Hundreds of thousands of children live in communities on the front lines of the war, terrified, traumatized and deprived of their basic needs. That fact alone should compel us to do everything we can to bring more humanitarian assistance to Ukraine," said the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, who is also the head of OCHA. "Homes, schools and hospitals are repeatedly hit, as are water, gas and power systems. The very fabric of society is under attack with devastating consequences. Our response plan, implemented with national NGOs and volunteers, includes the full range of assistance."
Ukrainian refugees in neighbouring countries also need increased and sustained support. Despite efforts for inclusion, only half of school-age refugee children are enrolled in schools in host countries, while a quarter of refugees in need struggle to access health care. Only 40 to 60 per cent are employed, often below their qualifications, and many remain vulnerable with no means to support themselves.
“Although their plight is no longer in the headlines, millions of refugees from Ukraine still need urgent support,” said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi. “Host countries continue to extend protection and include them in society, but many vulnerable refugees still need help. They shouldn’t feel pressed to return because they cannot make ends meet in exile. All refugees must be helped and given opportunities to use and build their talents to prepare them for eventual voluntary return when the situation allows.”
Note to editorsDespite extreme access challenges, especially to areas occupied by the Russian Federation, aid workers reached nearly 11 million people in Ukraine in 2023, with the support of the international donor community. Humanitarian organizations made every effort to increase assistance in the front-line communities, including through 105 inter-agency convoys, complementing the Government’s response and the efforts of volunteers, civil society organizations and other local groups.
Neighbouring countries have generously hosted Ukrainian refugees for almost two years, but they urgently need more international support. In 2023, RRP partners reached more than 2.5 million refugees with support and protection, working to include them in national systems until it is safe to return.

REMARKS BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, AT THE JOINT LAUNCH OF THE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND RESPONSE PLAN AND REGIONAL REFUGEE RESPONSE PLAN FOR 2024 IN UKRAINE
Geneva, 15 January 2024
As delivered
I would like to take you to a place you have probably never heard of, a place which is called Hroza in the Kharkiv Region in eastern Ukraine. Hroza is a small community of 320 people, or was 320 people when on the 5 October, as people were sitting in their homes, a missile landed in the middle of that small town, killing outright 59 people and wiping out 20 per cent of the population in seconds.
Absolutely devastating and happens almost every single day in Ukraine. So, when that happens, what do we do? What do we do together? The first thing we do – what we try and do for many of these incidents – is go to those locations. The very next day we were there. I was there, UNHCR, WHO, OCHA – we were all there.
Why? Because, as the Deputy Prime Minister said, first of all, it is that demonstration of support that despite all of the other tragedies in the world right now, which look completely overwhelming, Ukraine is still important, a small community of 320 minus 59 people in seconds is still important. We go, first of all, to demonstrate that importance.
Secondly, I would like to thank OHCHR who did an excellent report on that tragic incident. It was not a military installation. It was 59 people sitting in a cafe mourning the loss of a loved one. So that's the second reason why we go – we are part of a chain.
What do we do in terms of assistance? We do just that, and it works. As the Deputy Prime Minister said, we've got a machine in place. The local authorities, local volunteers who do an outstanding job, national actors, international NGOs, UN agencies, the Government – we have got that piece set now. We respond to every one of these incidents.
On day one, we are there. What are we doing? Bringing psychosocial support and immediate supplies to start those repairs, so people whose doors and windows have been completely destroyed by this massive explosion, where the destruction left behind and the damage by the wave that destroy everything around it was bigger than this room. So, psychosocial support, our presence, our witnessing what happens and supplies – that's days after.
Weeks after, it's rebuilding the homes. In many locations, it is removing the rubble. In many locations, it is supporting small businesses because that little town depended on that little café. It was the only source of income that they had. So, all of this we can do, and it is now predictable thanks to your funding, thanks to our coordination, thanks to our network, thanks to our relationship with the authorities.
But it's the years after – and as Martin said, we are moving to the third year. There's nothing left for us to repair and there's nothing left for me to get my hands on. What's left behind is much harder to deal with. How do you get over the fact that there was, and still is, the playground of that community right beside where that café was hit. Or the women – because I was there on Christmas Day – who tell me “I don't go to the center of town anymore. I can't”. Don't forget that missiles hit and there's immediate damage. We're responding, thank you so much for your support. But in the years to come that damage that we don't see has to be dealt with. And that's the phase we're moving into.
My message is – the war is not over. The suffering is not over. We continue to require your support so that we can continue to do the job that we have been doing. And if the funding is not coming at the level that's required, you know from other locations, we will have to start dismantling the humanitarian system. And rebuilding that in Ukraine, certainly, it's not me who is going to be able to do that. So, all of these things we need to keep in mind as we move forward, but the fundamental message is – the war is not over.

Title: JOINT LAUNCH OF UKRAINE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND RESPONSE PLAN AND REGIONAL REFUGEE RESPONSE PLAN FOR UKRAINE FOR 2024

09 January 2024
This is a summary of what was said by OCHA's Global Deputy Spokesperson Jens Laerke – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today’s press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
Next Monday, 15th January, we, together with UNHCR, will launch, here in the Palais des Nations, this year’s response plans for Ukraine and for the Ukrainian refugees and the host communities in the wider region.
People have endured almost two years of relentless hostilities following the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion.
More than 14.6 million people – 40 per cent of the population in Ukraine – will need humanitarian assistance this year.
The war has also forced some 6.3 million Ukrainians to flee abroad. UNHCR will update you on that.
Civilians are being killed and injured daily, while their homes and critical infrastructure are being destroyed.
The first week of January brought a wave of attacks to Ukraine, starting on the 29th of December and continuing to this day.
Families across Ukraine were ringing in the New Year to the sound of air raid sirens, hunkering down in underground shelters and metro stations, or in the basements of their homes.
On 2nd January, humanitarians in the capital Kyiv counted over 30 explosions in that city alone.
Kharkiv in the east was also hit, at least five civilian casualties were reported, and 130 people were injured that day.
The Donetsk Region was left without electricity or water, as temperatures dropped far below freezing point last week.
On 3rd and 4th January, attacks continued killing and injuring civilians in the Sumy Region in the north, in the Donetsk Region in the east, and in Kherson and Mykolayiv Regions in the south.
Over the weekend – no respite. On 6th January, another wave of air strikes in the Donetsk Region killed nearly a dozen civilians, five of them children.
And yesterday, more hostilities in Donetsk, Dnipro and Kherson Regions killed and injured dozens of civilians, including children, and damaged homes and schools.
On top of the violence, Ukraine is now in the grip of a deep winter. A continued, large-scale humanitarian operation is as urgent today as it ever was.
On Monday, the Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths and the High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, will present our UN-coordinated plans to save lives and address the suffering caused by this ongoing emergency.
There will be a panel discussion to present both plans with Martin Griffiths, Filippo Grandi, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk, and NGO representatives from Ukraine and Poland.
The press is invited to attend the launch in Room XXIV, from 9.30 a.m. CET.
The event will also be webcast on UN webtv.

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS STRIKES THAT KILLED NEARLY A DOZEN CIVILIANS IN THE DONETSK REGION
I am truly horrified by the news that yet another wave of strikes on war-torn Pokrovsk District, in the Donetsk Region, has killed nearly a dozen of civilians over the past hours. Five of them were children. These were just children who have been killed because of this war.
My thoughts are with the grieving families and the people of Pokrovsk, a place that has seen over last one year some of the worst phases of Russia’s invasion.
The most recent surge in attacks on populated cities across Ukraine is leaving behind an outrageous number of children, women and men killed and injured, and a trail of loss and destruction. Since 29 December, the UN recorded nearly 120 civilians killed across Ukraine, and just below 480 injured.
Behind each number is a story of immense suffering.
Indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas are absolutely unacceptable and forbidden under international humanitarian law. This must stop.

Title: Civilian casualties across Ukraine since 29 December
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
03 January 2024
On 2 January 2024, the Russian Federation launched waves of missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, targeting Kyiv and Kharkiv, two of the largest cities in the country. Preliminary reports from Ukrainian authorities indicate that the attacks killed at least five civilians and injured 130, damaging homes and civilian infrastructure.
Approximately 100 missiles were launched at Kyiv, reportedly killing at least four civilians and injuring 68 (including two children) in the city and surrounding areas. Falling debris from intercepted missiles also damaged residential buildings and a supermarket, along with critical civilian infrastructure such as gas and electricity substations. Consequently, five districts of the city were temporarily left without electricity, heating, and water.
In Kharkiv, several missiles reportedly struck the city center, causing substantial damage to multiple residential buildings. Preliminary reports indicate that at least one civilian was killed and 62 were injured (including six children).
The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) visited Solomianskyi district in Kyiv city and neighboring Vyshneve town, and spoke with residents whose homes had been destroyed or badly damaged. Many are currently sheltering in a nearby school, which was also damaged in the attack. In addition to the loss of lives and life-changing injuries, residents described the pain of losing their homes and all their personal belongings.
Since the wave of attacks by the Russian Federation across the country, beginning on 29 December until today, HRMMU has recorded 90 civilian deaths, including two children, and 421 civilians injured in 12 oblasts. This includes shelling and missile attacks, which reportedly killed eight civilians, and injured 29 in areas of Donetsk oblast occupied by the Russian Federation. Each civilian casualty will be independently verified by HRMMU.
The mission extends its deepest condolences to the families of those whose lives have been senselessly cut short, and our wishes for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.
HRMMU documents and reports on the war’s heavy toll on civilian lives, property, and infrastructure. Our latest information on the impacts of the hostilities and the Russian occupation can be found in our report on the Human rights situation in Ukraine, and our detailed analysis of civilian casualties can be found in our report on the Protection of civilians in armed conflict.

02 January 2024
HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS REPEATED WAVE OF ATTACKS ON UKRAINE’S CAPITAL AND POPULATED CITIES
For the people of Ukraine, the new year started with loss, pain, and anguish. For the third day in row, vast aerial assaults by the Russian Federation have caused death – including several children - and destruction of homes and other civilian infrastructure. It is alarming that many parts of the capital, Kyiv, have been left without electricity or water, knowing temperatures this week will drop to -20 degrees Celsius. Hostilities have also cut off hundreds of thousands of people from power in the Donetsk Region.
On behalf of the humanitarian community, I reiterate our commitment to keep supporting the people of Ukraine suffering the devastation caused by Russia’s invasion. And today, my thoughts are with the families and friends of those killed or injured and with those who fear for the missing.
Again, the United Nations reminds the Russian Federation that indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are strictly forbidden under international humanitarian law.

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS WAVE OF ATTACKS ON UKRAINIAN POPULATED CITIES
I condemn, in the strongest terms, Russia's heinous wave of attacks on populated areas of Ukraine over the past few hours, which has left a path of destruction, death and human suffering. The strikes damaged homes, schools, hospitals, a shopping mall, a metro station and energy infrastructure, killing and injuring civilians in almost every region of the country.
Right now, families and emergency services are trying to pull people out of the debris left by the destruction. For the Ukrainian people, this is another unacceptable example of the horrifying reality they are faced with, and which made 2023 another year of enormous suffering.
The Russian Federation continues the pattern of disregard for its obligations under international humanitarian law. Either indiscriminate attacks or attacks intentionally directed against civilians or civilian objects are strictly prohibited.

29 December 2023
“I am shocked by yet another full-scale set of coordinated missile and drone attacks by the Russian Federation across Ukraine during the night of 28 to 29 December.
The massive assault struck densely populated areas in many cities and towns, including Kyiv, Lviv, Khmelnytskyi, Cherkasy, Sumy, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Odesa, and Zaporizhzhia. The attack also affected a wide range of civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings, a maternity hospital, schools, kindergartens, parks, a metro station, and a shopping mall, as well as energy infrastructure. Electricity was cut in several regions, following damage to transmission lines.
At least 23 civilians were killed and 134 were injured. Rescue groups are still searching for people trapped under the rubble of residential buildings.
International humanitarian law explicitly prohibits attacks deliberately targeting civilian objects, as well as indiscriminate attacks, under any circumstances. I call again on the Russian Federation to cease its attacks on Ukraine immediately, and to strictly respect all the rules of international law relating to the conduct of hostilities.”

Title: Ukraine Community Recovery Fund Approves First Strategic Allocation
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 December 2023
The first meeting of the Steering Committee for the Ukraine Community Recovery Fund took place today. The Fund is managed by the UN in Ukraine, and priorities are set in cooperation with the Ministry for Communities, Territories and Infrastructure Development of Ukraine. The co-chairs, UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine Denise Brown and Vice Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov, briefed the Steering Committee members on the Community Recovery Fund’s objectives and contributions. The Committee then agreed that the first strategic allocation for available funding would be made to vulnerable communities in the Sumy region for interventions focused on agriculture and livelihoods; under the Mine Action window, the earmarked contributions will be allocated to supporting the infrastructure needs of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in order to strengthen community demining.
“We presented the Fund’s concept back in July this year at the London Conference. International partners responded to our call to support the restoration of Ukrainian communities, and this is evidence of their trust and confidence in the future of Ukraine. Together we continue to establish the conditions for Ukrainians to return to their communities and restore their lives, even during war,” said Vice Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov.
The function of Fund Secretariat is carried out by the UN Resident Coordinator Office in Ukraine, with administrative support from the UN’s Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office. Projects supported by the fund will be implemented by relevant UN agencies on the ground in cooperation with local partners.
“The UN is not losing sight of humanitarian needs, wintertime challenges, and daily attacks that significantly affect the civilian population. At the same time, we are seeing that people want to return to their communities where that is possible. This is why the Recovery Fund has been launched – to provide an important push for housing and infrastructure reconstruction and demining, along with new livelihoods and support for the economic development of communities affected by the full-scale Russian invasion,” said UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine Denise Brown. “I am grateful to the governments that have already contributed to the Fund, and I call on others to join this critical initiative.”
Apart from Denmark, who became the Fund's first mover in November 2023, funding has also been provided by Luxembourg and the Republic of Korea. Thus, as the first meeting of the Steering Committee took place, the Fund had $5.85 million available. $4.6 million was allocated to support communities in the Sumy region, while $1.25 million provided by Korea and earmarked to the Mine Action window of the Fund will be directed to supporting much needed infrastructure of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine for community demining. Over the next five years, the Fund aims to raise $300 million and be a catalyst for the recovery of Ukrainian communities.
“In July 2023, the Sumy Regional Administration launched an inclusive Recovery Coordination Council that brings together national and international partners to coordinate the ongoing interventions towards the implementation of our Recovery Strategy 2022-2024. While we have made some progress against the targets in our plan, a key gap remains in mobilizing resources to support communities with livelihoods, agriculture and economic development. This allocation from the Community Recovery Fund fills a key funding gap for our Strategy and is an important signal to people in our communities who want to stay in their homes and rebuild their lives. I wish to thank Denmark, Luxembourg and Korea for their contributions to the Ukraine Community Recovery Fund,” commented Volodymyr Artiukh, Head of the Sumy Regional Administration.
As the next step, UN entities will work directly with the Sumy Regional Development Agency and the heads of target communities to design the needed interventions and rollout implementation by March 2024.

Title: RUSSIAN INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS ON KHERSON, ONCE AGAIN, DENY CIVILIANS THEIR ACCESS TO HUMANITARIAN AID WHEN THEY NEED IT THE MOST
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
20 December 2023
HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS ATTACKS THAT HIT HUMANITARIAN FACILITIES AND OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN KHERSON
I am horrified by the news that another wave of indiscriminate strikes by the Russian Federation has damaged facilities and critical supplies of at least three humanitarian organizations in Kherson today. The warehouses of the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and the local NGO Shchedryk were burned to the ground, destroying much-needed relief supplies. The facilities of the international NGO HEKS/EPER were also impacted. Today’s strikes have also damaged homes, a health facility and left civilians, yet again, injured in Kherson.
These attacks impact humanitarians’ capacity to carry out their life-saving work and, ultimately, deny civilians their access to aid when they need it the most. The people of Kherson – and those living along the entire front line in the east and south – are, indeed, bearing the brunt of this war. The level of destruction is massive and, with the onset of the winter, aid is as necessary as ever.

Title: WHO, together with Government of Germany, donates 20 ambulances to Ukraine to ensure emergency care provision during medical transportation amid war
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 December 2023
WHO has donated 20 ambulances to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine to enable the provision of emergency medical care to patients during the war. Designed as mobile intensive care units, the ambulances will be used to provide the necessary care for patients who need extra life-supporting activities during transportation to hospitals and between hospitals. This is the latest such donation by WHO in nearly 2 years of the full-scale war.
“With the devastating impact of war on Ukraine’s health system, these 20 ambulances will enable interhospital medical transportation across Ukraine, including the country’s eastern and southern regions, equipped to provide intensive and highly specialized care to seriously injured patients,” said Dr Gundo Weiler, Director of the Division of Country Support and Partnerships and acting Regional Emergency Director at the WHO Regional Office for Europe.
“Since the beginning of the war, WHO has supported Ukraine with the provision of essential medical supplies and equipment to ensure the continuity of care and meet the urgent health needs of the Ukrainian people. Together with health partners we stand united, and in 2024, we are committed to further addressing both humanitarian and recovery needs to maintain the resilience of Ukraine’s health system in the face of challenges,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine.
The ambulances donated today are equipped with a range of crucial life-supporting devices, including defibrillator-monitors, lung ventilators, medical oxygen delivery equipment, infusion pumps, ECG machines, stretchers, trauma care equipment and other devices, allowing for the provision of life-saving care to critical patients during medical transportation.
"Ambulances are not just cars – they enable medics to save lives. In conditions of constant shelling, regular updating of the fleet of emergency medical vehicles is crucial. The Russian forces have already destroyed or damaged almost 500 ambulances. I am sincerely grateful to our international partners for their understanding and broad support. The 20 ambulances being provided to us by WHO today will soon support the work of doctors where they are currently most needed. They are equipped with everything that is necessary to provide medical assistance to patients in the most difficult conditions," said Viktor Liashko, Minister of Health of Ukraine.
Since the full-scale war erupted on 24 February 2022, 95 ambulances have been donated to the Ministry of Health by WHO and its partners. More ambulances are set to be delivered in the coming months.
The delivery was made possible with funding from the German government, the biggest donor to date towards WHO’s health response to the war in Ukraine.
“Germany has been standing with Ukraine since the very first days of the Russian invasion. This donation is part of the overall support from the Government of Germany to WHO emergency programmes in Ukraine and in the neighbouring countries that receive and host refugees, amounting to more than €30 million this year. We thank the WHO team in Ukraine for their outstanding work,” said Dr Tim Prange, Deputy Ambassador of Germany to Ukraine.
Overall, WHO has delivered more than 4000 metric tonnes of life-saving medical supplies to Ukraine since the war began. Deliveries have included power generators, ambulances, oxygen supplies for medical facilities, supplies for trauma and emergency surgeries, and medicines to help treat noncommunicable diseases.

Title: WHO and Ministry of Health of Ukraine sign Biennial Collaborative Agreement to enhance partnership and strengthen health system resilience for 2024–2025
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 December 2023
As the full-scale war in Ukraine approaches the two-year mark, the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine have signed a Biennial Collaborative Agreement (BCA) for 2024–2025, setting out health priorities with which WHO will support Ukraine, as the country’s health system works to expand its ability to provide health for all, surmounting formidable challenges.
The BCA was signed in Kyiv by Viktor Liashko, Minister of Health of Ukraine, and Dr Gundo Weiler, WHO/Europe’s Director of the Division of Country Support and Partnerships and acting Regional Emergency Director – present on behalf of Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. The new agreement sets a framework for further cooperation to maintain the resilience of Ukraine’s health system amid the war while continuing the country’s health reform agenda and moving towards health system recovery.
“The evolving health situation, heavily impacted by the war, requires both immediate life-saving services and a continuum of care across the country. Amid the ongoing war, we will continue to work hand in hand with the Government of Ukraine and other partners to support the health response to the war, implementing health system reforms and designing comprehensive recovery programmes,” explained Dr Weiler.
“For nearly 2 years now, WHO has supported the Ukrainian health system on multiple fronts, from providing crucial medical and health supplies and hardware to ensuring access to essential services for the people of Ukraine, including and especially those hardest to reach,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine. “By signing the new collaborative agreement with the Ministry of Health, WHO will support Ukraine in further strengthening the country’s health system and responding to the challenges posed by the war, providing humanitarian assistance along with strategic advice on continued health sector reforms and recovery efforts.”
“WHO is a long-term strategic partner of Ukraine and our Ministry. The signing of the new cooperation agreement will continue the history of our fruitful cooperation to maintain the stability of the medical system despite the challenges of the full-scale war and continue the process of reforming the industry. High-quality, affordable and free health care for Ukrainians is our common goal,” said Viktor Liashko, Minister of Health of Ukraine.
Grounded in the European Programme of Work, which guides the work of WHO/Europe and its country offices regionwide, along with WHO’s 13th General Programme of Work and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the agreement will enhance collaboration between WHO and Ukraine in the following areas:
Through the agreement, WHO will support Ukraine in meeting the urgent and pressing direct and indirect health emergency needs triggered by the war. WHO and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine will also work towards further implementation of health reforms to create a more effective, people-centred, resilient and accountable health system that can adapt to emerging needs and deliver high-quality services to all.
In focusing on rebuilding and strengthening the health system, WHO and the Government of Ukraine will work towards ensuring access to essential services such as rehabilitation, primary health care, and public health surveillance, and increasing the financial protection of the Ukrainian people in terms of affordability of health care, including access to medicines and services. The collaborative agreement also aims to intensify and expand the availability of technical assistance to Ukraine compared to previous years.
Ultimately, the BCA will operationalize the strategic priorities set out in the newly developed Country Cooperation Strategy, outlining how WHO in Ukraine will continue working closely with the Government of Ukraine in implementing health priorities along with national recovery and development agendas by 2030.

Title: As Ukraine Faces Second Winter of War, UN Warns of Long Conflict
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 December 2023
Kyiv, December 12, 2023 – The United Nations human rights organization today warned of the long-term cumulative effects of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is now in its twenty-second month.
“The impact of the continued attacks in civilian locations, human rights violations, and civilian suffering we are witnessing today will reverberate for generations to come,” said Danielle Bell, the head of the Ukraine mission of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). “Virtually every aspect of public life, from education and healthcare to the economy and social cohesion, has been adversely affected by the war, inflicting long-term damage on Ukraine's social, economic, and political fabric,” she added.
In a report released on Tuesday, OHCHR said 576 people were killed and 1,864 were injured between August and November 2023. It said 86% of these casualties occurred in territory under the control of Ukraine, particularly in Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts of eastern and south-eastern Ukraine.
The OHCHR report notes that the majority of civilian casualties and damage resulted from shelling and multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) attacks near the frontline. It also noted that almost a quarter of civilian casualties occurred far from the frontline due to missile and loitering munitions attacks, predominantly launched by Russian armed forces, fueling the perception that “nowhere is safe.” The missile strike by Russian armed forces on a funeral reception in Hroza village, Kharkiv oblast, resulting in the tragic death of 59 civilians, further reinforced this perception.
Compared to the same period last year, civilian casualties have decreased overall due to evacuations of civilians from frontline areas and Ukraine’s effective air defense systems. However, the human rights situation is not improving.
“The past four months alone saw severe and far-reaching violations of human rights and international humanitarian law,” Bell noted, citing torture, sexual violence, willful killings, arbitrary detention, and other abuses.
The high level of physical destruction of civilian infrastructure, including energy generation and grain facilities, as well as mine contamination were going to have long-term adverse consequences for the functioning of the country.
As the war grinds on, OHCHR said, the Russian Federation has moved to impose its own legal, political, and administrative systems in areas it has occupied in violation of international humanitarian law. It noted that under international law the occupying power must maintain the status quo, to the extent possible. Instead, the Russian Federation is acting as the sovereign power over occupied territory by holding ‘elections’, appointing Russian judges, and applying Russian law, even retroactively, and conscripting Ukrainian men to serve in the Russian military.
The report called upon the Russian Federation to ensure the prompt return of all deported and transferred individuals, including children and persons with disabilities; refrain from changing the personal status of children displaced from Ukraine, including their nationality and their legal guardians.

Title: CIVILIANS AND HUMANITARIAN PERSONNEL IN UKRAINE ARE NOT A TARGET
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 December 2023
STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON RECENT ATTACKS IMPACTING CIVILIANS, CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS IN UKRAINE
The attacks by Russian forces over the past week, harming civilians, civilian infrastructure and humanitarian operations across Ukraine, are unacceptable.
The week began with significant damage to a humanitarian hub of a local non-governmental organization following an attack in Kherson. Life-saving humanitarian supplies were destroyed, depriving thousands of people of aid in this difficult winter time. The following day, a volunteer from another national NGO, a resident of Kherson, was killed. Since the beginning of the year, 15 aid workers have been killed in Ukraine, including 11 in the line of duty, and 34 injured.
In further attacks during this week, more health facilities were damaged, and four health workers were injured in Kherson City. Attacks continued in other parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, as well as in the central Dnipro Region, killing and injuring civilians, harming civilian infrastructure and impeding aid distribution.
I strongly condemn the civilian toll of these attacks, which indicate a blatant disregard for civilian life and international humanitarian law. Civilians and critical civilian infrastructure, including humanitarian and medical facilities, which are crucial for saving lives, must be protected.
Humanitarians must be allowed to operate safely to provide relief to millions of civilians affected by the brutality of this war.

Title: The Universal Declaration offers Ukraine a way forward, Türk says
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
07 December 2023
Statement delivered by Volker Türk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, at the International Human Rights Conference “Freedom or Fear”
Kyiv, Ukraine
Excellencies,
Distinguished delegates,
Thank you for the invitation to participate in this important event.
When the United Nations Charter was adopted in 1945, its commitments were clear. Prevention of conflict. Peaceful resolutions between countries. Respect for the sovereignty of each nation, and for the fundamental principles of justice, equality and cooperation.
In the context of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine launched nearly two years ago, these commitments and principles have been flouted.
And the people of Ukraine have experienced daily pain, suffering, displacement and destruction, as I could see when I visited your country about a year ago.
More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in less than two years, and this is a conversative estimate. More than six million have fled.
Homes, schools and medical facilities, along with energy infrastructure, have been destroyed, in violation of international law. Humanitarian needs are growing – particularly as temperatures begin to drop this winter – leaving the most vulnerable, such as older people, people with disabilities and displaced people, at enormous risk.
To say the least, these are extremely painful times for human rights.
Indeed, around the world we are witnessing levels of violent conflict not seen since 1945. Today, one quarter of humanity lives in areas affected by conflict. That amounts to two billion people.
Add to this deepening geopolitical tensions and a determined pushback on human rights at the global level.
It is easy to lose hope.
But I am firmly convinced that history can offer us a way forward.
Seventy-five years ago, shaken by two world wars, by genocide, by the nuclear threat, and by the Great Depression, States committed to protect and advance the rights of every human being.
They came up with a blueprint to do so: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The purpose of today’s event is not to celebrate, but to reflect. To ask why and how this document helped shape a future of hope and how it paved the way from fear and want, to freedom.
And how we can use it as a way forward to address today’s challenges.
In the face of the scale, complexity and pace of these challenges, notably here in Ukraine, we know that maintaining the status quo is no longer tenable.
It is more critical than ever that we return to the promises of the Universal Declaration.
To recall the universality of rights, and to advance towards a vision of rights as solutions.
Even amidst the utter human tragedy that is war, it is important to remain committed to this vision.
Leadership that lives up to these ideals – where human rights underpin policy, economy and governance – is leadership that brings dignity, freedom and justice.
My Office continues its human rights monitoring in Ukraine, where we aim to establish the facts and document violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.
For too long, the people of Ukraine have been living a nightmare of bloodshed and loss. Yet I have been impressed by Ukrainians that I have met over the years, who have not lost hope in building a future shaped by the values of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of each member of the human family.
To achieve this, there must be enduring peace, in line with the United Nations Charter and international law.
Thank you.

Title: INCESSANT ATTACKS ON VITAL SERVICES PUT THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IN FRONT-LINE COMMUNITIES IN PERIL
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 November 2023
STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON ATTACKS IMPACTING CRITICAL SERVICES IN FRONT-LINE COMMUNITIES
I am deeply worried as attacks by the Russian Armed Forces on civilian infrastructure and civilians appear to have increased over the last weeks, as the onset of winter with below-zero temperatures brings another layer of challenges to front-line communities in Ukraine.
Hospitals, patients, and health workers in the Kherson and Donetsk Regions have been under constant strikes, including in Selydove two days ago. Power plants and electricity transmission systems have been frequently hit, with gas and water systems cut off in Nikopol.
As temperatures plummet, thousands of families may be unable to keep warm and safe due to these attacks. After nearly ten years of fighting and two years after the escalation of the war, civilians in the front-line eastern and southern parts of the country have depleted their resources, many reaching their breaking point.
We will continue to support affected people across the country together with our humanitarian partners and volunteers. But the recent trend of attacks on civilian infrastructure and facilities that provide essential services during the winter is unacceptable and inhumane.
The International Humanitarian Law is clear and MUST be respected to protect the lives of civilians.

Title: Civilian Deaths In Ukraine War Top 10,000, UN Says
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
21 November 2023
At least 10,000 civilians, including more than 560 children, have been killed and over 18,500 have been injured since Russia launched its a full-scale armed attack against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said today.
On 15 November, four people were killed when a missile struck a four-storey apartment building in Selydove village in the Donetsk Oblast, in an area controlled by Ukraine, pushing the total number of those killed above 10,000. Among these latest victims was a family that had been displaced earlier in the war and an 85-year-old woman.
“Ten thousand civilian deaths is a grim milestone for Ukraine,” said Danielle Bell, who heads the monitoring mission. “The Russian Federation's war against Ukraine, now entering into its 21st month, risks evolving into a protracted conflict, with the severe human cost being painful to fathom,” she added.
The HRMMU stated that the figure of 10,000 represents civilian deaths verified according to its methodology but cautioned that the actual figure may be significantly higher given the challenges and time required for verification.
Last week’s incident in Selydove is a typical example of attacks that are currently causing civilian casualties, the HRMMU said. During the recent three-month period, from August to October, most verified civilian casualties – 86 per cent – occurred in government-controlled territory. The vast majority were caused by explosive weapons with wide area effect – such as artillery shells and rockets, cluster munitions, missiles, and loitering munitions. Older people are also disproportionally represented among civilian casualties in Ukraine because they are often not able to relocate to safer places.
HRMMU monitoring shows a significant number of civilian casualties occurring far beyond the frontlines, primarily attributed to the Russian armed forces’ deployment of long-range missiles and loitering munitions against targets in populated areas across the country.
“Nearly half of civilian casualties in the last three months have occurred far away from the frontlines. As a result, no place in Ukraine is completely safe,” Bell warned.

Title: WFP EXPANDS ITS SUPPORT TO THE NATIONAL SCHOOL FEEDING PROGRAMME IN UKRAINE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
16 November 2023
The UN World Food Programme (WFP) today signed agreements with oblasts to support daily school meals for more than 60,000 children in 420 schools across the country.
In the last academic year, WFP and the Ministry of Education and Science signed a Memorandum of Understanding and Cooperation on the implementation of the school feeding programme. During this first phase of the programme, WFP supported the preparation of meals for 12,000 children in 58 schools in the Kyiv oblast. Thanks to generous funding from the Government of France and private donors, WFP was able to expand the programme across the country this year.
During the 2023-2024 academic year, WFP will fund 30% of the daily hot meals for children in schools in the Kyiv, Lviv, Zakarpattia, Ternopil, Khmelnytskyi, Chernihiv, Chernivtsi, Cherkasy, Mykolaiv, Odesa, and Poltava oblasts. Schools will utilize the funds received through the programme to improve the quality of the meals or to reduce the fee paid by parents to the canteen.
Oblasts were selected based on a range of criteria, including food security level, as well as the number of internally displaced persons.
WFP operates within the framework of the Government’s School Nutrition Reform, in close coordination with the Ministry of Education and Science, oblast and hromada authorities and schools.
“Many children in Ukraine are resuming in-person learning in war-affected regions,” said WFP Country Director in Ukraine Matthew Hollingworth. “We are fully committed to supporting them, their parents and their schools by funding daily meals to keep them healthy and focused, as well as relieve some pressure on their families’ budgets.”
"In wartime, it is critically important for us adults to take care of children's well-being. And providing daily hot meals is one of the ways to support them. We are grateful to the UN World Food Programme for the systematic support of Ukrainian children and a significant contribution to their healthy future," said Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Ukraine Andrii Stashkiv.
France, whose funding enabled the expansion of the school feeding programme, recently hosted the first global summit of the School Meals Coalition, which strives to ensure every child receives school meals by 2030.
School feeding is one of many ways WFP supports Ukrainians affected by the war. WFP also distributes food parcels in areas closest to the frontline, where food is hard to find or very expensive, as well as cash assistance to displaced and vulnerable Ukrainians across the country. WFP is also supporting the safe release of mined agricultural land in the Kharkiv region to help farmers and food producers resume work.

Title: DENMARK BECOMES FIRST CONTRIBUTOR FOR NEW UKRAINE COMMUNITY RECOVERY FUND
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 November 2023
Denmark has become the first contributor to the new Ukraine Community Recovery Fund (UCRF), a financial instrument launched by the UN in Ukraine in collaboration the Ministry for Restoration of Ukraine. The Fund supports community-level investments in reconstruction of housing, energy, social infrastructure, humanitarian demining, and support to livelihoods and local economic development. These interventions are combined with targeted capacity strengthening of local authorities for essential service provision and community mobilization.
“Denmark strongly believes in the importance of a community-focused approach to recovery,” said Dan Jørgensen, the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation and Global Climate Policy. “Since 2022, we have worked closely with the city of Mykolaiv and the Mykolaiv Oblast in the south of Ukraine, providing layers of assistance ranging from generators and drinking water systems early on to the comprehensive restoration of social infrastructure and entire residential neighborhoods now. Throughout this process, UN agencies have been our partners, and we are delighted to take on the important role of first mover and an advocate to other donors to support the Fund and the community recovery approach in Ukraine.”
“Community recovery requires us to work together. The results the UN has achieved for recovery on the ground are only possible because UN agencies worked together in joint teams with the local administrations and other partners. This work is critical for those communities, and it is a good start. But it is not enough,” said Denise Brown, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine. “Denmark’s contribution as First Mover is an important one. We already see it catalyzing further contributions to the Fund and expanding our reach so that we can support more Ukrainian families to go back to their communities and homes.”

Title: BRUTAL ATTACKS ON UKRAINIAN CIVILIANS AND HEALTH CARE ARE UTTERLY UNACCEPTABLE AND MUST CEASE IMMEDIATELY
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
13 November 2023
STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON ATTACKS IN KHERSON
I am utterly outraged and profoundly disturbed by the brutal attacks this afternoon in the centre of Kherson, in the South of Ukraine, killing and injuring civilians, including health care workers. An innocent two-month-old baby girl has been hospitalized with a blast injury.
My deepest sympathies are with the families who have endured the unbearable loss of their loved ones due to ruthless attacks in Kherson and across Ukraine.
The consequences of this attack extend beyond the loss of human life: multiple houses, a hospital and an ambulance were struck in the central part of the city.
Over the last day, civilians in the front-line city of Kherson continued to pay the highest price due to incessant brutal attacks. In some parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, including Kherson, services have been decimated, with not even half of hospitals or clinics remaining functional.
Since the escalation of the war in February 2022, the World Health Organization verified over 1,300 attacks on health care in Ukraine, accounting for more than 50 per cent of all attacks against health care in the world over this period.
These relentless attacks from the Russian Federation must come to an end. Each innocent life claimed by the invasion of Ukraine stands as a harrowing testament to the sheer brutality of this war.
Health facilities, health workers and civilians have special protection under international humanitarian law, and attacking them is a grave violation.

09 November 2023
STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON YESTERDAY'S ATTACKS HITTING A CIVILIAN VESSEL ENTERING THE PORT OF PIVDENNYI
I am outraged to learn of an attack yesterday on a civilian vessel as it was entering the Ukrainian Black Sea Port of Pivdennyi in Odesa, killing a port worker and injuring crew members. I share my condolences with the family of the killed port pilot and hope for the recovery of the injured.
This happens just a few days after a series of attacks that killed and injured civilians, destroyed grain supplies and damaged a 124-year-old Fine Arts Museum in Odesa, in the south of Ukraine.
Yesterday's attack is one of over 30 attacks on Ukrainian port facilities since the termination of the Black Sea Initiative in July. This tragic incident marks the first time civilians are killed and injured on a civilian vessel.
The consequences of this brutal and relentless pattern of Russian attacks on port facilities are devasting for Ukraine's economy and the hundreds of millions of people facing hunger worldwide.
International humanitarian law strictly prohibits attacks on civilian infrastructure.

Title: UN REPORT LINKS RUSSIA TO DEADLY ATTACK ON UKRAINIAN VILLAGE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
31 October 2023
The United Nations Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) today said it has reasonable grounds to believe that Russia carried out the deadly missile strike that claimed the lives of 59 civilians in the village of Hroza in Eastern Ukraine on 5 October.
A new report released today by HRRMU concludes that Russia either failed to undertake all feasible measures to verify that the intended target was a military objective rather than civilians or civilian objects, or deliberately targeted civilians or a civilian object, in either event in violation of international humanitarian law.
“This attack on the Hroza café, which claimed the lives of 36 women, 22 men and an eight-year-old boy, stands as one of the deadliest incidents since the start of the Russian full-scale armed attack in February 2022,” said Danielle Bell, who heads the UN’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. “It serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of the war in Ukraine and underscores the necessity of holding perpetrators accountable,” she added.
The report says that the extensive damage and the remnants of the weapon found at the site of the incident point to a Russian Iskander missile as the likely cause of the explosion. This short-range precision-guided ballistic missile struck Hroza's sole café approximately 20 to 25 minutes after 63 local residents had gathered there to commemorate the reburial of a Ukrainian soldier who had fallen earlier in the war.
UN human rights monitors documented that all the victims were civilians and that there were no military personnel or any other legitimate military target present at or in proximity to the reception at the café.
The report also details the utterly devastating impact of the strike, with 15 families of the village losing more than one family member in the attack. A local resident recounted that her daughter's friend could only be identified by her manicure when rescue workers discovered her hand. For many others, identification relied solely on DNA tests.
Although Russia did not explicitly acknowledge responsibility for the attack, Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN Security Council depicted the Hroza funeral gathering as a legitimate military target, an assertion contradicted by the information collected and verified by HRMMU.
The Russian Federation is urged to acknowledge responsibility for the civilian casualties resulting from the attack, to conduct a full and transparent investigation into the attack to hold those responsible to account and prevent similar attacks from happening in the future, and to provide access to remedy, including reparations, for direct and indirect victims.

Title: Rapid Environmental Assessment of Kakhovka Dam Breach Ukraine, 2023
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 October 2023
Much of the damage caused by the breach of Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam in June 2023 is irreversible, with likely changes to the environment that could have impacts on ecosystems and human health. These findings are part of an assessment published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), which calls for specific immediate and long-term remediation measures.
The Rapid Environmental Assessment of the Kakhovka Dam Breach, carried out at the request of the Ukrainian Government, concluded that consequences will be felt for decades, reaching far beyond Ukraine’s borders. The assessment was led by experts from 13 institutions in Kyiv and abroad, and leveraged official data, satellite imagery and remote sensing, while noting challenges in accessing the site that is in a war zone.
The assessment encompasses damage caused both upstream and downstream, including hydrological and geomorphic impacts, chemical contamination, waste, and ecological damage, including to protected areas. The assessment does not address the full impacts on irrigation, drinking water and supply of water to industry – including the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant – and associated human health impacts.
External financial and technical support is urgent and indispensable for the planning and implementation of remediation and restoration actions for the dam. More generally, this breach is a continuation of a wider suite of damage and environmental devastation, previously discussed in a UNEP review of the environmental impact of the war. It will take several assessments and significant funding to address the full scale of environmental impacts within all parts of the affected territory.

Title: Amidst the war, Ukraine’s First Mental Health Forum Hosts Hundreds in Kyiv
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 October 2023
KYIV, UKRAINE, 20 October 2023 – A first of its kind hybrid forum titled "Moving Towards Mental Health System & Services of the Future: A Case of Building Back and Forward Better in Ukraine" wrapped up its three-day run in Kyiv today.
Organized by World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coordination Center for Mental Health of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the forum brought together over 400 participants, with over two thousand more joining online. These included representatives of government agencies and non-governmental sector, local and international organizations, mental health experts from Ukraine and a number of countries - France, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Slovakia, Canada, as well as from WHO headquarters and the WHO Regional Office for Europe.
"Our task and the task of such forums is to establish horizontal cooperation. We need to understand who refers to whom and where if necessary. Who should “pick up” and provide the exact assistance a person needs,” said Ukraine’s Minister of Health Dr. Viktor Liashko during the welcoming panel.
The event served as a platform for showcasing global best practices, fostering the exchange of experiences, and crafting innovative solutions through cross-sectoral dialogue to address the pressing issue of mental health amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine.
"Cooperation is important not only at the national but also at the international level,” said Vice Prime Minister and the Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk. “Exchange of experience, coordination of efforts - all this is to ensure that all humanitarian resources sent to Ukraine go to where they are most needed.”
The Forum hosted presentations, panel discussions, workshops, interactive zones, and a marketplace where participating organizations presented their achievements and developments in the area of mental health. Discussions spinned the entire spectrum of mental health care - from awareness raising and fostering a culture of self-help to human rights and engagement of people with lived experience of mental health conditions.
"I am confident that the Forum will contribute to innovative solutions helping ensure that every Ukrainian has access to quality mental health services. We are continuing to make tremendous progress in spite of the ongoing war, and I am grateful to all the partners for coming together to make this work possible," added Dr. Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine.
The Forum is held within the framework of the All-Ukrainian Mental Health Program, created and implemented at the initiative of First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska.
“Addressing the immense trauma and mental health impact of this war cannot wait. It is important to bring humanitarian supplies, but they need to be better connected to health care services and mental health support”, Denise Brown, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine.

Title: UN Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine finds continued war crimes and human rights violations gravely impacting civilians
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
20 October 2023
NEW YORK/VIENNA (20 October 2023) – The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine documented further evidence that Russian authorities have committed indiscriminate attacks and the war crimes of torture, rape and other sexual violence, and deportation of children to the Russian Federation, according to its report submitted to the UN General Assembly.
As the armed conflict in Ukraine continues in its second year, it has further contributed to suffering and hardships for thousands of affected civilians.
Additional indiscriminate attacks with explosive weapons committed by Russian armed forces, which the Commission investigated, have led to deaths and injuries of civilians and the destruction and damage of civilian objects. For example, as a result of an attack in April 2023 on a multistorey block of residential apartments in Uman, Cherkasy region, 24 civilians, mostly women and children, were killed, and part of the building became uninhabitable. The Commissioners spoke with its residents during their recent visit to Ukraine.
The investigations confirmed the Commission’s previous finding that Russian authorities have used torture in a widespread and systematic way in various types of detention facilities. In addition to the Commission’s previous findings of torture in Ukraine and detention facilities in the Russian Federation, the new evidence for this report, collected in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, shows the same pattern of torture in areas under Russian authorities’ control. In the cases investigated, perpetrators mainly tortured men suspected of passing information to the Ukrainian authorities, or of otherwise supporting the Ukrainian armed forces.
Interviews with victims and witnesses illustrated a profound disregard towards human dignity by Russian authorities in these circumstances. Witnesses reported situations in which torture had been committed with such brutality that the victim died. In a detention facility in a school in Biliayivka village, Kherson region, co-detainees requested medical care when a victim showed signs of respiratory distress immediately after being tortured. However, Russian armed forces refused, and the victim died within an hour.
The Commission’s recent investigations in the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia show that rape and other sexual violence were often committed together with additional acts of violence against the victims, including severe beatings, strangling, suffocating, slashing, shooting next to the head of the victim and wilful killing. A 75-year-old woman who stayed alone to protect her property, was attacked by a Russian soldier who hit her on her face, chest, and ribs, strangled her, as he was interrogating her. He ordered her to undress and when she refused, he ripped off her clothes, cut her abdomen with a small sharp object and raped her several times. In addition to the consequences of the rapes, the victim suffered several broken ribs and teeth. The Commission found that, in addition to rape, the war crime of torture was also committed against the victim.
The traumatic experiences described in the report have severe and long-term consequences for the physical and mental health of the victims.
The Commission investigated further accounts regarding transfers of unaccompanied children by Russian authorities to the Russian Federation or to areas they occupied in Ukraine. It documented the transfer of 31 children from Ukraine to Russia in May 2022, and concluded that it was an unlawful deportation, which is a war crime. The Commission is concerned about information regarding measures that have the apparent aim of allowing certain children to remain for prolonged periods in the Russian Federation.
The report contains three cases where the investigations showed that Ukrainian authorities committed violations of human rights against persons whom they have accused of collaboration with the Russian authorities.
The Commission reiterates the importance of accountability, in all its dimensions, with full respect and care for the rights of the victims.

ENDS

The full report as submitted to the UN General Assembly can be found here.
The members of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine are available for interviews.
Background: The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine was created by the UN Human Rights Council in 2022 to investigate all alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, and related crimes in the context of the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine. In March 2024, the Commission will submit a comprehensive report on its activities within its second mandate to the Human Rights Council. The Commission comprises Erik Møse (Chair), Pablo de Greiff and Vrinda Grover.

Title: Things are Not Always as They Seem: IOM Ukraine Launches "LOOK AGAIN" Campaign to Raise Awareness of Human Trafficking
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 October 2023

Kyiv — On European Day Against Trafficking in People, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Ukraine has launched an awareness campaign called "LOOK AGAIN." This campaign's primary goal is to fight against human trafficking and to help people understand the risks that can come with employment opportunities that seem too good to be true.
According to IOM’s estimates from 2022, more than 32 million people, or 85% of the entire population of Ukraine, have been affected by the full-scale war. “Faced with the direct or indirect impact of hostilities, displacement and a weakened economy, the population in Ukraine has become more prone to trafficking and more vulnerable to other forms of exploitation,” said IOM Ukraine’s Deputy Chief of Mission, Marco Chimenton. “Every second Ukrainian is ready to accept at least one risky offer that could lead to human trafficking or exploitation.”
The "LOOK AGAIN" campaign goes beyond making people aware of the issue of human trafficking; it urges people in Ukraine to be careful when they encounter attractive job or housing offers that could lead to exploitation and provides examples of commonly used schemes used by recruiters to lure people into different types of exploitation.

The campaign has strong support from its partners, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway, and the Ministry of Justice of Sweden. It was launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine and the All-Ukrainian Coalition of NGOs to Combat Human Trafficking, playing a significant role.
“Modern-day slavery still exists and brings huge profits to the exploiters,” said Deputy Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine, Iryna Postolovska. She called on Ukrainians to be cautious when considering jobs or assistance offers: “Check as much information as you can, do not give your ID documents to anyone, let your relatives and friends know where you are, think of a code word that would allow you to inform them that you are in danger, and study the language of the country  you are staying in.”
A total of 296 survivors of human trafficking have been supported by IOM Ukraine so far this year, with nearly 20,000 survivors supported since the year 2000.
The "LOOK AGAIN" installation will be visible in 21 regions of Ukraine, including places such as train stations, malls, and town squares. Other communication products developed within the campaign will be widely shared in the following weeks.

Title: Kakhovka Dam destruction inflicted US$14 billion damage and loss on Ukraine: Government of Ukraine–UN report
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
17 October 2023
17 October 2023, KYIV – The destruction of the Kakhovka dam inflicted almost US$14 billion in loss and damage on Ukraine, compounding the already disastrous impacts of Russia’s full-scale invasion, according to a new report released by the Government of Ukraine and the United Nations. The initial estimate for total recovery and reconstruction needs is $5.04 billion, and this figure is expected to grow as more detailed assessments are carried out. In the short term, $1.82 billion is required for recovery efforts in the 2023/2024 period.
The new Post Disaster Needs Assessment lays bare the scale of the 6 June 2023 tragedy, which wreaked economic and environmental havoc in areas downstream from the Kakhovka dam and hydropower plant on the Dnipro River, as well as upstream areas losing access to water supply.
The Kakhovka dam breach caused massive damage, submerging 620 square kilometres of territory in four oblasts—Kherson, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zaporizhzhia—impacting 100,000 residents directly. It severely damaged housing, infrastructure, the environment, and cultural sites such as historic buildings, museums, and places of worship.
In addition, it disrupted energy supplies, drinking water, agricultural irrigation, and river transport in southern Ukraine.
According to this comprehensive report, direct damage to infrastructure and assets amounted to US$2.79 billion, while losses exceeded US$11 billion, with the lasting environmental impact being the biggest concern. The direct damage to infrastructure and assets was highest in the energy and housing sectors.
The report estimates that total recovery and reconstruction needs are US$5.04 billion, of which US$1.82 billion will be required in the immediate- to short-term.
This assessment will undergo further refinement during the forthcoming round of the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment carried out by the Government of Ukraine, the United Nations, the World Bank, and the European Union.
Note to editors:
The Post Disaster Needs Assessment was prepared jointly by the United Nations and teams from the Government of Ukraine, led by the Ministry of the Economy, with inputs by the World Bank Group and the European Union. The UN entities that contributed to the report comprise the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Labor Organization (ILO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Title: Odesa Procurement and Vendor Fair helps Ukrainian businesses drive recovery in tandem with the UN
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
16 October 2023
The Ukrainian business community consistently demonstrates remarkable resilience and innovation daily. Ukrainian companies, especially the small and medium enterprises, are a driving force as the country strives to rebuild amid the Russian invasion, and the UN in Ukraine is offering practical ways to help them expand their business opportunities in this process.
The 2nd UN Procurement and Vendor Fair, held in Odesa on 16 October, was aimed at local businesses from Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and the wider region, with the goal of increasing their awareness of UN procurement practices and how to join the UN’s pool of vendors. The event featured a hands-on workshop, where over 30 UN procurement professionals offered support to businesses in the registration process on UN platforms and shared practical tips and best practices for successful applications.
The UN, working closely with the Government and local partners, launched massive humanitarian operations in the wake of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While these continue, there has been an increasing emphasis on helping communities rebuild – which is where the private sector comes in.
In humanitarian and recovery operations alike, prioritizing the sourcing of supplies and expertise within Ukraine is an important way to strengthen economic and social resilience, to save jobs, and to build back.
Jointly organized with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Odesa Regional Administration and the NGO United Activities in Odesa, the fair gathered over 300 representatives of the local business community in-person and online.  The event equipped local entrepreneurs with practical information on how the UN holds procurement and how to apply for UN tenders.
The United Nations in Ukraine has extensive procurement activities. In 2022, Ukrainian businesses secured contracts worth of US$474 million. These contracts span a range of sectors, such as food products, construction materials, machinery, industrial manufacturing materials, textiles, healthcare-related goods and services, and information technology services.
In the wake of the full-scale Russian invasion, the UN has significantly bolstered the Ukrainian economy by injecting US$1.2 billion in cash assistance. This assistance reached 5.96 million people nationwide, with a specific allocation of US$64 million going to Odesa, where it supported over 368,000 individuals.
Furthermore, the UN has also been actively displaced businesses in Odesa by offering grants, business assistance, and facilitating access to finance and markets. Many of these businesses are SMEs directly impacted by the conflict and are either owned by or employ women, youth, people with disabilities, or internally displaced individuals.
The Odesa fair is the second of its kind, following one held in Kyiv in March. The UN keeps monitoring the outcomes of that event and the results are very encouraging. Over 700 Ukrainian businesses have already joined the UN Global Marketplace, thereby gaining access to UN tenders. Many have already secured contracts with the World Food Program for food supply, housing material provision with the International Organization for Migration, and machinery procurement for agricultural demining in Kharkiv with the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme.

Title: Restoring access to primary healthcare in war torn areas: WHO's 14 modular primary care facilities replace damaged facilities for Ukraine's frontline communities
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 October 2023
The ongoing war in Ukraine, caused by the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion, continues to bring daily destruction and loss of life. It has severely impacted the healthcare sector, resulting in the disruption of essential primary health care services for frontline communities. Amid to the humanitarian crisis, healthcare facilities have been affected since 24 February 2022, with over 1,200 attacks recorded by WHO. To ensure continued access to primary healthcare in areas where existing facilities are destroyed or irreparable, WHO is installing modular primary care facilities in partnership with the Ministry of Health Ukraine (MOH) Ukraine.
The modular primary care facilities are prefabricated healthcare units to ensure quick installation on the spot. To scale up primary care infrastructure these units are one of WHO's key response and recovery projects in Ukraine, offering a rapid solution to an acute problem. While they are a temporary solution, they can serve as replacements for damaged facilities for up to 10 years.
Currently, there are 14 modular primary care clinics in total, with five fully operational and three currently in progress of installation, and three will be installed soon. This total also includes three units in contingency stock for emergencies. The project covers four regions identified by authorities, including Kherson, Kharkiv, Sumy, and Mykolayv.
On October 3, 2023, as part of this initiative, a new modular primary healthcare clinic was installed in the village of Khukra in the Sumy region.
This newly installed structure will serve as an outpatient facility, like the other modular clinics, providing primary healthcare services to a population of over three thousand.
All these modular clinics are equipped with essential amenities, including electricity, sanitary facilities, sewage systems, waiting rooms, and patient examination rooms. Generators and air fans are provided to maintain an optimal environment for healthcare delivery.
The modular clinic in the Sumy region comprises 8 prefabricated modules combined to form a fully functional health facility, with 4 rooms for receiving patients and the capacity 11 healthcare workers to work simultaneously. This clinic, like others, will be staffed by health care workers, as primary care physician and nurses, who previously worked at damaged or destroyed facilities, ensuring continuity of primary care.
Other modular clinics are also assembled from varying numbers of prefabricated modules, depending on the required number of patient rooms. These structures can be assembled and installed within just 10 days to 2 weeks each.
Gerald Rockenschaub, Regional Emergency Director of WHO Regional Office for Europe: "The war in Ukraine has had devastating repercussions for the healthcare sector, severely limiting access to essential services in frontline communities. Through this initiative, WHO is working tirelessly to restore vital primary health services. Despite facing numerous challenges and experiencing a higher number of healthcare attacks than any other humanitarian emergency worldwide, WHO remains committed to this critical support for Ukraine."
Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine at World Health Organization: "Modular clinics serve as temporary replacements for damaged facilities in the areas most affected by the war, providing infrastructure where doctors and nurses can provide essential primary healthcare services, particularly for chronic conditions where needs are highest. This initiative aligns with the broader humanitarian and United Nations effort to empower frontline communities and facilitate community-driven recovery, addressing the gap in access to vital primary healthcare, which is a fundamental step in restoring normalcy. For us, this represents the true bridge between acute response and early recovery for health".
Maryna Slobodnichenko, Deputy Minister of Health for European Integration:  "For more than 19 months of the war, Russia has damaged more than 1,400 healthcare facilities and destroyed another 190. The enemy is purposefully terrorizing Ukrainians and destroying healthcare facilities every day. Every bullet and projectile are a proof of this deliberate terror against civilians, said Deputy Minister for European Integration Maryna Slobodnichenko. - However, thanks to strong support and cooperation with WHO and other international partners, step by step we manage to move forward and rebuild destroyed hospitals so that patients have full access to the essential healthcare. The creation of modular clinics) is a very important collaboration for us, aimed at real results and helping our patients today."
Emanuele Bruni, Incident Manager in WHO Ukraine: “We are in the final stages of installation for all the modular clinics, and they will soon be fully functional, ready to receive patients starting from this autumn. This sustainable yet swift solution is designed to ensure an effective emergency response and qualified primary health care”.
As part of the first stage of the project, Sumy region marks the third installation, and 8 more modules will be distributed soon, as indicated by the MOH's priority list for the most affected regions.
The Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) is providing the necessary financial support for this project.

Title: Ukraine: UNESCO trains 50,000 teachers on digital pedagogy
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 October 2023
Kyiv, 11 October 2023 – UNESCO and Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science are launching an online training in digital pedagogy for 50,000 teachers, while the education of many Ukrainian students is still disrupted by the war.
Many of Ukrainian students were unable to start the academic year in the classroom. According to the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, 25% of them are studying remotely and 30% are studying in a hybrid format. Last year, UNESCO and partners provided 50,000 teachers with computers. Now, UNESCO is providing teachers with an online training and a suite of resources to further develop their digital skills and help them deliver quality distance and hybrid learning.
“Since February 2022, UNESCO has continuously supported Ukrainian teachers to ensure that students continue learning in the midst of war. I pay tribute to their work, resilience and continued dedication. As the new academic year has just begun, UNESCO reaffirms its commitment to them. Because education is the cornerstone on which Ukraine's future is built,” said Stefania Giannini, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education.
A comprehensive approach to support teachers
In Ukraine, the ongoing war has put further strain on the education system with school teachers being among the internally displaced persons and lacking the tools and training to keep teaching at a distance or in hybrid mode. The new “Digital Teacher” training launched by UNESCO with funding from Google.org will address these challenges – by strengthening teachers skills and ability to leverage digital tools, while improving their working conditions and well-being.
Developed by UNESCO and a group of Ukrainian experts, the online training comprises seven modules, each containing guidance and interactive activities where teachers can discuss specific questions and access practical exercises, tests and additional resources. It facilitates the creation of relevant, authentic and engaging learning experiences. The content also addresses aspects of mental health, psychosocial support, social and emotional learning.
“In the new school year, 1 million Ukrainian students are forced to pursue their education exclusively through distance learning. Such a situation requires enhancing digital solutions to ensure equal access to quality education for all in the midst of war. As we commemorate World Teacher’s Day, we join hands with UNESCO to empower teachers with the 'Digital Teacher' project,” said, Dmytro Zavgorodyi, Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Ukraine.
Alongside the course, UNESCO is establishing a Community of Practice and a mentoring network to support educators in developing their competencies. Teachers will be able to exchange best practices, share innovative teaching methodologies, and collectively address challenges related to digital teaching and learning.

Title: UN Human Rights Monitors Visit the Scene of a Missile Strike That Killed Dozens in Eastern Ukraine

07 October 2023
Hroza, Ukraine 7 October 2023 – Officials from the United Nations Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) today visited the scene of a deadly missile attack that killed at least 52 persons in the village of Hroza in eastern Ukraine on Thursday.
“My initial conversations with local residents and survivors indicate that virtually all those killed were civilians and that the target itself, a busy village café and store, was also clearly civilian,” said Danielle Bell who heads the monitoring mission and who led the team that visited Hroza on Saturday.
“What happened here is yet another tragic reminder of the deadly impact Russia’s invasion has had on Ukraine’s civilians,” she added.
Thursday’s attack in which a missile hit a busy local café, where residents had gathered for a wake to honor a fallen soldier, wiped out a significant portion of the small village’s population. According to initial findings, only one of those killed, also a local resident was a soldier who was attending the wake for his father. It is one of the deadliest strikes since Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine.
“My heart goes out to the victims of this barbaric attack and their loved ones. We will spare no effort to determine who did this in the hope that one day they will be held accountable,” Bell said, adding that said human rights teams will continue to gather information on the attack.
The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission says more than 9,700 civilians have been killed and almost 18,000 have suffered injuries since Russia attacked Ukraine on February 24, 2022. But it cautions that the real casualty figure could be much higher as human rights monitors have been barred by Russia from visiting areas where some of the most intense fighting took place despite numerous requests for access.

HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS ATTACK THAT KILLED AND INJURED SCORES OF CIVILIANS IN THE KHARKIV REGION
I am appalled by the reports of a Russian strike that, shortly ago, ripped apart the village of Hroza, in the Kharkiv Region, killing dozens of civilians. The images arriving from the locality, home to just above 300 people, are absolutely horrifying.
On behalf of the United Nations and the humanitarian community, I sent my most heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. Our thoughts are also with the people of Ukraine, who had to witness today, once again, another barbaric consequence of Russia’s invasion.
Intentionally directing an attack against civilians or civilian objects is a war crime. Intentionally launching an attack knowing that it would be disproportionate is a war crime.

Title: ALMOST 20 MONTHS INTO RUSSIA’s ATTACK THE UN REPORTS A MOUNTING CIVILIAN TOLL AND RAMPANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
04 October 2023
KYIV 4 October 2023 – In a new report released today (Wednesday) the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) painted a bleak picture of the human rights situation in the country. With Russia’s invasion well into its 20th month, Ukraine’s civilians continue to pay a horrendous price with nearly 10,000 dead and tens of thousands injured, the report said, noting that over the past six months, the war has claimed, on average, six civilian lives a day.  Missile attacks against residential areas and vital infrastructure, as well as grain and agricultural facilities, often located far from frontline areas, continue to sow fear and destruction across Ukraine.  Civilians in areas occupied by Russia face torture, ill-treatment, sexual violence and arbitrary detention, Hundreds remain imprisoned, with their families unaware of their fate.
“The report’s findings show the war’s deadly toll on Ukraine’s civilians with almost six people dying and 20 suffering injuries on average every single day. In just six months covered by this report more than one thousand civilians died and nearly four thousand were injured.” said Danielle Bell who heads the UN’s human right monitoring mission in Ukraine.
The war has caused millions of Ukrainian civilians to fall below the poverty line.  Their plight has been further exacerbated by broad economic and social harm caused by attacks on vital infrastructure and agricultural facilities. An example of this was the destruction of the Khakovka dam earlier this year that triggered major flooding and caused an environmental disaster that will have long-term adverse effects on the rights and well-being of the people living in the area.
“The war has wreaked havoc in the lives of millions of Ukrainians, including children who will have to live with horrific legacy of human loss, physical destruction, environmental damage, particularly contamination from explosive remnants of war, for many years to come,” said Bell.
The UN report said human rights monitors continued to document widespread torture and ill-treatment against civilians and POWs by Russian authorities, including severe beatings, electrocution, mock executions, sexual violence and degrading treatment. Appalling conditions of detention continued, including: lack of food and medical services; overcrowding; poor living conditions and sanitation; sleep deprivation; and no access to the outside world. Russia to date has refused to allow any access to the UN’s human rights monitors.
In contrast, the report notes that Ukraine continues to grant human rights monitors unfettered access to interned POWs and that conditions in Ukraine’s POW camp near the western city of Lviv have improved.
The report called for further investigation into the deadly attack on the penal colony of Olenivka in late July of 2022, which killed 51 Ukrainian prisoners of war and injured at least 139.  But it ruled out that HIMARS rockets were used in the attack, noting that the available evidence is consistent with a projected ordnance having followed an east-to-west trajectory. The report faulted Russia for keeping prisoners of war in the proximity of the front line in violation of international humanitarian law and for not giving the UN access to the site.
In occupied areas, the report provided examples of Russia introducing its own administrative and education systems. Civilians in territory occupied by Russia were under pressure to accept Russian citizenship, with the occupying authorities making access to health care, pensions and other basic benefits dependent on the acceptance of Russian nationality. Male residents of the occupied areas faced intimidation, in an effort to coerce them to join the Russian armed forces, the report said.
While highlighting progress on some issues in areas controlled by Ukraine, the report noted the continued prosecution by Ukraine of thousands of individuals accused of collaboration with Russia in areas previously occupied by the Russian armed forces. The accused were often charged and convicted for conduct that could in principle be lawfully compelled by the occupying power under international humanitarian law, it said.
The report raised concern about the fate of Ukrainian children, some of them in institutional care with physical and intellectual disabilities, who were transferred from their regular places of residence to other locations within the areas occupied by Russia or deported to Russia. The report also mentioned cases of children who had been sent to summer camps in Russia with their parents’ purported consent but then were not returned home. The report notes that Russia to date has failed to identify the children and reunite them with their families and calls for the return of all deported and transferred individuals, including children and persons with disabilities.

Title: UN Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine finds continued systematic and widespread use of torture and indiscriminate attacks harming civilians
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
25 September 2023
GENEVA (25 September 2023) – There is continuous evidence that Russian armed forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine, including unlawful attacks with explosive weapons, attacks harming civilians, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, and attacks on energy infrastructure, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine said in its latest update today.
During a presentation to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the Commission reported that it had documented explosive weapons attacks on residential buildings, a functional medical facility, a railway station, a restaurant, shops and commercial warehouses. These attacks led to civilian casualties, the damage or destruction of key facilities, and the disruption of essential services and supplies.
The Commission deplores that attacks affecting civilians and medical institutions, which have protected status, continue to take place.
The Commission is investigating the cause of the breach of the Nova Kakhovka dam and its impact on the civilian population.
The Commission’s investigations in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia indicate the widespread and systematic use of torture by Russian armed forces against persons accused of being informants of the Ukrainian armed forces. In some cases, torture was inflicted with such brutality that it caused the death of the victim.
One victim who suffered torture through electric shocks stated: “Every time I answered that I didn’t know or didn’t remember something, they gave me electric shocks … I don’t know how long it lasted. It felt like an eternity.”
In the Kherson region, Russian soldiers raped and committed sexual violence against women of ages ranging from 19 to 83 years, the Commission found. Frequently, family members were kept in an adjacent room hence being forced to hear the violations taking place.
Amongst the many devastating consequences for children, the Commission has continued to investigate individual situations of alleged transfers of unaccompanied minors by Russian authorities to the Russian Federation. It regrets that there is a lack of clarity and transparency on the full extent, circumstances, and categories of children transferred.
The Commission is also concerned about allegations of genocide in Ukraine. For instance, some of the rhetoric transmitted in Russian state and other media may constitute incitement to genocide. The Commission is continuing its investigations on such issues.
The Commission reiterates its deep concern at the scale and gravity of violations that have been committed in Ukraine by Russian armed forces and emphasizes the need for accountability. It also recalls the need for the Ukrainian authorities to expeditiously and thoroughly investigate the few cases of violations by its own forces.
The Commission’s latest update to the Human Rights Council is a continuation of its previous reports, including its Conference Room Paper with detailed findings, released on 29 August 2023.
Since its establishment, the Commission has travelled over ten times to Ukraine. In the course of its investigations, its members and investigators met with government authorities, international organisations, civil society, and other relevant stakeholders.

Title: UNOPS signs new Host Country Agreement with the government of Poland
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 September 2023
In a significant move to bolster collaboration and foster sustainable development, plus early recovery and reconstruction in Ukraine, UNOPS has announced the signing of a Host Country Agreement with the government of Poland. This agreement marks a pivotal milestone in launching UNOPS presence in Poland.
The agreement outlines two primary objectives:
Fostering Early Recovery and Reconstruction in Ukraine: UNOPS is committed to utilizing its expertise in infrastructure, procurement, and project management to spearhead recovery and reconstruction projects in Ukraine.
Increasing Polish Private Sector's Access to UN Procurement Platforms: The agreement further aims to enhance the engagement of Polish companies in UN procurement processes. In 2022, the UN procured  USD 71.71 million worth of goods and services from Poland, accounting for 0.24% of the global procurement value.
Jorge Moreira da Silva, the UNOPS Executive Director said: “This agreement is a testament to partnership. It not only amplifies the solidarity shown by the Polish government and private sector towards Ukraine but also opens avenues for Polish businesses to actively participate in UN procurement processes. We are eager to work hand in hand with the Government of Poland to make a tangible difference in lives and help Ukraine build back better.”
UNOPS will be partnering with the UN Global Compact Network Poland, having already signed a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure the widest possible reach amongst Polish businesses. The Polish office of UNOPS will serve as a hub, attracting the best talent to contribute to projects aimed at the recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine.
Zbigniew Rau, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Poland, remarked: "I am convinced that the presence of UNOPS in Warsaw will strengthen our existing cooperation with the UN, contribute to expanding its scope and give it new energy. At the same time, it will contribute to enlarging the UN family of organizations in Poland.”

Title: STATEMENT BY THE RESIDENT AND HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
21 September 2023
The International Day of Peace.
Let us take this day, and every single day that we wake, to think about the absence of peace in Ukraine and the consequences of war.
Russia’s escalation of the war continues to inflict untold suffering on the lives of the people of Ukraine, who resolutely demonstrate dignity and determination in the face of adversity.
Near-daily air strikes, artillery fire, areas of land contaminated by mines, and constant air raid sirens; these are the harbingers of loss and grief.  Lives are brutally taken, homes are destroyed, local economies shattered. This is the reality of life in Ukraine today.
The high cost of war being paid by this country is a stark reminder of what is lost when there is no peace in Ukraine, and indeed, in too many places around the world.
The position of the United Nations is unequivocal: the Russian Federation has violated the territorial integrity of Ukraine and violated the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law.
Repeated attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are violations of International Humanitarian Law.
At the opening of the 78th Session of the General Assembly, UN Secretary-General made clear, “It is high time to renew multilateral institutions based on 21st century economic and political realities – rooted in equity, solidarity and universality – anchored in the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.”
There is no peace in Ukraine on this International Day of Peace.
We must all strive to change this reality.

Title: Ukraine: UNESCO sites of Kyiv and L’viv are inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 September 2023
Riyadh, Friday 15 September - The World Heritage Committee, meeting in Riyadh until 25 September, decided today to inscribe the sites of "The Saint Sophia Cathedral and Related Monastic Buildings and Lavra of Kyiv-Pechersk" and "L’viv – the ensemble of the historic centre" on the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of destruction the Russian offensive poses.
The UNESCO World Heritage Committee considers that “optimal conditions are no longer met to fully guarantee the protection of the Outstanding Universal Value of the property and that it is threatened by potential danger due to the war”. Faced with the risk of direct attack, these sites are also vulnerable to the shockwaves caused by the bombing of the two cities.
While noting the many actions taken by the Ukrainian authorities to protect their cultural property, the Committee stated that these two heritage sites of outstanding universal value have remained under permanent threat since the start of the invasion on 24 February 2022.
Their inclusion on the List of World Heritage in Danger reminds the 195 States parties to the Convention of their responsibility to monitor and contribute to the protection of these sites. It also opens the door to additional financial and technical aid in order to implement new emergency measures - in line with the measures already taken by Ukraine with UNESCO.
The inclusion of these two sites on the List of World Heritage in Danger comes in addition to that of the Historic Centre of Odesa, already inscribed in January 2023.
About the sites
Kyiv's Saint Sophia Cathedral symbolises the "new Constantinople", capital of the Christian principality created in the 11th century in a region converted to Christianity after the baptism of Saint Vladimir in 988. The spiritual and intellectual influence of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra contributed to the spread of the Orthodox faith and thought on the European continent in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The site has been on the World Heritage List since 1990.
Founded in the late Middle Ages, the city of L’viv flourished as an administrative, religious, commercial and cultural centre from the 13th to the 20th centuries. Its medieval urban topography has been preserved intact, in particular the traces of the different ethnic communities that lived there, as well as the magnificent Baroque and later buildings. The historic centre of L’viv was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1998.

13 September 2023
STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON TODAY’S ATTACKS THAT HIT UKRAINE’S DANUBE PORTS
It is hugely alarming to hear that the two Ukrainian ports in the Danube River were once again struck during overnight Russian attacks on the Odesa Region. This tragic event left at least six civilians injured, according to the port authorities.
Today’s strike on Ukrainian ports was the 21st of such attacks since Russia’s decision to terminate the Black Sea Initiative less than two months ago. It is shocking but since 17 July there has been almost one attack every other day hitting vital port and grain facilities in Ukraine.
The consequences of this brutal and relentless pattern of Russian attacks are catastrophic for the people of Ukraine and the 345 million people facing hunger worldwide.
International humanitarian law strictly prohibits attacks on civilian infrastructure. This must stop.

Yesterday was yet another tragic day for civilians in Ukraine. Two volunteers were killed and another two injured in the Donetsk Region, when their vehicle was reportedly hit during a strike. My thoughts are with their families, friends and colleagues.
Volunteers – mostly national but also people who came from all over the world to help - are going to extraordinary lengths to provide some relief to other civilians living through the devastation caused by Russia’s invasion.
And as any civilians, they are protected under international humanitarian law, and all efforts must be made to ensure they are safe.

Title: Russia’s war in Ukraine synonymous with torture: UN expert
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
10 September 2023
KYIV (10 September 2023) – Russia’s armed aggression is becoming synonymous with torture and other inhuman cruelty, a UN expert said today.
“The volume of credible allegations of torture and other inhumane acts that are being perpetrated against civilians and prisoners of war by Russian authorities appears to be unabating,” said Alice Jill Edwards, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. “These grievous acts appear neither random nor incidental, but rather orchestrated as part of a State policy to intimidate, instil fear, punish, or extract information and confessions,” Edwards said in a statement at the end of an official visit to Ukraine.
The UN torture expert gathered harrowing testimonies involving electric charges being applied to ears and genitals, beatings of all kinds, mock executions at gunpoint, simulated drowning, being required to hold stress positions, threats of rape or death, and various ceremonies of ridicule and humiliation. Returned Ukrainian civilians and soldiers recounted being crowded in basements and cells, in congested conditions, and being poorly fed. Several lost dangerous levels of weight.
Edwards said these acts would constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, prohibited at all times and in all circumstances under international human rights and humanitarian law.
“Because the global prohibition of torture reflects our shared aspiration to live in societies free of fear, perpetrators - including at the highest levels - must be brought to justice,” she stressed.
During the Special Rapporteur’s visit from 4-10 September, she reviewed the procedures and practices of investigation and prosecution of such crimes of torture committed within the context of the armed conflict. According to Ukrainian government figures, over 103,000 war crimes proceedings have been registered so far.
“A major challenge for the authorities is handling the enormity of the allegations, which has required the upscaling of operations, staffing and skill sets,”, said the Special Rapporteur. “The work that the Ukrainian authorities are undertaking to document war crimes is all the more impressive given that it is being carried out ‘in real time’. That early action is virtually unprecedented anywhere in the world.”
“The international duty on every country to investigate and prosecute crimes of torture and other inhuman acts is not altered by war or other exceptional circumstances. Yet these circumstances would pose great challenges for any system,” the expert said.
Edwards was briefed on multiple obstacles to achieving justice for victims. These include the inaccessibility of presently occupied areas, the loss of crucial evidence due to deterioration and lapse of time between the crime and liberation when investigations can begin, and adapting the criminal justice system to be able to process and prosecute international atrocity crimes.
The Ukrainian government reported having strengthened its system of regional prosecutors by establishing mobile investigation units, has expanded forensic expertise and testing facilities, and is upgrading technology and evidence-gathering techniques.
During her seven-day visit to Ukraine, the Special Rapporteur also visited different places and facilities and inspected the conditions of treatment of Russian prisoners of war and those accused of conflict-related crimes.
“I found that sincere efforts have been made by the Ukrainian authorities to treat Russian prisoners of war respectfully. The barrack-style facilities I visited were hygienic and orderly. Prisoners were being well fed, were receiving medical attention for their battlefield injuries, were able to practice their religion and had paid work and recreational facilities,” Edwards said.
The Special Rapporteur met with senior government officials, members of the Supreme Court, all the services involved in investigating and prosecuting crimes of torture, the Coordination Headquarters on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) and National Preventive Mechanism. She had also met with representatives of the diplomatic community, the United Nations, and civil society organisations. She conducted a range of interviews with persons deprived of their liberty, as well as victims and survivors.
The Special Rapporteur will present a report on the visit to the United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2024.

Title: UN Human Rights Official Denounces Attack in Eastern Ukraine

08 September 2023
Kyiv, 8 September 2023 - Danielle Bell, the head of the UN's Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) denounced this week’s horrific attack on a crowded market in Kostyantynivka in Ukraine's Donetsk Region and emphasized its wide-reaching, devastating effects.
The attack, occurring in the early afternoon of 6 September, killed 16 and injured dozens.  An 18-year-old young man and an 83-year-old woman are among the dead.
“An attack on a crowded market in the city centre carries far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the immediate victims and their families, but also the broader community and their livelihoods,” said Bell following her meeting yesterday with the administrative authorities of Kramatorsk Raion, Donetsk Region. “This latest attack, among the deadliest in recent months, yet again reflects the calculated brutality inflicted on Ukrainians since Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly a year and a half ago," she added.
According to HRMMU, over 9,500 civilians have lost their lives, and more than 17,000 have sustained injuries since the commencement of the Russian attack. However, given HRMMU's inability to access to areas under Russian occupation, where intense fighting has occurred, the actual toll could be significantly higher.
HRMMU extends our heartfelt condolences to the grieving families and our compassion to the injured.

08 September 2023
The safety and well-being of children is paramount. Accordingly, upon being made aware that a website previously used by one of our partners for raising mine risk awareness was hijacked and has been displaying objectionable material, we reported this to the Ukrainian Cyber Police unit.
UNICEF has requested that access to this website be blocked, and we are working with relevant authorities and partners to resolve this issue and ensure appropriate measures are taken to prevent harm.
We encourage children and caregivers seeking information on mine safety to visit our website, https://bezpeka.info/ which provides comprehensive guidance on this critical issue.
UNICEF remains committed to fulfilling its mission of protecting the rights and promoting the well-being of every child, and we are actively addressing this incident to safeguard the integrity of this important information campaign.

Title: Ukraine: 20 cultural properties receive enhanced protection by UNESCO’s Second Protocol to the 1954 Hague Convention
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
07 September 2023
Paris, 7 September 2023 – Today, the UNESCO Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict held an extraordinary meeting to strengthen the protection of cultural heritage in Ukraine, including the granting of provisional enhanced protection to 20 cultural properties as well as deciding the training of Ukrainian security forces and judiciary personnel on heritage protection.
Following repeated destructions of cultural properties in Ukraine, an extraordinary session of the Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict was held today, at Ukraine’s request.

During its session, the UNESCO Second Protocol to the 1954 Hague Convention Committee adopted a declaration “deploring that serious damages were caused by Russian missile strikes to historical buildings of cultural significance within the properties in L'viv, Odesa and Chernihiv.”

The Committee decided to provisionally inscribe 20 cultural properties in Ukraine on the International List of Cultural Property under Enhanced Protection. These inscriptions increase their immunity in the course of ongoing war, potentially enabling competent bodies of all 87 States Parties to the 1999 Second Protocol to prosecute or extradite alleged offenders.
“One and a half years on since the invasion, we are witnessing an alarming increase in attacks against Ukraine’s cultural heritage. More actions are needed to avoid irreversible damage to the shared heritage of humanity, and today’s outcome represents a decisive step in the right direction.” – Ernesto Ottone R., Assistant Director General for Culture
These 20 properties now benefit from the highest level of immunity from military attacks as well as threats of making it a military target. Non-compliance with these clauses would be qualified as a “serious violation” to the 1954 Hague Convention and its Second Protocol.

The Committee also decided to financially support the organization of trainings by UNESCO for Ukrainian security forces and judicial personnel, to enhance their skills in protecting cultural heritage. This comes in addition to the various training courses for Ukrainian cultural professionals and heritage preventive protection and rehabilitation measures carried out by UNESCO since the outbreak of the war.

Since 24 February 2022, UNESCO has verified damages to 287 cultural sites in Ukraine, including within boundaries of World Heritage sites.

Title: INTENTIONALLY DIRECTING AN ATTACK AGAINST CIVILIANS OR CIVILIAN OBJECTS IS A WAR CRIME
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 September 2023
STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON ATTACKS THAT TODAY KILLED AND INJURED DOZENS OF CIVILIANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
I am shattered by the news of a series of attacks that today, once again, have left a path of death and destruction in different parts of Ukraine. The despicable attack that a few hours ago hit a populated market in Kostiantynivka, in the Donetsk Region, brutalized civilians in this war-torn community, killing and injuring dozens of adults and children.
It is a truly sad day for Ukraine.
This deeply tragic and unacceptable event is just another example of the suffering that Russia’s invasion inflicts on civilians across the country.
In the south, Russian strikes damaged, also today, schools and homes in Zaporizhizhia, and port and grain infrastructure in the Odesa Region. Repeated attacks on Ukrainian ports are depriving farmers of their livelihoods and the world of affordable food when millions are facing hunger in the poorest countries.
Intentionally directing an attack against civilians or civilian objects or intentionally launching an attack knowing it will cause disproportionate civilian harm is a war crime. International humanitarian law must be respected. The people of Ukraine need this cruel devastation to stop.

Title: Statement at the end of UN Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine’s visit to Kyiv
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
04 September 2023
Kyiv, Ukraine
Erik Møse, Chair of the Commission
On behalf of the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine we want to welcome you to this press conference.
The Commission has now visited Ukraine more than ten times. This is the first time the three Commissioners are in the country during its second mandate from March 2023, whereas our investigators have already been here several times.
First, we visited Uman in the Cherkasy region and then travelled to Kyiv. We have met several interlocutors, including the Minister of Culture and Information Policy, the Ministry of Defence, the Ombudsman for Human Rights, the Office of the Prosecutor General, and the Security Service of Ukraine.
During the Commission’s first mandate, we provided two written reports: to the General Assembly in October 2022 and to the Human Rights Council in March this year.
Furthermore, last week we published an extensive Conference Room Paper. It is based on the March report and contains a detailed account of the basis for the findings of the Commission.
The Conference Room Paper presents a select number of cases and describes patterns of a wide range of violations by the Russian armed forces. The violations include wilful killings, unlawful confinement, torture, rape and other sexual violence, unlawful transfers and deportations of protected persons and children. Many of these violations qualify as war crimes, and some of them may, if confirmed by further evidence, amount to crimes against humanity, such as the use of torture and attacks on the civilian infrastructure.
The paper also contains extensive discussions of criminal and non-judicial accountability measures, as well as the need for coordination.
We take this opportunity to stress the importance for the Russian authorities to ensure that all perpetrators are held accountable. We also remind the Ukrainian authorities to complete investigations of the few cases where the Commission has found violations by the Ukrainian armed forces.
Vrinda Grover, Member of the Commission
In Uman, the Commission visited a residential multi-storey block of apartments hit during an attack in April 2023, where 24 persons, mostly women and children, were killed. We met with the residents, who shared their grief, personal loss and their ongoing difficulties in securing alternative housing. We also met with municipal authorities who are now responsible for providing assistance to the victims in terms of compensation for loss of family members, housing and other benefits.
The Commission recognises that the Ukrainian legal system faces immense challenges to provide accountability and justice to the victims of a range of conflict related crimes and violations, in the sphere of investigation, prosecution and adjudication.
Our meetings with NGOs also provided valuable insights into efforts by the state to respond to the formidable challenges relating to investigating and prosecuting conflict-related crimes, including sexual violence, as well as ensuring comprehensive redress to victim survivors.
Pablo de Greiff, Member of the Commission
The Commission has always argued that it would work on the basis of a wide notion of accountability, including judicial and non-judicial measures. It has therefore followed closely discussions about the establishment of reparations programs.
During the visit we had discussions with different stakeholders about the various initiatives emerging on this topic. The establishment of a comprehensive reparations programs is a long-term process, which should be distinguished from, but also coordinated with, national reconstruction programs, and property restitution and repair programs. A comprehensive program should also be designed in close consultation with the victims.
In the past we have insisted on the urgency of providing mental health and psychosocial support to the victims, and the Commission is gratified to find that there is greater awareness of the importance of doing so, although the actual delivery continues to be a challenge.
The Commission has also insisted on the importance of improved coordination between different services the government is already providing but in a disaggregated way, which imposes on victims some hurdles to access. We take the opportunity to reiterate these points.
The Commission will submit written reports of its activities to the General Assembly in October 2023, and to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2024.

Title: STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON THE LATEST ATTACK HITTING UKRAINE’S DANUBE PORT
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
03 September 2023
I strongly condemn yet another Russian attack hitting port facilities in the Danube River, in Ukraine’s Odesa Region in the early hours of the morning. The strike not only caused damage to this crucial civilian infrastructure but also left port’s civilian workers injured.
Regrettably, this is not an isolated case. Repeated attacks on Ukraine’s ports since the Russian Federation’s decision to terminate the Black Sea Initiative create enormous challenges for Ukrainian farmers struggling to export their produce and the country’s ravaged economy. The pattern of attacks on the Danube’s ports and grain facilities is particularly concerning. They are now one of the main alternatives to ensure Ukrainian food reaches the global market, which is vital to prevent higher prices and increased hunger already affecting the poorest countries worldwide.
International humanitarian law is clear and prohibits attacks directed against civilians or civilian objects.

Title: WFP DISTRIBUTES COMPLEMENTARY CASH ASSISTANCE TO PENSIONERS IN UKRAINE THANKS TO EUROPEAN UNION AND OTHER DONORS
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
31 August 2023
KYIV – The UN World Food Programme (WFP), in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Policy and the Pension Fund of Ukraine, has started transferring complementary cash payments to pensioners in regions most affected by the war.
In accordance with the policy of the humanitarian country team in Ukraine, WFP prioritizes the use of cash assistance to support Ukrainians affected by the war. WFP has distributed more than US$500 million to more than 3 million Ukrainians since April 2022, in close coordination with the Government and other humanitarian actors.
Through this new initiative, WFP provides complementary cash assistance for pensioners living in territories of active or possible hostilities (as determined by the Government), who receive less than UAH 3,000 (US$81) in pension payments and have not received other forms of cash assistance since March 1, 2023 (such as living allowances for internally displaced persons, or cash assistance from international organizations).
Pensioners meeting the conditions for this assistance will receive a monthly payment from WFP for an amount equal to the difference between the pension they already receive and the amount of UAH 3,000, with the minimum payment amount set at UAH 100. The funds are paid directly by WFP to the bank account on which pensioners receive their usual pension payments, with no need to register or apply for the additional assistance.
The programme targets approximately 260,000 pensioners initially, who will receive the payments for at least four consecutive months. For the first payment this month, WFP expects to distribute approximately US$3 million.
“With prices rising due to the war, we know that millions of people living in regions most exposed to fighting find it difficult to afford basic necessities, and that many of them have been skipping meals or buying lower quality, less nutritious food”, said Matthew Hollingworth, WFP Country Director in Ukraine. “We work to support the most vulnerable through existing social assistance systems to ensure that our programmes complement the Government’s assistance,” Hollingworth added.
"During the war, Ukrainians living in the territories where hostilities are taking place often need additional financial support. The joint project of the Ministry of Social Policy, the Pension Fund and the WFP made it possible to provide such support - and to provide it to those citizens who do not have cash supplements from other sources," said First Deputy Minister of Social Policy, Daria Marchak.
The programme is initially funded by the European Union, with additional contributions from Norway, Sweden and private donors.
The European Union is one of WFP’s main partners for cash and food assistance in Ukraine. Last month the EU donated an additional €6.4 million to WFP to support cash assistance to vulnerable Ukrainians. Overall since March 2022, the European Union has contributed more than €25 million to WFP for both cash assistance and food distributions to Ukrainians living near frontline areas.
Cash assistance is one of many ways WFP supports Ukrainians affected by the war. WFP also distributes food parcels in areas closest to the frontline, where food is hard to find or very expensive, and is supporting the safe release of mined agricultural land in the Kharkiv region to help farmers and food producers resume work. WFP also chartered 24 vessels carrying Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea Initiative, which helps to sustain agricultural activity and boost Ukraine’s economy.

Title: Ukraine: Luxembourg and FAO join hands to protect the livelihoods of livestock-keeping families
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
31 August 2023
A new FAO emergency and resilience project funded by Luxembourg will provide cash and voucher assistance to 1 500 war-affected families engaged in livestock production
31 August 2023, Kyiv – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has launched a EUR 1 million project, funded by Luxembourg, to protect livelihoods and improve food security in accessible war-affected areas of Ukraine.
This is the first contribution from Luxembourg to FAO activities in Ukraine and the first to FAO’s emergency and resilience work in general in over a decade. The project is aligned with the Organization’s 2023 Response Programme in Ukraine, which aims to address immediate humanitarian needs and restore critical agrifood systems.
“According to FAO’s findings, rural households engaged in livestock production experience losses of animals and commercial relations along with war-associated damages to their property and infrastructure, making it difficult for them to remain productive and generate income,” explains Pierre Vauthier, Head of the FAO Office in Ukraine. “Rural households struggle to provide adequate shelter to their livestock and to secure quality animal feed.”
Considering that the situation will remain fluid, particularly in the eastern and southern regions, FAO has designed a set of interventions in collaboration with the Government of Ukraine, local authorities, and the State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection, aiming to safeguard livestock production and rural livelihoods. The new Luxembourg-funded project will support up to 1 500 livestock family farmers in Dnipropetrovska, Donetska, Kharkivska and Zaporizka oblasts in improving animal shelter conditions and maintaining or increasing livestock productivity over a period of 12 months. The interventions will focus on the most vulnerable families recovering from the impacts of the war that may require urgent support, including households headed by women, older persons, and people with disabilities.
“Safeguarding small-scale livestock production is critical for food security and nutrition in the country, particularly in areas recently affected by the war escalation,” added Vauthier. “Therefore, timely investments in the provision of essential support to prepare for the winter season is crucial to preserve current levels of production and support the livelihoods of host communities and internally displaced people in war-affected areas.”
To realize the project goals, FAO will use flexible implementation modalities such as cash and voucher assistance. Targeted households will receive vouchers worth UAH 12 000 (equivalent to USD 325) to purchase material and equipment from pre-selected suppliers for repairing their livestock shelters. In order to provide a comprehensive support package, the same households will also receive cash transfers of UAH 3 673 (USD 100) to cover livestock feed.
To implement its 2023 Response Programme in Ukraine, FAO requires USD 205 million in total. To date, FAO has received USD 38 million thanks to contributions from Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance of the United States Agency for International Development, the European Union, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Luxemburg, the Kingdom of Norway, and the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, leaving a gap of USD 167 million.

STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON A NEW WAVE OF ATTACKS ON NEARLY HALF OF UKRAINE’S REGIONS
A new wave of massive Russian attacks on at least 10 of Ukraine's 24 regions has left behind a path of destruction and death over the past 24 hours.
Grain storage facilities, vital for the Ukrainian farmers and global food security, have been hit in the Danube area. A school in the Sumy region was damaged, and teachers were killed and injured. In the Kherson region, civilians endured some horrifying hours of relentless strikes that damaged a hospital, and forced aid organizations to suspend vital assistance and take shelter in the middle of the day yesterday.
I have repeatedly expressed alarm about this brutal pattern of civilian harm due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This must stop, and international humanitarian law must be respected.

23 August 2023
The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) today warned of the far-reaching human rights consequences of the repeated attacks by the Russian Federation on Ukraine’s grain infrastructure. A strike last night on the southern Odesa region damaged a grain storage facility and a trans-shipment complex.
Since 11 July, the Russian Federation has carried out 14 such attacks, hitting grain terminals, warehouses, port infrastructure, industrial equipment and administrative buildings. The strikes also disrupted Ukraine’s global food supply lines. HRMMU has verified the deaths of four civilians and the injury of 43 others resulting from these attacks.
“These attacks cause not only immeasurable human suffering and loss for families, but also have a broader impact on livelihoods, farmers, communities and businesses in Ukraine and beyond,” said Danielle Bell, the Head of the HRMMU.
HRMMU, according to its mandate, will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these strikes.

Title: Ukraine: 15,000 school psychologists trained by UNESCO to support learners and teachers
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 August 2023
Today, UNESCO and the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine launch the training of 15.000 school psychologists to withstand the impact of the war on the mental health of Ukrainian learners and teachers.
A study found that 75% of Ukrainian schoolchildren have experienced stress and 26% of Ukrainian teenagers have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. There is an urgent need to strengthen psychosocial support to help them recover from the trauma and emotional distress induced by the war.
"UNESCO is determined to support Ukraine in promoting mental health and psychosocial support within the education sector. Our initiative will amplify the resilience of learners and educators and contribute to reduce the stigma around mental health."
- Stefania Giannini, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education
In recent months, UNESCO and its partners certified 117 psychologists from 24 regions of Ukraine. They will now train 15,000 school psychologists to equip them with the knowledge and competencies necessary to provide Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in the context of war. This ambitious program is supported financially by Japan.
The course comprises four modules that draw on lessons learnt from an in-depth assessment of current practices in mental health and psychological support and a survey of over 4,500 psychologists in educational institutions. Each module consists of three video lecture sessions, a practical assignment, a supervisory session, and a concluding test.
"This comprehensive training will equip school psychologists with knowledge, skills and tools to identify and address mental health issues among educational communities, with a view to creating safe and healthy learning environments that promote well-being and resilience amidst war. Together, we work to respond to today's challenges so that students can overcome obstacles, achieve academic success and become healthy and responsible citizens.
- Oksen Lisovyi, Minister of Education and Science, Ukraine
This initiative complements UNESCO's existing support for teachers, including the distribution of more than 50,000 Google Chromebooks and their training in digital pedagogies. It also aligns with UNESCO’s comprehensive programme to strengthen the resilience of the education system in Ukraine, supported by the Global Partnership for Education.

Title: REMARKS BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON THE 2023 WORLD  HUMANITARIAN DAY
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
19 August 2023
As delivered*
Today is the World Humanitarian Day.
It marks the twentieth anniversary of the horrendous attack on the UN Headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, when a truck laden with explosives drove in into our office and killed dozens of UN staff and injured hundreds, both Iraqi and international.
So every year, we come together on the anniversary of the date to remember those colleagues. We also remember the colleagues who’ve fallen every year since then, while bringing humanitarian assistance to people across the world. This year alone, we've seen over 60 colleagues die already, particularly in the Sudan and South Sudan conflicts.
But also in Ukraine. We've lost people in 2022 and this year as well. And in particular, I think of the young doctor in Kherson who died in an air strike launched by Russia on his first day on the job.
So if you would, a minute of silence to remember all of these fallen colleagues.
Thank you very much.
We focus often on the horrors of this war in Ukraine. And it is easy to do because every single day there is an attack which kills and maims Ukrainians. But alongside those attacks is the work of the humanitarian community. The local volunteers, the national organizations, the international organizations, and the UN, who come together.
The Kakhovka Dam destruction was brutal and a huge shock to all of us. But from the first day, we were all there supporting the people of Ukraine, pulling people out of the water, ensuring they had drinking water, food and a place to go. And most importantly, that human moral support.
In Pokrovsk last week, I stood in front of the two apartment blocks which had been hit by two consecutive strikes by Russia. I saw the homes that were destroyed, I saw the playground that was just in front of those buildings where children played. Again, the volunteers, the local authorities, and the national and international partners came together to clean the debris and to support people.
I think there's one day I will never forget when I leave Ukraine, and that was the liberation of Kherson. And three days after the liberation, we were allowed to go in and deliver supplies. People were standing in front of their homes, cheering as everyone went by. It was nine long months of suffering.
But today is thank you.
Thank you to the excellent photographers, mostly national, who've taken these photos, which are a window into the story of the world of aid workers in Ukraine.
Thank you to the Member States and the donors who provide unfailing moral support, strategic support and financial support, which allows us to get our work done.
Thank you to the local and regional authorities with whom we work every single day.
And to the Government. We stand side by side to do a very difficult job.
And most importantly, thank you to the aid workers. Every single one of us who have come together, who are connected to support the people of Ukraine. Together, all of us. Thank you. Diakuiu.

STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON AN ATTACK THAT HIT THE CENTRE OF CHERNIHIV
I am extremely disturbed by the news of yet another Russian strike that hit shortly ago the heart of Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine, leaving dozens of civilians killed and injured, including children. It is heinous to attack the main square of a large city, in the morning, while people are out walking, some going to the church to celebrate a religious day for many Ukrainians.
I condemn this repeated pattern of Russian strikes on populated areas of Ukraine, causing deaths, massive destruction and soaring humanitarian needs.
Attacks directed against civilians or civilian objects are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law. It must stop.

19 August 2023
I am appalled and heartbroken to learn that one of our humanitarian colleagues, who had been working as a protection staff for our Ukrainian NGO partner, Right to Protection, was killed in the Russian missile attack on Chernihiv city centre this morning.
He leaves behind three children and a wife. Our colleague died alongside dozens of other killed and severely injured civilians as he was driving with his child through the city centre on the Saturday morning. Another Right to Protection colleague was also affected by the attack.
The terrible news reached me just a few hours after I had joined the humanitarian community at an event in Kyiv to mark World Humanitarian Day. We gathered to honour and remember the aid workers in Ukraine and around the world who have dedicated a significant part of their lives to assisting people suffering from wars and conflicts, and who have been killed while serving others.
Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the families and the Right to Protection team, and with all the people who lost loved ones in this senseless attack.
Attacks against civilians must stop. They are #NotATarget.

Today, a wave of attacks shook cities in the west, north and centre of Ukraine, causing damage to homes, a kindergarten and other civilian infrastructure that are hundreds of kilometres away from the front line. These are the parts of the country where millions of people are seeking safety and refuge after fleeing the horrors of Russia’s invasion.
Russia’s persistent attacks hitting essential infrastructure in populated areas cause immense human suffering.
This brutal pattern of civilian harm must stop.

Russia’s indiscriminate attacks continue to impact civilians and civilian infrastructure across Ukraine.
People in the south of the country, including the Kherson and Odesa regions, have endured a particularly harsh weekend, as strikes left many civilians, including children, killed and injured. The attacks also affected humanitarians and our capacity to support those suffering the consequences of the war. On Friday, our colleagues from the NGO ADRA had to stop the much-needed distribution of vital items after their warehouse and cars were damaged due to shelling in the Kherson region.
Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be respected – they should never be a target.

STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON THE ATTACK THAT HIT A HOTEL IN ZAPORIZHZHIA
I am appalled by the news that a hotel frequently used by United Nations personnel and our colleagues from NGOs supporting people affected by the war has been hit by a Russian strike in Zaporizhzhia shortly ago.
It is utterly inadmissible.
I have stayed in this hotel every single time I visited Zaporizhzhia. My team uses it as their base for their frequent travels to the city. It was the UN base for the operation to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, in May last year.
The number of indiscriminate attacks hitting civilian infrastructure, killing and injuring civilians, have reached unimaginable levels – these attacks violate international humanitarian law.
In the name of humanity, I call on the Russian Federation to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and immediately stop indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine.

Title: HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS ATTACKS THAT KILLED AND INJURED SCORES OF CIVILIANS IN THE DONETSK REGION
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 August 2023
I am profoundly disturbed by the latest Russian strikes that hit residential buildings and other civilian places in Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region, yesterday evening, killing and injuring scores of civilians. It is absolutely ruthless to hit the same location twice in the space of minutes, causing the death and injury of people who had quickly come to help the survivors – including rescue workers from the State of Emergency Service of Ukraine. They are front-line responders, helping people in their most difficult times and must be respected.
This horrifying attack is certainly a serious breach of international humanitarian law and violates any principle of humanity. It adds to the very long list of attacks in Ukraine, including many over the past few days, that must be investigated as they violate international humanitarian law.
In the meantime, humanitarian organizations are already on the ground, providing immediate assistance. And I send, on behalf of the humanitarian community in Ukraine, my most heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of those killed and wish a rapid recovery for the injured.

Title: UNESCO presents preliminary results of its mission to Odesa
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 August 2023
Following repeated attacks on Odesa at the end of July, UNESCO undertook a preliminary assessment of the damage to cultural heritage, estimated at over 50 impacted sites. Releasing new emergency funds, the Organization will conduct new urgent protection measures and studies of impact, required to inform stabilization and consolidation.
Last month, an escalation of violence against culture has been witnessed, including repeated Russian attacks on the city of Odesa, home to the World Heritage property ‘The Historic Centre of Odesa’.
Strongly condemning these attacks, Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, also announced the deployment of an experts’ mission in the following days.
From 29 July to 1 August 2023, the mission led by Chiara Dezzi Bardeschi, UNESCO's Representative to Ukraine, brought together several experts, including from ICOMOS and ICCROM, to assess the extent of damage to Ukrainian cultural heritage. The mission also aimed to identify imminent threats to the integrity of these sites and to propose urgent measures needed to stabilize them and protect them from future deterioration.
The mission has visited the Historic Centre of Odesa to gather first-hand information and on-site evaluation of the damaged buildings, in addition to meetings with national and local authorities, but also technical institutions and NGOs operating in Odesa.
"I was amazed to see the determination and resilience of the people of Odesa, both cultural professionals and civilians, in the face of the destruction of their culture. UNESCO stands by their side."
- Chiara Dezzi Bardeschi, UNESCO’s Representative to Ukraine
Among the 52 cultural properties reported as damaged by the Ukrainian authorities, UNESCO was able to assess on the ground the level of destruction of the 10 most impacted sites. The majority are categorized as severely damaged, including the Transfiguration Cathedral, the House of Scientists, the Manuk-Bey's mansion - currently hosting a kindergarten - , the Literature Museum, the Pommer's mansion and the Residential buildings (Solomos) in 4 Preobrazhenska Street.
These attacks have also damaged the historic urban fabric, which represents an important attribute of the World Heritage site and is one of the reasons why it was inscribed.
Due to the repeated attacks, some other historic buildings become more vulnerable, and therefore are at risk of significant damage caused by blasts and vibration, if new attacks occur.
A detailed report will be finalized and presented in the following months.




Through its Heritage Emergency Fund, UNESCO has just released urgent funds (US$ 169,000) to support several timely required actions, including the installation of new protections on key cultural buildings, the conduction of geological and architectural studies and post-disaster first-aid respondents’ skills enhancement.
The detailed documentation of current state is crucial to inform stabilization and conservation plans. During the mission, UNESCO experts have already started producing the 3D laser scanning of some severely damaged properties, among which the House of scientists and the Cathedral.
As Odesa is not the only place under attack, UNESCO has also recommended the inscription on the World Heritage in Danger List of two other Ukrainian properties: “Kyiv: Saint-Sophia Cathedral and Related Monastic Buildings, Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra” and “L'viv – the Ensemble of the Historic Centre”. The final decision will be made by the World Heritage Committee at its forthcoming meeting in September.

I visited the Port of Izmail today and was shocked to see the level of destruction left by the Russian strikes on grain storage facilities on 2 August. The thousands of tons of grains that were damaged would have been enough to feed approximately 66 million people for a day.
The termination of the Black Sea Initiative by the Russian Federation and the recent and repeated attacks on Ukrainian ports are causing insurmountable damage to the agricultural sector in Ukraine and may further accentuate hunger for the world’s poorest people.
Relentless attacks by Russian forces on grain stores and port infrastructure in Ukraine form an extremely alarming pattern of harm and may constitute a grave violation of international humanitarian law.

Title: ATTACKS ON HEALTH CARE IN UKRAINE ARE A GRAVE VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
01 August 2023
STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON THE STRIKE THAT HIT A HOSPITAL IN KHERSON
The unacceptable attack that today damaged a hospital in Kherson is just another example of the horrific consequences of Russia’s invasion for civilians in Ukraine. Not even those providing vital services to people whose lives have been torn apart by the war are being spared.
Today, a young doctor, just starting his career – his first day at work – was killed inside a hospital, a critical civilian facility. My thoughts are with his family and colleagues. Other health workers were also injured, according to the UN Human Rights Office. I wish them a speedy recovery.
Since the escalation of the war in February 2022, the World Health Organization verified over 1,000 attacks on health care in Ukraine. This is more than 60 per cent of all attacks against health care in the world. This has an immediate impact on people’s ability to access essential health services at a time when they need them most. In some parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, including Kherson, services have been decimated as not even half of hospitals or clinics remain functional.
Health facilities and health workers have special protection under international humanitarian law and attacking them is a grave violation.

Title: CROATIA SUPPORTS UN PROJECT TO DEMINE AND RELEASE PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL LAND IN UKRAINE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
31 July 2023
KYIV – The Government of Croatia donated €1 million to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) today to help farmers and food producers resume work in regions most affected by explosive remnants of war.
The agreement was signed by Gordan Grlić Radman, Foreign Minister of Croatia, and Matthew Hollingworth, WFP Country Director in Ukraine, in the presence of First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy of Ukraine, Yuliia Svyrydenko.
The €1 million contribution is Croatia’s largest ever donation to the UN World Food Programme. The funds will support a collaborative project led jointly by the UN World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in conjunction with WFP’s partner for mine action, the Fondation suisse de déminage (FSD).
The project aims to survey productive agricultural land for the presence of mines and other explosives, demine it where necessary, and release it safely to restore food production and support the livelihoods of rural communities. The project will also extend support to farmers in rehabilitating soils and re-establishing their agricultural production once the lands are deemed safe.
The work is already underway in Kharkivska oblast with plans to expand to Mykolaivska and Khersonska oblasts. The project is designed and implemented in close coordination with the Government of Ukraine as well as local authorities to ensure complementarity in action and directly support the Government’s demining efforts.
“The Ukrainian government has identified demining as one of the five key priorities for the country's rapid recovery, as it concerns the safety of people, restoration of fully operational agricultural enterprises, and the establishment of food supply chains,” said First Deputy Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko. “We are actively collaborating with our international partners to launch a humanitarian demining market in Ukraine, procure specialized equipment, train deminers, certify private demining operators, and establish local production. We highly value the support of partners who provide donor and international technical assistance for demining projects in Ukraine, particularly Croatia, which possesses significant demining expertise. The funds raised under the joint Memorandum with Croatia and the UN partners will be used for surveying and clearing contaminated lands, which potentially amount to 174,000 square kilometres in Ukraine,” the First Deputy Prime Minister added.
“This meeting marks a significant milestone as we have just signed a crucial agreement with the World Food Programme to implement a demining project in Ukraine, aimed at revitalizing food systems and local livelihoods in conflict-affected areas” said Gordan Grlić Radman, Foreign Minister of Croatia. “During our meeting, we emphasized the critical importance of mine action in restarting economic and social activities in Ukraine. Understanding the pressing need to address the challenges posed by mines and explosive remnants of war, we reiterate our dedication to working hand in hand to bring about positive change in the affected regions”, the Minister added.
“We are deeply grateful to count the Government of Croatia as one of our key partners on this project,” said Matthew Hollingworth, WFP Country Director in Ukraine. “Croatia’s experience in conducting successful, large scale demining operations makes it a proven leader in humanitarian demining and an invaluable partner to help release land for Ukraine’s farmers, who desperately want to resume work and feed their families and communities”, Hollingworth added.
The war has damaged Ukraine’s agriculture and food production, disrupted supply chains and exports, increased production costs, and caused widespread mine contamination. According to the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment, published in February 2023, Ukraine’s production of grain and oilseeds decreased by 37 percent in 2022.
Croatia will host the International Donor Conference on Humanitarian Demining in Ukraine on the 11th and 12th of October in Zagreb. The conference will be a platform to mobilize additional international support and resources for demining initiatives in Ukraine.
WFP is in Ukraine to provide food and cash assistance to Ukrainians affected by the war, and works closely with farmers, bakeries and other actors to restore or sustain food production and food systems.

The humanitarian community, along with local authorities, is on the ground in Kryvyi Rih, helping survivors of the strike that damaged residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure in the city, and left many killed and injured. Yesterday our teams also provided immediate aid to civilians whose houses were hit in Dnipro. Russia's invasion keeps causing devastation, and the situation worsens with each passing day.

The UN in Ukraine supported the Sumy Regional Administration to convene a forum of local authorities, civil society organizations, international development partners, academia and private sector actors, joined by representatives of the national government.

The discussions were aimed at establishing a regional recovery coordination mechanism to drive implementation of the Sumy Regional Economic Recovery and Development Strategy and strengthen the connections between the humanitarian response, recovery interventions, development planning, and private sector investments ongoing in the region.
“Today, we are demonstrating to international partners the potential and capabilities of the region, our desire and determination to recover and develop, and we are offering concrete steps and projects along the way. At the forum, we are laying a solid platform for further cooperation with our foreign friends and the future basis for Sumy region development. We have all the resources for this: our desire and perseverance, and the great interest of donors. I am sincerely grateful to all our foreign friends who, despite the war, found the opportunity to come and join the forum, and to our strategic partners from the UN who helped organize this event and bring together in a constructive dialogue all those who are committed to development and recovery of Sumy region”, said Volodymyr Artiukh, the Head of Sumy Regional State Administration.
The UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine, Denise Brown, noted the importance of regional and local leadership: “What immediately captured my attention on my first visit last winter to Sumy were your efforts to design and launch a regional recovery and economic development strategy already at that time to shift from humanitarian to recovery. And not only did you design a strategy in the very difficult context you were still dealing with at the end of last year, but you did so in an inclusive and participatory way where you involved the cities, the hromadas, civil society, academia and the private sector. This really exemplifies the collaboration necessary for an inclusive and successful recovery.”

As a result of the discussions, the Regional State Administration will establish an inclusive Regional Recovery Coordination Forum to implement Sumy’s strategy, with the support of the United Nations. All stakeholders agreed that the Forum's primary objectives should include promoting inclusive and sustainable development, local ownership and participation, and serving as a pilot for other regions. The Regional State Administration, the United Nations and all stakeholders made a commitment to support inclusive coordination and align longer-term support with initiatives at the national level, including development of the State Strategy for Regional Development and future EU integration planning.
Sumy region also intends to share its experiences with recovery strategy development and coordination for recovery with other regions in Ukraine. The UN in Ukraine is a dedicated partner for this goal for the long term.
Background information:

Like other frontline regions of Ukraine, Sumy has been severely affected by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In addition to the worst losses of human life and health, many people have lost their homes, jobs and livelihoods; critical infrastructure, education and healthcare facilities have been damaged. Despite the war, local communities have demonstrated remarkable resilience and, with the support of development partners, have developed and implemented recovery actions. The Sumy Region Economic Recovery and Development Strategy is an example of this effort. The UN in Ukraine has been supporting local authorities and communities in Sumy region in this process, by aligning its efforts with stakeholders to ensure the recovery interventions are tailored to community needs.
To date in the Sumy region, the UN has assisted more than 350,000 people since the invasion started. This includes the two humanitarian convoys sent into Sumy city when it was encircled and besieged by Russian forces in March 2022, as well as humanitarian assistance across the region after its liberation. This support has encompassed housing repairs, emergency shelter kits, heating supplies, infrastructure improvements, and essential psychosocial and child protection services. The UN also helped establish social adaptation spaces in Sumy city, Bilopillia, Chernechchyna, and Konotop, providing assistance to persons with disabilities, older people, and others in need.
At the community level, the UN has supported Sumy city and Bilopillya, aiding in monitoring local development strategies and implementing relevant recovery plans. Furthermore, the European Union-funded "Mayors for Economic Growth" project has seen seven municipalities from the region (Sumy, Bilopillia, Trostianets, Konotop, Krasnopilla, Hlukhiv and Oktyrka) join the network, with two partner municipalities actively participating in the "Urban Imaginaries" project, promoting new methods of social listening, and piloting their urban transformation initiatives with financial support from the project.
When it comes to the private sector, the UN has actively engaged with the Sumy Chamber of Commerce and Industry, bolstering organizational capacity, improving business development services, and encouraging effective public-private dialogue. The UN in Ukraine also works to strengthen entrepreneurship and business skills among local entrepreneurs in Sumy region by supporting training sessions, with the most recent held in Romny for 25 local participants.

Title: One year later, Türk decries lack of accountability for Olenivka killings
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
25 July 2023
GENEVA (25 July 2023) – A year after the tragic killing of at least 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war at the penal colony at Olenivka in the Donetsk region of Ukraine that is under the temporary military control of the Russian Federation, justice is still no closer to being served, UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said on Tuesday.
“The prisoners of war who were injured or died at Olenivka, and their family members, deserve the truth to be known, and for those responsible for breaches of international law to be held accountable,” he said.
“Our Office has met with the families of the victims and heard their pleas for truth and justice – and indeed, they have a right to truth, justice and reparations. For all those impacted by this tragedy, we must do all we can to ensure justice is done.”
The Russian Federation provided neither satisfactory assurances about secure access for the United Nations to visit the particular site, nor granted general requests by the UN Human Rights Office to access areas of Ukraine under the temporary military control of the Russian Federation. The Office, however, has been able to conduct extensive interviews with survivors of the incident at Olenivka and undertaken detailed analysis of available additional information, in line with OHCHR’s established methodology.
While the precise circumstances of the incident on the night of 28-29 July 2022 remain unclear, the information available and our analysis enable the Office to conclude that it was not caused by a HIMARS rocket. Based on the information available, it is not possible at this stage to establish either the specific source of the explosion, nor the exact direction from which a weapon may have been fired. The Office will continue to follow up on the incident consistent with its expertise and mandate.
“Prisoners of war are protected under international humanitarian law. Deaths or serious injury of POWs must be followed up by an official and thorough enquiry on the part of the Detaining Power,” Türk added. “Any suspicion of criminal conduct must be promptly, thoroughly, independently, impartially and transparently investigated and those responsible prosecuted.”

Title: STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON THE ATTACK THAT HIT A HUMANITARIAN FACILITY IN CHASIV YAR
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 July 2023
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack that today damaged a cultural centre that had been serving as a humanitarian facility in Chasiv Yar, in the Donetsk region. The strike rendered inoperable a place where humanitarians, health workers and volunteers provide civilians in this front-line community with the aid and services they desperately need. It is outrageous that Russian forces appear to be repeatedly targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.
No one was injured as it happened in the middle of the night. However, vital relief items and medical supplies were destroyed, and humanitarian and health services will be impacted.
This is, unfortunately, the fourth attack impacting humanitarian assistance in Ukraine in July alone, following tragic incidents that damaged aid facilities and assets in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.
Civilian infrastructure, including humanitarian facilities, is protected under international humanitarian law. Facilities providing health services, including those that have been set up for medical purposes, have special protection. It must be respected.

23 July 2023
The Secretary-General strongly condemns the Russian missile attack today on Odesa that resulted in civilian causalities and damaged the UNESCO-protected Transfiguration Cathedral and other historical buildings in the Historic Centre of Odesa, a World Heritage site.
In addition to the appalling toll the war is taking on civilian lives, this is yet another attack in an area protected under the World Heritage Convention in violation of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The Secretary-General is concerned about the threat that this war increasingly poses to Ukrainian culture and heritage.  Since 24 February 2022, UNESCO has verified damage to 270 cultural sites in Ukraine, including 116 religious sites.
The Secretary-General urges the Russian Federation to immediately cease attacks against cultural property protected by widely ratified international normative instruments. The Secretary-General also continues to urge immediate cessation of all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure.

Title: Odesa: UNESCO strongly condemns repeated attacks against cultural heritage, including World Heritage
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 July 2023
Paris, 23 July 2023 – UNESCO is deeply dismayed and condemns in the strongest terms the brazen attack carried out by the Russian forces, which hit several cultural sites in the city center of Odesa, home to the World Heritage property ‘The Historic Centre of Odesa’.
The attack took the lives of at least two people, according to preliminary reports, and damaged a number of significant cultural sites, including the Transfiguration Cathedral, the first and foremost Orthodox church in Odesa founded in 1794. This act of hostility comes only days after other attacks that impacted many cultural heritage sites in areas protected under the World Heritage Convention in Lviv and Odesa.
“This outrageous destruction marks an escalation of violence against cultural heritage of Ukraine. I strongly condemn this attack against culture, and I urge the Russian Federation to take meaningful action to comply with its obligations under international law, including the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the 1972 World Heritage Convention,” said Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO’s Director-General.
The Director-General of UNESCO visited Odesa on April 4, 2023 to meet with World Heritage site managers and stakeholders from the cultural sector. She took stock of the emergency actions undertaken by UNESCO to protect this exceptional heritage threatened by war.
UNESCO will continue to engage with the World Heritage site managers, local and national authorities to identify urgent needs for assistance.
In the coming days, UNESCO will field a mission to Odesa to conduct a preliminary assessment of damages.
These attacks contradict recent statements by the authorities of Russia concerning the precautions taken to spare World Heritage sites in Ukraine including their buffer zones.
Intentional destruction of cultural sites may amount to a war crime, as acknowledged also by the United Nations Security Council - of which the Russian Federation is a permanent member - in Resolution 2347 (2017).

Title: HUMANITARIANS REACHED 7.3 MILLION PEOPLE IN UKRAINE WITH VITAL AID  IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2023
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 July 2023
NOTE TO CORRESPONDENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SAVIANO ABREU, SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UN OFFICE FOR THE COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS IN UKRAINE

Over the past few days, Ukraine has again made the headlines worldwide – for all the wrong reasons – following the Russian Federation’s decision to terminate the crucial Black Sea Initiative and the wave of attacks on the civilian Port of Odesa.
Fighting and hostilities here, however, have been as intense as ever over the past months, and although its humanitarian impact is not always captured at the same level, the truth is that the war continues to devastate the lives of civilians, particularly those living close to the front line.
In eastern and southern Ukraine, people struggle to access essential items and services, including vital water and food, life-saving health services, or even materials to repair their damaged homes. Children’s vaccinations have been impacted, and their right to go to school cannot be taken for granted.
Since the escalation of the war in February 2022, the UN and our humanitarian partners have worked intensively to ensure people suffering from the consequences of this ferocious war can get some support, some relief. Last year, 16 million people in Ukraine received assistance from the UN and our partners.
This work continues in 2023 and in the first six months of the year, humanitarians provided vital aid and protection services to nearly 7.3 million people. This is almost 2 million more than what we reported in May. Regrettably, only 4 per cent of the people reached live in areas under the military control of the Russian Federation, as impediments imposed on aid workers hamper life-saving activities in these areas.
Across the country, critical health care – as we all know these services have been decimated in the east and south – was provided to 5 million people and around 3 million people had access to clean water and hygiene products amidst increased shortages, particularly in areas affected by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam.
Humanitarian partners have also provided food to over 3.7 million people and reached 3.3 million people with emergency shelter or critical household items. Around 1 million children who fled their homes and whose schools are not fully functional have received support to continue their education. Our colleagues providing protection services, including counselling, legal services, mine-awareness campaigns and services to prevent gender-based violence and support survivors reached more than 1 million people.
And last but not least, 2.5 million people – including over 20,000 people affected by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam – have received multipurpose cash assistance, crucial support for people whose income and livelihoods have been impacted by the war.
This work, however, is not carried out without challenges. Intensified hostilities and fighting along the entire front line, as well as impediments and obstacles imposed on aid organizations have further impacted humanitarian access in Ukraine in the first six months of 2023, making it increasingly challenging and unpredictable.
At least five humanitarian workers were killed in the line of duty in Ukraine in the first six months of 2023, compared to four fatalities recorded in all of 2022, and nearly 100 incidents impacting humanitarian operations were reported, more than half of them with a moderate or severe impact on the delivery of assistance. This is an average of one incident every other day, highlighting the complex environment humanitarian organizations in Ukraine face. And, as mentioned before, access to Ukrainians in areas currently under the military control of the Russian Federation continues to be a challenge. The humanitarian community remains firmly committed to continuing all efforts to deliver support where it is needed the most.
To this end, support from the international community is crucial. Just below 30 per cent of the US$3.9 billion requested in the 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan has been received by humanitarian organizations in Ukraine. Aid workers in Ukraine urgently need more funding now to ensure life-saving operations will not stop.

Title: UNOPS and Denmark provide water tank trucks to communities affected by destruction of Kakhovka Dam
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
21 July 2023
Crucial disaster relief is delivered to Ukraine, as communities continue to grapple with the consequences of the Kakhovka Dam explosion
As part of an emergency reallocation of Danish funds administered by UNOPS, five water tank trucks have been procured and delivered to five communities in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The communities of Marhanets, Chervonohryhorivka, Pokrovske, Hrushivka and Nyva Trudova are located upstream of the Kakhovka Dam. They have been deprived of a regular water supply since the destruction of the dam, which caused the Kakhovka Reservoir to dry up.
“Our region has been dealing with the consequences of the terror attack on the Kakhovka dam for over a month. Two districts – Nikopol and Kryvyi Rih – are experiencing water supply issues. We are sparing no effort in addressing them, and we are building alternative water supply lines. In the meantime, drinking water needs to be delivered to the people,” stated Volodymyr Orlov, First Deputy Head of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Administration.
Until the alternative water supply lines can be built, the water trucks will be used by local authorities to increase the capacity to deliver water to people living in the affected communities.
“We are currently using four fire engines and an old water truck to deliver drinking water to people in our community,” explained Olena Krainik, Acting Village Head of Chervonohryhorivka. “The new truck has twice the capacity of the old one. It will go a long way in helping us.”
The new trucks have already made their way to the communities.
“UNOPS works to help Ukraine achieve its development ambitions and fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals. In the context of the ongoing war, that also means providing emergency assistance to meet basic needs,” said Tim Lardner, UNOPS Ukraine Country Director. “We have been able to coordinate effectively with local authorities and our partners from Denmark to make this delivery happen. We will continue to monitor developments and respond appropriately, so that the people of Ukraine can enjoy a decent quality of life.”
The UN Secretary-General described the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam as another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
According to UN data, tens of thousands of people have been directly affected by flooding and up to 700,000 risk losing access to drinking water.
The Ukrainian government announced plans to build new water supply mains from alternative sources, but these will take months to complete, leaving communities in precarious conditions.

Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
21 July 2023
The International Trade Centre (ITC) and EU4Digital Facility are partnering to provide e-commerce training to an additional 11 Ukrainian companies.
Since the beginning of the conflict, 6.9 million in-country Ukrainians have been displaced, indicating the need to find new income and jobs. The Ministry of Economy of Ukraine has estimated that the economy downsized to 30% of pre-conflict levels - making digital work and online marketplaces provide the necessary relief for the Ukrainian population, building the national economy’s resilience.
The training is part of ITC’s Japan-funded project, which assists internally displaced populations and businesses in digital skills and e-commerce.
The trainings will be delivered through eCommerce consultations centre of EU4Digital that has already supported Ukrainian firms in reaching EU market places this year.
Ukrainian firms based in Ukraine can apply for the trainings here.
The selected companies will receive coaching on best practices and five hours of private consultations to create opportunities of entering EU-based marketplaces, set between August and December 2023.
About the International Trade Centre - The International Trade Centre is the joint agency of the World Trade Organization and the United Nations. ITC assists small and medium-sized enterprises in developing and transition economies to become more competitive in global markets, thereby contributing to sustainable economic development within the frameworks of the Aid-for-Trade agenda and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

Title: Odesa: UNESCO strongly condemns attack on World Heritage property
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
21 July 2023
Paris, 21 July 2023 – Further to the statement made by the UN Secretary-General, UNESCO condemns the Russian attack in the buffer zone of the World Heritage property “The Historic Centre of Odesa”, affecting buildings of cultural significance within the property.
Taking place just two weeks after the strike that destroyed a historic building in Lviv, this attack is the second to date in an area protected under the World Heritage Convention in violation of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. This strike also coincided with the destruction of the Culture Centre of Folk Art and Art Education in the city of Mykolaiv, a hundred kilometres away.
UNESCO expresses its support to the people of Odesa and conveys its sincere condolences to the families of victims.
A preliminary assessment in Odesa has revealed damage to several museums inside the World Heritage property, including the Odesa Archaeological Museum, the Odesa Maritime Museum and the Odesa Literature Museum. They had all been marked by UNESCO and local authorities with the Blue Shield, the distinctive emblem of the 1954 Hague Convention.
The museums, which have already received support from UNESCO since the start of the Russian invasion, have notably benefited from the implementation of urgent repair, protection and digitization measures, which are at the heart of UNESCO’s emergency assistance programmes for Ukraine, implemented in close cooperation with the Organization’s international partners.
On Thursday, 20 July, UNESCO exchanged with World Heritage site managers to reaffirm the Organization’s support for the protection of the Historic Centre of Odesa and to identify urgent needs for assistance.
Once again, UNESCO calls for a cessation of attacks against cultural property protected by widely ratified international normative instruments.
This war represents an ever-increasing threat to Ukrainian culture. To date, UNESCO has verified damage to 270 cultural sites in Ukraine since 24 February 2022.

The Secretary-General strongly condemns the Russian attacks against port facilities in Odesa, and other Ukrainian Black Sea ports.
The attacks contradict the Russian Federation’s commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations, which states that “the Russian Federation will facilitate the unimpeded export of food, sunflower oil and fertilizers from Ukrainian controlled Black Sea ports.”
The Secretary-General also recalls that the destruction of civilian infrastructure may constitute a violation of international humanitarian law.
These attacks are also having an impact well beyond Ukraine. We are already seeing the negative effect on global wheat and corn prices which hurts everyone, but especially vulnerable people in the global south.
For his part, the Secretary-General will not relent in his efforts to ensure that Ukrainian and Russian food and fertilizer are available on international markets as part of his ongoing efforts to fight global hunger and ensure stable food prices for consumers everywhere.

I am horrified by the images of last night’s attacks by Russian forces on the port of Odesa. It is the second day in a row that this civilian port, a crucial lifeline for Ukraine and for the poorest people in the world who depend on Ukrainian grain, has been severely damaged in massive strikes.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- PRESS REMARKS ON THE BLACK SEA INITIATIVE AND MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON FACILITATING EXPORTS OF RUSSIAN FOOD PRODUCTS AND FERTILIZERS
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
17 July 2023
New York, 17 July 2023
Good morning
I deeply regret the decision by the Russian Federation to terminate the implementation of the Black Sea Initiative – including the withdrawal of Russian security guarantees for navigation in the northwestern part of the Black Sea.
This Initiative has ensured the safe passage of over 32 million metric tons of food commodities from Ukrainian ports.
The World Food Programme has shipped more than 725,000 tons to support humanitarian operations – relieving hunger in some of the hardest hit corners of the world, including Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa and Yemen.
The Black Sea Initiative -- together with the Memorandum of Understanding on facilitating exports of Russian food products and fertilizers -- have been a lifeline for global food security and a beacon of hope in a troubled world.
At a time when the production and availability of food is being disrupted by conflict, climate change, energy prices and more, these agreements have helped to reduce food prices by over 23 per cent since March last year.
With the decision to terminate the Black Sea Initiative, the Russian Federation also terminated its commitment to “facilitate the unimpeded export of food, sunflower oil, and fertilizers from Ukrainian controlled Black Sea Ports” -- as expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Russian Federation and the United Nations.
Ultimately, participation in these agreements is a choice.
But struggling people everywhere and developing countries don’t have a choice.
Hundreds of millions of people face hunger and consumers are confronting a global cost-of-living crisis.
They will pay the price.
Indeed, we are already seeing a jump in wheat prices this morning.
I am aware of some obstacles that remained in the foreign trade of Russian food and fertilizer products.
This is precisely why I sent a letter to President Putin with a new proposal to keep the Black Sea Initiative alive.
In that letter – which I believe is necessary to quote at length – I underlined that:
“Since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding, and also taking into account the measures adopted by the Russian Federation, Russian grain trade has reached high export volumes and fertilizer markets are stabilizing with Russian exports nearing full recovery, as stated by the Russian Union of Grain Exporters and Russian Fertilizer Producers Association.”
The letter went on to detail action by the United Nations.
Namely that we have: “also delivered breakthroughs even in some of the most challenging areas of trade facilitation.  The United Nations has helped to secure the issuance of: U.S. General License 6B and 6C, which are especially important in light of the extraterritorial nature of US sanctions as these licenses apply not only to US imports from the Russian Federation but also to all countries concerned with their sanctions regime; two UK General Licenses on finance and trade in food and fertilizers, which are especially important for the insurance market; and the derogation by the European Union in its ninth sanctions package, which allowed, for example, the unfreezing of assets of fertilizer companies, as well as a range of clarifications, Frequently Asked Questions, fact sheets and other guidance to the private sector.
These regulatory frameworks, as well as extensive engagement with the private sector to find dedicated solutions across banking and insurance sectors have led to the progressive normalization of trading conditions since July 2022, including declining freight and insurance rates.  Bulk vessel port calls at Russian ports have also remained mostly steady.”
The letter went on to detail how: “We have built a bespoke payments mechanism for the Russian Agricultural Bank through JP Morgan outside of SWIFT.”
The letter also described how: “The United Nations also has worked closely with the key Russian fertilizer groups to unblock assets … amounting to over 70 per cent of the frozen assets in the original list submitted to us by the Russian Federation in November 2022.  Moreover, the United Nations has facilitated… the humanitarian donations of fertilizer to most in-need countries in Africa – overcoming profound complexities of the operation..”
My letter also mentioned that: “the Russian Federation has highlighted the issue of access to SWIFT by the Russian Agricultural Bank as a key factor influencing its decisions.  On this front, the United Nations recently brokered a concrete proposal to enable a subsidiary of the Russian Agricultural Bank to regain access to SWIFT with the European Commission.  The key element underpinning this proposal’s political viability is that it can be implemented within existing regulations.  We see this as a unique political opening, stemming from a genuine desire to protect global food security beyond 17 July.”
I am deeply disappointed that my proposals went unheeded.
Today’s decision by the Russian Federation will strike a blow to people in need everywhere.
But it will not stop our efforts to facilitate the unimpeded access to global markets for food products and fertilizers from both Ukraine and the Russian Federation.
I particularly want to recognize the efforts of the government of Türkiye in this regard.
Looking ahead, our goal must continue to be advancing global food security and global food price stability.
This will remain the focus of my efforts, taking into account the rise in human suffering that will inevitably result from today’s decision.
We will stay fixed on finding pathways for solutions.
There is simply too much at stake in a hungry and hurting world.
Thank you.

Title: WHO installs new module clinic for primary health care in Kharkiv region
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 July 2023
In an effort to address the destruction caused by the full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation and ensure access to essential healthcare services, WHO has partnered with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine to identify a sustainable rapid solution to bridge the gap in the medical services in affected territories and ensure an adequate emergency health response. This project aims to support communities and ensure the provision of healthcare services in remote areas affected by war, where primary health facilities have been damaged.
Today, as part of this larger initiative, a new modular primary health care clinic has been installed in Izyum, Kharkiv region, replacing the previously destroyed primary health facility.
This newly installed structure will serve as an outpatient health facility, providing primary healthcare services to a population of over 10,000 people. The clinic will be staffed by medical professionals who were previously working at the damaged facility, ensuring continuity of care. It will have three rooms for receiving patients and a vaccination room, where approximately 12 healthcare workers, including 3 doctors and 9 nurses, will be able to work simultaneously.
The temporary clinic comprises six prefabricated modules combined to form a fully functional health facility. It is equipped with essential amenities, including electricity, sanitary engineering, sewage, waiting and patient examination rooms. Additionally, the clinic is supplied with a generator and air fans to ensure a conducive environment for healthcare delivery.
"This initiative brings both hope and practical solutions to communities residing in the most affected areas where primary health facilities were damaged. We prioritize the availability of essential health services, and in collaboration with our partners, we are working hard to make it possible. We will be bringing more modules and support the maintenance of outpatient clinics in Ukraine," said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine.
Minister of Health of Ukraine Viktor Lyashko said, "Our priority is to ensure the provision of high-quality, affordable, and free medical care for our citizens. The areas closest to the epicenter of hostilities, which are subject to destruction by the aggressor, require special attention. The establishment of a new modular primary medical care clinic in Izyum, Kharkiv region, is a significant step towards meeting the medical service needs of local residents. We greatly appreciate the cooperation with WHO and other partners. Together, we are developing and implementing necessary solutions to improve the well-being of our communities."
Access to primary healthcare and essential services is at the core of the emergency response objectives, along with ensuring access and availability of services. Currently, more than 1000 attacks on healthcare have been verified by WHO, and attacks continue to occur.
Primary healthcare centers are amongst those facilities that have been partially or fully damaged. Out from 40 primary health facilities assessed by WHO facilities on the request of MoH, 15 were damaged in 7 regions identified by MOH for the project, including Kherson, Zaporizzhya, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Kyiv, and Odesa regions.
Denise Brown, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine said: “The war has had devastating consequences on the health sector, obstructing access to health services in front-line communities, including Izium. The modular health clinic being opened today is a first step in restoring some of the essential services that are indispensable for recovering and rebuilding lives. The Ukraine Humanitarian Fund has made an important contribution to jumpstart this effort. Since the start of the war, the UHF has allocated over USD 35 million to rebuild health facilities and to restore basic services. Investments such as these into health systems feed into the UN’s larger effort to enable community-driven recovery.”
To ensure continuity of services and infrastructural availability, and to restore functionality to maintain access to essential health services, WHO will install prefabricated modular structures where primary health services have been damaged or are no longer suitable from an infrastructural point of view. These prefabricated modules offer a temporary solution to ensure the full operational capacity of the pre-existing or currently damaged facilities. The modules can function as healthcare facilities for over 10 years.
As part of the first stage of the project, Kharkiv region marks the second installation, and seven more modules will be distributed soon, as indicated by the Ministry of Health's priority list for the most affected regions.
The OCHA’s Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) is providing the necessary financial support for this project.

Title: HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE MUST BE PROTECTED:  STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON THE LATEST ATTACKS AFFECTING AID WORKERS IN UKRAINE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
13 July 2023
It is extremely disturbing to hear that our colleagues from the Ukrainian NGO Mission Proliska came under fire yesterday in the Kharkiv region, while delivering much-needed humanitarian aid to families facing the horrors of Russia’s invasion. The Proliska team was using a clearly marked vehicle – a humanitarian vehicle, protected under international humanitarian law.
Earlier this week, on 9 July, I once again had to condemn a strike affecting humanitarian assistance in the front-line town of Orikhiv, in the Zaporizhzhia region. And following that tragic incident, another attack in Kherson impacted the delivery of humanitarian aid on 11 July. In each of these three unacceptable attacks, civilians have been impacted.
As humanitarians, we have one purpose: saving and protecting the people of Ukraine whose lives have been upended by Russia’s invasion. These attacks only highlight the challenges we are facing, exacerbated by the lack of access to support Ukrainians in areas currently under Russian control.
International humanitarian law protects civilians and civilian infrastructure, including humanitarian workers. They must never be a target.

Title: JAPAN HELPS WFP DELIVER FOOD ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE AFFECTED BY  DESTRUCTION OF KAKHOVKA DAM
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 July 2023
KYIV – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) thanked the Government of Japan for its early and generous contribution of US$2 million to support Ukrainian communities affected by the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam.
To date, WFP has delivered more than 235,000 food rations to people affected by the destruction of the dam across Khersonska and Mykolaivska oblasts. Japan’s contribution will help WFP sustain this assistance, mostly in the form of 30-day food rations.
“Japan is a leader in advocating for and providing humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, and one of our most important partners”, said Matthew Hollingworth, WFP Country Director in Ukraine. “This new contribution will support families who have had to endure not only the daily consequences of the war, but also a terrible ecological catastrophe,” Hollingworth added.
WFP and its local partner Tarilka started distributing ready-to-eat food packages of locally baked bread and canned beans or meat just six hours after the destruction of the dam on June 6. Within ten days, WFP had delivered more than 150,000 of these food rations to support families who had been evacuated or were trapped in flooded areas.
WFP works in Ukraine to provide food and cash assistance to Ukrainians affected by the war at the request of the Government and in close collaboration with authorities and local partners. Since March 2022, WFP has distributed the equivalent of almost 2 billion meals to Ukrainians – counting all forms of assistance including cash. WFP’s food assistance is primarily targeting areas near the frontline where food is scarce or very expensive, and more than 90% of the food that WFP distributes is purchased locally in Ukraine.
Since March 2022, the Government of Japan has contributed more than US$46 million to support WFP emergency food assistance programmes in Ukraine as well as logistics and emergency telecommunications services for the entire humanitarian community. This makes Japan one of the most important donors to WFP operations in the country. WFP also received US$13.8 million of individual donations from the Japanese people and the Japanese private sector.

Title: STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN, ON THE ATTACK AT AN AID DISTRIBUTION POINT IN ORIKHIV
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
10 July 2023
After 500 days of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, civilians continue to be killed and injured. Yesterday, in yet another attack, several civilians were reportedly killed and injured while receiving humanitarian aid in the front-line town of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region. A drinking water distribution point installed and maintained by a partner of the UN’s Ukraine Humanitarian Fund was also destroyed in the attack.
The people in Orikhiv have been living under constant bombardment for many months. When I visited Orikhiv on Orthodox Christmas earlier this year, I met people forced to spend most of their days in shelters.
As I have said many times, and I will continue to say, international humanitarian law is clear: civilians, civilian infrastructure and humanitarian assets must be protected. And investigations of these violations must take place.
The people of Ukraine need our support more than ever. We will continue to help those most in need.

Title: Majority of displaced Ukrainians plan or hope to return home as war hits 500-days mark
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
10 July 2023
As the full-scale war on Ukraine reached a 500-day mark, an absolute majority of Ukrainians displaced as refugees abroad or inside the country report still express a hope and intention to return home, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)’s latest survey reveals. Seventy-six per cent of refugees  surveyed by UNHCR in EU countries and Moldova and 82 per cent of internally displaced Ukrainians plan or hope to return permanently, according to the study “Lives on hold: Intentions and Perspectives of Refugees and IDPs from Ukraine”. With active hostilities ongoing, taking lives and damaging civilian homes and infrastructure, only about 15 per cent plan to return in the next three months and intend to stay in their current location, either abroad or in safer areas in Ukraine.
Hopes to return are higher (71%) among refugees who found temporary protection in countries neighbouring Ukraine, compared to those hosted in other European countries (57%). Since their displacement, over a third of refugees (39%) and 50% of internally displaced people have been able to travel back to their home regions for short-term visits, which help people maintain connections with their families and communities and make informed decisions about the conditions of their eventual return.
According to the findings, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Kyiv and Kharkiv regions, as well as Kyiv city, were identified among the top areas of intended return. While safety and security were cited as the main factors preventing displaced people from returning home now, access to basic services, housing, employment and livelihoods were named as enablers facilitating return.
“To enable refugees and internally displaced people to return, recover and rebuild their lives in their areas of origin, UNHCR contributes to area-based programmes and durable solutions in areas of return through protection services, housing and community-based programmes. This also includes legal assistance to help returnees recover ID documents and property documents and with house repairs, and prefabricated homes,” noted the UNHCR Representative in Ukraine, Karolina Lindholm Billing in her briefing on 7 July.
UNHCR has prioritized house repairs in areas to which many displaced Ukrainians have already returned, and so far repaired 1,800 houses in Chernihiv region, 1,500 houses in Kharkiv region and 2,200 in Mykolaiv region. In total across Ukraine, UNHCR has so far supported the repair of over 13,000 houses and helped more than 240,000 people with legal aid services, and this work continues.
In the areas of Khersonska, Dnipropetrovska and Mykolaivska oblasts affected by not only hostilities but also by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, UNHCR has provided protection services, relief items, such as blankets, mattresses, bedding kits, solar lamps, and emergency shelter assistance and is now assessing the longer-term damages to houses for support with durable repairs.
Last week, UNHCR also published a “Position on Voluntary Returns to Ukraine” which reaffirms that UNHCR is not promoting returns to Ukraine at the present moment, as the invasion and international armed conflict is ongoing. At the same time, UNHCR emphasizes that voluntarily returning to one’s home country is a fundamental human right which must be respected and supported. In line with its initial non-returns advisory, issued in March 2022, UNHCR continues to advocate for protection of civilians of all nationalities fleeing Ukraine and for flexibility of host countries towards short-term visits to Ukraine by refugees.

Title: THE UKRAINE WAR REACHES ANOTHER GRIM MILESTONE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
07 July 2023
Kyiv, 7 July 2023 – The United Nations today (Friday) deplored the horrendous civilian cost of the war in Ukraine, as the country marked 500 days since the beginning of Russia’s large-scale invasion.
The UN’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said it was able to confirm that more than 9,000 civilians, including over 500 children, have been killed since Russia’s February 24, 2022 attack, but it cautioned that the real number could be much higher.
“Today we mark another grim milestone in the war that continues to exact a horrific toll on Ukraine’s civilians,” said Noel Calhoun, the deputy head of HRMMU.
The HRRMU noted that overall monthly casualty figures decreased earlier this year comparing to 2022, but in May and June the average number of casualties went up again. It cited the recent deadly attack on June 27 when 13 civilians, including four children, died in an early evening missile strike on a busy shopping area in Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. Among those who perished in the Kramatorsk attack was Viktoriia Amelina, a Ukrainian writer and human rights defender, who succumbed to her injuries earlier this week.
Just days later another missile strike claimed 10 civilian lives in the western city of Lviv, making the last two weeks some of the deadliest since the Russian invasion began.
The UN human rights monitoring mission, which has worked in Ukraine since 2014, said three times as many civilians were killed in the last 500 days as during the entire previous 8 years of hostilities in eastern Ukraine.
The latest report on the civilian casualties from 24 February 2022 to 30 June 2023 is available here (LINK).

Title: L’viv: UNESCO condemns the attack in the buffer zone of the World Heritage site
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 July 2023
UNESCO condemns the bombing that hit a historic building in L’viv last night, located in the buffer zone of the World Heritage Site of "L'viv – the Ensemble of the Historic Centre".
This attack, the first to take place in an area protected by the World Heritage Convention since the outbreak of the war on 24 February 2022, is a violation of this Convention as well as of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.
The Organization expresses its sincere condolences to the families of the five victims, according to a provisional report, and its support to those injured and to the people of L’viv.
UNESCO recalls the obligations of States Parties under these widely ratified normative instruments. States Parties to the World Heritage Convention undertake not to take any deliberate measures which might damage the cultural and natural heritage situated on the territory of other States Parties. These obligations apply to the buffer zones.
Buffer zones are an additional layer of protection for World Heritage sites and whose boundaries are recognised and approved by the World Heritage Committee.
Under the 1954 Hague Convention, States Parties also commit to refrain from any act of hostility directed against cultural property.
In March 2022, Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, sent a letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation to remind him of these obligations and to specify the coordinates of the World Heritage sites in Ukraine.
L’viv is also a UNESCO creative city for literature, and will soon host a UNESCO cultural centre which will be a national hub for Ukrainian artists.
Since the beginning of the war, UNESCO has verified damages to more than 260 Ukrainian cultural properties.

In the early hours of this morning in Lviv, I was jolted awake by explosions.
Another attack by the Russian Armed Forces has left people injured and killed as their homes were severely damaged in a strike while they too were still sleeping.
Today’s attack came just a week after the deadly attack in Kramatorsk and recent strikes in Kharkiv, Sumy and other regions of Ukraine, bringing loss and destruction to the people who continue to live through the horrors of Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine.
Once again, I repeat that international humanitarian law is clear: civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.
The United Nations and the humanitarian community will continue to support the people of Ukraine.
On behalf of the United Nations and the humanitarian community, I send my sincere condolences to the bereaved families and wish those injured a speedy recovery.

Title: Works begin under EU-funded project to repair schools in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
05 July 2023
UNOPS is working with the EU and partners to help more than 20,000 students return to school.
Construction work began in late June on the first batch of educational institutions as part of the School Repairs in Ukraine project, funded by the EU and implemented by UNOPS. The ongoing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine puts the rights of millions of children to quality education at risk. The objective of this initiative is to rehabilitate war-damaged schools for the return of students at the start of the new academic year in September 2023.
Claudia Amaral, Head of EU Humanitarian Aid in Ukraine, stressed the importance of this initiative, stating, "We aim to restore a sense of normalcy and stability for children who have been affected by this war. The EU is committed to standing alongside Ukraine to rebuild schools, dreams, and the future of its children."
Following detailed assessments by specialists, eight schools across three oblasts - Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv - have been identified for immediate attention. The repair work will focus on replacing windows and doors, addressing the relatively limited damage caused by blast waves from nearby missile strikes. The aim is to ensure that these buildings are safe and comfortable for the returning students.
Oleksandra Azarkhina, Deputy Minister for the Development of Communities, Territories, and Infrastructure of Ukraine, noted: “Words of gratitude go out to our international partners, including the School Repairs in Ukraine project, implemented by UNOPS, for their significant support. The project is tackling the renovation of educational facilities that sustained local damage, providing them with much needed equipment, and improving their shelters to meet safety requirements.”
The repair works at these initial eight schools will be followed by more extensive renovations at an additional 28 sites. These subsequent repairs will involve addressing roofs and walls, repairing heating systems as needed, and improving shelter conditions to further enhance safety.
"Education is what every country's future depends on," emphasized Tim Lardner, UNOPS Ukraine Country Director. "As Ukraine faces the challenges that lie ahead, it will need the talents of its young generations to secure a sustainable pathway to prosperity. By helping schools reopen, we are making our modest contribution to the country's success."
Local authorities and school administrations are optimistic that these efforts will allow students to return to classrooms and resume their education. Principal Viktoriia Shalimova of Lyceum no. 4 in Lozova, one of the eight schools in the first batch, acknowledged the impact on children, stating, "Children miss being able to socialize with their peers. They will sometimes visit school, although they don't have classes. I keep hearing how much they miss it."
Despite the ongoing war and the recurrent threat of airstrikes, the Ukrainian government has adopted a plan to transition a significant number of schools back to offline learning starting this September. Recently adopted requirements dictate that all educational facilities must have shelters with sufficient space to operate, which highlights the government's commitment to safe educational environments.
Oleksandra Azarkhina, Deputy Minister for the Development of Communities, Territories, and Infrastructure of Ukraine, emphasized this, stating, "Safe educational environments are one of the government's top priorities. We have already launched the recovery and reconstruction of damaged schools, as well as the construction of new ones. Central to these efforts is the Fund for the Elimination of the Consequences of Armed Aggression, which has provided funding to 65 secondary schools."

Title: Human Rights Council President appoints Vrinda Grover to serve as member of Ukraine commission of inquiry
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
29 June 2023
GENEVA (23 June 2023) – The President of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Václav Bálek (Czechia), has appointed Vrinda Grover of India as a member of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, which was created by the UN Human Rights Council in 2022.
A practicing advocate in India, Grover has more than 34 years of experience in constitutional law, criminal law and human rights. She has appeared as counsel in landmark cases before the Trial Courts, High Courts and the Supreme Court of India as well as before commissions of inquiry and quasi-judicial authorities.
Grover has legally represented victims and survivors of sexual violence, custodial killings, torture, communal massacres, extra-judicial killings, enforced disappearances and mob lynching. She has also represented media practitioners, human rights defenders and death row prisoners.
Grover has actively engaged with women’s rights and broader human rights movements. Currently serving as the chair of the board of International Service for Human Rights, she is also a founding member and independent expert of the Working Group on Human Rights in India and the UN. She was a member of the UN Women Asia Pacific Regional Civil Society Advisory Group (2012-2016). In 2012, she participated in a fact-finding mission of the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT) and of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) in the Philippines to investigate the situation of human rights defenders in the country.
The three-person Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine was created by the UN Human Rights Council on 4 March 2022 with a mandate to investigate all alleged violations and abuses of human rights, violations of international humanitarian law and related crimes in the context of the aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation. On 4 April 2023, the Council renewed the mandate of the Commission for a further period of one year. Grover will join Erik Møse (Norway) and Pablo de Greiff (Colombia) who have been serving as Chair and Commissioner of the Commission of Inquiry since March 2022.
The Commission is scheduled to present an oral update to the Human Rights Council at its fifty-fourth session (September 2023), to submit a report to the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session (October 2023) and to submit a comprehensive report to the Human Rights Council at its fifty-fifth session (March 2024).

The images arriving from Kramatorsk are horrifying.
I am appalled and extremely saddened by yet another strike hitting homes, restaurants, shops and schools, leaving dozens of civilians, including children, killed and injured. On behalf of the United Nations and the humanitarian community, I send my most heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and wish those injured a speedy recovery.
Yesterday’s attack hit the centre of Kramatorsk, a civilian area, densely populated, where people were trying to go on with their lives despite all the horrors caused by this war.
This is another example of inexcusable level of suffering Russia’s invasion is inflicting on the people of Ukraine. International humanitarian law protects civilians and civilian infrastructure, and everything must be done to minimize or avoid civilian harm, including by verifying targets.
Civilians and civilian infrastructure are not a target.

Title: International actors gather with Ministry of Justice and UNODC in Kyiv to support action on Ukraine prison crisis
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
27 June 2023
Kyiv, Ukraine, 21 June 2023 – On 21 June 2023 representatives from 18 UN Member States came together with international organizations in Kyiv to discuss the unprecedented challenges facing Ukraine’s prison and probation services, in an event organized by the Ministry of Justice and supported by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

Ukraine’s prisons have been badly affected by the war, with extensive damage suffered. There are severe ongoing challenges, including struggles to ensure safety and security, meet prisoners’ basic needs and manage the evacuation of thousands of prisoners from conflict-affected regions, as well as vulnerability to further crisis. The safety and security of prisons impacts the safety and security of society outside prison walls.
At the forum the Minister of Justice, Mr Denis Malyuska, pointed to the positive path Ukraine’s prisons had been on before the war. “This Forum proved to Ukrainians and the whole world that the Ukrainian penitentiary system is changing. We have travelled a difficult path from the Soviet past to observing the rights of prisoners according to international standards, but have made important progress. There are still many challenges ahead during these difficult times and the support and unity of our partners, both in Ukraine and across the international community, is essential to overcome them.
His comments made it clear that while the need for immediate assistance in prisons is immense, support focused on bolstering resilience and ongoing reform is equally essential. The Ministry of Justice continues to be strongly committed to fostering a more humane and rehabilitative approach to imprisonment. This forum was a vital step in ensuring that the country’s prisons continue their reform in line with European and international standards, in order to enhance social reintegration prospects and reduce recidivism rates, thereby contributing to public safety.
These standards include the United Nations Minimum Standards for the Treatment of Prisoners – also known as the Nelson Mandela Rules – which offer a blueprint for good prison management in the 21st Century. They offer a powerful defence against abuse of prisoners’ rights, and provide the foundation for better prisons that make society safer for all. Ukraine has recently joined the Group of Friends of the Nelson Mandela Rules – a group of 40 Member States and other entities committed to promoting the practical application of the Rules.
Member States attending the Forum shared their commitment to supporting Ukraine's penal system. Mr Ken Saito, Minister of Justice of Japan, said: "I have nothing but respect for Ukraine's strong commitment to penal reform in such difficult times. This will serve as an important foundation to promote the rule of law in the country. At the upcoming G7 Justice Ministers meeting, Japan will work with the G7 and international bodies to assist Ukraine in these efforts."
Attendees of the forum exchanged knowledge and expertise, and forged local and international strategic partnerships to facilitate ongoing action in this vital area. They discussed a proposal developed by the Ministry of Justice and UNODC for a new programme, Penitentiary Assistance in response to the Armed Conflict and Emergency Needs in Ukraine (PACE.UA), which would:
Discussing PACE.UA, the UN Resident Coordinator, Ms Denise Brown, emphasized the UN’s commitment to supporting the penitentiary system’s immediate needs, as well as Ukraine’s ongoing prison and penal reform efforts. “Ukraine’s prisons have been badly affected by the war, with extensive damage and severe ongoing challenges. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has worked with the Ministry of Justice to propose a new programme, PACE.UA, which would address these challenges. We are ready to take action – but we need the support of Member States in order to do so. The Penitentiary Forum offered an opportunity to kick start this essential work.”
The proposed programme is fully aligned with the UN Transitional Framework for Ukraine (2022-23) and its focus on leaving no one behind, social inclusion and human rights. PACE.UA would support the Framework’s priority area 2 (recovery and support in key sectors), which highlights efforts to protect conflict-affected people and civilian infrastructure; and to strengthen national capacities for efficient crisis response and recovery planning, including institutional capacity development.
Mr Denis Malyuska thanked UNODC for their ongoing support. "Allow me to express my sincere gratitude to UNODC, our reliable and valued partner. Their support will continue to be instrumental in addressing our most pressing challenges, driving progress and achieving positive outcomes for our nation.”

Title: Ukraine Recovery Conference. Plenary 2 – Scale of Recovery Challenge
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 June 2023
On 21 June 2023, Under-Secretary-General and UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner, in his capacity as the Vice-Chair of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group, delivered the following remarks at the Ukraine Recovery Conference held in London, United Kingdom.
As prepared for delivery.
Your Excellency, President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
Your Excellency, Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal,
The Right Honourable Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, James Cleverly,
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have just returned from Ukraine, where the people I met with have had their lives and livelihoods shattered by war.
Yet they also possess an extraordinary determination to adapt, to recover, and to rebuild, which the United Nations (UN) is supporting across three key strands.
-First, from day one of the invasion, the UN in Ukraine has worked with the government, local authorities, and civil society to extend critical humanitarian assistance -- from food and shelter to cash assistance and protection services.
At the same time, the UN has developed a clear picture to inform a targeted recovery through a Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment developed with our partners.
Our humanitarian support has already reached 5.4 million people across Ukraine in 2023.
The Ukraine Humanitarian Response Plan requires $3.9 billion yet it is just 26% funded as of 15 June 2023.
-Second, the UN remains focused on critical needs -- most recently the Kakhovka Dam disaster, with devastating humanitarian, economic and ecological consequences.
Despite security and access constraints, the UN and partners have provided humanitarian support to at least 200,000 people in Kherson and the surrounding regions including food, shelter, and drinking water.
We continue efforts to provide assistance to all of those in need including in areas currently under Russian control where humanitarian access is extremely limited.
To chart a way forward, the UN and our partners are also developing a damage assessment with a focus on agriculture and the environment.
-Third, in 2023, the UN scaled up its recovery efforts, implementing $1 billion of recovery and development programming in line with the Government’s priorities, driven by 24 UN entities and 3,000 personnel.
That includes supporting the restoration of the high-voltage energy grid to ensure an uninterrupted supply of electricity, water, and heating, directly benefitting six million people.
The UN has also assisted Ukraine’s emergency services to remove over half-a-million landmines and pieces of unexploded ordnance, aiding four million people, including to return home.
The UN is also supporting the domestic private sector, the lifeblood of Ukraine’s economy, already helping thousands of businesses and individuals to relaunch or relocate.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The UN’s pledge to stay and deliver in Ukraine is characterized by community-level recovery -- jointly planning, sequencing, and layering our humanitarian, development, and social cohesion support.
We are connecting Ukrainians’ resilience with the tools that people need today to invest and rebuild towards futures that are not defined by this war.
Thank you.

Title: Ukrainian Gender Equality Commissioner declares women’s economic inclusion and empowerment a national priority for country’s peacebuilding and recovery.
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 June 2023
Women and marginalized groups have key role to play in leading decision making on Ukraine’s recovery, which should help build the country back better and more equal. This was the main message of representatives of the Ukrainian government, women rights organizations, civil society, and the private sector that convened at gender responsive event held ahead of the Ukraine Recovery Conference.
Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine has had a disproportionate effect on women and girls. They represent the great majority of refugees, and internally displaced. Under daily attack, women face increased challenges in accessing housing, social services, food, sexual and reproductive health, employment, and other essential services. Yet at the same time women and women led organization are playing a huge role in providing humanitarian assistance, supporting their communities, participating in the armed resistance and keeping the economy afloat.
Speaking in London on the eve of the international Ukraine Recovery Conference, Ukraine’s Government Commissioner for Gender Equality Kateryna Levchenko said it was imperative that reconstruction plans ensure women and girls specific needs are addressed and women are fully included in the recovery’s planning and financing.
“Gender equality and inclusion are among the main principles of recovery according to the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano. Principles are good when they are effectively implemented. Therefore, any international support should consider a gender mainstreaming approach and women empowerment should be part of all projects for all development partners without exception.  I would like to appeal to development partners to advocate the need for gender-responsible recovery of Ukraine and to be strong as we, Ukrainians are strong!” she said.
“To rebuild a vibrant and inclusive Ukraine, women and women's organisations must be included as core voices  involved in shaping the Ukrainian society. To ensure Ukraine has its best and brightest citizens re-building the country, every table, every panel, every process must include women and diverse voices of Ukraine’s communities,”  said Lord Ahmed of Wimbledon, the Prime Minister’s Special Representative for Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict and Minister of State (Middle East, North Africa, South Asia and United Nations).
“Ukraine already has many of the laws and policies in place to ensure a gender responsive recovery, UN Women looks forward to supporting our counterparts in government and civil society to implement them, while also encouraging international partners to apply financing for gender equality principles in their decision making on how to fund the recovery,” stated Sabine Freizer, UN Women’s Representative in Ukraine.
Mark Bowman, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Vice President for Policy and Partnership, said: “EBRD is well on track to deliver on the Bank’s commitment to invest €3 billion for Ukraine by the end of 2023.”
At the centre of our support is the focus on rebuilding Ukraine’s human capital and ensuring a gender responsive recovery. Our clients Horizon Capital and Astarta gave impressive examples on how the private sector is supporting women entrepreneurs, facilitating the reintegration of veterans and others into the Ukrainian agricultural workforce,” he added.
Natalia Karbowska, Ukraine Women’s Fund, speaking on behalf of the Ukrainian civil society organizations emphasized that to make recovery truly gender responsive the following is needed: political will of those making decisions, expertise, analysis, and statistics, strong civil society to develop the strategies but to work with the government as “critical friends” on their monitoring and implementation, platforms and clear priorities where gender responsive should be integrated in the first place, such as economy and employment.
“With recovery we are learning by doing. There is not much experience and knowledge globally and of, course, in Ukraine. Gender responsive recovery is about strategies but also about practical implementation. We have to be realistic. We cannot integrate gender everywhere at the same time. We have to decide on the priorities. Criteria. Sectors with the biggest gender gaps, which will benefit the most from women’s participation. Economy and employment is clearly one of them,” she added.
The side-event to the Ukraine Recovery Conference was convened by the British Embassy Kyiv (BEK) and hosted by European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), together with partners including UN Women, the FCDO’s Support to Civil Society Organisations (SCSO) programme in Ukraine, the National Democratic Institute (NDI), the Ukrainian Women’s Fund, the Women’s Ukraine Congress, and the Government of Ukraine.

Title: Ukraine: FAO and WFP join forces to clear agricultural land from remnants of the war and help farmers resume production
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 June 2023
The programme aims to prevent Ukraine from requiring food assistance in the long term
Kyiv/Rome – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) have launched a joint programme in collaboration with mine action partner Fondation Suisse de Déminage (FSD) to support smallholder farmers and rural families most affected by the war.
The programme has already started in Kharkivska oblast, and will later expand to Mykolaivska and Khersonska oblasts, focusing on farmers with land plots smaller than 300 hectares as well as rural families growing food for their own consumption.
The programme is designed to safely release land back to productive use, including by clearing it from mines and other explosive remnants of the war, to help restore agricultural livelihoods, contribute to Ukraine’s economic recovery, and phase out the need for humanitarian assistance for thousands of rural families.
The war has damaged Ukraine’s agriculture and food production, disrupted supply chains and exports, increased production costs, and caused widespread mine contamination.
According to the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment, published in February 2023, Ukraine’s production of grain and oilseeds decreased by 37 percent in 2022.Almost 90 percent of small-scale crop producers surveyed by FAO in Ukraine reported a decrease in revenue due to the war, and one in four reported having stopped or significantly reduced their agricultural activity.
“Making the land safe and free of explosive remnants of the war is the first step to rebuilding resilient and prosperous rural communities in Ukraine, who have been on the frontlines of this war, and preventing their long-term dependence on humanitarian assistance,” said Denise Brown, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine.
“Many families and small-scale farmers in front-line regions are not planting this season because they know their fields are dangerous or they are risking their lives to plant on mined lands or contaminated soils,” noted Pierre Vauthier, Head of FAO Ukraine Country Office. “We expect that the soil rehabilitation, remediation and conservation techniques conducted will support people’s return to farming, and restore rural livelihoods while helping to sustain Ukraine’s agricultural production.”
“Without urgent action, agricultural production in Ukraine will continue to collapse, with direct consequences on food security and diet diversity in the country, and potential ripple effects on regional and global markets,” said Matthew Hollingworth, WFP Representative and Country Director in Ukraine.
FAO, WFP and FSD in close coordination with communities, local authorities and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, will first identify and map lands that require demining by using satellite imagery. In the second phase, demining teams will survey and clear lands from mines and other explosive remnants of the war, prioritizing plots that can be quickly released with minimal clearance work. In the third phase, FAO and FSD will test soils to assess contamination by pollutants left behind by exploded weapons. FAO and WFP will simultaneously survey small farmers and rural families on the types of inputs and resources they need to restart agricultural production, and will provide direct in-kind or cash support where possible.
To date, the $100 million project is facing a funding gap of $90 million. FAO and WFP estimate potential annual savings of up to $60 million in direct food assistance to rural communities. The project has been supported by the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, a UN pooled fund, as well as private donors.

//
It is extremely disturbing that rescue workers were, once again, killed and injured in Kherson yesterday while helping communities impacted by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam. On behalf of the humanitarian community, I send my condolences to the family of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery. Our thoughts are also with the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, working under extremely difficult conditions to support their people.
This incident is yet another example of the human impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Civilians, including rescue workers, are protected under international humanitarian law.

Title: On World Refugee Day, UNHCR spotlights initiatives and actions that give internally displaced people and refugees hope and possibilities to actively contribute
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
20 June 2023
20 June 2023, Kyiv, Ukraine ­­– Today, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Ukraine marked World Refugee Day with an event focused on initiatives and actions that help people who have been forcibly displaced actively participate and be fully included in housing, job and social programs in their new communities.
Titled “Hope Away from Home. A world where refugees and internally displaced people are always included”, the event brought together about ninety participants representing national, regional and local authorities, international partners, and civil society and community-based organisations who are championing initiatives that support “inclusion for solutions”. Key panelists included Aisha Hamza Isa, the youth leader of Muslim Congress in Ukraine, the heads of Kyiv and Rivne oblast state administrations, Ruslan Kravchenko and Vitalii Koval, the deputy mayor of Kryvyi Rih, Kostiantyn Bielikov, the deputy head of the IDP Coordination Council in Chernivtsi, Nataliia Frunze, and the head of the NGO “Veselka TV”, Dina Ibragimova. The event provided a platform to discuss and share best practices for ensuring the active participation and contribution of displaced and war-affected people in formulating ideas and solutions that help restore a sense of normalcy in their lives and enable them to recover and rebuild their lives with a strong sense of hope for the future.
Opening the discussion, the UNHCR Representative in Ukraine, Karolina Lindholm Billing, noted that Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes due to Russia’s invasion express a strong hope and desire to return to their homes, when they feel it is safe to do so, and that it is important to nurture that hope by providing support for the recovery of Ukraine, as is being discussed this week at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London. “At the same time, displaced Ukrainians also express a strong wish to recover from the trauma, find housing, a job, and to socially integrate in the communities where they currently live, and not stay idle with their lives on hold. The distinguished speakers at this event have a lot of experience in supporting displaced people, of all ages and abilities and disabilities, to be fully included and contribute to their new communities, and to feel Hope while away from Home,” Ms. Lindholm Billing added.
The keynote speaker, Vice Prime Minister, the Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories, Iryna Vereshchuk, said that creation of employment opportunities for internally displaced people is one of the priorities for the Government of Ukraine, enabling the recovery of the war-torn country: “Being a refugee stands for everything that should not be happening in the 21st century. People lose, run away, get asylum. And most importantly, they lose hope. We have to do everything possible for Ukrainian people, including men, women and children, so that they do not lose hope. We need to help internally displaced people in Ukraine to find jobs. We need UNHCR and other organizations to invest their resources in supporting employment and creation of gross national product. 2023 and 2024 will be focused on this.”

According to the UNHCR’s flagship annual report, Global Trends in Forced Displacement 2022, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine significantly contributed to the number of refugees and internally displaced people worldwide hitting 110 million, an all-time high. Around 11.3 million Ukrainians are currently displaced, including 5 million within the country and 6.3 million abroad.
Under the leadership of the Government of Ukraine, and in close cooperation with the regional and local administrations, UNHCR Ukraine and its NGO partners reached over 4.3 million people in 2022 plus over 1.3 million people so far in 2023 with humanitarian assistance, including protection services, emergency shelter materials and housing repairs, support for collective centres hosting displaced people, cash assistance and essential items. In 2023, while continuing to prioritize responses to urgent humanitarian needs, UNHCR is also supporting people to rebuild their homes and lives, contributing to the recovery of communities affected by war and displacement, in line with the National Recovery Plan.

Title: UNDP energy damage assessment for Ukraine reveals continued vulnerabilities
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
20 June 2023
New report also reveals roadmap for resilient green recovery and closer integration with EU
KYIV, 20 June 2023 – As Ukraine's energy sector reels under the impact of relentless attacks, a new report released today offers a sobering assessment of the status quo and charts a strategic course towards recovery and resilience.
The report, compiled just before the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, reveals that the Ukrainian energy system remains extremely vulnerable and continues to operate in emergency mode with a reduced and limited safety margin, grappling with damage costing more than $10 billion.
Ukraine's power system continues to operate in an emergency mode, which affects both power grids and generation. The report’s findings show that an alarming 42 out of 94 (45 percent) of vital high-voltage transformers in government-controlled territories have been damaged or destroyed due to missile or drone strikes since the beginning of the current stage of the war. More than half of these transformers have endured repeated attacks, thwarting attempts at repair.
According to the report, power generation capacity has been reduced to nearly 50 percent of its pre-2022 levels. Out of nearly 37 GW of installed capacity, over 19 GW have been destroyed, damaged or occupied since February 2022. The situation is aggravated by the significant decline in manoeuvring capacities, including the loss of more than 67 percent of thermal power generation capacity.
This widespread damage significantly affected energy supply during the recent winter and continues to threaten the stability of access to power for Ukrainian consumers.
UNDP Resident Representative Jaco Cilliers said the findings of the report underscore the urgent need for swift, coordinated, and strategic action. “UNDP’s assessment makes a compelling case for aligning immediate response measures with the mid-term objectives of the National Energy Strategy,” Cilliers said. “The de-facto loss of obsolete coal-fired generation shall be viewed as an opportunity to accelerate the green transition and decentralization of the sector. We have already started cooperation with several municipalities with a view to secure their immediate energy supply needs, but also to pave the way to financing the development of greener and more resilient energy infrastructure.”
The report proposes a set of clear and actionable recommendations to build the energy sector back stronger, greener and more resilient than before. UNDP is taking these recommendations as guidelines in its cooperation with national and local stakeholders on the recovery of the energy sector. The guidelines include:
Note to media: Because the Kakhovka Dam had been under the temporary military control of the Russian Federation, its hydro-power generation capacities had been unavailable since April 2022. However, following the dam’s destruction on 6 June, and although having little impact on the power grid, there have been immediate and detrimental downstream consequences on a wide range of critical energy infrastructure facilities, including power distribution, heating, gas, water supply and sanitation. Preliminary assessments indicate that more than 200 distribution power substations have been completely destroyed, along with dozens of boiler houses.
Background: The report, Towards a Green Transition of the Energy Sector of Ukraine, is a successor to the 2022 Ukraine Energy Damage Assessment, a comprehensive study jointly prepared by UNDP and the World Bank. While the previous report offered an initial overview of the damage sustained by the energy sector and covered the period February-December 2022, the current analysis performed by UNDP experts presents updated insights into the severity and extent of this damage, and covers January-April 2023. It builds on data provided by the Government of Ukraine, specifically the National Security and Defense Council, Ukrenergo, and the Ministry of Energy.

Title: UNDP Administrator concludes his visit to Ukraine with strong commitment towards recovery and reconstruction
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
19 June 2023
Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, calls for a renewed focus by the international community on early recovery ahead of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London.
KYIV, 19 June 2023 – The Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Achim Steiner, concluded a three-day mission to Ukraine where he committed to scaling up the organization’s support to the country’s recovery including key areas like restoring critical energy, housing and social infrastructure, demining, and supporting the millions of men and women whose small and medium scale enterprises make up the backbone of Ukraine’s economy.
“The deep scars of war are everywhere, but I’ve also witnessed the impressive resilience and determination of Ukrainians -- we must combine this unbreakable spirit with the support they need to invest, rebuild and regain control over their lives and create the opportunities that they need for the future,” Steiner underlined ahead of the Ukraine Recovery Conference to be held in London, United Kingdom, on 21-22 June 2023.
Steiner’s mission to Ukraine included visiting the city of Irpin, which was heavily damaged by shelling. There, he met with residents, including 28-year-old Sofia Krotyk, her husband and her two-year old son, who had to flee Irpin following the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. They barely escaped before their house was destroyed. “There was a piano and above it hung a picture of our family, and here too were beautiful wooden stairs leading upstairs to where my parents, little sisters and brother lived. Unfortunately, all that remains is the sky,” said Sofia.
Across Ukraine, it is estimated that the war has damaged nearly 1.5 million homes, and thousands of schools and hospitals. UNDP has supported the removal of some 80,000m3 (equivalent to 8,000 truckloads) of rubble in Kyiv Oblast, a vital step in the rebuilding process, which has already started.
In Irpin, Steiner also launched the rehabilitation process of a multi-story apartment building, jointly with the Ministry for Restoration of Ukraine, the Kyiv Regional State Administration. The project, part of a broader effort to restore 18 multi-story buildings in Kyiv Oblast, which will allow 4,000 people to have a home again was financed through the UNITED24 crowdsourcing platform that is helping to raise much-needed funds to rebuild.
“Together, we are supporting families to put a roof over their head, a vital first step to allow people to regain a semblance of normality,” said Steiner. “It is a demonstration that reconstruction is something that is happening now and not being put on hold until the war ends.”
Ukraine has also become one of the world’s largest minefields with some one-third of its territory potentially affected. In Irpin, Steiner met with representatives of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine as UNDP continues to support their dedicated efforts to clear landmines and unexploded ordinance. The mine action efforts of UNDP and other partners have already helped Ukrainian teams to remove 500,000 items of unexploded ordnance, has allowed 3.8 million people to live in more safety. “By removing these deadly remnants of war, it means that farmers can work their land safely and earn a living; children can go to school; and roads and markets and local amenities can open once again,” emphasized Steiner.
This recovery process also includes supporting micro-, small- and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs), which represent the lifeblood of Ukraine’s economy. In Lviv, Steiner inaugurated a new centre that will support businesses that have had to relocate to Western Ukraine. It is already home to businesses that provide vital prosthetics and rehabilitation equipment to people injured as a result of war. “This is part of our efforts to create a support ecosystem for businesses that relocated, relaunched and adapted -- based on a conviction that recovery efforts cannot wait,” said Steiner.
In Kyiv, Steiner participated in a roundtable discussion with 13 civil society organizations, including Vox Ukraine and ZMINA-Human Rights Centre where he underlined the need to combine communities’ determination to recover with the tangible support that NGOs can bring to driving a green, equitable and transparent recovery.
Steiner’s visit ended with meetings with the Prime Minister of Ukraine, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and other government officials, where he reiterated UNDP’s commitment to rapidly support early recovery and reconstruction in priority areas, including energy, demining, restoring critical and social infrastructure, and supporting the private sector.
Steiner affirmed that decision-making processes should be inclusive, and the voices of civil society and vulnerable individuals and communities must be heard. The path to recovery lies not only in reconstructing what was lost but in strengthening Ukrainian society from the grassroots level to the highest echelons of governance.

Title: Human Impact Assessment reveals stark consequences of war on Ukrainian society

19 June 2023
A comprehensive UNDP-led report takes a deep dive into Ukraine's Humanitarian Crisis
Kyiv, 19 June 2023 – The United Nations in Ukraine today released its Human Impact Assessment (HIA), providing comprehensive insights into the effects of Russia’s invasion on living conditions, health, access to education, livelihoods, food security, social inclusion, and gender equality. Twelve UN agencies contributed to the UNDP-led joint initiative, implemented at the request of the Office of the President and the Government of Ukraine.
Yulia Sokolovska, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said the Assessment marks an important milestone in understanding the true human cost of the war in Ukraine. “The Human Impact Assessment provides crucial insights into the resilience of our people, as well as the areas where we need to focus our recovery efforts,” he said. “We understand the depth of our responsibility, and are committed to ensuring the needs of our most vulnerable citizens are not just recognized but met.”
Denise Brown, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine said: “The data in this Assessment underscores the stark impacts of the Russian invasion, particularly on Ukraine’s most vulnerable people. Its recommendations will also help guide the entire UN system as we work with the Government, communities, and civil society in Ukraine, doing what is needed as they navigate their way to recovery.”
The Assessment reveals that although living standards and access to basic services stabilized following the initial months of conflict, living conditions faced a setback in winter 2022/2023 due to country-wide utility disruptions. Health and education were similarly impacted with 22 percent of households spending over a quarter of their monthly income on healthcare, and 11 percent of youth identifying a lack of access to quality education.
Other key findings:
The HIA concludes with key recommendations for the Government of Ukraine, International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs), donors, and International Financial Institutions (IFIs). These include supporting the government in upholding the rights of all groups affected by the war, aiding households and communities in rebuilding their resources, improving access to social protection systems, and implementing recovery efforts focusing on the changing needs of affected populations. Additionally, it urges the establishment of policies aimed at restoring agricultural production, investing in education and skills training, prioritizing livelihood interventions reflecting Ukraine's economic and demographic changes, and building inclusive societies during and post-war period.
Background: The HIA is a UNDP-led joint initiative of the United Nations, implemented at the request of the Office of the President and the Government of Ukraine. Representatives from 12 UN agencies contributed to HIA development: UNICEF, WFP, FAO, OHCHR, UNFPA, UN Women, IOM, UNDP, UNAIDS, UNHCR, WHO, and OCHA with support from the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office.

18 June 2023
STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE DENISE BROWN ON HUMANITARIAN ACCESS TO AREAS UNDER RUSSIAN CONTROL
The United Nations has been engaging with the Governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation regarding effective delivery of humanitarian aid to all people affected by the devastating destruction of the Kakhovka Dam.
The Government of the Russian Federation has so far declined our request to access the areas under its temporary military control. The UN will continue to engage to seek the necessary access. We urge the Russian authorities to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law.
Aid cannot be denied to people who need it.
The UN will continue to do all it can to reach all people – including those suffering as a result of the recent dam destruction – who urgently need life-saving assistance, no matter where they are.

UN deployed boats to deliver assistance in the Kherson Region
I am now with my colleagues from the UN Children’s Fund and the World Food Programme in a small village in the rural area of the Kherson Region, about 15 kilometres from the front line. We came here using four boats to deliver life-saving water and food to around 500 families who are in a dramatic situation - as many of the people here have been enduring the consequences of constant bombardment and now the catastrophic flooding.
The convoy brought food and water, which are the main needs of people here. The UN and our colleagues from the NGOs have worked non-stop, since day one, to ensure that people impacted by the catastrophe caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam could rapidly receive some support.
We will continue to make every effort to help civilians caught up in the horrors of the war in Ukraine.
Since 6 June, we continued life-saving operations and delivered at least 10 inter-agency convoys with vital items to thousands of people affected by the disaster, in addition to the regular assistance provided separately by UN agencies and NGOs.  On the situation: the fast depletion of the Kakhovka Reservoir, caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam during the early hours of 6 June, is leading to a grim situation in southern Ukraine, where tens of thousands of people have already lost access to piped water, mainly in Dnipropetrovska oblast.
The reservoir – one of the largest in Europe and a source of drinking water to at least 700,000 people – is reportedly decreased by 70 per cent of its capacity, according to Ukrainian authorities. The width of the reservoir decreased from 3 to 1 kilometre, and the water level is now at around 7 meters, below the threshold of 12 meters when it stops working as a water reservoir.
Large urban areas in Dnipropetrovska oblast, including Pokrovska, Nikopolska and Marhanetska, are completely cut off from centralized water, and others like Apostolivska and Zelenodolska have extremely limited access. This has left over 210,000 people, in this area alone, in urgent need of life-saving water, according to estimates from the United Nations and its humanitarian partners.
In Khersonska oblast, flooded areas have reportedly reduced from 620 km2 on 9 June to 180 km2 as of 13 June, according to the preliminary analysis of satellite imagery released by the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT).
The receding floodwater, however, will likely create new challenges for people already facing humanitarian needs in Ukraine.

15 June 2023
Achim Steiner, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has arrived in Ukraine to begin a three-day mission to witness the ongoing impact of the war on communities and assess the early recovery efforts now being made.
While in the country, Mr. Steiner will meet with people directly impacted by the war, government officials, civil society, private sector and partners from the United Nations (UN) family. He will visit communities to monitor the status of UNDP’s early recovery activities. Mr. Steiner will also discuss UNDP’s ongoing support to strengthen relief efforts and advance Ukraine’s longer-term recovery and development plans with government officials.
UNDP, as part of a coordinated UN response, has been supporting the Government of Ukraine since the onset of the war and is now assisting in a range of vital areas including the reconstruction and repair of critical infrastructure. While many UNDP interventions respond to urgent government priorities, such as restoring the supply of energy and clearing explosive ordnance and debris, UNDP is also laying the foundations for longer-term, resilient development.
Following his mission to Ukraine, Mr. Steiner will travel to London, United Kingdom (UK) where he will represent the UN at the Ukraine Recovery Conference, held jointly by the UK and Ukraine from 21-22 June 2023. The conference will focus on mobilising international support for Ukraine's economic and social stabilisation and recovery from the effects of war.

Title: New WHO report outlines concrete steps to make health care more accessible for people in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 June 2023
Barcelona/Kyiv, 15 June 2023 - Around 2.5 million households in Ukraine experienced catastrophic health spending in 2021. This represents nearly 1 in 5 households – a share that is higher than in many other countries in Europe, according to a new report launched today during the session on Ukraine at the WHO Barcelona Forum on Financial Protection, featuring also an expert discussion on possible policies to further minimize the impact of the war and improve financial protection in health care in Ukraine.
Catastrophic health spending means a household can no longer afford to meet its basic needs – food, housing and electricity – because of having to pay out of pocket for health care. In Ukraine households with catastrophic health spending are mainly those with low incomes and those headed by pensioners or in rural areas.
Launched at the 2023 WHO Barcelona Forum on Financial Protection, the new report “Can people afford to pay for health care? New evidence on financial protection in Ukraine”, shows that financial hardship due to out-of-pocket payments is almost entirely driven by spending on medicines and inpatient care. Medicines are the main driver in poorer households and inpatient care in wealthier households. Inpatient care plays a much larger role in driving catastrophic health spending in Ukraine than in most other countries in Europe.
This new analysis reflects the state of financial protection (affordable access to health care) in Ukraine before the Russian Federation’s invasion in 2022. Drawing on survey data from 2009 to 2021, it explores the impact of health financing reforms initiated in 2017, finding that there was a small but consistent decline in catastrophic health spending between 2018 and 2021. This positive trend is likely to be reversed by the devastating effect of the invasion on economy, health system, household poverty and people’s health.
“Since 2017, the Government of Ukraine has taken measures to reduce out-of-pocket payments by increasing public spending on health and through health financing reforms that aim to improve equity and efficiency in the health system. It is good to see some positive impact from these changes, although more remains to be done to address the challenge of out-of-pocket payments, particularly for people with low incomes and others at high risk of catastrophic health spending,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine.
“The strengths of health coverage policy in the current system – near universal population coverage and very limited use of co-payments – are increasingly important in the context of the war,” said Alona Goroshko, lead author of the WHO report. “The report recommends that the Government continues to support the National Health Service of Ukraine so that it is better able to reduce out-of-pocket payments for medicines and inpatient care in ways that improve financial protection. This is likely to increase trust in the health system and foster confidence in the Government’s capacity to improve people’s lives amid the challenging context of war.”
WHO’s new report notes that coverage policy in Ukraine has three features that are associated with stronger financial protection.
First, entitlement to publicly financed health services is based on residence, ensuring that most of the population is covered, unlike in health systems that link entitlement to payment of contributions, where many people can lack coverage.
Second, the introduction of the Affordable Medicines Program (AMP) in 2017 and the Program of Medical Guarantees (PMG) in 2018 (with further expansion in 2020) was an important attempt to explicitly link publicly financed health benefits to health needs and available resources.
Third, user charges (co-payments) are kept to a minimum, especially in primary care.
Despite these important positive features, informal payments and other out-of-pocket payments are widespread in the health system. This is due to low levels of public spending on health and other inefficiencies, including the following factors:
The report highlights five ways in which the Government of Ukraine can strengthen financial protection:
About the report
The report draws on data from household budget surveys conducted between 2009 and 2021 and information on coverage policy (population coverage, service coverage and user charges) up to the end of 2022. It assesses the state of financial protection in Ukraine before the Russian Federation’s invasion in February 2022. Ukraine is one of the few countries in Europe providing evidence on financial protection up to 2021.

The United Nations has engaged with the Governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation to ensure access to all civilians impacted by the devastating destruction of the Kakhovka Dam.
Operationally, we have boats, personnel and supplies ready to go.
However, the Russian Federation is yet to provide the safety guarantees we need to cross the front line to the left bank of the Dnipro River, including to Oleshky. These guarantees are necessary for the safety of our team and not to create additional risks for the people we intend to serve. The UN will continue to deliver life-saving assistance in the areas controlled by Ukraine and make every effort to ensure we can reach all people who have been stranded by the floods and urgently require life-saving assistance, no matter where they are.

08 June 2023
UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Denise Brown today met with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, reassuring him of the United Nations’ support in the face of the Kakhovka Dam disaster, and that UN teams have been on the ground since the first day.
UN and humanitarian partners have been delivering water, food and cash to people affected by floods in Kherson and Mykolaiv oblasts in partnership with the local authorities since the first day of this disaster.
Plans are now being made, also in partnership with oblast authorities, to reach the wider flood affected areas as soon as possible, once the military deems it safe, given the risks as fast-moving water shifts mines and unexploded ordnance to areas previously assessed as cleared.
The UN is committed to reaching all Ukrainians in need on both sides of the river bank. We have repeatedly requested access and safety guarantees, in particular to the left bank, from the Russian Federation authorities that are in temporary military control of these areas. We have not received that access, nor the necessary safety guarantees for humanitarian staff and the people they would help there.
The UN is also working with all relevant Ukrainian government ministries on the assessment of longer-term damage caused by this disaster.

06 June 2023
We have all seen the tragic images coming out today of the monumental humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe in the Kherson region of Ukraine.
The United Nations has no access to independent information on the circumstances that led to the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam plant. But one thing is clear: This is another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
We are seeing the effects in the city of Kherson, the town of Nova Kakhovka and 80 other towns and villages along the Dnipro River.
Massive flooding.  Large-scale evacuations.  Environmental devastation.  Destruction of newly planted crops.
And added threats to the highly threatened Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant -- Europe’s largest nuclear facility.
At least 16,000 people have already lost their homes -- with safe and clean drinking water supplies at risk for many thousands more.
The United Nations and humanitarian partners are rushing support in coordination with the Government of Ukraine – including drinking water and water purification tablets and other critical assistance.
We will continue our humanitarian work – and our appeals for urgent safe and secure humanitarian access.
Today’s tragedy is yet another example of the horrific price of war on people.
The floodgates of suffering have been overflowing for more than a year.
That must stop.
Attacks against civilians and critical civilian infrastructure must stop.
We must act to ensure accountability and respect for international humanitarian law.
Above all, I appeal for a just peace in line with the UN Charter, international law and the resolutions of the General Assembly.
Thank you.

Title: SPEECH BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, DENISE BROWN,  AT THE COMMEMORATION OF CHILDREN KILLED BY THE WAR
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
04 June 2023
I would like to start with a number, a very important number that should shock and horrify the world. And that is 1,500. 1,500 Ukrainian children killed or injured since the Russian invasion in February 2022. And unfortunately, that number goes up almost every single day. Last night, in Dnipro, three more children were injured in an explosion. Earlier this week, in Kyiv, a little girl was killed alongside her mother after a strike.
I know that that brings no solace, but it is important to document and keep track. The Convention of the Rights of the Child, written at the United Nations, signed by Member States, ratified by Member States, including Russia, is intended to protect children – physically, psychologically, financially – and ensure that they stay with their families. It specifically prohibits adoption during times of war. We know that the Convention for the Rights of the Child is being totally disregarded by Russia, as is International Humanitarian Law.
It doesn't make these documents irrelevant. It makes them extremely important for accountability. And the International Criminal Court has already issued two indictments for the forcible taking of children from Ukraine. And that's the beginning. We also know millions of Ukrainian children have been displaced because of violence, have seen their family members killed, have suffered great loss, have not been able to go to school, have not been able to access health care and are suffering from the trauma of the war brought by the Russian Federation.
I also know that much has been done to support these children. In Kharkiv, a fantastic centre has been set up by local authorities and UNICEF to support them. And in Antonivka, in Khersonska oblast, I met a little boy who lived in a shelter and who had his tablet and thus was able to study. And everywhere I go, I see this tremendous outpouring of support. I know it is not enough, it will never be enough. But our obligation, as the United Nations, is to stay here. And we will stay here as long as necessary to continue supporting those who need us the most.

Title: FAO, WFP and MAPF identify farmers’ needs for rehabilitation of lands affected by war
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
02 June 2023
Farmers from Kharkivska oblast are invited to express their needs for agricultural demining and land rehabilitation through a call, opened for the State Agrarian Registry users until 18 June.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) have launched a new programme to support farmers with demining and rehabilitation of agricultural lands of up to 300 ha that have been affected by military activities from February 2022 onwards. The programme activities have already started in Kharkivska oblast, and will be expanded to Mykolaivska, Khersonska and potentially other oblasts.
With the new call, opened for the State Agrarian Registry (SAR) users, FAO and WFP, in cooperation with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine (MAPF), are identifying the farmers’ needs for agricultural demining and land rehabilitation. Farmers from Kharkivska oblast are invited to fill in a form for priority demining by 18 June 2023. To participate in the call, farmers need to be registered in the SAR, and go through the link received in a message in personal profile in the SAR or via email, indicated during the registration in the Agrarian Registry.
Applicants will have to provide an estimation of how many hectares are affected by explosive remnants of war, and provide the GPS boundaries of the those land plots. The information provided will be reviewed using satellite imagery.
Along with the request, interested farmers will be asked to provide their consent to provide FAO and WFP access to the data related to their farming activities, which is already recorded in the SAR.
Applicants should note that this call is intended to estimate needs for urgent demining and does not guarantee any specific form of assistance.
The closing date for submitting requests is 18 June 2023.

Title: Ukraine: FAO surveys impact of war on smallholder farmers
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
02 June 2023
The findings indicate that damages and losses for small-scale crop and livestock producers exceed USD 3.85 billion
The war in Ukraine and its economic effects have caused major damage to small farmers' production and incomes, as is stated in the new report released by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
The Impact of the war on agricultural enterprises: Findings of a nationwide survey of agricultural enterprises with land up to 250 hectares surveyed 1 927 small-scale crop and livestock producers in 23 oblasts, including selected rayons in Donetska, Kharkivska, Khersonska and Zaporizka oblasts that are under the control of the Government of Ukraine.
The assessment provides an overview of the impact of the war on small-scale farmers in Ukraine, as well as regional analysis of specific western, central, and front-line oblasts. The majority of interviewees are small enterprises specialized in crops production (81 percent), followed by those engaged in both crop and livestock production (10 percent), as well as specific small-scale livestock production enterprises (9 percent).
“The survey shows the disturbing situation that agricultural producers are facing due to the war” said Pierre Vauthier, head of the FAO Ukraine Country Office. “Prior to the war, the Ukrainian agriculture sector produced sufficient fruits, vegetables, crop and livestock products to feed around 400 million people globally. The war has continuously interrupted the transportation of foods both within and outside the country, threatening the food security of millions around the world. The data from this assessment will help FAO, the Government of Ukraine, and partners identify urgent needs as well as geographical areas to invest in and support smallholder farmers to withstand the current situation and recover quickly.”
The study showed an almost eight percent decrease in the total number of small-scale producers, of which one percent are livestock producers ceasing small crop production, and the other almost seven percent are crop producers who have completely stopped the production. Among the key factors that have led to the interruption and/or reduction of farming include the temporarily closure of farms, losing control of farmland, death of owners and sale of land, all caused or associated to the escalation of the war.
“FAO  studied farmers cultivating up to 250 hectares of land, who represent  approximately 65 percent of the total number of agricultural enterprises in Ukraine, while they own and use only 7 percent of the total agricultural land,” added Oleksandr Revnivtsev, FAO National Field Assessment Coordinator.
For this assessment, FAO used its adapted agriculture damage and loss methodology, and collaborated with local partners, including the Kyiv School of Economics, the All-Ukrainian Association of Village Councils and Amalgamated Communities, the East-Ukrainian Agricultural Advisory Services for conducting the survey in Donetska oblast and the Office of perspective development for conducting the survey in Zaporizka oblast.
The survey findings are in line with the latest Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA2), undertaken jointly by the World Bank, the Government of Ukraine, the European Commission, and the United Nations, and the detailed Agricultural War Damages, Losses, and Needs Review, a part of the RDNA2 report, prepared by Kyiv School of Economics jointly with FAO and World Bank, and the financial support of Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR).

“I am yet again shocked and saddened by the death of a child who was killed alongside other civilians during another barrage of missiles launched at Kyiv today by Russian armed forces. My thoughts are with their families and those injured.
On this Ukrainian Children’s Day, I also want to express my deepest sympathy with the families of over 1,500 children killed and injured in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion started in February 2022. The UN is also gravely concerned and following closely the reports of Ukrainian children being forcibly transferred to Russia.
The war has also a devastating impact on the mental health and well-being of children, including millions who have had to flee for their lives. The humanitarian community will continue to work non-stop to ensure they can receive the support they urgently need, for as long as it is necessary.”

Title: THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS MISSON DEPLORES CHILD CASUALTIES IN UKRAINE WAR
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
01 June 2023
Kyiv, — UN human rights monitors today said a 9-year-old girl and two adults were killed in Kyiv’s Desnianskyi district earlier in the day as a result of a suspected Russian missile strike.
“Sadly, as the world marks International Children’s Day, there is little to celebrate in Ukraine where civilians, including children, continue to pay a heavy price” said Matilda Bogner who heads the UN’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.
UN monitors said six children were killed and 34 were wounded in May alone, bringing to more than 1,500 the total number of child casualties since Russia’s armed attack against Ukraine over 14 months ago.
Bogner deplored the armed attacks that have led to the so many child victims. “Behind every death there is an immeasurable human tragedy. This must stop now,” she said.
The UN monitoring mission said at least 525 children (276 boys, 219 girls, and 30 children, whose sex is not yet known) have been killed, and at least 1,047 have been injured in 289 cities, towns, and villages across Ukraine, in both Government controlled areas and those areas occupied by Russia, since Russia started an armed attack on 24 February 2022. It said 87 percent of the casualties were caused by explosive weapons with wide area effects, including artillery, missile and air strikes, and loitering munitions attacks.
The UN monitoring mission said the war so far left a total of almost 9,000 civilians dead and more than 15,000 wounded but it cautioned that the real figure could be considerably higher as UN monitors were not able to access some of the areas of Ukraine that have seen heavy fighting.

Title: WHO records 1,000th attack on health care in Ukraine over the past 15 months of full-scale war
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
30 May 2023
The World Health Organization (WHO) has verified the 1,000th attack on health care in Ukraine since full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation in February last year – the highest number WHO has ever recorded in any humanitarian emergency. This grim milestone yet again highlights the difficult and dangerous circumstances in which the country's health system operates, and the challenges in providing both routine and emergency healthcare services. Attacks hinder access to health care for tens of thousands of people, increasing the risks of illness and death.
The 1,004 WHO-verified attacks over the past 15 months of full-scale war have claimed at least 101 lives, including both health workers and patients, and injured many more, impacting health providers, supplies, facilities and transport, including ambulances.
WHO defines an attack on health care as “any act of verbal or physical violence, obstruction or threat of violence that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of curative and/or preventive health services during emergencies.” This can range from violence with heavy weapons to psychosocial threats and intimidation, that affect access to health care for those in need.
“These attacks threaten the safety and well-being of health workers and undermine care for people living close to conflict areas,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine. “Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law. They deprive people of the care they need and have wide-ranging, long-term consequences.”
Such an attack deprives an entire community of essential health services that are needed to save lives, leading to an increase of illness and deaths and deterioration of health systems in the longer-term. The psychological effect on patients, scared to seek health care, and health workers, unable to provide health care in safe and protected environments, is also significant and will impact the health of the population for long periods of time.
WHO continues to advocate for safe access for the delivery of health care services, free from violence, threat, or fear. This is critical to put people in need at the centre of the collective humanitarian response.
"The fact that the health system in Ukraine continues to operate amid such circumstances is a testament to the heroic dedication of healthcare workers,” continued Dr Habicht. “Despite the challenges posed first by the COVID-19 pandemic and now well over a year of war, Ukraine’s healthcare workers remain amazingly strong, brave, and patient, day after day, saving lives and providing care to those in need. We stand in solidarity with them and all those working to ensure that everyone in Ukraine has access to the healthcare they need."
WHO has been monitoring and responding to health needs in the regions most affected by fighting in the east and south of the country. According to the Health Resources and Service Delivery Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS), health facilities in the most affected areas including Kherson, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions have reported facing difficulties due to a lack of security and structural damage. However, a high percentage of health facilities in these regions are functional and accessible, even though they continue to operate partially due to damage.
“Even as we continue to verify attacks on health as this relentless war grinds on, we also note that attacks on other civilian infrastructure, especially in the past six months, are indirectly impacting the capacity of the health system overall,” explained Dr Habicht. “WHO has so far reached almost nine million people with support nationwide since 24 February last year. We are stepping up efforts, along with UN and other partners, to access more areas, including regained parts of Ukraine where health needs are among the most acute.”
According to WHO data, significant challenges have been reported in providing specialized services, such as chemotherapy and mammography, due to a lack of staff and medical equipment. There are also difficulties in providing high-skilled childbirth services in some regions. Although primary healthcare remains widely available in war-affected regions, health costs have been increasing in the past half-year, with surveys conducted by WHO indicating that nearly a third of the population are finding it difficult to afford certain health services.

Title: Note to correspondents on the humanitarian response in Ukraine, attributable to Saviano Abreu, Spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)

26 May 2023
//
•    The UN and our humanitarian partners continue to work non-stop to support people impacted by the escalating fighting and hostilities, which are ravaging communities in the east and south of the country.
•    Approximately 5.4 million people have received humanitarian assistance and protection services by aid organizations across Ukraine in the first four months of 2023 – more than 60 per cent of whom are women and girls. This is around 800,000 people more than the total we had assisted by the end of March.
•    More than 2.1 million people received multipurpose cash assistance, close to 3.5 million received food, nearly 3 million had access to health services and medicines, around 1 million could access clean water and hygiene products and also approximately 1 million received emergency shelter or critical household items after their homes were damaged or destroyed. Education services were provided to nearly 700,000 people - mostly children - and protection services to around 600,000, including people who received services to prevent gender-based violence or support survivors.
•    This was possible thanks to the efforts of hundreds of humanitarian organizations, and our close work with local groups and community-based volunteers who play a vital role on getting the assistance to those who need it the most.
•    We do need to ensure that the world knows that the humanitarian response in Ukraine is as crucial as ever: the war has further escalated since the beginning of the year, taking a heavy toll on civilians who live close to the front line, those who cannot go back to their homes and also people all across the country living under almost daily air sirens and threats of attacks.
•    Although strikes on energy infrastructure decreased – we all remember how damaging it was during the winter months – with each passing day more and more people in Ukraine are having their homes, schools, water system and hospitals damaged.
•    Mine contamination is also creating huge challenges, not only to civilians trying, for example, to get back to their farms, but also for humanitarians trying to deliver assistance. This is particularly concerning in the Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions, where people depend on agriculture and dozens of mine-related accidents are being reported every month.
•    Access challenges also continued and assistance to areas under Russian control remains extremely limited. This year alone, because of the deterioration of the security situation and shifts in the front line, humanitarian partners have lost access to almost 60,000 people in almost 40 towns and villages in the east. We don’t stop efforts and exploring all options to ensure people there receive the assistance they need.
•    On the funding side, humanitarians have received only 24 per cent of the $3.9 billion requested for the response this year. We call on the international community to sustain its support to the humanitarian response in Ukraine. This war is far from over and the international support will be critical to ensure we can help people whose lives are been upended by this war.

Title: Unveiling "Behind the Silence" - A Documentary Shedding Light on the Consequences of War on Domestic Violence in Ukraine and Support Services for Survivors, Premieres in Kyiv
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 May 2023
On May 24th, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, in collaboration with StarLight Doc, presented the film "Behind the Silence," created with the support of the governments of Canada, the United Kingdom, USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), and the Ukrainian Humanitarian Fund (UHF).

The film shows how the full-scale war has impacted the levels and forms of domestic violence. Additionally, the documentary highlights the provision of assistance to survivors of war-related violence, including sexual violence.
The film premiere took place at the “Zhovten” cinema and gathered around 300 viewers. The event was attended by the ambassadors of Spain, Finland, and Croatia in Ukraine, as well as representatives from the embassies of France, Japan, Belgium, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, and the Czech Republic. The opening remarks were given by Her Excellency Larisa Galadza, H.E. Ambassador of Canada to Ukraine.
“Canada is committed to supporting Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes – not just in its defence against Russia’s ongoing military aggression, but also in dealing with the consequences the war has rot on the most vulnerable. Our collective supports ensure that there are safe spaces for SGBV survivors seeking assistance, and are available to make sure that no one is alone during these difficult times”, said Her Excellency Larisa Galadza.
In addition to the services supported by the Canadian government, "Behind the Silence" also showcases how experts from services supported by the government of the United Kingdom provide assistance. Particularly, platform "Aurora," mobile teams of social and psychological assistance.
“Tackling gender-based violence is a priority for the UK. That’s why we’ve been working closely with partners in Ukraine to ensure the survivors get the support they need. I’m proud that this work is helping people, and we will continue to support efforts like the Aurora platform. Those who need help should know that it’s available and they are not alone. This is what the "Behind the Silence" film is about”, said the British Ambassador to Ukraine Dame Melinda Simmons.
The film also highlights the work of other support services for violence survivors, such as Survivor Relief Centres, the psychological support line for men, shelters, crisis rooms, hotlines. Most of these services are supported by the United Nations Population Fund and other UN system organizations.
“In Ukraine, because of the invasion by Russia, because of the escalation of the war, the situation with regard to gender-based violence – domestic violence, sexual violence, conflict-related sexual violence – is just so much worse. Particularly for women and girls. They are so much more exposed because of the war”, said UN Resident & Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Denise Brown. So, ensuring that people know where to go to for support and understand the services that are available is critical. We all need to know where to turn to. And the documentary ‘Behind the Silence’ shows that assistance is available despite the circumstances. Psychologists, social workers, lawyers, the police are here to help. And we are honoured to support them.”
The screening of the film was supported by UNFPA's Honorary Ambassador in Ukraine, Maria Yefrosinina, who actively advocates for the rights of domestic violence and war-related violence survivors.
"In times of war, when the country is going through immense suffering and pain, people sometimes downplay their own experiences, putting them aside, thinking that first we need to win the war. Undoubtedly, we should all continue to do everything possible to live in a free country, but it is important not to forget about ourselves, that enduring violence is not acceptable under any circumstances, and that we should not turn a blind eye to injustice within our own families because of the war. Help is available, and it is closer than it seems. The key is not to stay silent about violence, and the documentary 'Behind the Silence' is our attempt to motivate people to seek for support", said UNFPA's Honorary Ambassador in Ukraine, Maria Yefrosinina.
StarLight Media is the media partner for the creation of the film and the event.
Anastasia Steinhauz, Head of Starlight Doc and ICTV, ICTV2 channels, said, "Some may think that a full-scale war with all its horrors and pain has put a pause on internal social issues. Unfortunately, that is not the case. We know that the problem of domestic violence remains relevant and may escalate in the near future. We know that those who previously found it difficult to seek help are now facing new barriers - both in terms of general safety and psychological and economic challenges. Therefore, we are grateful to our partners, UNFPA, for the opportunity to create this documentary film. It is our joint documentary manifesto that reminds us that war should not hinder seeking assistance. There are professional, services, and organizations that continue to work for the sake of providing help, and there are people who need support right now."
With the onset of the large-scale war in February 2022 and the increase in the number of internally displaced persons, the issue of response to and prevention of gender-based violence has become particularly relevant.
The situation has intensified in at-risk groups, according to experts, particularly affecting elderly individuals, some of whom have taken in children, grandchildren, or relatives from the beginning of full-scale war. Especially if there have been previous cases of domestic violence in the family. Children are also at risk, as they often depend on their parents' decisions, such as whether to stay in conflict-affected areas or change their place of residence. As a result, the risk of violence increases.
According to "La Strada-Ukraine," over the past three years, in 2022, the National Hotline for the Prevention and Counteraction of Gender-Based Violence received the highest number of calls—38,472. For comparison, in 2019, there were nearly 10,000 less calls.
In 2022, there were 251,829 reports of domestic violence received by the police and social welfare authorities.
Furthermore, the focus of assistance has expanded, as both social services and the police have started providing help to survivors of violence related to the war, particularly sexual violence. Survivors of this type of violence often fear seeking help. Therefore, in addition to addressing the consequences of such violence, ongoing awareness-raising efforts are being carried out, and the film "Behind the Silence" is an integral part of these efforts.
"As of May, the police have received 82 reports of rape and other sexual crimes committed by Russian military personnel against civilians. However, this number does not reflect the real picture, as there are individuals who are afraid to seek help, some still reside in occupied territories and are unable to receive comprehensive support, or they understand the risk of persecution by the occupying authorities. Nevertheless, we are witnessing an increase in trust towards law enforcement. We believe that this is achieved through a people-centric approach that police officers adhere to today. We are confident that trust will become even stronger after everyone working with CRSV survivors completes a special online training developed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs", emphasized Katerina Pavlichenko, Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs.
If you or your loved ones need qualified assistance, please find the contact information of support services on the UNFPA website.

The creation of the documentary was made possible with the support of the governments of Canada, the United Kingdom, the USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), and the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund.

Title: Ukraine: UNESCO joins forces to protect the mental health of the educational community
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
25 May 2023
Kyiv/Lviv, 24 May – Recognizing the need for mental health and psychosocial support in the Ukrainian education community, UNESCO and the Ministry of Education and Science, with the support of Japan, will gather all relevant education actors in Lviv from May 25 to 27.
For registration, please send an email to Tateishvili Revas, tateishvili@insha-osvita.org
Programme available here
Venue: Готель Львів (Lviv Hotel), проспект В'ячеслава Чорновола, 7, Львів, Львівська область, 79000
For the opening of this workshop, representative from UNESCO, the Office of the First Lady, the Ministry of Education and Science and the Embassy of Japan will address the nearly 150 participants. Then, participants will conduct thematic group work to develop tools and recommendations for the implementation of these policies.
This workshop is organized within the context where almost the entire population of Ukraine is living under constant stress with a high risk of experiencing emotional harm and mental health issues. In the education sector, 26% of Ukrainian teenagers have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. 75% of schoolchildren have experienced stress. Children and education staff affected by the war have an increased risk of suffering emotional harm and developing mental health problems with grave implications for their overall health and well-being.
UNESCO, with the financial contribution of the Government of Japan, launched an ambitious initiative aiming to reduce the negative effects of the conflict on the mental health of Ukrainian students. It is part of the overall action plan led by the Ukrainian authorities to address these challenges, including the National Program for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support under the leadership of the Office of the First Lady, and the Concept of Safety of Educational Institutions upon the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.

Title: The UN Says Russia’s Armed Attack on Ukraine Has Had a Devastating Impact on Older People, Demands Access
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 May 2023
A report released today by the UN’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said older people suffered and died at a disproportionately high rate as a result of Russia’s armed attack on Ukraine. It said that even though people over 60 represent a fourth of Ukraine’s population they account for almost one third of civilians killed during the first 12 months of the conflict.
The UN called on Russia to cease its attack against Ukraine and to grant immediate and unfettered access to its human rights monitors to areas of Ukraine occupied by the Russian armed forces.
The UN report said on some occasions Russian armed forces forced civilians, including elderly people to remain in basements for weeks in dire conditions. In one case cited in the report, 360 civilians were confined to an overcrowded school basement in the village Yahidne in Ukraine’s Chernihiv region without toilet facilities, clean water, or ventilation for nearly a month, resulting in the deaths of ten elderly persons.
The report said UN human rights monitors documented several cases of older people with limited mobility who died in hostilities simply because they were not able to reach a bomb shelter on time. As Russian troops occupied the eastern town of Izium in March of 2022, a disabled woman in her mid-sixties burned to death when the building where she lived was shelled and caught fire.
The UN found that older people on both sides of the frontline were hit exceptionally hard by power outages, water cuts as well as a lack of access to health services, medication and pensions that for most were the only source of income. Those depending entirely on their old age pensions for survival had to undertake perilous journeys across frontline areas to collect their pensions.
The report noted that the war imposed new hardship, deprivation and misery on the lives of older Ukrainians, many of whom had already grappled with hardship and poverty before the attack. The report acknowledged Ukraine’s efforts to address the plight of elderly and vulnerable people, but it also called on Ukraine to do more to ensure that economic social and cultural rights enshrined in international humanitarian and human rights law are respected.
This includes taking into account and prioritising the specific needs of older persons when organizing evacuations, securing long-term adequate accommodation for displaced people, and guaranteeing access to adequate state financial assistance, including social pensions and other allowances.

Title: UN Secretary-General's remarks at press encounter on the Black Sea Initiative
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
17 May 2023
New York, 17 May 2023
Good afternoon,
We have some positive and significant developments — confirmation by the Russian Federation to continue its participation in the Black Sea Initiative for another 60 days.
I welcome this decision.  The continuation is good news for the world.
Outstanding issues remain.
But representatives of Russia, Ukraine, Türkiye and the United Nations will keep discussing them.
I hope we will reach a comprehensive agreement to improve, expand and extend the Initiative – as I proposed in a recent letter to the Presidents of the three countries.
I want to convey my appreciation to all those taking part in the negotiations in a spirit of constructive engagement.
I once again express my gratitude to President Erdoğan and the Government of Türkiye for their efforts – working in permanent coordination with the United Nations.
The importance of the Black Sea Initiative – and the parallel Memorandum of Understanding between the UN and the Russian Federation – is clear.
These agreements matter for global food security.  Ukrainian and Russian products feed the world.
Under the Black Sea Initiative, more than [30] million tons of food have been exported.
Vital food supplies are reaching some of the world’s most vulnerable people and places – including 30,000 tons of wheat that just left Ukraine aboard a WFP-chartered ship to feed hungry people in Sudan.
They matter because we are still in the throes of a record-breaking cost-of-living crisis.
Over the last year, markets have stabilized, volatility has been reduced and we have seen global food prices fall by 20 per cent.
And they matter because they demonstrate that, even in the darkest hours, there is always a beacon of hope and an opportunity to find solutions that benefit everyone.
Looking ahead, we hope that exports of food and fertilizers, including ammonia, from the Russian Federation and Ukraine will be able to reach global supply chains safely and predictably – as foreseen in both the Black Sea Initiative and the Memorandum of Understanding on Russian food and fertilizer exports – the implementation of which the United Nations is fully committed to support.
Thank you.

10 May 2023
Paris, 10 May 2023 – Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, has denounced the killing of French reporter Arman Soldin, AFP video coordinator, on the outskirts of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine on 9 May.
“I condemn the attack that killed video journalist Arman Soldin and call for an investigation to identify the circumstances of his death,” said the Director-General. “I renew my call for international humanitarian law to be respected, including United Nations Security Council Resolution 2222 of 2015 on the protection of journalists, media professionals and associated personnel in situations of conflict.”
Soldin had been covering the fighting in Ukraine for Agence France-Presse since the beginning of the war. He was reported to be killed in a rocket attack on Chasiv Yar on the outskirts of Bakhmut where he was accompanying Ukrainian soldiers. He is the 12th journalist killed in Ukraine since the war started.
UNESCO promotes the safety of journalists through global awareness-raising, capacity building and by coordinating the implementation of the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity.

Title: UN supports Ukraine’s firearms record-keeping with computer donation
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 May 2023
Kyiv, 8 May, 2023 – The United Nations in Ukraine is providing practical support for Ukraine’s civilian firearms record-keeping, handing over 30 computers to the National Police during a meeting between UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator Ms. Denise Brown and Mr. Ihor Klymenko, Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine.
The provision of the IT equipment – comprising desktops and monitor sets – is part of ongoing technical assistance provided by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Ukraine, through its Global Firearms Programme. It will enable the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Police to roll out a Unified Weapons Register across Ukraine. This system is designed to digitize registration, accounting, and control activities associated with civilian firearms circulation. The equipment support has been made possible through financial support of the Federal Government of Germany.
Trafficking in persons, firearms, drugs, natural resources, and other illicit commodities has wide-ranging impacts on peace and security as well as sustainable development, contributing to instability, potentially prolonging crises and hindering reconstruction. Involving small and large criminal organizations operating nationally and across borders, trafficking is facilitated by, and incentivizes, corruption. The associated criminal financing also threatens the integrity of funding for development and reconstruction efforts.
The UN in Ukraine recognises the enormous challenges being faced by the country and commends the efforts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ukrainian law enforcement authorities in their ongoing efforts to combat trafficking. The UN has developed technical assistance actions to support Ukrainian authorities to combat the threats related to trafficking. As part of this, UNODC works closely with the authorities to enhance the criminal justice response against illicit firearms in line with the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Ukraine acceded to the Protocol in 2013.
UNODC has worked with Ukrainian authorities on the issue of illicit firearms, providing legislative and technical advice, training, equipment, and support for international cooperation to help Ukrainian authorities detect, investigate, and prosecute instances of illicit arms flows within, from and to the country.
The UN in Ukraine continuously works on supporting the Government’s efforts to strengthen the capacity of national systems, in line with the Transitional Framework, a strategic document of the UN development system that addresses the response to the economic and social impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Title: The measure of world food prices rose in April for first time in a year
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 May 2023
FAO Food Price Index increases, amid higher international quotations for sugar, meat and rice, while prices for wheat, maize, dairy products and vegetable oils decline.
5 May 2023, Rome - The benchmark index of international food commodity prices rose in April for the first time in a year, amid increases in world quotations for sugar, meat and rice, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reported today.

The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in the international prices of commonly-traded food commodities, averaged 127.2 points in April 2023, up 0.6 percent from March.

At that level, the Index was 19.7 percent below its level in April 2022, but still 5.2 percent higher than in April 2021.

The FAO Sugar Price Index rose 17.6 percent from March, reaching its highest level since October 2011, due to reduced productions expectations and outcomes in India, China, Thailand and the European Union caused by dry weather conditions as well as to a slow start of the sugarcane crop harvest in Brazil, along with higher international crude oil prices, which can increase demand for sugarcane -based ethanol.

The FAO Meat Price Index rose 1.3 percent during the month, driven primarily by higher pig meat quotations, followed by poultry prices, which increased amid Asian import demand and production curbs spurred by animal health issues. International bovine meat prices also increased due to a decline in cattle supplies for slaughter, especially in the United States of America.

In the meantime, price indices for other major food commodity categories, with the exception of rice, continued their declining trend.

The FAO Cereal Price Index dipped 1.7 percent from March and averaged 19.8 percent below its April 2022 value. International wheat prices declined by 2.3 percent, due mostly to large exportable availabilities in Australia and the Russian Federation. World maize prices fell 3.2 percent as supplies in South America seasonally increased with ongoing harvests. On the other hand, against a backdrop of reduced harvests caused by higher input costs and adverse weather, especially outside of Asia, sales to Asian buyers sustained an increase in international rice prices.

“It is important that we continue to track very closely the evolution of prices and the reasons for increases in prices. As economies recover from significant slowdowns, demand will increase, exerting upward pressure on food prices,” said FAO Chief Economist Maximo Torero. “At the same time, the increase in rice prices is extremely worrisome and it is essential that the Black Sea initiative is renewed to avoid any other spikes in wheat and maize,” he added.

The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index declined by 1.3 percent in the month, registering its fifth consecutive monthly decline. World palm oil prices were stable, while quotations for soy, rapeseed and sunflower oils declined in step with seasonal harvest pressure from a potentially record soybean crop in Brazil.

The FAO Dairy Price Index dropped by 1.7 percent, impacted by the persistent slack global import demand for milk powders and higher cheese export availabilities in Western Europe.

Updated production and trade forecasts

In a new Cereal Supply and Demand Brief, also released today, FAO adjusted its world wheat production forecast for 2023. The global outturn is now pegged at 785 million tonnes, the second largest on record, but down from last season mostly on declines in Australia and the Russian Federation from their record 2022 outputs.

For maize, Brazil’s production is expected to reach a record high, while that of Argentina is projected to drop below average levels due to prolonged dry conditions and heat waves. Conducive weather conditions have bolstered yield expectations in South Africa, which expects the second highest harvest on record.

Meanwhile, 2023/24 prospects for rice production along and south of the equator are mixed, largely due to the regionally varied impact of the La Niña event. Going forward, the possible emergence of the El Niño phenomenon during the northern hemisphere summer will need to be closely watched.

FAO raised its earlier projection for world trade in cereals in 2022/23 to 472 million tonnes, now some 2.2 percent below its record level in the previous season. Global wheat trade is forecast to rise by 2.3 percent, while global trade in coarse grains will likely by 5.5 percent. International trade in rice in 2023 is predicted to contract by 4.4 percent year-to-year.

World cereal utilization in 2022/23 is forecast at 2 780 million tonnes, and world cereal stocks by the close of seasons to stand at 855 million tonnes. Based on these latest forecasts, the 2022/23 global cereal stocks-to-use ratio would stand at 29.8 percent, down slightly from 30.8 percent during the previous 12 months, but still indicating a relatively comfortable supply level globally, FAO said.

02 May 2023
Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, has condemned the killing of Ukrainian journalist and fixer Bogdan Bitik in the region of Kherson in southern Ukraine on 26 April.
“I condemn the killing of Bogdan Bitik. Journalists and media professionals working in conflict zones must be protected, and those who commit crimes against them prosecuted,” said Audrey Azoulay, Director General of UNESCO. “As stated in UN Security Council Resolution 2222/2015, any specific targeting of journalists or associated personnel covering a conflict constitutes a crime.”
Bogdan Bitik was reportedly killed by sniper fire while working as a fixer for Corrado Zunino, a correspondent of the Italian daily La Repubblica, who was also injured. Zunino was reported to be wearing a vest marked “press” at the time of the attack.
Since the beginning of the war, UNESCO helped journalists in Ukraine to continue their work safely, providing them with protective equipment, training them on reporting in war zones and supporting the creation of media centres.
Globally, UNESCO promotes the safety of journalists through global awareness-raising, capacity building and by coordinating the implementation of the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity.

Title: FAO and the EU support relocation of Ukraine’s national seed collection to a secure site
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
28 April 2023
Unique plant genetic resources have been transported over a thousand kilometres from Kharkiv to the west of Ukraine.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with support from the European Union (EU), moved a collection of unique plant genetic samples from Kharkiv in the east of Ukraine to a safe location in the west of the country. The volume and diversity of the plant genetic material contained in the seed collection, some of which is not available at any other seed bank, makes it unique and essential to Ukrainian agriculture and to global food security.
As of 2021, Ukraine estimated that it held more than 150 000 plant genetic materials belonging to 544 crops varietals and 1 802 species of plants. The collection contains 39 000 unique genetic samples originating from Ukraine. Crop scientists consider preserving Ukraine’s collections of wheat, triticale, barley, pea, chickpea, temperate forages, and sunflower is of critical importance for global crops.
The Kharkiv National Gene Bank was in imminent danger of loss when shelling in May 2022 damaged infrastructure, agricultural machinery, and some of the working seed collections at field research stations.
“As the conflict intensified, scientists from around the world contacted the Secretariat of the International Plant Treaty to sound the alarm on Ukraine’s main national seed collection held in Kharkiv,” said Kent Nnadozie, Secretary of FAO’s International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. “This unique collection is of global value for the future of food security and sustainable agriculture, and if lost then it is lost forever.”
To conserve Ukraine’s agricultural heritage, FAO and the EU joined efforts to move the collection to a secure location in the west of Ukraine, over 1 000 km away. In a complex operation several national authorities including Ukraine’s Academy of Agrarian Sciences, the International Plant Treaty and the Global Crop Diversity Trust (Crop Trust) partnered to catalogue the seeds and complete the logistics for transportation.
“This activity aims to secure and safeguard the Ukrainian Plant Genetic Resources System and rehabilitate it in a rational and efficient manner,” said Christian Ben Hell, the Sector Manager for Agriculture at the EU Delegation to Ukraine. “While the collection is now in a safe location, further work is needed to ensure a sustainable solution in the long-term. It also involves improving the information system of plant genetic resources with modern IT support.”
It is an international good practice to ensure that such collections are duplicated and safeguarded in at least two locations, one of which should be the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, in case of damage to national collections. Ukraine previously deposited around 2 700 cereal and legume accessions in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, but the majority of its collection has not yet been backed-up.
With the funds from the EU, FAO, the International Plant Treaty and Crop Trust are supporting the Ukrainian National Academy of Agricultural Science to develop and operationalize a plan for the long-term preservation and safe replication of genetic resources, including a future deposit in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. In parallel, the construction of an additional depository in the west of Ukraine has also commenced.
“FAO has a unique role to play in supporting the reconstruction of Ukraine’s agrifood systems, given the Organization’s substantial expertise and experience in both humanitarian and development contexts,” said Pierre Vauthier, head of FAO’s Ukraine country office. “This initiative makes an important contribution to safeguarding future food production and resilient livelihoods in Ukraine, and supports the critical role it plays in global food security.”
Other partners, including the Nordic Genetic Resource Center, the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources and Novo Nordisk Foundation, provided early emergency support to the Ukraine’s national genebank. A wide range of partners are now joining efforts with FAO, the International Plant Treaty and the Crop Trust to ensure coordinated action to safeguard Ukraine’s agricultural heritage.
Every seed sample conserved in a genebank represents a unique additional option available to breeders, researchers and farmers in the fight against climate change and food insecurity. At a time when the world is facing an unprecedented loss of agricultural biodiversity in farmers’ fields, it is more important than ever to ensure that crop diversity is safeguarded, including the diversity that is held in genebanks.

Title: Briefing note by Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding recent developments in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
25 April 2023
Geneva - Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Ravina Shamdasani
We urgently call on both the Russian and Ukrainian authorities to investigate and to swiftly and publicly condemn audio recordings that have emerged over the weekend in which people with apparent connections on both sides of the conflict in Ukraine appear to order the summary execution of prisoners of war or declare that there shall be no survivors on the battlefield.
Audio material emerged on 23 April on several Telegram channels urging combatants not to take prisoners of war or to summarily execute those they captured. One recording is alleged to be of a member of the Ukrainian armed forces ordering the killing of a prisoner of war from the so-called Wagner Group that provides military and security contractors to fight for the Russian Federation. A subsequent audio statement was issued, apparently from the head of the Wagner Group, indicating that they would no longer take prisoners of war on the battlefield.
While we have not yet been able to verify the authenticity of these recordings, such statements could provoke or encourage summary executions of prisoners of war or those hors de combat.
If verified, the order to summarily execute persons hors de combat, including prisoners of war, followed by their killing or an attempt to do so amounts to a war crime, as does the declaration that no quarter will be given. We call on Russian and Ukrainian authorities to comply with their obligations under international law to investigate the statements in these recordings and to identify and prosecute those responsible.
We also call on military commanders and other superiors to issue clear and unambiguous orders to protect and treat humanely POWs and persons hors de combat, and to ensure that these orders are strictly complied with.

Title: “A contribution to the NPU’s effectiveness,” – Japan provides National Police of Ukraine with reflective items and heat packs
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 April 2023
The Government of Japan handed over reflective wearable items and heat packs to the National Police of Ukraine in a ceremony held in Kyiv today. The goods travelled to Ukraine from Japan. They will enhance police officers’ safety when working in conditions of low visibility, as well as help the Police assist citizens more effectively in cold weather.
On behalf of the National Police of Ukraine, the ceremony was attended by Vasyl Nevolia, Head of the International Police Cooperation Department. “The National Police is forced to work in previously unfamiliar circumstances, ensuring law and order no matter the conditions,” noted General Nevolia. “Our units must learn and develop new expertise quickly, and we have to provide our men and women with the means to do their job well and stay safe. The equipment handed over today contributes to that. We express our sincere gratitude to the Government of Japan for its attention to our needs, and we look forward to continued cooperation.”
The donated items include 20,000 reflective vests, over 158,000 reflective wristbands, and over 130,000 heat packs. The need for them was formulated earlier in the winter, when large parts of the country suffered power and heating outages.
Ambassador Kuninori Matsuda of Japan also attended the event and was able to inspect the delivered goods. “The Government of Japan, as the chair of G7 this year, is determined to uphold the international order based on the rule of law, and to deepen bilateral cooperation standing by Ukraine and its people. Japan commends the important work carried out by the National Police in this difficult time of on-going war. This is the first tangible cooperation extended to the National Police, and we hope that this cooperation will contribute to improving the safety of the dedicated police officers of Ukraine.”
The project focused on delivering the items to Ukraine has been managed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). Elene Agladze, UNOPS Ukraine Partnerships Specialist and In-Country Officer in Charge, said: “Both the Government of Japan and the National Police of Ukraine are long-standing partners of UNOPS, and we are very pleased to be able to facilitate their interaction. Much of what we do in Ukraine at the moment is about addressing urgent needs through emergency projects, but we also emphasize laying the foundations of the country’s sustainable recovery to help it build back better. We have no doubt that this delivery is a steppingstone on the path to comprehensive and mutually beneficial cooperation.”
This delivery was funded by the Additional Emergency Grant Aid for winterization assistance in Ukraine allocated by the Government of Japan in February 2023. UNOPS and Japan are also working together on the initiative called Emergency Grant Aid for Winterization Response and Provision of Housing to Vulnerable People of Ukraine. As of the beginning of April 2023, it helped deliver 84 high power generators (110kVA and above) to municipal heating, water supply, and sewage companies in the city of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region and is now preparing to renovate residential buildings in Kharkiv city that have been damaged as a result of the war.

12 April 2023
The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine is appalled by particularly gruesome videos posted on social media on Tuesday (April 11).
One of the videos shows a brutal execution of a man who appears to be a Ukrainian prisoner of war, while the other one shows mutilated bodies of apparent Ukrainian servicepersons. Regrettably this is not an isolated incident. In recent reports the Mission documented a number of serious violations of International humanitarian law, including those committed against prisoners of war. These latest violations must also be properly investigated and the perpetrators must be held accountable.

Title: Note to Correspondents on the Black Sea Grain Initiative
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 April 2023
The Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) has not been able to conduct inspections today as the parties needed more time to reach an agreement on operational priorities.
Following intensive discussions within the JCC, supported by the United Nations and Türkiye, routine inspections are planned to resume tomorrow, Wednesday, 12 April. We urge all involved to meet their responsibilities to ensure that vessels continue to move smoothly and safely in the interest of global food security.
As of today, there are 50 vessels waiting to move to the Ukrainian ports. The JCC has overseen and enabled the safe export of more than 27.5 million metric tonnes of food since the Initiative was signed, contributing to the lowering of food prices. This critical work is done against the backdrop of the ongoing war and active hostilities. We do not underestimate the challenges, but we know they can be overcome.
The UN team is working closely with all sides, taking into consideration all parties’ concerns.
The global humanitarian benefits of the Initiative are evident and are not limited to exports to specific low-income countries. It is in everyone’s interest to keep it going.
The FAO reported on the March food price index, which marked a further drop of 2.1 per cent. The index has fallen 20.5 percent in the last year. The renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative in November and March has contributed to this fall. This translates to benefits for millions of vulnerable and low-income households around the world. Through this Initiative, an essential source of supplies for the World Food Programme has been restored, with over half a million metric tonnes of wheat having been transported since August, supporting ongoing humanitarian operations in Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and Yemen.
It is critical that all sides ensure the integrity and full implementation of the Initiative.

Title: Ukraine: A. Azoulay and V. Zelensky together to rebuild the cultural sector
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
05 April 2023
Kyiv - UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay carried out a two-day mission to Ukraine, with visits to Kyiv, Chernihiv and Odesa, to reaffirm the Organization's support to the population and to advance the reconstruction of the country’s cultural sector. President Zelensky welcomed the “concrete results” of the emergency measures taken by UNESCO since the beginning of the war.
“Since the very first days of the war, UNESCO has stood by the Ukrainian people to help protect culture, heritage, education and the safety of journalists. These are the pillars of our humanity, of our identities; the pillars of the country’s recovery and of peace,” said Audrey Azoulay at a press briefing outside Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Repeatedly since February 2022, the Organization has reiterated that the targeting of cultural sites and schools violates international law. UNESCO has also deployed an emergency plan, funded to the tune of $30 million. It ranges from the delivery of protective equipment for monuments and works of art, to the distribution of more than 50,000 computers to enable teachers to continue teaching remotely as well as the provision of dozens of helmets and bullet-proof vests to journalists working in combat zones.
$6.9bn needed to restore culture
“This support will continue and increase in 2023,” announced Audrey Azoulay during a meeting with teachers in a school in Chernihiv, where she notably said that in the coming weeks UNESCO is mobilizing more than $10 million in additional funding to respond to the education emergency. One of the Organization's priorities in this area concerns the strengthening of psychosocial support for students in educational establishments.
The Director-General of UNESCO also presented figures on the impact of the war on all areas of culture over the past year. In particular, the Organization took stock of $2.6 billion in physical damages. “In order to rebuild but also to redress the situation, it will be necessary to invest $6.9 billion in the cultural sector in Ukraine over the next ten years," Audrey Azoulay further said on the sidelines of a working meeting with President Zelensky.
UNESCO and Ukraine to draw up recovery plan for cultural sector
At their meeting, the Ukrainian President welcomed measures already implemented by the Organization. “Sometimes there are only words. With UNESCO, there are concrete results,” he said. The President requested UNESCO to support in the Ukrainian authorities’ development of their recovery plan for the cultural sector, while continuing to coordinate and mobilize international actors in the field.
Audrey Azoulay concluded her visit to Ukraine in Odesa, whose historic centre was inscribed by UNESCO on the List of World Heritage in Danger in late January this year. Following the inscription, the Organization will further strengthen actions on the ground, prioritizing the preservation and digitization of artistic and documentary heritage while maintaining the protection of heritage buildings endangered by artillery fire.
UNESCO will also launch a vast project to improve the conservation of the city’s archaeological museum collections, thanks to the financial support of the Foundation of UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière.

05 April 2023
More than $1.2 billion is urgently needed for emergency repairs to critical infrastructure
Kyiv, 5 April 2023 – Relentless attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has caused over $10 billion in damages and left over 12 million people with no or limited electricity, while also disrupting water supply and heating systems, according to a comprehensive Energy Damage Assessment from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank.
The assessment provides the most detailed overview of the catastrophic damage to Ukraines energy infrastructure, with emergency repairs estimated to reach $1.2 billion.
“Currently, we are focused on implementing projects that meet the urgent needs of the population and the economy, said Oleksandr Kubrakov, Vice Prime Minister for Restoration of Ukraine – Minister for Communities, Territories and Infrastructure Development of Ukraine. “UNDP’s Energy Damage Assessment shows just how massive these needs are. We expect the international community will use this report to provide additional assistance."
The largest share of damage is in the power sector – close to US$6.5 billion – while damage to nuclear plants reached about US$770 million. With whole communities having faced weeks without power in below freezing temperatures over the recent winter, the assessment also highlights the need for urgent emergency planning for the 2023/2024 winter season, which it is estimated will cost approximately US$1 billion.
“Right now, the priority is to keep the lights on and the heat flowing. This will be a momentous task, as our new assessment shows that emergency repairs will cost at least $1.2 billion, with a key focus being to secure power supply for critical infrastructure in big cities and in war-affected areas damaged beyond recovery,” explained Jaco Cilliers, UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine.
“But we also cannot wait for the war to end before we start laying the groundwork for longer term recovery. This energy assessment provides critical data that can support Ukraine in its transition towards a greener, more sustainable and more resilient energy infrastructure,” he continued.
Overall, damage to the country’s energy infrastructure is estimated to be more than five times greater than in June 2022, according to preliminary estimates. As a continuation of the damage assessment, the next phase should estimate the loses and needs to build back better, including transitioning to green technology.
“The costs of repairing and restoring the energy sector continue to mount,” said World Bank Operations Manager for Eastern Europe Gevorg Sargsyan. “Recovery and reconstruction present an opportunity for Ukraine to achieve a more resilient and green energy future. This will require balancing the immediate need for fast provision of services with the importance of building back better. Careful planning will be needed to ensure thoughtful investments and to simplify processes to attract financing from a range of public and private sources.”

Title: UN Data to Support the Government of Ukraine in Facilitating Durable Solutions for Displaced People
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
04 April 2023
On 30-31 March, under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator’s office and in partnership with the UN Country Team, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) organized a “Data for Solutions in Ukraine” symposium.
Creating a common understanding and aligning the data efforts of the UN agencies and national and international actors with data and analytical needs of the Government is essential for paving the way for durable solutions, such as local integration or return. Research by IOM highlights that 58 per cent of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have been displaced for six months or longer, and 56 per cent have completely exhausted their savings. In the context of high cost of staying in displacement and pressing vulnerabilities, only 14 per cent of IDPs nationwide currently plan integrate in their locations, while the majority hope to return to their places of origin, when feasible.
“The wartime pressures have thoroughly tested the pre-existing internal displacement data systems,” said IOM’s Regional Director for South-Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Manfred Profazi, opening the symposium. “Differences in the data approaches by humanitarian and recovery actors and the Government of Ukraine are to be comprehensively discussed.”
According to the Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine, Oksana Zholnovych, the challenges brought by the war put many things upside down: “Internal and external displacement entails enormous complex changes at the individual and societal levels. Accordingly, social policies need to be adjusted to meet the actual needs of people, and data on real needs and clear stats will be key to reformatting the system.”
"After the full-scale invasion, many people faced difficult life circumstances. Many had to look for shelter in safer regions. Support from the state and international organizations is very important for them,” said Oleksii Borodai, Deputy Minister for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, Commissioner for IDPs. “Verified data will help in the development of clear operational response plans, both for integration of displaced people in their new communities and for their safe and sustainable returns."
“The numbers tell us people’s stories, drive our response and allow us to determine a qualitative change in people’s lives,” summarized Denise Brown, UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine. “Data will help us in getting people back home”.
The symposium served as a platform for discussion on how to harmonize IDP statistics and analysis for use as a baseline for interventions that aim to achieve durable solutions for IDPs in their communities. It further contributed to building a collective understanding of the priorities, interests and needs of the Government of Ukraine, the types of data needed to support durable solutions programming in the context of internal displacement in Ukraine and in adherence with global strategic discussions.

Title: Photo exhibit in Kyiv depicts the heroic efforts of deminers in conflict zones

Powerful images portray the risks and rewards of one of the world’s most dangerous jobs

Kyiv, 4 April 2023 – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in partnership with Ukraine's State Emergency Service, today launched a photo exhibition at the Golden Gate (Zoloti Vorota) metro station entitled "War Through the Eyes of Sappers of the State Emergency Service," marking the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action. The exhibition, which was made possible with the generous support of the European Union and the governments of Japan, Croatia, Denmark, France, and the United Kingdom, sheds light on the experiences of sappers who are risking their lives to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance in Ukraine.
As a result of 13 months of war, Ukraine has one of the world's largest areas of mine and unexploded ordnance contamination within its borders, with over 14 million Ukrainians at risk and about 30 percent of Ukraine's territory potentially contaminated – about four times the size of Switzerland.
Speaking at the launch event for the exhibition, United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Denise Brown said that “the UN is committed to reinforcing its own support to mine action in Ukraine, including through awareness-raising for communities and children, the provision of equipment, and through agricultural demining. Mines and other explosive remnants of war represent a continuous threat to every Ukrainian going about their daily life.”
UNDP Resident Representative Jaco Cilliers said it would take decades for Ukraine to be completely cleared of mines and other explosive remnants of war. "The estimated cost of reconstruction and recovery for Ukraine is a staggering US$411 billion. Of that, almost 10 percent, $37.6 billion, will be needed for demining," he said.
Thanking the governments of Canada, Croatia, Denmark, the EU, France, Japan, and the UK for their generous and ongoing support, Cilliers pointed out that the gap between contributions and the cost remains vast. "We urge the international community to sustain and scale up its support to Mine Action in Ukraine," he said. "This is a gargantuan challenge that requires a collaborative approach."
UNDP is the lead UN agency on mine action in Ukraine and is supporting the Government in managing the risks from explosive ordnance and debris removal, which includes providing specialist technical equipment and training to the State Emergency Services. The SES has cleared nearly 340,000 items of mine and unexploded ordnance since February 2022, spearheading emergency clearance efforts. National and international commercial companies and NGOs are also playing a crucial role in this effort.
Serhii Kruk, Head of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, said a significant proportion of Ukraine is contaminated with unexploded ordinance, posing a huge danger to the citizens. "Unexploded mines, specially set traps pose a huge danger to the civilian population," he said.  "That is why one of the priority tasks of restoring the life of the country is clearing all the objects of explosive ordnance away from critical and energy infrastructure. We need to restore safe life in the de-occupied territories, which will enable the development of the economy in the regions and in Ukraine as a whole."
The exhibition will remain open to the public until 20 April.

Title: UN in Ukraine prioritizes purchasing from Ukrainian businesses
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
28 March 2023
The United Nations in Ukraine, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, and the Kyiv Chamber of Commerce and Industry partnered to organize a Procurement and Vendor Fair in Kyiv today.
The objectives of the fair were to increase the awareness of Ukrainian businesses of the types of goods and services the UN will be procuring in 2023; explain how to apply to UN procurement processes; and discuss with representatives of the government and the private sector how some key legislative changes could increase market share of Ukrainian business in spending of international organizations.
The procurement and vendor fair gathered more than 300 representatives of Ukrainian businesses in person and 350 online. The UN system in Ukraine procured more than 510 million USD from Ukrainian businesses last year and expects even more in 2023. Key sectors for the UN include construction, food industry businesses, transport, and logistics and in particular the UN would like to increase vendors from regions around the country and businesses owned by women or persons with disabilities. The procurements of international organizations can also serve as a catalyst to the economic recovery and resilience of small and medium sized enterprises in Ukraine.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs systematically supports Ukrainian business. I am convinced that the goods and services that the UN procures to support Ukrainians should be purchased locally in Ukraine as much as possible. This support will stimulate the recovery of the national economy. At the same time, we aim to significantly increase the share of Ukrainian suppliers not only in local, but also in global UN procurement. Ukrainian business is competitive, meets international standards and can offer good quality goods and services at an affordable price”, said Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.
“The Ukrainian business community will continue to play a key role in the rebuilding of the country. Their investments and growth will help create the jobs that people need. The UN is reaching out through this fair to further our existing collaboration with the business community”, said Denise Brown, UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine.
“Today I am addressing our Ukrainian businesses, participants of the Fair. You have a unique opportunity to get first-hand information about the procurement system of UN agencies, programs and funds, to learn more about the requirements to successfully participate in the UN tenders, discuss other relevant topics of cooperation, and hold individual communications directly with representatives of the organization”, said the President of the Kyiv Chamber of Commerce and Industry Mykola Zasulskyi.
During the event the Ukrainian private sector was also informed about the UN Global Marketplace Platform through which the UN globally procures more than 30 billion USD of goods and services annually. It is a unique platform where all UN entities publish procurement offers. The platform is a "single window" to the procurement world of the UN, through which businesses can track tender announcements and submit proposals.
With its 24 agencies and almost 3,000 staff on the ground, the UN in Ukraine is committed to partnering with Ukraine's private sector in the humanitarian response and in the recovery and reconstruction process.

Title: UN Human Rights Ukraine released reports on treatment of prisoners of war and overall human rights situation in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 March 2023
Statement by the Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine Matilda Bogner, delivered at the launch of OHCHR’s 35th report on the human rights situation in Ukraine and a thematic report on the treatment of prisoners of war.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, I would like to welcome those present here and those joining us online.
As many of you will know, our job is to document violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. Today, we are launching two reports: one is on the treatment of prisoners of war and the other covers the overall human rights situation in Ukraine over a 6 month period up to 31 January 2023.
IMPACT OF HOSTILITIES ON THE CIVILIAN POPULATION
The war has come at a horrendous human cost. As of this week, we have documented that more than 8,000 civilians have been killed and almost 14,000 injured. More than 90 per cent were caused by missiles, explosive weapons or mines and explosive remnants of war. The actual figures are unfortunately considerably higher.
RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND SECURITY OF PERSONS
In occupied areas of Ukraine, we have documented summary executions and attacks on individual civilians by Russian armed forces and the pervasive use of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances.
Since 24 February 2022, we have documented 621 cases of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention of civilians by Russian armed forces. Among the 127 that we interviewed after their release, 90 per cent reported that members of the Russian security forces tortured and ill-treated them while in detention, in some cases including sexual violence. Five of these civilians were boys, between 14 and 17 years old, who had been forcibly disappeared by Russian armed forces and subjected to ill-treatment or torture.
Since 24 February 2022, we have documented 91 cases of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention committed by Ukrainian security forces. Of the 73 victims we interviewed, 53 per cent had been tortured or ill-treated by members of Ukrainian armed forces and law enforcement agencies.
The prohibitions of torture and arbitrary deprivation of life are absolute. All perpetrators must be held to account, and victims and their relatives must enjoy the rights to remedy and truth. In this regard, we welcome the recent adoption by the Parliament of Ukraine of a law amending the Criminal Code to align national legislation with the UN Convention against Torture.
The horrendous human cost of the war is also evident in the cases of conflict-related sexual violence, which we have documented since 24 February last year. By 31 January this year, we had recorded 133 victims – comprising of 85 men, 45 women and 3 girls. 109 cases are attributable to Russian armed forces, Russian law enforcement authorities and penitentiary staff, and 24 cases are attributable to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Ukrainian police, and Ukrainian civilians or members of territorial defence forces. Sexual violence frequently occurred when civilians or prisoners of war were detained, as well as in residential areas that were controlled by Russian armed forces.
We also documented transfers of civilians to areas in occupied territory or to the Russian Federation, some of which may amount to forced transfers or deportations. These transfers include children and adults who lived in social care institutions and unaccompanied children from parts of Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv and Odesa regions while they were occupied by the Russian Federation or temporarily controlled by Russian armed forces.
PRISONERS OF WAR
I will turn now to our report on the treatment of prisoners of war, during all stages of captivity – from initial capture, to transit and then places of internment.
Our team interviewed more than 400 prisoners of war, approximately 200 on each side. Ukraine provided us with unimpeded confidential access to official places of internment of Russian prisoners of war. The Russian Federation did not give us access. However, we were able to carry out confidential interviews with Ukrainian POWs upon their release.
I will start with Russian prisoners of war in the hands of Ukraine. We are deeply concerned about the summary execution of up to 25 Russian POWs and persons hors de combat by Ukrainian armed forces which we have documented. This was often perpetrated immediately upon capture on the battlefield. While we are aware of ongoing investigations by Ukrainian authorities into five cases involving 22 victims, we are not aware of any prosecutions of the perpetrators.
Almost half of the 229 Russian POWs who we interviewed spoke of being tortured or ill-treated by members of Ukrainian armed forces and the SBU, and to a lesser extent penitentiary staff. The majority of these cases occurred during the initial stages of apprehension and interrogation. POWs were beaten, shot in the legs, stabbed in their limbs, electrocuted, subjected to mock executions, threats of sexual violence or death. In permanent places of internment, such as pre-trial facilities, or the POW camp, reports of mistreatment were significantly less. We still received, however, complaints of beatings in some of these facilities in Dnipro, Vinnytsia and Kharkiv last spring.
Under international law, prisoners of war should not be held in closed confinement. While many remain in closed confinement in Ukraine, we welcome progress through the establishment of a POW camp in Lviv region in April 2022. We expect that the authorities are addressing complaints of humiliating and degrading treatment, which we received during our visit to the camp in December 2022. No camp has been established by the Russian Federation and POWs are regularly held in closed confinement.
In relation to the treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war, we are also deeply concerned by the summary execution of 15 Ukrainian prisoners of war shortly after being captured by Russian armed forces. The Wagner Group military and security contractors perpetrated 11 of these executions.
Of the 203 Ukrainian POWs that we interviewed, 67 per cent fell into the hands of Russian forces after their surrender was negotiated by commanders. In these cases, we saw better protection for them at the beginning of their captivity.
However, the majority of Ukrainian prisoners of war who were captured during battle were tortured or ill-treated before internment. Members of Russian armed forces and the Russian Security Service tortured and ill-treated them to extract military information, to intimidate or humiliate them, or as a form of retribution. Forms of torture included beating, electrocution, or in several cases, being shot or stabbed in the legs. Mock executions were also common. The report describes one case, where a POW died from injuries within hours after he was tortured.
Conditions for many Ukrainian prisoners of war were shocking.  A prisoner of war we spoke to told us – and I quote - “We were provided with just enough food to keep us alive”. Access to medical care was often insufficient, or unavailable, sometimes leading to dire consequences. The report documents that five of them died in internment reportedly due to the lack of medical attention.
The number of documented cases of torture and ill-treatment during internment in penitentiary facilities is shocking – more than 84 per cent endured such mistreatment. Penitentiary staff subjected prisoners of war to so-called ‘welcome beatings’ upon their arrival, beat and electrocuted them regularly during inspections in cells or while walking them around the facilities. Members of the Russian Federal Penitentiary Services (FSIN) and those in charge of many places of internment in Russian occupied territory systematically engaged in such practices against POWs. Former POWs told our colleagues that they dreaded weekly trips to the shower which inevitably ended in beatings and humiliation, often with sexual overtones. We documented that five POWs died from injuries sustained during torture in internment.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The cruelty and large-scale impact on civilians that we have seen over the last year will continue, unless both parties to the conflict ensure full compliance with international humanitarian law.
And when violations do occur, prompt action must be taken, first within the ranks of the army itself, and also through full and effective investigations and prosecutions of those responsible for the acts committed and those in command. The cases of summary executions, torture, ill-treatment, arbitrary detention and sexual violence must not be allowed to continue.
It is now over a year since the Russian Federation launched its armed attack against Ukraine, which has led to the violations that I have outlined today.
In the words of the High Commissioner, we appeal again “for respect for the sanctity of life, for human dignity, for respect for the principle of humanity”.
Thank you.

Title: Updated Ukraine Recovery and Reconstruction Needs Assessment
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 March 2023
Report looks at the Russian invasion’s toll after one full year
KYIV, — A new joint assessment released today by the Government of Ukraine, the World Bank Group, the European Commission, and the United Nations, estimates that the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine has grown to US $411 billion (equivalent of €383 billion). The estimate covers the one-year period from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, to the first anniversary of the war on February 24, 2023.  The cost of reconstruction and recovery is expected to stretch over 10 years and combines both needs for public and private funds.
This second Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA2) provides a comprehensive evaluation of war impacts across twenty different sectors. It quantifies the direct physical damage to infrastructure and buildings and describes the impact on people’s lives and livelihoods. The RDNA2 also includes the amounts needed for recovery and reconstruction. The RDNA2 estimates Ukraine will need $14 billion for critical and priority reconstruction and recovery investments in 2023.  Meeting these needs will require $11 billion in financing beyond what the government has already addressed in its 2023 budget, including $6 billion in unfunded budget needs and another $5 billion in financing to support state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and catalyze the private sector.
"Conducting the second Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment is an important element in Ukraine's reconstruction strategy. We are grateful to the World Bank for an up-to-date and thorough analysis, which will become an important tool for us and our partners in the implementation of recovery projects - recovery that has already begun. Energy infrastructure, housing, critical infrastructure, economy and humanitarian demining are our five priorities for this year. Part of the reconstruction work has already been done, and I am grateful to our partners from the EU, the USA, and the World Bank. The amount of damage and recovery needs currently does not include data on the loss of infrastructure, housing and businesses in the occupied territories. When the defense forces release them, we expect that the data will be supplemented, and the Government will immediately begin restoration work in these territories," said Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal.
Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement Olivér Várhelyi said: “Each day that goes by, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is taking a heavy toll for the citizens of Ukraine and the socio-economic fabric of the country. The EU is determined to continue supporting Ukraine, now a candidate country, with all its tools and instruments at its disposal for as long as it takes. The rapid needs assessment will help donors channel funds to the priority sectors on the ground. The EU is fully focused on ensuring fast recovery and ensure basic services for the population, namely energy, education and health infrastructure and housing”.
The RDNA2 assessment finds the total estimated reconstruction and recovery needs to be US$411 billion, 2.6 times the country’s estimated 2022 GDP. The needs – estimated for the next decade – consider inflation, market conditions, surge pricing in areas of mass construction, higher insurance premiums, and a shift in the future towards lower energy intensity and more resilient, inclusive, and modern design. The highest estimated needs are in transport (22 percent), housing (17 percent), energy (11 percent), social protection and livelihoods (10 percent), explosive hazard management (9 percent), and agriculture (7 percent). The largest proportionate increase in damages was in energy, where damage was more than five times greater than in June 2022. The geographic areas with the greatest increase in needs are frontline regions of the war: Donetska, Kharkivska, Luhanska, and Khersonska.
“Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction will take several years but the good news is that the country’s resilience and determination as well as partner support during the invasion is containing damages and reducing the needs,” said World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia Anna Bjerde. “Continued support for Ukraine is an investment in both the country and the global economy. Development partner support for public investment needs to be complemented by significant private investment to increase the available financing for reconstruction.”
Denise Brown, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Ukraine said: “Behind every home or hospital, or school destroyed, a Ukrainian life is affected. Loss of a life, lack of access to proper health care for pregnant women and the elderly or a child who is not able to go to school. While the psychological trauma is incalculable, the RDNA2 is just the beginning of the estimation of loss. But somethings can't be rebuilt.”
The estimates from both Rapid Damage and Needs Assessments issued to date should be considered as minimums as needs will continue to rise as long as the war continues. But the damages since the release of RDNA1 have not escalated as much as could have been expected due to several factors. First, the most intense conflict has remained constrained to areas that already faced significant damage.  Also, some of the country’s needs have been met by the Government of Ukraine with the support of its partners. For example, in the health sector over 500 affected health care facilities have been partially or fully repaired; the energy and transport sectors have benefited from the provision of equipment, materials and financing to make rapid repairs. In addition, the ability to keep the government functioning and essential services flowing, which has helped to limit the escalation of recovery and reconstruction costs.
The report finds direct damages to buildings and infrastructure comes to more than US$135 billion   across the following most affected areas: housing (37 percent), transport (26 percent), energy (8 percent), commerce and industry (8 percent), and agriculture (6 percent). Energy, housing and transport sectors have seen the greatest increase in direct damages, since the RDNA1 estimates. Agricultural damage is also significantly higher, reflecting both increased asset destruction and more precise data.
The RDNA2 also focuses on the human impact of the war and how the loss of lives, livelihoods, incomes, and assets has pushed 7.1 million people into poverty and reversed 15 years of development progress. The report also highlights that the impacts of the war have exacerbated inequalities and in particular affected women, children and people with disabilities and resulted in dramatic setbacks in the Sustainable Development Goals, especially those related to poverty, health, education, economic growth, energy, peace and justice.
This report benefited from the generous financial support of the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), the Swiss Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), and Digital Development Partnership (DDP).

18 March 2023
//
The Black Sea Grain Initiative, signed in Istanbul on 22 July 2022, has been extended. The Initiative allows for the facilitation of the safe navigation for the exports of grain and related foodstuffs and fertilizers, including ammonia, from designated Ukrainian seaports. During the first two terms, some 25 million metric tonnes of grain and foodstuffs have been moved to 45 countries, helping to bring down global food prices and stabilizing the markets.
We express our gratitude to the Government of Türkiye for the diplomatic and operational support to the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative, alongside the Memorandum of Understanding on promoting Russian food products and fertilizers to the world markets, are critical for global food security, especially for developing countries.
We remain strongly committed to both agreements and we urge all sides to redouble their efforts to implement them fully.

Title: WAR CRIMES, INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS ON INFRASTRUCTURE, SYSTEMATIC AND WIDESPREAD TORTURE SHOW DISREGARD FOR CIVILIANS, SAYS UN COMMISSION OF INQUIRY ON UKRAINE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
16 March 2023
GENEVA/ VIENNA (16 March 2023) – Russian authorities have committed a wide range of violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law in various regions of Ukraine, many of which amount to war crimes, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine said in a new report Thursday.
The war crimes include attacks on civilians and energy-related infrastructure, wilful killings, unlawful confinement, torture, rape and other sexual violence, as well as unlawful transfers and deportations of children.
The Commission’s evidence shows that in areas that came under their control,
Russian authorities have committed wilful killings of civilians or persons not involved in fighting (hors de combat), which are war crimes and violations of the right to life.
Russian armed forces have carried out attacks with explosive weapons in populated areas with an apparent disregard for civilian harm and suffering, failing to take the required precautions. The attacks were indiscriminate and disproportionate, in violation of international humanitarian law. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas has been one of the main causes of civilian casualties. The Commission was struck by the extent of the destruction it has observed during its visits.
The waves of attacks by Russian armed forces on Ukraine’s energy-related infrastructure from 10 October 2022, may amount to crimes against humanity, according to the Commission, which said that this should be investigated further. The disruption of energy-related infrastructure led to entire regions and millions of people being left for periods without electricity or heating, particularly during freezing temperatures.
The Commission established a pattern of widespread unlawful confinement in areas controlled by Russian armed forces, targeting broad categories of men, women and children. Confinement in dedicated facilities across Ukraine and in the Russian Federation was accompanied by consistent methods of torture against certain categories of persons by Russian authorities. A former detainee underwent beatings as a “punishment for speaking Ukrainian” and for “not remembering the lyrics of the anthem of the Russian Federation”. This pattern of torture may amount to crimes against humanity, according to the Commission, and should be investigated further.
The Commission found numerous instances of rape and sexual and gender-based violence committed by Russian authorities as they undertook house-to-house visits in localities that came under their control and during unlawful confinement. Sexual violence amounting to torture and the threat of such against women and men have been important aspects of the torture exercised by Russian authorities.
While looking into transfers of children from Ukraine to the Russian Federation, the Commission found, with concern, that violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed. Situations concerning the transfer and deportation of children which it has examined amount to war crimes. Witnesses told the Commission that many of the younger children transferred were not able to establish contact with their families and might lose contact with them indefinitely. Delay in the repatriation of civilians may also amount to a war crime.
The Commission also documented a small number of violations committed by Ukrainian armed forces, including likely indiscriminate attacks and two incidents qualifying as war crimes, where Russian prisoners of war were shot, wounded and tortured.
Beyond sharing their deep loss and trauma with the Commission, survivors highlighted the importance of identifying those responsible and holding them accountable. One man, whose father was executed by Russian armed forces in the Izium region, told the Commission: “They punished innocent people; now those who are guilty, if they are still alive, need to be punished to the fullest extent.”
The Commission recommends that all violations and crimes be investigated and those responsible be held accountable, either at the national or the international level. It calls for a comprehensive approach to accountability that includes both criminal responsibility and the victims’ right to truth, reparation, and non-repetition.
For the report, the Commission visited 56 localities and interviewed 348 women and 247 men. Its investigators inspected sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture, as well as weapon remnants, and consulted a large number of documents and reports.

Title: NOTE TO CORRESPONDENTS - on humanitarian convoy for Chasiv Yar
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
10 March 2023
//
At around 10 a.m. local time, three trucks with United Nations humanitarian supplies off-loaded their vital cargo in Chasiv Yar, about 10 km from Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, with assistance for some 2,000 people in acute need.
The UN convoy will return to Dnipro today.
The convoy brought medical supplies for the remaining population in Chasiv Yar for three months, hygiene supplies for 2,000 people, food rations for 750 people for one month, and solar lamps and tarpaulins for around 750 people.
The items were provided by the International Organization for Migration, UNICEF, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the World Food Programme and WHO.
Most of the 16,000 people who used to live in Chasiv Yar and surrounding communities have fled the area. Chasiv Yar was completely cut off from gas supplies more than a month ago and all water has been trucked in. Electricity is extremely limited and the only ambulatory still functioning has limited capacity due to pervasive insecurity.
The UN and our humanitarian partners, together with local groups, are committed to support people in Chasiv Yar, which also hosts people who fled Bakhumt recently. Less than a month ago, we sent another inter-agency convoy to Sloviansk with supplies to people in Soledar, Chasiv Yar and Toretsk. We have been there on many other occasions before that.
So far in 2023, the UN and our partners have sent 26 inter-agency convoys to communities living close to the front line, supporting nearly 230,000 people. More than 10 of them reached communities in areas controlled by Ukraine in the Donetsk region, providing much-need items to approximately 100,000 people.
The UN and our partners will continue to make every effort to help civilians caught up in the horrors of the war in Ukraine.

Mr. President, I want to thank you and the Ukrainian people for welcoming me once again in such difficult circumstances.
This is my third visit to Ukraine in less than a year.
My third visit to show our full commitment and to seek solutions.
The position of the United Nations, which I have consistently expressed, is crystal clear: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of the UN Charter and international law.
The sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine must be upheld, within its internationally recognized borders.

Our ultimate objective is equally clear: a just peace based on the UN Charter, international law and the recent General Assembly resolution marking one year since the start of the war.
Until that just peace can be secured, we continue working hard to mitigate the impacts of the conflict which has caused enormous suffering for the Ukrainian people – with profound global implications.
The United Nations has stayed on the ground delivering desperately needed humanitarian aid to millions here in Ukraine.
I want to express my deep solidarity with all the victims of the war.
To those who have lost their lives and to their loved ones.
To those who have seen their hopes dashed or had to flee in search of survival.
They are all owed effective accountability.
The United Nations also worked to help evacuate civilians trapped in the Azovstal steel plant.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has been fully mobilized to try and preserve the safety and security of nuclear power plants in Ukraine, including in Zaporizhzhia.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative, agreed last July in Istanbul, has provided for the export of 23 million tons of grain from Ukrainian ports.
It contributed to lowering the global cost of food and has offered critical relief to people, who are also paying a high price for this war, particularly in the developing world.
Indeed, the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Food Price Index has fallen by almost 20 percent over the last year.
Exports of Ukrainian -- as well as Russian -- food and fertilizers are essential to global food security and food prices.
I want to underscore the critical importance of the rollover of the Black Sea Grain Initiative on 18 March and of working to create the conditions to enable the greatest possible use of export infrastructures through the Black Sea, in line with the objectives of the initiative.
Safety and security around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is also vital.
I believe that a possible mediation to seek the full demilitarization of the area, while ensuring that the plant can return to normal operations, would also be important.
The United Nations stands ready to offer its good offices.
At the same time, we will continue to support solutions for humanitarian problems wherever possible on every front – such as a meaningful expansion of the current exchange of prisoners of war until it is completed.
The recent shocking images of a Ukrainian soldier apparently being summarily killed is yet another tragic reminder that the laws of war must be strictly respected.
We must pursue all of these objectives, recognizing that each one of them has value in itself.
Mr. President, thank you once again for your welcome.
I can assure you that we will continue to seek solutions and a just peace for the people of Ukraine and the world.
Thank you.

Title: UN Women Ukraine and the Ukrainian Institute named winners of Women in Arts. The Resistance
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 March 2023
For the fourth year in a row, UN Women Ukraine and the Ukrainian Institute presented the Women in Arts. The Resistance award to highlight the achievements of women working in culture and the arts and celebrate their contribution to victory. The winners were announced on March 7, on the eve of International Women's Day. During the ceremony, the premiere of the women's manifesto "You are a great power", created in cooperation with the music channel MEGOGO LIVE, took place.
"The fire doesn't burn the stubborn" – is the motto of this year's Women in Arts. The Resistance Award, which covered the two previous years. In 2022, the ceremony did not take place due to the full-scale invasion, so the Women in Arts Award 2023 took on a new meaning, embedded in the name "The Resistance" and in the elements of the visual identity of the award. The winners of the Award in the respective categories became:
• Women in Visual Arts –– Alevtyna Kakhidze
• Women in Music –– Alla Zahaikevych
• Women in Theatre –– Nina Zakhozhenko
• Women in Film –– Alina Horlova
• Women in Literature –– Halyna Kruk
• Women in Cultural Management –– Yuliia Vahanova
• Women in Cultural Journalism, Criticism and Research –– Anastasia Platonova
• Special mention –– Yuliia “Cuba” Sidorova
"It is very important that despite the difficult time of a full-scale war, the Women in Arts award honors Ukrainian artists and cultural figures. Russia is waging a genocidal war and trying to erase Ukrainian culture and identity as such, which is why their preservation and development are so important. Award nominees and laureates play a key role here. The award also contributes to the strengthening of Ukraine's human potential, which will be of critical importance in post-war reconstruction," said Dmytro Kuleba, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and Chairperson of the Award`s Supervisory Board.
More than 49 independent experts in the respective fields were involved in the process of selecting nominees and winners. The organization of the award is based on the regulations, which outlines the stages and selection criteria, including actual achievements, national and/or international recognition, creative method, as well as contribution to victory. The list of the expert council and the jury can be found at the following link: https://heforsheukraine.info/artsweek2023/
“In times of uncertainty, culture plays an important role. It brings people together, strengthens society, and paves the way for the country’s future. In the past years, the Women in Arts Award has become the platform to present diverse talents and showcase the achievements of Ukrainian female artists. This year's Award is even more special to us. It honors two years of cultural achievement and celebrates Ukrainian women’s contributions to resistance and recovery. It’s our way to celebrate Ukrainian women's exceptional dignity, courage, resilience, and talent,” emphasized Sabine Freizer, Representative of UN Women Ukraine.
Every year the modern Ukrainian artist and sculptor Maria Kulikovska create statuettes, especially for the Women in Arts Award. The form of the statuette is the hands of a woman, which are intertwined. According to the artist, women's hands symbolize support and protection, as well as women's work. The artist's hands are the basis for the sculpture.
The premiere of the Women's Manifesto "You Are a Great Power" created by the MEGOGO LIVE channel team took place during the award ceremony. This is an author's song and video, which became a kind of soundtrack to the Women in Arts. The Resistance Award. The song "You Are a Great Power" was performed by singers Sasha Koltsova ("Krykhitka"), Maryna Krut`, ROXOLANA, and Olena Karas ("Tonka"), who also wrote the music. The nominees of this year's Award also starred in the video: Alevtyna Kakhidze, Albina Yaloza, Victoria Amelina, Halyna Kruk, Lizaveta Herman, Lyubov Yakymchuk, Nina Zahozhenko, and Oksana Cherkashyna. The purpose of the manifesto is to emphasize the strength and contribution of Ukrainian women to culture, in particular, during the full-scale invasion. The video can be viewed on the MEGOGO LIVE YouTube channel.
Women in Arts is an independent award founded in 2019 by the Ukrainian Institute and UN Women Ukraine as part of the HeForShe solidarity movement for gender equality. The purpose of the award is to draw attention to the achievements of women working in the fields of culture and art.

Title: Kharkiv Dairy Plant continues to produce dairy products thanks to generator received from Government of Germany
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
28 February 2023
Kharkiv Dairy Plant LLC, TM Agromol received a 1100 kVA generator (800 kW), provided by the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) with the financial support of the German Foreign Ministry. It is one of the 41 generators that Germany has transferred to support Ukrainian food producers.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has supported to identify suitable recipients and distribute the generators among those producers that need assistance the most.
"We continue to actively support Ukrainian food producers by providing powerful generators, ensuring stable energy supply to essential facilities. This is critically important, especially for enterprises that are located on the front line and that support food security in the most vulnerable oblasts of the country," said Pierre Vauthier, head of the FAO office in Ukraine.
Kharkiv Dairy Plant LLC was founded in 1973 and has come a long way from the production of bottled products to dairy and fermented milk products. Since 2019, the plant has been operating under the new brand name Agromol.
"Before the war, the plant sold up to 100 tonnes of products per day, but now the volume has decreased, though we are actively working to reach the pre-war levels," said Oleh Denysov, Deputy Director of Kharkiv Dairy Plant LLC, TM Agromol. "We used to supply our products to the central oblasts of Ukraine, in particular to Zaporizka, Dnipropetrovska, Zhytomyrska oblasts, but now we distribute products exclusively to Kharkivska oblast."
Today, the plant is one of the largest enterprises in Kharkiv. The product range includes more than 100 types of dairy products – milk, kefir, sour cream, as well as dessert products, such as kefir with fruit fillings, sour cream sauces, etc.
As a result of the shellings, the factory sustained some damages, notably to its ceiling and windows. Due to the hostilities, there are constant power outages in the region, which significantly affect operations. Moreover, the substation that supplies power to the plant has been completely destroyed.
"Milk is a perishable product. When there is no electricity, the production stops, and then the product can only be disposed of due to the irreversible processes," added Oleh Denysov. "Thanks to FAO, we have received this powerful generator, which will ensure a stable supply of energy to the plant for as long as it is necessary, when there is no centralized power supply."
With the support of the Government of Germany, so far, 17 generators from 41 have been distributed among food producers in nine most war-affected oblasts of Ukraine to support bread and milk production.

Title: UN Secretary-General's remarks to the 52nd session of the Human Rights Council
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
27 February 2023
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted 75 years ago.
The Declaration described, for the first time, entitlements that apply to everyone, everywhere, always.  

The most translated document in the world, its English version is just 1300 words long.  

But all human life is there.   

The Universal Declaration sets out the rights to life, liberty and security; to equality before the law; to freedom of expression; to seek asylum; to work, to healthcare and education, and more.    

But as we mark its 75th anniversary, the Universal Declaration is under assault from all sides.  

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered the most massive violations of human rights we are living today.  
 
It has unleashed widespread death, destruction and displacement. 
 
Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have caused many casualties and terrible suffering. 
 
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has documented dozens of cases of conflict-related sexual violence against men, women and girls. 
 
And serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law against prisoners of war – and hundreds of cases of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions of civilians – were also documented. 
 
Excellencies,  
 
Unfortunately, the Universal Declaration of Human rights, which should be our common blueprint, is too often misused and abused.  
 
It is exploited for political gain; and it is ignored – often by the very same people.  
 
Some governments chip away at it. Others use a wrecking ball.  
 
And today’s public disregard and private disdain for human rights are a wake-up call.  
 
This is a moment to stand on the right side of history.  
 
A moment to stand up for the human rights of everyone, everywhere.  
We must revitalize the Universal Declaration and ensure its full implementation to face the new challenges of today and tomorrow.  
 
My Call to Action for Human Rights, launched three years ago in this chamber, is the blueprint.  
 
Human rights are not a luxury that can be left until we find a solution to the world’s other problems.  
 
They are the solution to many of the world’s other problems. 
 
From the climate emergency to the misuse of technology, the answers to today’s crises are found in human rights.  
 
Human rights are innate to being human.  
 
The Hindu Vedas, the Ancient Chinese Analects of Confucius, the Bible and the Koran all set out very similar duties and rights.  
 
The Declaration on the Rights of Man and the Citizen, a cornerstone of the French Revolution in 1789, set out rights to liberty, property, to freedom of speech, the press and religion.  
 
But these rights extended exclusively to men who were citizens – not to women, slaves, or minorities. When a French women’s rights activist published a parody of the men-only revolution, she was tried and executed for treason.  
 
Less than ninety years [later], in 1875, my maternal grandfather was born.  
 
He was an important role model and an inspiration throughout my life --a man who told me so much about his experiences that they became part of my own memories.  
 
When he was born, the colonial project, based on massive human rights violations, was flourishing across Africa, Asia and the Americas.   
 
Slavery – the utter denial of human rights – had recently been abolished in the United States – but would continue elsewhere and in other forms for many years.  
 
Women everywhere were subjugated by men.  
 
Although my grandfather’s life began in an era of human rights horrors, we saw incredible progress.  
 
Slavery was formally abolished; most colonies won independence; women secured the right to vote. There was widespread recognition of civil and political rights, including to free speech and association.  
 
At the start of the twentieth century, the harmful impact of industrialization brought attention to social and economic rights.   
 
Civil society and the Trade Union movement led the fight for the rights to education, healthcare, social security and decent working conditions for everybody.  
 
Half a century later, from the carnage of two world wars and the appalling crimes of the Holocaust, a transformative moment saw the birth of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
 
The Universal Declaration sets out the rights inherent to all people for all time – an unparalleled achievement.  
 
And thanks to the efforts of the Indian women’s rights activist, Hansa Mehta, the equal rights of women and men were explicit from the start: “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” 
 
My grandfather’s generation benefited from a century of progress on human rights that went hand-in-hand with remarkable leaps in human development.  
 
In 1900, some 80 percent of people around the world lived in poverty. That figure had fallen to less than 10 percent by 2015.  
 
The average person lived 32 years. Today, it’s more than 70.  
 
Seven out of every ten people were illiterate. Now it’s less than two. 
 
Instead of continuing this progress, we have now gone into reverse.  
 
Extreme poverty and hunger are rising for the first time in decades.  
 
Nearly half of the world’s population, 3.5 billion people, live in climate hotspots. These vast areas are fast becoming human rights disaster zones where floods, droughts and storms mean people are 15 times more likely to die of climate impacts.   
 
A record one hundred million people have been forced to flee by violence, conflict and human rights violations.  
 
Just yesterday, yet another horrific shipwreck in the Mediterranean claimed the lives of scores of people seeking a better future for themselves and their children.  
 
Refugee and migrant rights are human rights.  
 
They must be respected without discrimination.  
 
While criminal gangs control migration routes, people will continue to perish. We need safe, orderly, legal routes for migrants and refugees.  
 
And we must do everything possible to prevent the loss of life by providing search and rescue and medical care – as a humanitarian imperative, and as a moral and legal obligation.  
 
Every day brings new evidence of human rights violations, from summary executions and torture to enforced disappearance and sexual violence.     
 
Around the world, antisemitism, anti-Muslim bigotry, the persecution of Christians, racism and white supremacist ideology are on the march.   
 
Religious, linguistic and ethnic minorities, LGBTQI+, and other minority communities are targeted for harassment and hatred.  
 
Women’s sexual and reproductive rights are denied; and gender-based discrimination and violence are rampant.  
 
Freedom of expression is in freefall and the number of media workers killed around the world last year rose by a horrific 50 percent.  
 
Inequalities of all kinds are dividing societies ever more deeply.  
 
Social cohesion and trust are draining away through the yawning gap between the haves and have-nots.  
 
The pandemic left us with a pandemic of abuses of civil and political rights.  
 
And it laid bare routine violations of economic and social rights, including the exploitation of women’s unpaid care work.   
 
Looking forward gives rise to even greater alarm.   
 
Unless humanity kicks its addiction to fossil fuels now, critical climate tipping points will crush the human rights of generations to come.   
 
The misuse of new technologies could threaten human rights on a scale we can’t even imagine.   
 
Future generations could inherit a world with no protection from misinformation, disinformation and lies.   
 
A divided world of winner takes all.  
 
We must heed the lessons of history.  
 
As flashpoints multiply and deadly new risks loom, we must fight for our rights.   
 
We must protect and promote the global consensus around the Universal Declaration and move forward into a new era of human rights for all.   
 
This requires both a laser focus on the rights we have already recognized – and a quantum leap towards a new generation of rights.  
 
The report on Our Common Agenda sets out a vision for the future with people and their rights at the centre.  
 
A new social contract to rebuild trust and social cohesion.  
 
A New Global Deal to heal divisions and give developing countries a greater voice in decision-making.   
 
And a New Agenda for Peace, based on a holistic vision of the peace continuum from prevention to mediation, peacekeeping and peacebuilding.  
 
The Call to Action for Human Rights sets out seven areas for urgent attention: rights at the core of sustainable development; rights in times of crisis; gender equality; civic space; future generations; collective action; and new frontiers.  
 
We at the United Nations are changing the way we work, recognizing that human rights are central to everything we do.  
 
We are prioritizing the connections between human rights and the prevention of conflicts and crises of all kinds.  
 
In July this year, the High Commissioner and I will launch a new Agenda for Protection.  
 
This important initiative will seek to strengthen support from across the United Nations system to Member States to protect people and their rights, both in times of peace and in times of crisis and conflict.
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
I have had the privilege of working with three High Commissioners – Zeid bin Ra’ad al Hussein of Jordan, Michelle Bachelet of Chile, and now Volker Türk of Austria. All are outstanding leaders and advocates.
They delivered on the requests from this Council, and they also published more than 170 important country and thematic reports in their own right over the past six years.
These reports cover climate change in the Sahel, migration in Europe and the Americas, and human rights concerns in different contexts, including Afghanistan, Chile, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Libya, the Sahel, Ukraine, and Xinjiang, to name just a few.
This Council, your various mechanisms including the Universal Periodic Review, the Special Procedures and the Treaty Monitoring Bodies, and the Office of the High Commissioner, are central to creating momentum for progress.
This institution stands for the efforts of brave human rights defenders who risk persecution, detention and even death as they carry out their vital work.
Your fact-finding missions, Commissions of Inquiry and independent experts are essential to justice and accountability.
The International Court of Justice occupies a unique role in international justice and accountability.
The International Criminal Court is the central institution of the international criminal justice system; embodying an aspiration for accountability for the most serious crimes.
I welcome moves towards accountability for human rights abuses at the national and regional levels, including those committed by the private sector.
Legal challenges against climate-wrecking corporations are an important step forward.
Fossil fuel producers and their financiers must understand one simple truth: pursuing mega-profits when so many people are losing their lives and rights, now and in the future, is totally unacceptable.
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
As we celebrate the impact of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, our worst enemy is complacency.
Because the story of human rights is only half-told.
We must continue to make human rights real in the lives of people everywhere.
We must take inspiration from the liberation and protest movements that achieved enormous progress over the past century – the abolition of slavery, decolonization, universal suffrage, the women’s movement and the end of apartheid.
Civil society, human rights defenders, people with disabilities, women and girls and young people around the world are already on the streets, demanding protection for all human rights, for everyone.
I stand with them. We must all stand with them.
Thank you.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL - REMARKS TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL ON UKRAINE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 February 2023
New York, 24 February 2023
Mr. President, Excellencies,
The purposes and principles embedded in the United Nations Charter are not a matter of convenience.
They are not merely words on paper.
They are at the core of who we are.
They reflect the driving mission of our United Nations.
And they exist precisely to address any grievance – whatever it may be.
One year ago, I sat in this Council and urged:
“In the name of humanity do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century, with consequences not only devastating for Ukraine, not only tragic for the Russian Federation, but with an impact we cannot even foresee in relation to the consequences for the global economy.”
I said then that we must give peace a chance.
But peace has had no chance.
War has ruled the day.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and international law.
It has unleashed widespread death, destruction and displacement.
Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have caused many casualties and terrible suffering.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has documented dozens of cases of conflict-related sexual violence against men, women and girls.
Serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law against prisoners of war – and hundreds of cases of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions of civilians – were also documented.

Mr. President,
Life is a living hell for the people of Ukraine.
An estimated 17.6 million people — nearly 40 per cent of the population of Ukraine — require humanitarian assistance and protection.
The crisis has erased 30 per cent of pre-war jobs.
The World Food Programme estimates that nearly 40 per cent of Ukrainians are unable to afford or access enough food.
The war has sparked a displacement crisis not seen in Europe in decades.
More than 8 million Ukrainian refugees have been recorded across Europe, in addition to an estimated 5.4 million people who have been internally displaced.
More than half of all Ukrainian children have been forced from their homes – with unaccompanied and separated children facing grave risks of violence, abuse, and exploitation.
Vital infrastructure is under fire – water, energy and heating systems have been destroyed in the depths of a freezing winter.
The World Health Organization has verified over 700 attacks on health care facilities.
More than 3,000 schools and colleges have been damaged or destroyed. Millions of students have had their education severely disrupted.
Less measurable — but no less important — is the devastating impact of months of displacement and bombardment on the mental health of Ukrainians.
Nearly 10 million people, including 7.8 million children, are at risk of acute post-traumatic stress disorder.
And make no mistake, the Russian Federation is also suffering the deadly consequences.

Mr. President,
We need peace — peace in line with the UN Charter and international law.
As we work for peace, we will continue calling for action on many fronts.
Protection of civilians must remain the top priority. Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure must stop.
The use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas – in towns, cities and villages – must end.
Safe and unimpeded humanitarian access for life-saving assistance must be ensured.
We must also invest in Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction.
At the request of the Ukrainian Government and on behalf of the UN system, the United Nations Development Programme is co-leading an assessment of damage to energy infrastructure, jointly with the World Bank.

Mr. President,
Since the start of the war, the International Atomic Energy Agency has supported Ukraine to ensure the safety and security of its 15 operating reactors at four nuclear plants, including Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia.
We continue to urge all parties to swiftly agree and implement a nuclear safety and security protection zone at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to avoid a serious accident with potentially disastrous consequences.
Veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in the context of the conflict have spiked nuclear risks to levels not seen since the darkest days of the Cold War.
These threats are unacceptable.

Mr. President,
Progress continues to be made under the Black Sea Grain Initiative, an agreement brokered with the parties by the United Nations and the government of Türkiye.
More than 20 million metric tons of foodstuffs have now been safely reconnected to global supply chains on more than 700 ships, helping to bring down prices around the world.
I want to underscore the importance of all parties remaining engaged in this initiative, and reiterate our call for it to be extended beyond March 2023.
The United Nations is firmly committed to working to remove remaining obstacles to Russian food and fertilizer exports, including ammonia.
These exports are essential to our broader efforts to bring down prices and ease food insecurity around the globe.
Both efforts demonstrate that international cooperation is essential, valuable and possible -- even in the midst of conflict.

Mr. President,
Over the past year, this Council has held more than forty debates on Ukraine.
The guns are talking now, but in the end we all know that the path of diplomacy and accountability is the road to a just and sustainable peace.
Peace in line with the UN Charter and international law, and yesterday’s resolution of the General Assembly.
We must prevent further escalation.
We must all encourage every meaningful effort to end the bloodshed and, at long last, give peace a chance.
Thank you.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  --  REMARKS TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSION ON UKRAINE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 February 2023
New York, 22 February 2023
[as delivered]
Mr. President,
The one-year mark of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine stands as a grim milestone – for the people of Ukraine and for the international community.
That invasion is an affront to our collective conscience.
It is a violation of the United Nations Charter and international law.
It is having dramatic humanitarian and human rights consequences.
And the impact is being felt far beyond Ukraine.
As I said from day one, Russia’s attack on Ukraine challenges the cornerstone principles and values of our multilateral system.
The UN Charter is unambiguous:
“All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”
Mr. President,
The General Assembly has addressed, in the clearest terms, the attempt by the Russian Federation to illegally annex four regions of Ukraine – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk.
In doing so, the Assembly reaffirmed the longstanding principles of international law contained in its landmark Friendly Relations Declaration of 1970.
Namely, that “the territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force”, and that “no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”.
The position of the United Nations is unequivocal:
We are committed to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders.
Mr. President,
The United Nations has stayed on the ground working with humanitarian partners.
Fully 40 per cent of Ukrainians are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Vital infrastructure has been targeted – water, energy and heating systems have been destroyed in the dead of winter.
UN agencies have also been cooperating with host countries that received more than 8 million Ukrainians – the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War.
Last week, the UN launched a $5.6 billion humanitarian appeal for the people of Ukraine.  I urge your full support.
I have visited Ukraine twice since the start of the war where I heard testimonies of severe violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws.
In this conflict as elsewhere, the United Nations is committed to ensuring justice and accountability.
Mr. President,
Even amidst the brutality of war, we have worked in concerted and creative ways to forge solutions.
In Mariupol, the United Nations helped evacuate civilians trapped in the Azovstal steel plant.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative has shown the possibility of Ukraine and Russia to advance global food security – with the support of government of Türkiye and the United Nations.
Despite ongoing challenges, the initiative to ship grain and other food stuffs from Ukraine is making a difference.
We are working hard to remove all the remaining obstacles to the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Secretariat of the United Nations and the Russian Federation to facilitate exports of Russian food and fertilizers to global markets.
This is also an important contribution to address global food insecurity.
We will continue to support these initiatives, for the benefit of millions of people across the world, especially in the Global South.
Notwithstanding deep mistrust, the parties to the conflict have also worked out regular exchanges of prisoners of war, facilitated by regional actors.
These efforts can and must continue, and expand as much as possible.
Mr. President,
Over the past year, not only have we seen suffering and devastation grow, it is also becoming more evident just how much worse it could all still become.
The possible consequences of a spiraling conflict are a clear and present danger.
Every day, we are reminded of the grave threat that haunts us all when irresponsible military activity continues around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant – the largest nuclear facility in Europe.
I commend the International Atomic Energy Agency for engaging the sides to ensure that the area remains safe.
The security and safety of all Ukrainian nuclear power plants must be guaranteed.
The war is also fanning regional instability and fueling global tensions and divisions, while diverting attention and resources from other crises and pressing global issues.
Meanwhile, we have heard implicit threats to use nuclear weapons.
The so-called tactical use of nuclear weapons is utterly unacceptable.
It is high time to step back from the brink.
Complacency will only deepen the crisis, while further eroding our shared principles proclaimed in the Charter.
Mr. President,
War is not the solution.  War is the problem.
People in Ukraine are suffering enormously.
Ukrainians, Russians and people far beyond need peace.
While prospects may look bleak today, we must all work knowing that genuine, lasting peace must be based on the UN Charter and international law.
The longer the fighting continues, the more difficult this work will be.
We don’t have a moment to lose.
Thank you.

Title: Türk deplores human cost of Russia’s war against Ukraine as verified civilian casualties for last year pass 21,000
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
21 February 2023
GENEVA (21 February 2023) – UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk today deplored the human cost of the war in Ukraine that has left at least 8,006 civilians dead and 13,287 injured over the past 12 months, in addition to the numerous lives previously lost in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
“These numbers, which we are publishing today, lay bare the loss and suffering inflicted on people since Russia’s armed attack began on 24 February last year; suffering I saw for myself first hand when I visited Ukraine in December. And our data are only the tip of the iceberg. The toll on civilians is unbearable. Amid electricity and water shortages during the cold winter months, nearly 18 million people are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. Some 14 million people have been displaced from their homes,” Türk said.
“The very young to the very old have all been affected. Students have seen their education halted or disrupted by attacks on educational facilities, while older people and people with disabilities have faced immense challenges, in some cases unable to reach bomb shelters or having to spend prolonged periods in basements in conditions affecting their health,” the UN Human Rights Chief said. Most of those remaining in conflict-affected areas are older people, who are often reluctant or unable to leave dangerous areas.
“Every day that violations of international human rights and humanitarian law continue, it becomes harder and harder to find a way forward through mounting suffering and destruction, towards peace,” Türk stressed.
According to the UN Human Rights Office’s monitoring mission in Ukraine, of the adult civilian casualties whose sex was known, men accounted for 61.1 per cent of civilian casualties and women for 39.9 per cent. At least 487 children were killed and 954 injured.
Some 90.3 per cent of civilian casualties were caused by explosive weapons with wide area effects, including artillery shells, cruise and ballistic missiles, and air strikes. Most occurred in populated areas. The Office has also recorded 632 civilian casualties – 219 killed and 413 injured – caused by mines and explosive remnants of war.
The Office’s presence on the ground, which has been monitoring civilian casualties in Ukraine since 2014, has stressed that the actual figures are likely substantially higher, as its numbers only reflect verified individual cases.
The monitoring mission has received information regarding 21 civilian casualties – six killed and 15 injured – in the territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, occupied by the Russian Federation. Many reports of civilian casualties are still pending corroboration in other occupied areas of Ukraine, notably in locations such as Mariupol (Donetsk region) and Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region).
In addition, the Office has information regarding 160 civilian casualties – 30 killed and 130 injured - in the territory of the Russian Federation. Given the lack of corroborating information to date, these figures have not been included in the total numbers.
Civilians were killed in their homes and while simply trying to meet their essential needs, such as collecting water and buying food. These included 67-year-old Olha, who was killed in a missile strike just metres from her flat in Kharkiv as she went to buy milk the day after the war began. Her friend told UN human rights monitors how she came down from their shared 15th floor apartment to find Olha lying dead in the street.
Serhii, a man in his 60s, choked back tears as he told human rights monitors how he saw his six-year-old granddaughter lose a leg in an artillery attack, when his house in a village near Kherson took a direct hit on 2 April 2022.
“Stories such as those of Olha and Serhii underscore the devastating price civilians on both sides of the frontline have paid and continue to pay,” Türk said.
“Efforts to establish accountability and justice for violations of international law must intensify and deepen. It is equally vital that victims are able to access reparations and the practical assistance they desperately need, without first having to wait for the outcomes of formal legal proceedings,” the High Commissioner said.
“This senseless war has reverberated across the world. Higher costs of food and fuel as a result have deepened misery on a global scale, especially among those who were already the most vulnerable.  This war, which is a blatant affront to the UN Charter and the whole body of international law built to protect human beings everywhere, and its vast human toll must end now.”

Title: Statement attributable to Matthew Hollingworth, Humanitarian coordinator (a.i.), on the latest attacks impacting aid facilities in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
16 February 2023
Yesterday, the humanitarian community in Ukraine woke up to find out, once again, that another aid facility had been damaged during airstrikes.
A warehouse of the national NGO Proliska was hit in the early hours of the morning in Chasiv Yar, in the Donetsk region. The facility has served as a hub from where the organization and other partners – including the United Nations – would send relief supplies to people enduring heavy hostilities in Bakhmut, Avdiivka and other front-line communities. It was also a centre where civilians would gather to receive assistance in Chasiv Yar. Fortunately, no one was injured.
This was the third attack impacting facilities used to distribute humanitarian assistance in only two days. The day before, a warehouse of the national NGO Tarilka was struck in Kherson, injuring an aid worker. The incident compromised the logistics of Tarilka and other organizations working to support people in the front-line communities across the Kherson region. On the same day, another airstrike impacted a facility used by different groups in Kostiantynivka, in the Donetsk region.
We also continue to receive horrifying reports of homes, schools and hospitals being hit day in, day out, across front-line areas.
Civilian infrastructure, including aid and health facilities, are vital for the people of Ukraine. Constant care must be taken to spare them from harm. They are not a target.

Title: Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine Denise Brown remarks at the launch of the 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 February 2023
As delivered
I have to start with what you already know, because it is so important and because I am there, in Ukraine, day in and day out, and I am a witness to what is going on. Soldiers are not the only ones dying in this war. Civilians have lost and continue to lose their lives. This includes the lives of children. This includes the lives of the elderly who stay behind in their communities. These are the most vulnerable who are dying also in this war.
Civilians have lost and continue to lose their homes, their belongings, their livelihoods their family members. In the front-line communities that we go to there is sometimes this overwhelming sense of loss that permeates the air. But at the same time, there is this overwhelming sense of determination, both Filippo and Martin have mentioned this.
Civilian infrastructure is being targeted and this is a violation of international humanitarian law. And I can say that because I see it: hospitals, schools and energy infrastructure. And don't forget, we can talk about a building being destroyed, a hospital, and a heating plant but that affects millions of people, including millions of children. The hospital in Vovchansk in Kharkiv, which I visited a couple of weeks ago, was targeted two times last week. [It is] serving a community that stayed behind – that was the reason it was targeted. Millions of Ukrainians, including children, currently live – and we have heard it already today – without adequate access to electricity, water, and heating, in the dead of winter. I was back in Kherson city last Wednesday, it was my fifth trip there. The main heating pipes were hit twice the morning that I was there, and it was -5 degrees, with a wind that was really chilling our bones, and we were only there a few hours.
And yet, and we know it, we all say it, the people of Ukraine remain strong and continue to build, to rebuild, but as the ambassador just said, continue to need our support.
So my first point is that the humanitarian needs are increasing. I am afraid they are not decreasing because there are different dimensions to this crisis, and as the front line moves - the needs increase.
We have all heard about the war appearing to intensify in the east, in the Donbass over the past week, particularly in Donetsk, so we should be prepared for additional displacements of civilians. There is daily shelling in the east in Kharkiv, in Dnipro - relentless shelling, that each time hits civilian infrastructure. And the air strikes are pretty much daily in Kyiv and Odesa, so we are all affected.
I think the request for more tanks and stronger air defense systems is pretty good signal that the war continues, and that the needs of the Ukrainian people are there and continue. But I want to emphasize, I think it is such an important point, and Martin said it, it does not undermine meeting the needs elsewhere. A child who suffers – anywhere – is a child who needs our protection.
Second, this however does not mean that the humanitarian community has moved into Ukraine and will not leave. We have already begun discussions and work with the Minister of Social Policy on ensuring a transfer of the multipurpose cash humanitarian caseload where those needs continue. It will take some time, but we have had that conversation with the Government, the Member States, the UN agencies, NGOs – and we are working on this together. I think a good guest knows when to leave, so we are not leaving yet, but we are preparing for that eventual departure, when the time is right. And we will make that decision with the Government.
Thirdly, yesterday on Monday in the senior officials meeting in Brussels we discussed extensively localization. I heard a lot about what everyone thinks we are not doing. And of course, it is imperative, that the people who responded first, who were the volunteers – it was not the UN, it was the volunteer organizations who are still there – that their knowledge, their outreach be coupled with our collective capacity for advocacy and delivery at scale. If you have ever the opportunity to visit Kharkiv, Kherson, Sumy, or Zaporizhzhia which both Filippo and Martin have, and of course, the Ambassador knows, you will see the humanitarian hubs that are there, and this is underpinning our new humanitarian response plan. So it is a location where you find the volunteers, the local authorities, the UN agencies, the NGOs to support the people who come with legal support, with food, with medical attention, with the psychosocial support that is so urgently required. We are not doing it everywhere, but we are doing it in those locations.
Also, I allocated in December US$20 million from the Ukrainian Humanitarian Fund to 13 NGO partners who are funneling that to 300 volunteer organizations. Because our systems are way too complicated, onerous administrative bureaucratic procedures, but now they have access through the 13 partners, who take on the burden of the reporting and the monitoring. We will be evaluating this, to see how it goes, and Martin has been asking if he could deploy this in other situations. And we think yes. So this is the new face of localization. I get very frustrated when I read about ‘where the UN vehicles that we should be seeing up along the front line?’ You are looking for the wrong thing. White UN vehicles and NGO vehicles driving around as a sign of a humanitarian response to scale is an outdated indicator. I am not sure everyone understands that.
I have also to say, I did not say it to Martin yet, but I do think our humanitarian architecture is elitist – you need to know the lingo, you need to know how to be part of the club. So we are opening that up. But give us a little time, please. We are in a war, there are daily air strikes, we are imperfect, but we recognize what we need to do.
Fourth, the humanitarian response plan reflects the different dimensions of the collective work of the humanitarian community. Our critical importance right now is the front-line response. That front-line response is for me the most important thing. We are inching towards that front line with inter-agency convoys. This is work – and I must say, I am pushing the UN agencies very hard – we have to do this ourselves, alongside the NGO partners. We cannot transfer the risk to the local organizations. It is difficult, it is complicated, it is dangerous. We are trying to reach every single one of the 53 communities within 20 kilometres of the front line. We started in November, it is a difficult work, but we are managing to do that. We are delivering supplies and we are delivering the message, that the international community – we are there, with the people who stayed behind. There is no greater message.
What is not happening at scale, or in any consistent way, is reaching people on the other side of the front line. No, I do not have data, because we do not have access, but believe me when I say, that what happens on one side of the front line is exactly the same thing, as on the other side of the front line.
We consistently request access across the front line. Humanitarian notification system – Ukrainians consistently respond ‘yes’, and the Russian [Federation] consistently respond ‘no’. It is just a fact. It is just a fact, it is not my extrapolation. But the needs are there, and that is why we have included it into the Humanitarian Response Plan. This is Ukrainian territory, the UN does not recognize the annexation by Russia. We require access, it is a matter of principle, and it is a legal matter as well. So we need to deploy, as we discussed, in the Senior Official Meeting, we need to strengthen our humanitarian diplomacy, we need the support of Member States –  becomes a political issue, not something I can solve on my own, so this is really a plea to you to assist us with this.
Humanitarian Plus approach is very much there, and everyone loves the bakeries in Mykolaiv, but we also have agricultural demining, the databases of the houses to repair, rebuilding hospitals, schools, vouchers for grocery stores -  it is humanitarian plus, we are stepping in on humanitarian plus.
Let me just finish by thanking the Government of Ukraine with whom we have a very constructive relationship. Thank you very much, Ambassador, the Member States, the foundations for their outstanding support in 2022, and the people of Ukraine are counting on you in 2023. Thank you.

Title: Donating a fleet of buses, WHO and EU help strengthen vaccination drives in Ukraine to protect the most vulnerable
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 February 2023
The WHO Country Office in Ukraine, with European Union support, has donated 59 buses to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine to help strengthen far-flung vaccination efforts across the country during the war.
The buses will be staffed by mobile and outreach teams and will travel across all regions controlled by the Government of Ukraine to administer vaccines against infectious diseases including COVID-19, measles and diphtheria, with a particular focus on internally displaced persons, vulnerable groups, including the elderly and those with chronic health conditions and anyone residing in remote and hard to reach areas.
“Vaccination coverage has been significantly impacted over the past year of war, and these buses will help ensure that Ukraine continues on its journey to ensure IDPs and the most vulnerable populations can more easily access vaccines against diseases that could prove deadly,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
“Out of 35 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines delivered in country since beginning of pandemic, only 4 million (11%) doses have been implemented after 24 February 2022. We also observe routine immunization efforts face challenges as a result and we are preparing to address these risks of outbreaks of measles and diphtheria.”
With WHO support in partnership with EU and USAID since April – December 2022, up to 400,000 people across 1,500 locations across eight regions have been reached with outreach immunization services which include vaccinations, and information on how to catch up on required immunization to prevent the outbreaks of infectious diseases.
COVID-19 and routine vaccines are provided by public healthcare facilities throughout Ukraine and are administered according to global recommendations and in line with national vaccination calendar. Vaccines are available and administered free of charge in the country.
The donated buses will be distributed by the Ministry of Health among all Regional Сenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs).
WHO in Ukraine supports the national immunization program in partnership with the European Union. This includes strengthening of program capacities at national and regional levels and providing technical and operational support to eliminate inequities in vaccine coverage and extending population access to services as well as informational support for vaccination campaigns to prevent further large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases. WHO shares recommendations, technical guidance, conducts trainings for immunization program specialists and healthcare workers, and provides consumables and also assists in the delivery of vaccines to Ukraine as part of the COVAX international initiative.
Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine said: “WHO in Ukraine will continue to work tirelessly to support immunization efforts and help the country to increase vaccination coverage this year. Today’s crucial donation of buses with the EU marks a major step in this direction, and we thank our partners, and the Ministry of Health for continuing to provide their populations with effective protection against infectious diseases.”
“This donation will also help to address most recent challenges health system faces due to ongoing missile attacks to energy infrastructure which significantly affect vaccine cold chain and vaccine distribution to places with no stable electricity supply. Intensifying mobile and outreach services will help to better serve populations residing in these areas and improve their protection from infectious diseases.”
Dr Ihor Kuzin, Deputy Minister of Health said: “During the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, the vaccination campaign did not stop for a single day. Thanks to our partners, the donated busses will greatly strengthen the Regional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention so that we can strengthen routine immunization and reach as many people as possible with vaccinations against COVID-19. A special focus will be on IDPs, people with limited mobility and people living in hard-to-reach areas“.
Martin Schroeder, Head of Section “Human and Local Development“at the European Union Delegation to Ukraine said: "Strengthening public health systems is one of the top priorities in EU-Ukraine’s dialogue in the health area. The donation of these buses today marks an important step to help strengthen the vaccination drive in Ukraine and ensure the most vulnerable are being protected against infectious diseases. We plan to continue our partnership with WHO in Ukraine and the Ministry of Health to ensure that Ukraine's public health system is supported in this challenging period of full-fledged Russian war and beyond".

Title: UN and partners appeal for US$5.6 billion to help millions affected by the war in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 February 2023
(Geneva, 15 February 2023) - With the full-scale war in Ukraine about to enter its second year, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) today jointly appealed for US$5.6 billion to ease the plight of millions of people affected.
The Humanitarian Response Plan for Ukraine, bringing together more than 650 partners, the majority of them Ukrainian organizations, calls for $3.9 billion to reach 11.1 million people with food, health care, cash and other life-saving assistance.
The Refugee Response Plan (RRP) for refugees from Ukraine appeals for $1.7 billion. The plan includes 10 refugee host countries, namely Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, with some 250 partners – more than half of whom are national partners. These funds will help 4.2 million Ukrainian refugees and communities in countries hosting them.
The humanitarian situation in Ukraine deteriorated rapidly in 2022, after the Russian Federation’s invasion escalated eight years of conflict in the east into a full-scale war. The devastation and destruction have been staggering, with some 40 per cent of Ukraine’s population now in need of humanitarian assistance and protection. The war has also forced many to flee Ukraine, resulting in a humanitarian crisis of a scale not witnessed in Europe for decades.
“Almost a year on, the war continues to cause death, destruction and displacement daily, and on a staggering scale,” said Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.
“We will continue to prioritize assistance to people who need it most and to support local authorities and civil-society organizations, whose dedication has been inspiring,” he added. “We must do all we can to reach the hardest-to-reach communities, including those close to the front line. The suffering of the Ukrainian people is far from over – they continue to need international support.”
“The response in host countries to the Ukraine emergency has been remarkable, with strong state leadership, an outpouring of solidarity by host communities as well as the extraordinary work done by civil society, particularly local NGOs, and refugee-led and community-based organizations,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
“Europe has proven capable of bold, collective action to help refugees”, Grandi added.  “Refugees have not only been welcomed, but temporary protection arrangements have provided refugees with the right to work, access services and to be included in national systems.  We must not, however, take this response, or the hospitality of host communities, for granted.  Continued international support and solidary is needed, until refugees are able to return to their homes in safety and dignity, which must also remain a priority.”
Since the war began, humanitarian organizations in Ukraine have made every effort to scale up assistance to all regions of the country. Nearly 16 million people across Ukraine received aid and protection services in 2022, including areas outside Government control. Humanitarians also reached 6 million people with cash assistance, which also provided a boost to local economies.
Last year, RRP partners reached millions of refugees from Ukraine with protection and assistance, including over 1.1 million people who received support in accessing protection as well as over 609,000 children who benefited from child protection services. Almost 1 million refugees received in-kind support and over 885,000 people received urgent cash assistance to cover their basic needs.
In 2023, joint efforts and continued support to both response plans will enable partners inside Ukraine and refugee host countries to reach millions of people with protection services. This includes mental health and psychosocial support, child protection and gender-based violence prevention and response, shelter support, supplies for basic needs, and cash assistance.

Title: Odesa inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List in the face of threats of destruction
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 January 2023
25 January 2023 - The World Heritage Committee on Wednesday decided to inscribe the Historic Centre of Odesa (Ukraine) on the World Heritage List. This decision recognizes the outstanding universal value of the site and the duty of all humanity to protect it.
"Odesa, a free city, a world city, a legendary port that has left its mark on cinema, literature and the arts, is thus placed under the reinforced protection of the international community. While the war continues, this inscription embodies our collective determination to ensure that this city, which has always surmounted global upheavals, is preserved from further destruction", said Audrey Azoulay UNESCO Director-General.
Under the terms of the World Heritage Convention, the 194 States Parties of the Convention commit not to undertake any deliberate step that may directly or indirectly damage the World Heritage site and to assist in its protection.
The Historic Centre of Odesa has also been inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger, which gives it access to reinforced technical and financial international assistance, which Ukraine may request so as to ensure the protection of the property and, if necessary, assist in its rehabilitation.
An accelerated procedure due to the war
In view of the threats to the city since the beginning of the war, the World Heritage Committee has used an emergency procedure provided for in the Operational Guidelines of the World Heritage Convention. As early as the summer of 2022, UNESCO linked international experts with Ukrainian experts to prepare the nomination, with the support of Italy and Greece.
Ukraine’s President Zelensky made the submission official in October 2022, in an online speech to UNESCO. The evaluation bodies examined the nomination over the following weeks, allowing for a review at this week’s extraordinary World Heritage Committee in Paris.
UNESCO deploys emergency measures on the ground
In recent months, in parallel with the process of inscribing the Historic Centre of Odesa on the World Heritage List, UNESCO implemented emergency measures on the ground to help protect the site.
UNESCO has notably ensured the repairs to damages inflicted on the Odesa Museum of Fine Arts and the Odesa Museum of Modern Art since the beginning of the war. The Organization also provided equipment for the digitization of nearly 1,000 works of art and of the documentary collection of the Odesa State Archives. Equipment was also delivered to protect the buildings as well as the open-air works of art.
These measures are part of UNESCO's overall action plan in Ukraine, which has already mobilized more than $18 million for education, science, culture and information.

Title: WHO donates ambulances to Ukraine to support emergency health needs amid the war
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 January 2023
Lviv, 23 January 2023 - WHO in Ukraine has donated 26 ambulances to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine to enable the provision of emergency medical care to patients during the war.
“With continuous attacks on health care in Ukraine, WHO supports Ukraine’s healthcare system during the war and delivers life-saving medical supplies and equipment in coordination with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and other partners,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine.
“These ambulances will help save lives and bring vital care to people in Ukraine amid the war.”
The donation includes 6 patient transport ambulances and 20 mobile intensive care unit ambulances, equipped with oxygen tanks, defibrillators, transport ventilators and other medical devices, allowing transportation of seriously injured patients to health facilities.
Since 24 February 2022, more than 30 ambulances have been donated to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine by WHO and its partners. More ambulances are set to be delivered later this year.
Dr Viktor Liashko, Minister of Health of Ukraine, noted: “Every single day war brings new challenges to our life and work, we all faced lots of losses and destructions, but our main task remains the same - to take care of people's health. I’m sincerely grateful to the World Health Organization for their significant help and comprehensive support. Thanks to our joint efforts, Ukrainian medical system continues to work. Today these ambulances start saving lives of Ukrainians.”
The delivery was made possible with funding from the European Union.
“Hundreds of healthcare facilities have been destroyed since the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Together with humanitarian partners like WHO and in close coordination with the Ukrainian government, we support the healthcare system so that the Ukrainian healthcare workers can continue saving lives across the country,” said Claudia Amaral, Head of EU Humanitarian Aid in Ukraine.
WHO has delivered more than 2000 metric tonnes of life-saving medical supplies to Ukraine since the war began. Deliveries include power generators, ambulances, oxygen supplies for medical facilities, supplies for trauma and emergency surgeries, and medicines to help treat noncommunicable diseases and more.

Title: FAO outlines three pillars of action for initiatives in Ukraine in 2023
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 January 2023
22 January 2023, Berlin – On the side lines of the Global Forum for Food and Agriculture (GFFA) in Berlin, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Government of Germany co-organized a special meeting on Saturday for G-7 Ministers on the situation in Ukraine and planning to address the impacts of the war on the Ukrainian people, livelihoods and agricultural output.
For 2023, FAO Chief Economist, Máximo Torero Cullen, presented updates regarding FAO’s Rapid Response Plan for the country,  outlining three pillars of action, which together will require $205 million in funding.

They include:
i) restoring food security and self-sufficiency for half a million rural households in frontline or otherwise heavily-impacted areas through provision of seeds, feed and cash;
ii) restoring critical production and value chains by providing diesel and gas generators, seeds for wheat, barley, oats and peas, temporary and fixed modular storage units and other needs;
iii) bolstering critical agrifood system services by supporting testing and certification for alternative grain export routes, restoring veterinary services, partnering with specialized organizations to facilitate the removal of explosive hazards from agricultural lands and conducting damage and loss assessments.

The meeting was hosted by Cem Özdemir, Germany’s Federal Minister for Food and Agriculture.

Also present were Mykola Solskyi, Minister for Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, and Vladimir Bolea, Minister for Agriculture and Food Industry of the Republic of Moldova, which has been impacted by the conflict. Ministers and senior officials from Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, and the European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also participated.

In 2022, FAO programmes included providing more than 26 000 grain sleeves able to store more than 5 million tonnes of cereals given that Ukraine’s infrastructure has been damaged , helping more than 30 000 households with vegetable seeds and seed potatoes in the early planting part of the year, while also providing more than 5 000 tonnes of winter wheat seeds to small-scale farmers.

FAO has also provided multi-purpose cash assistance to more than 2 000 vulnerable rural households, notably in Dnipropetrovska, Khersonska and Zaporizka oblasts.

“FAO’s programmes in Ukraine with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine and local administrations in each oblast are a good illustration of our strategic approach combining humanitarian assistance and investment in medium and long-term resilience building, along the Humanitarian Development Peace nexus” Torero said in a presentation of FAO’s evolving Rapid Response Plan for the country.

One rural household over every four has reduced or stopped agricultural production due to the war, with more than one in three having done so in the contact-line districts, according to FAO. That has unleashed a food security problem for the local population of a country that has historically been a food exporting powerhouse. Ukraine’s exports of cereals declined by almost 30 percent in the 2022/2023 marketing year.

Title: Note to Correspondents: Update on the Black Sea Grain Initiative
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
19 January 2023
From August 2022 to date, 17.8 million tonnes of grain and other food products have been exported under the Black Sea Grain Initiative to 43 countries.
In December, the exports through the Ukrainian Black Sea ports marked a bit over 3.7 million metric tonnes, up from 2.6 million in November. In the last two weeks, nearly 1.2 million metric tonnes of food have been moved from those ports. However, unfavourable weather conditions both in Odesa ports as well as in Turkish inspection areas have curbed some movements in the last week.
So far and according to information reported at the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC), China is the primary recipient of exports, Spain is second and Türkiye is third. Nearly 44 per cent of the wheat exported has been shipped to low and lower-middle income countries (64% to developing economies). The World Food Programme bought 8 percent of the total wheat exported under the Black Sea Grain Initiative in 2022 in support of its humanitarian operations in hunger-struck places around the world.
Over 1,300 voyages have been enabled so far by the Joint Coordination Centre. Currently, there are more than 100 vessels in Turkish territorial waters connected to the Initiative, 32 are waiting for inspection, while the rest have applied to participate in the Initiative. Since November, the JCC has been deploying three inspection teams daily. So far, this month, the teams conclude an average of 5.3 inspections per day. In the last two weeks, the average waiting time of vessels between application and inspection is 21 days.
The United Nations urges all parties to work to remove obstacles for the reduction of the backlog and improve operational efficiencies within the JCC.
All the detailed and up-to-date data and information on exports, cargo and reported destinations are kept on our website.
The Initiative calls also for the facilitation of safe navigation for exports of fertilizers, including ammonia. However, the shipment of ammonia from the Ukrainian ports has not yet begun. Ammonia, a key ingredient in the fertilizer production, is urgently needed on the market to bring these prices down and make it more affordable. The parties negotiating on how to get ammonia to the market through the Togliatti/Yuznhy pipeline are still in discussions and are yet to reach an agreement.
The two agreements signed in Istanbul in July 2022, the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the Memorandum of Understanding, aim to supply world markets with volumes of grains, other food products, and fertilizers to help bring down global food and fertilizer prices and ease global food insecurity. Achieving this goal requires the full implementation of both agreements on unimpeded export of Ukrainian and Russian food and fertilizer to global markets. This is now more critical than ever given the urgency to address potential global food availability crisis in 2023 due to continued high fertilizer prices.
The United Nations continues to support those and related efforts to increase the availability of food and fertilizer as part of the assistance it continues to provide in the implementation of the agreements.

Title: Ukraine: EU-FAO partnership to ensure recovery and development of agricultural value chains

04 January 2023
A $15.5 million EU-funded project aims to respond to disruptions to the agricultural sector caused by war
Rural households, smallholder farmers and small-scale agricultural enterprises will benefit from a $15.5 million project funded by the European Union (EU) and implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to support the functioning, reinforcement and strengthening of value chains in agriculture, fisheries and forestry, and their adaptation to the wartime conditions.
The project will focus on supporting producers in Lvivska, Ivano-Frankivska, Zakarpatska and parts of Chernivetska oblast with matching grants for on-farm and value chain-based investments coupled with extension and advisory support.
“The EU funds for this FAO project aim to re-establish or reinforce pre-war level functionality of agricultural value chains. This is needed to meet the food requirements of local and displaced populations in the west and address food insecurity elsewhere in the country in the immediate and short term, and will be critical to averting a food crisis into 2023,” said Christian Ben Hell, the Sector Manager for Agriculture at the EU Delegation to Ukraine.
The food security situation in Ukraine has deteriorated rapidly following the eruption of the war on 24 February 2022, which has caused extensive destruction of crops, agricultural and other civilian infrastructure, and disrupted both supply and value chains.
FAO’s recent nationwide assessment on the impact of the war on agriculture and rural households reveals that one in every four of the 5 200 respondents has reduced or stopped agricultural production due to the war. Through this EU-funded project, which initially started in February 2021 with a preparation phase but then was put on hold due to the war to be repurposed to meet the current needs, in March-May 2022 emergency agricultural support was provided to over 6 000 rural households. This assistance covered the urgent population’s need for agricultural inputs, cash, vegetable seeds and seed potatoes to continue food production for household consumption.
"The testimonies of the individuals and families who I met during my visits to the newly accessible areas confirm the urgent need for immediate support towards restoring their household capacities and avoiding dependence on humanitarian assistance. At the same time, it is imperative that the Government is supported in its efforts to develop the agriculture sector and to strengthen and diversify value chains," said Pierre Vauthier, Head of FAO Ukraine country office.
As the war persists, market participants including large numbers of household and family farms, individual producers, small companies, traders and processors are experiencing difficulties in accessing inputs, finance and investment to support continuity and expansion of operations. The major difficulties expected in the next few months in terms of both crop and livestock production activities are low benefits from the sale of products, constrained access to fertilizers or pesticides, and fuel or electricity to power equipment.
“Although the required analytical work was completed prior to the war, its escalation altered the programming environment and reshaped the priority needs of the agrifood sector participants.” said Hanna Antonyuk, Project Manager at FAO Ukraine. “The project aims to provide timely support to agricultural producers and small-scale agricultural enterprises with urgently needed access to finance, technical and business development advice and market intelligence. During wartime, these investments are necessary to secure the operations of agricultural producers, to support their adaptation to the evolving environment and to lay the foundations for sustainable growth.”
The investment support programme will be launched through Ukraine’s State Agrarian Registry (SAR) and, starting from March 2023, the matching grants will be provided to eligible agricultural producers and agricultural enterprises in the following value chains:
Lvivska oblast:
Zakarpatska, Ivano-Frankivska and parts of Chernivetska oblasts:
Grants in the range of $1 000 to $25 000 will be disbursed in Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH) at the prevailing exchange rate and beneficiaries will be required to make a matching contribution to finance the proposed investment. Specific eligibility and selection criteria, as well as procedural and administrative requirements to submit an application will be published through a publicity campaign expected to be launched shortly.
In addition, the project aims to assist the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences in preserving a unique national collection of plant genetic resources, which is of global significance in terms of the volume and diversity of genetic material. The project will secure and safeguard the collections of the Ukrainian plant genetic resources by moving them to a safe storage location and will improve the collections database with modern IT support.

Title: IOM and EU Will Support Over 700,000 Ukrainians Through Winter in Wartime
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
27 December 2022
As temperatures across Ukraine have plummeted below zero and are expected to drop even more, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Mission in Ukraine, is stepping up efforts to help displaced and war-affected people cope with cold weather conditions. With humanitarian funding from the European Union, IOM will support over 700,000 Ukrainians with multi-sectoral assistance during the winter months, which will be the most challenging season yet for the country.
IOM’s winterization support, made possible with funding from the EU, includes the refurbishment of collective centres hosting displaced people, the improvement of water supply, wastewater and heating systems, the repair of damaged homes, as well as the distribution of high-thermal blankets, bedding kits, mattresses, and hygiene items. It also includes the provision of solid fuel, and cash assistance enabling people to have flexible means for supporting themselves during winter. With this funding, IOM will stock critical items ensuring war-affected people in Ukraine continue to be reached, and that will serve as well to support partners responding to the urgent needs on the ground.
In total, mobile teams will conduct repair works in 375 collective sites and social institutions, improving insulation, fixing leaking roofs, replacing broken windows, non-functioning radiators, and installing additional showers.  IOM will refurbish 5,800 private homes and distribute emergency shelter kits to enable people to make necessary improvements themselves. Solid fuel will be provided to help families stay warm during the cold period. IOM will also support municipalities in areas recently retaken by the Government of Ukraine with construction materials and generators.
“Displaced and war-affected people will face new and growing challenges as the war drags on and winter grips Ukraine. Our key priority is to support warm, safe, and dignified conditions to help people get through the next few months,” said Anh Nguyen, IOM Ukraine Chief of Mission.
“The vulnerable people in Ukraine are going through the most difficult winter. As attacks continue leaving millions without reliable access to electricity, heating, and water, our humanitarian partners like IOM continue working to meet the most pressing needs,” said Claudia Amaral, Head of EU Humanitarian Aid in Ukraine.
Around 18 million Ukrainians, or 40 per cent of the country’s population, are in need of humanitarian assistance, the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates. Continuous attacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure have multiplied the devastating impact of the war and risks for the most affected people.
IOM's latest survey shows that despite multiple attacks on the country’s power supply and heating infrastructure, Ukrainians plan to spend the winter at their current locations: only seven per cent of respondents nationwide are actively considering leaving. At the same time, private resources for survival are becoming scarce, as 43 per cent of all families in Ukraine have completely exhausted their savings.

We share the grief of the bereaved families and wish a prompt recovery to the injured.
As many prepare for celebrations, we must remember those who continue to suffer every day from the war in Ukraine.

Title: Ukraine: Humanitarian Coordinator allocates $20 million to support local organizations and volunteer groups at the forefront of the humanitarian response
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
20 December 2022
The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, today announced the release of an additional US $20 million from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) to support more than 300 civil society organizations, community-based organizations and volunteer groups that have been working around the clock to support millions of people impacted by the war in Ukraine.
“These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February. They are in the front line, taking risks to make sure people whose lives have been torn apart by months of war receive support for their daily needs: water, food, medicines, shelter when their houses have been damaged,” explained Denise Brown.
The humanitarian community in Ukraine has had several meetings with these groups in different parts of the country. “The work they are doing is impressive. However, 10 months later, their resources are being exhausted and they need support to sustain their vital assistance to the people of Ukraine,” said Denise Brown.
With this new disbursement, OCHA-managed humanitarian funds will have allocated over $252 million for life-saving operations in Ukraine since the Russian Federation’s invasion started on 24 February, including $192 million from the UHF and $60 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). More than $55 million has been channelled to projects and organizations supporting hospitals, displacement centres and other critical facilities with generators and people with winter supplies, as Ukraine faces a severe energy crisis in the middle of the winter. “This wouldn’t have been possible without the incredible support of our donors. We thank them, on behalf of the humanitarian community and the people of Ukraine,” concluded Denise Brown.

Title: UNHCR launches pilot Cash-Based Intervention Using Blockchain Technology for Humanitarian Payments to People Displaced and Impacted by the War in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 December 2022
Ukraine, UNHCR has launched a first-of-its-kind integrated blockchain payment solution powered by the Stellar network to reach people in need with speed, agility, and accountability.
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), the non-profit that supports the growth and development of the Stellar blockchain network, announced today the launch of a pilot first-of-its-kind blockchain payment solution for digital cash distribution to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other war-affected people in Ukraine.
UNHCR, in collaboration with United Nations International Computing Centre (UNICC), the UN’s technology solutions provider, are amongst the first to pilot the new Stellar-based aid disbursement solution, which ensures the delivery of cash assistance directly into the hands of those being assisted quickly, efficiently, and securely with full value transfer traceability and accountability.
The pilot phase of the project is designed specifically for Ukraine but can be adapted worldwide. UNHCR confirms eligibility and distributes assistance in Circle Internet Financial’s USD Coin (USDC) — a stablecoin where one USDC is equal to one US Dollar — directly into a recipient's Vibrant digital wallet which they can download onto a smartphone. This provides a secure place to hold and transport funds in USDC, a stable store of value, allowing people to travel within the country or cross borders without the need to carry cash.
When recipients choose to convert to cash, whether it is dollars, euros, or local currency, they can withdraw their funds at any global MoneyGram location, including over 4,500 MoneyGram locations in Ukraine.
The program is being piloted in Kyiv, Lviv, and Vinnytsia and will expand to other towns and cities in Ukraine. The money will provide humanitarian assistance to some of the people most impacted and vulnerable due to the war, to help them cover basic needs like rent of accommodation, food, medical care and heating during the winter. The solution has been extensively tested over the last six months and is expected to be expanded to reach more war-affected people inside Ukraine as well as refugees from Ukraine in early 2023.
This blockchain initiative complements UNHCR’s goals to further expand the systematic and rapid use of Cash-Based Interventions. Since 2016, when UNHCR issued its first Policy on Cash Based Interventions, UNHCR has delivered almost USD 5 billion in cash assistance to some 35 million people in 100 countries.
UNHCR is committed to further expanding the provision of cash, which is normally the preferred assistance modality by people forcibly displaced, as it gives them the freedom and dignity to themselves decide how to prioritize the assistance given, based on their personal need.
“Ukraine is a global lead in the development of technical solutions to increase access to social protection, including assistance for displaced people. Across the world, UNHCR has been collaborating for years with the tech sector, which has played a crucial role in helping us to innovate to deliver assistance faster, as speed is of the essence in humanitarian action. It’s also essential to provide people with a range of options for receiving aid, as one size does not fit all. Programmes need to be designed with the people they are meant to serve at the centre. I am very pleased that UNHCR and the SDF have chosen Ukraine for this launch, and look forward to expanding it beyond this pilot, so it can benefit many thousands more people in need of assistance as a result of the war”, said Karolina Lindholm Billing, UNHCR Representative to Ukraine.
“SDF, together with UNHCR, is realizing the promise of blockchain and pioneering a new future for the delivery of billions of dollars in aid disbursed annually. Using Stellar, we are helping get funds into the hands of those who need them – and doing it quickly, transparently, and without the need for bank accounts or credit or debit cards. We are proud to work with UNHCR to deploy blockchain innovations that will play a role in assisting those in crisis”, said Denelle Dixon, Stellar Development Foundation CEO and Executive Director.
"Today, we can see how blockchain technology allows us to scale humanitarian efforts in a way that wasn’t possible before. For fleeing Ukrainians, and primarily for those whose banks are inaccessible, this pilot project providing humanitarian assistance using a digital wallet, will serve as a possible lifeline for survival. The project itself is a vivid example of how blockchain has the potential to transform and revolutionize the way humanitarian funds are allocated. The use of blockchain technology allows humanitarian organizations such as UNHCR to be more transparent and accountable and ensure that the most vulnerable people will have access to funds provided in their name. In this way, humanitarian efforts around the world will be strengthened in an unprecedented way. The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine is grateful to SDF and UNHCR for standing with the people of Ukraine and doing this in such an efficient & modern way,” said Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development Oleksandr Bornyakov.

Title: UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS AND EMERGENCY RELIEF COORDINATOR MARTIN GRIFFITHS REMARKS TO PRESS AT THE END OF HIS FOUR-DAY MISSION TO UKRAINE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 December 2022
As delivered
Thank you, Prime Minister, thank you Denys, for receiving me. I was recalling that you and I met in this same building, many many months ago, early on in this war. And it is a great privilege for me to be back. Thank you very much indeed.
I was fortunate to visit Mykolaiv and Kherson earlier this week, and now also in Kyiv meeting the Prime Minister and other leaders, as well as humanitarian agencies. And I'd like to share a few conclusions from those visits and from those meetings.
Firstly, I was very impressed by the close partnership which the international humanitarian community, which is what I represent, has with your authorities, with your Government here. But also very importantly in the oblasts, the government of Mykolaiv and Kherson. I spent time with the mayors of those two cities, the heads of hromadas also. And that relationship is extremely strong, but it's very operational. Needs are identified. Aid is delivered.
And I want to thank you, in fact, for what everyone has been telling me from the humanitarian agencies, international and national, local, the fron- line partners, to thank you for the very, very constructive and open relationship we have, even in these extraordinarily difficult times where you all days are filled with decisions and tragedies. You have provided the time for our agencies and our partners to do that job. It is a huge thank you.
Since the beginning of the war, international humanitarian agencies have reached just under 14 million people with assistance, and we will continue to do so under your leadership.
But let me say a few things about Mykolaiv and Kherson.
We were in Kherson, as I said. The Governor was spending the day with us, the mayor, the people. We saw distribution sites for food, shelter, clothing, mattresses, all organized by local authorities, handing out these small bits of generosity to the people in their great time of difficulty. I was in a school where UNICEF has a child centre. And as we were there in Kherson, we heard the artillery coming closer to us. So the shelling, which is a daily phenomenon in Kherson, we heard that. And it's not that we were under threat, but we were reminded of these still uncertain lives and future of so many people, even in Kherson, where you have managed to regain so much of your territory.
We met in Mykolaiv, in a shelter provided by your Government to the displaced people from Kherson, some of these families. Some of them have been there for months, but some had recently arrived because their villages on the road between Mykolaiv and Kherson had been destroyed. And the following day we saw those villages, and they went back daily to try to restart their lives in those villages.
They didn't know when the reconstruction of their houses would happen, and it was a reminder of two things. One, you have an enormous challenge ahead to reconstruct the places where people live. But equally, you have people who want to go home, who are determined to go home. And that is a great value and a great tribute to your people.
Three things just three things which came across very strongly. And you mentioned them as priority needs. Number one, no surprise, is the electricity. I was absolutely stunned to see the degree to which electricity is the gateway to everything else. Without electricity, there's no warmth. The weather is getting cold. Without electricity, there are no medical services, there is no transport, there is no light.
And in many parts of Kherson there is very little electricity. So, the effort that you were making in Paris on the same day, Denys, that is, making the repair of energy infrastructure the absolute central priority is one that I saw how important it was to the people of Kherson. And the Governor of Kherson is trying to amend the electricity lines coming into his oblast and hoping that if they were repaired, that they would not be damaged again.
This issue is of central importance precisely because civilians suffer from the lack of electricity, civilians who should not suffer under international law in a conflict. That's the first priority.
The second is de-mining, and we talked about it just now. I was told, for example, that there are about half a million hectares of agricultural land in Kherson alone, which needs de-mining. You can't get the country back into production without de-mining. I think, as you were saying to me earlier, Ukraine is probably now the most mine-polluted country in the world. So the urgent international priority to the mine is one that we will also do what we can.
And then finally, this and we talked about it also. Even in war, people want to see a future, perhaps, particularly in war. And restarting elements of a local economy is a central priority for people. People want to go back to work. They want their children to go back to schools, they want transport to work. They want the economy to work, they want employment to happen. And I am one of those who supports you in your efforts to get that private sector back. Even now, even in places like Kherson, where the war is still going on with those people on the right bank are still being shelled every day, restarting, jumpstarting the economy, anything that we in the UN can do to support that effort – we’d happily do so.
Thank you very much.

Title: STATEMENT BY DENISE BROWN, HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE,  ON THE KILLING OF AN AID WORKER IN KHERSON TODAY
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 December 2022
I am appalled by the death of an aid worker who was killed together with another civilian during an attack in Kherson today. Some other civilians have been injured. The strike hit a building used by local authorities, volunteer groups and humanitarian organizations to distribute aid to people in Kherson.
It is shocking to know that a place that is used to support civilians, particularly the elderly, in need of assistance because of the war has been hit.
I send my most heartfelt condolences to both families. My thoughts are also with the colleagues of this brave woman who died in the line of duty today, working as a paramedic with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society.
This deeply tragic event is yet another reminder of the horrific consequences of this war for civilians and the extraordinary risks front-line humanitarian workers take.

Title: Ukraine: New UN survey shows rural households are increasingly affected by the war
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 December 2022
Nationwide assessment reveals that more than one in four respondents reported having reduced or ceased agricultural production
Kyiv/Rome – After nine months of war in Ukraine, rural households are increasingly affected by the conflict with many forced to scale down or abandon agricultural activities, according to a new survey released by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
The Impact of the war on agriculture and rural livelihoods in Ukraine: Findings of a nationwide rural household survey revealed that one in every four of the 5 200 respondents surveyed had reduced or stopped agricultural production due to the conflict. Rural households were interviewed to enhance understanding of the current agriculture and livelihoods situation and needs, particularly in view of the upcoming winter season.
“Ukraine’s agriculture sector is an important source of livelihoods for the roughly 13 million Ukrainians living in rural areas. While around two-thirds of agricultural production is made by enterprises, rural households produce around 32 percent,” said Pierre Vauthier, head of FAO’s Ukraine country office. “The report indicates that 25 percent of the Ukrainian rural population involved in agriculture stopped their activities or reduced their output due to the war. The situation is much worse in the most agriculture-dependent regions of Ukraine, where over 40 percent of rural families are affected.”
The impact of the war on the broader production system, characterized by disruptions to value and supply chains and price volatility, has had repercussions on the rural population, underlining their interdependence with the country’s agricultural economy. While the effects of the war are more prominent in the oblasts (regions) along the front line, these are also widely experienced in the rest of the country.
“The report focuses on those households mostly involved in backyard farming and small-scale agricultural production,” said Lavinia Antonaci, coordinator of the assessment. “Although not officially defined as farmers, they play a pivotal role in ensuring the food security, incomes and livelihoods of rural populations by providing for their own food consumption as well as selling products locally, thus contributing to local supply chains.”
Key findings
As the war persists, the current situation is likely to deteriorate further. Compounded by the winter season and the potential for further internal displacements to rural areas, the coping capacities of the rural population are likely to become progressively strained. It is critical to protect those households from the further deterioration of their productive capacities, which are the foundations of their resilience.
The report notes that support to rural household food production is a means to mitigate the negative impacts of the war on their food security and livelihoods, and will also improve and maintain the hosting capacities of rural households. Revitalizing and sustaining the small-scale agriculture sector will strengthen and secure the contribution of rural households to the broader agricultural system and enhance the benefits they can access in return.
In addition, it is critical to monitor the constantly changing situation and to continue providing complementary assessments and integrated analyses on the impact of the war on Ukraine’s agricultural system to better inform short-, medium- and long-term actions.

Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 December 2022
//
WHO:
- Martin Griffiths, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator
WHAT:
- Mission to see the humanitarian impact of the war on the people of Ukraine and review the response undertaken by aid organizations in the country.
WHEN:
- 12 to 15 December 2022
WHERE:
- Mykolaiv, Kherson and Kyiv.

Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, arrived in Ukraine today for a four-day mission. While in the country he will meet with Government officials, humanitarian partners and people impacted by the war.
Accompanied by the Assistant-Secretary-General and Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, Mr. Griffiths will see the impact of the humanitarian response and new challenges that have arisen as infrastructure damage mounts amid freezing winter temperatures.
In Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, the humanitarian chief will visit a site housing internally displaced people and a UN-supported bakery which produces bread for people front-line city of Kherson. From there, he will head to Kherson, where he will see how the UN and local authorities are establishing areas where people can go for warmth and safety when they have lost heating, electricity and water in their homes. Mr. Griffiths will spend the final leg of his trip in the capital, Kyiv, where he will meet with senior Government officials, as well as with NGO representatives and the diplomatic community.
Over nine months since the war in Ukraine began, nearly 18 million people – around 40 per cent of the country’s population – need humanitarian aid. Recent waves of attacks on energy infrastructure are leaving millions of people without heat, clean water or electricity in their homes just as freezing winter conditions set in. The United Nations and humanitarian organizations, most of them Ukrainian national NGOs, have reached more than 13.5 million people with critical aid since 24 February.

Title: The United Nations Ukraine hosted a Thematic Dialogue with Ukrainian Women’s Civil Society Organizations in Kyiv
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
09 December 2022
Кyiv, Ukraine -  Denise Brown, the United Nations Resident & Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Geeta Kuttiparambil, UN Women Ukraine Representative, a.i., and Tetyana Kudina, Programme Coordinator, UN Women Ukraine, co-hosted the United Nations Thematic Dialogue with Ukrainian Women’s Civil Society Organizations. The event was held in Kyiv on December 7th.
This event which gathered 27 Women CSOs representatives was the first in a series of dialogues designed to provide an inclusive platform for Ukrainian women’s CSOs to highlight emerging and timely priorities across human rights, humanitarian assistance and recovery efforts, and enable direct engagement of women’s CSOs with the diplomatic, development and humanitarian community.
Opening the event, Denise Brown, the United Nations Resident & Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, addressed the participants and outlined the goal of the meeting: “We are here to listen to you and to work with you to bring the concerns and priorities of women affected by the war to the forefront of our response.”
During the meeting participants discussed measures which will help to safeguard and strengthen the leadership and achievements of the Ukrainian women’s movement during the war; the current risks, limitations and potential challenges women CSOs anticipate in meaningfully advancing their work; and how United Nations can better support women activists and CSOs to continue the momentum of their efforts and amplify advocacy.
Larysa Baida, the National Assembly of People with Disabilities: “We need to sit at the same table with UN structures working in Ukraine and discuss issues and barriers, so they can help us help people”.
Iryna Drobovych, Ukrainian Women’s Congress: “Coming together as CSO representatives gives us energy to move on and engage. This unity of women’s organizations is important nowadays. It’s time to unite”
The dynamic discussion confirmed that women leadership and joint efforts of all stakeholders amid the full-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine are much needed to navigate through these challenging times, mitigate the negative impact of the war on women and girls and streamline the humanitarian response and recovery efforts.
Issues raised by participants also included political representation of women, as well as greater support to women affected by war to develop businesses to support their family in a context where there is a growing number of single-female headed households, with fewer and fewer income-earning opportunities, all on top of an already unequal labour market. Access to services related to gender-based violence, as well as support to women with disabilities were also identified as key priorities.
Wrapping up the 1st Thematic Dialogue with Ukrainian Women’s Civil Society Organizations, Åsa Regnér, Deputy Executive Director for Policy, Programme, Civil Society and Intergovernmental Support, UN Women said: “This is a priority for us. We want to put women’s leadership and needs at the forefront of the agenda of the UN’s response”.
The participants of the meeting agreed to establish a joint working group with the participation of UN agencies in Ukraine and CSOs to align on the next steps necessary to identify key directions for strengthening UN and Ukrainian Women’s Civil Society Organizations joint efforts.

Title: UN report details summary executions and attacks on individual civilians by Russian troops in northern Ukraine from February to April
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
07 December 2022
Kyiv, 7 December 2022 – In the initial weeks of the invasion of Ukraine, Russian armed forces summarily executed or carried out attacks on individuals leading to the deaths of hundreds of civilians, the Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Matilda Bogner said today. A UN Human Rights report based on the work of the Mission details how Russian troops killed civilians in Ukrainian towns and villages across Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions of Ukraine from 24 February until 6 April 2022.
Matilda Bogner said the summary executions examined in the report may constitute a war crime. “There are strong indications that the summary executions documented in this report may constitute the war crime of wilful killing”, she said.
The report explains how killings of civilians were not confined to specific locations, although some areas were more affected than others. In the town of Bucha near Kyiv, which was under the control of Russian troops from 5 to 30 March, the Mission documented the killing of 73 civilians (54 men, 16 women, 2 boys, and 1 girl) and is in the process of corroborating an additional 105 alleged killings.
Summary executions often followed security checks by Russian armed forces. “A mere text message, a piece of camouflage clothing, or a record of previous military service could have fatal consequences,” Bogner said.
The report states that the UN has, so far, documented the violent deaths of 441 civilians (341 men, 72 women, 20 boys and 8 girls) in the three regions in the initial 6 weeks of the Russian invasion alone. The report cautions that the actual figures are likely to be considerably higher as work is still ongoing to corroborate an additional 198 killings that occurred in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions of Ukraine occupied by Russia in the initial stages of the ongoing armed attack against Ukraine.
Apart from the summary execution of civilians, the report covers cases when Russian troops launched attacks that did not respect the principle of distinction between military objectives and civilians and failed to take all feasible precautions to spare civilians. “Civilians were targeted on roads while moving within or between settlements, including while attempting to flee the hostilities,” Bogner said.
The report examines 100 killings in more detail. Of the number, according to the report’s assessment, 57 amounted to summary executions (48 men, 7 women, and 2 boys). Thirty of those took place in places of detention while the remaining 27 victims were killed on the spot, shortly after coming under the control of Russian forces.
“Russian soldiers brought civilians to makeshift places of detention and then executed them in captivity. Many of the victims’ bodies were found with their hands tied behind their backs and gunshot wounds to their heads,” said Bogner.
The report found that men and boys comprised 88 per cent of all victims of summary executions, suggesting that males were disproportionately targeted on the basis of their gender.
The report states that although many months have passed since the first killings became known, much needs to be done to hold those responsible to account. The UN Human Rights Office has found no information that the Russian authorities have been actively investigating or prosecuting any of such cases. Bogner called for the Russian Federation to promptly investigate all alleged violations of international law and to bring those responsible to justice.
The full text of the OHCHR thematic report “Killings of civilians: summary executions and attacks on individual civilians in Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions in the context of the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine” is available in English, Ukrainian and Russian.

Title: UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk concludes his official visit to Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
07 December 2022
Kyiv, 7 December 2022
Good afternoon and thank you all for coming.
I have been here now for four days,  in sub-zero temperatures.  I have seen for myself the horrors, suffering and the daily toll that this war  against Ukraine by Russia has had on the people of this country.
I have spoken to the families of prisoners of war who anxiously await news of their loved ones. I’ve listened to the pain of  those  whose children are on the frontline; heard about the particular plight of people with disabilities and older people who are unable to reach safe shelter when the air raid sirens go off. I  visited the site of a shelled apartment block in Izium, Kharkiv Oblast, where more than 50 people were buried under the rubble.
And in the rubble were the signs of lives cut short by acts of indiscriminate shelling.
A shoe. A piano. Toys. A closet full of clothes. Shelves of books.
I talked to a woman who showed me her destroyed apartment block, where all her neighbours, now dead, used to live.
I had to spend time in an underground shelter on Monday as at least 70  missiles were launched across Ukraine, again striking essential infrastructure and knocking out power. A group of human rights defenders joined us, and we calmly carried on with our meeting. As if it was normal to have your day interrupted by air raid sirens.
It is not normal. It must not be normal.
I fear that there is one long, bleak winter ahead for Ukraine. The consequences of the war on the enjoyment of human rights for people in the country have already been devastating, and the prognosis is very worrying.
Some 17.7 million people need humanitarian assistance and 9.3 million require food and livelihood assistance. A third of the population has been forced to flee their homes. Some 7.89 million have fled the country, the majority of whom are women and children, and 6.5 million people are internally displaced.
This means lives uprooted.
Humanitarian aid plays a vital role in providing support to the most vulnerable, including older people and people with disabilities. Providing an adequate social security net to the most vulnerable need to  be prioritized.
Each day we receive information about war crimes. The scale of civilian casualties, as well as the significant damage and destruction to civilian objects - including hospitals and schools - is  shocking as I saw for myself in Izium. During winter, this has horrible consequences for the most vulnerable. They are struggling with blackouts, with no heating or electricity, going on for hours.
Information continues to emerge about summary executions, torture, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and sexual violence against women, girls and men.
In relation to continuing reports of ill-treatment, torture and execution of prisoners of war, my Office issued a statement in mid-November raising serious concerns based on our findings. We will continue to follow this issue closely.
Prisoners of war must be treated humanely at all times from the moment they are captured. This is a clear, unequivocal obligation under international humanitarian law. Prisoners of war who are suspected of committing war crimes should be prosecuted, in line with international standards. However, international law prohibits prosecuting them for mere participation in hostilities.
During my visit on Monday to Bucha, north of Kyiv, I saw the visible trail of destruction left following the Russian forces’ departure from the town in March. Bullet holes on the walls of houses. The town was retaken by Ukrainian forces within less than four weeks, but – six months on – the trauma of so many who lived, terrified, through that period, and others who lost loved ones, remains palpable.
Our presence here – the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine headed by Matilda Bogner – is today issuing a report that details the killings of civilians cutting firewood or buying groceries. The report documents the fate of 441 civilians in parts of three northern regions – Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy – that were under Russian control until early April. Bucha was the town hardest hit. We are working to corroborate allegations of additional killings in these regions, and in parts of Kharkiv and Kherson regions that were recently retaken by Ukrainian forces.
There are strong indications that the summary executions documented in the report constitute the war crime of wilful killing.
The victims and survivors of these violations have a right to truth, justice and reparation – accountability must be ensured as soon as possible. It is important to put in place programmes early on to provide compensation to victims and survivors, to fill the gap until those who are responsible meet their obligations.
What has also been deeply alarming is the questioning of international humanitarian law. We must remember that this area of law governing the conduct of hostilities emerged following the brutal Battle of Solferino in 1859 and was codified in the wake of the horrors of two world wars that started on this continent.
And let us not forget, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted in direct response to “the calamities and barbarous acts experienced by the peoples of the world during the Second World War”.
International humanitarian law is an important achievement of humanity and an obligation. My plea is to everyone engaged in hostilities to respect it fully, especially in the most difficult, most emotional circumstances. International humanitarian law is stronger than its violation by any  State. A violation by one party does not legitimize violations by another.
I urge justice for all victims, whoever they are, with respect for their dignity and humanity. The imperative for accountability is not altered by the affiliation of the victim or perpetrator. All allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law – by whomever and wherever committed - must be promptly investigated and brought to justice, under a fair and independent legal process.
Such an approach is also essential to strengthen the rule of law in Ukraine.
As one human rights defender I met this week said it is crucial for Ukraine to hold on tight to the values of a free society, grounded in respect for the rule of law and human rights, including the freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial, the freedom of religious belief, the right to social security – the whole host of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.
And not to lose them in the fog of war.
I impressed upon my counterparts the need to keep a constant eye on the vision for the day after. To prepare now for the kind of Ukraine that the people would like to live in once this war is over. There will be a better future.
For this, human rights must be the guide.
This means building social cohesion among the different communities and ensuring the rights of the most vulnerable; ensuring equal access without discrimination to essential services for those most in need – including people with disabilities and older people, with women the most deeply affected.
It means ensuring a fully functioning judicial system that delivers fair trials and justice to the people; ensuring that allegations of violations – recent violations and since 2014 – are acted upon with urgency and transparency, investigated and followed through with prosecutions; ensuring that laws under consideration are fully in line with international human rights standards.
Civil society must be free to thrive, express their opinions and help to build a society that is strong through diversity.
I have been encouraged by the openness of the authorities and their engagement with my Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. In addition to our monitoring work, we have also been providing advice on laws that require  amendment, including Law No. 2108-IX which in March introduced criminal liability for collaborating with an “aggressor State”. The law contains provisions that are vague, while imposing harsh penalties. We are calling for it to be amended to bring it in line with international standards, as mentioned in my meeting earlier this week with parliamentarians. My Office will follow up on this with specific recommendations. We have also shared our concerns with Parliament on the draft law on citizenship and the draft laws on media.
My Office in  Ukraine has been working here uninterrupted since 2014 – documenting and reporting, working with civil society, advising the Government on compliance with international law and how to respond to our findings. Our mandate includes monitoring and reporting on all violations committed on the territory of Ukraine, irrespective of the perpetrator.
It is important for us to have access to the occupied areas of Ukraine, from where we also continue to receive reports of violations. We have not had recent access, but continue to seek it.
My representative in Ukraine and the head of our monitoring mission, Matilda Bogner, will now speak to you in more detail about our report on killings in northern Ukraine.
On my part, let me stress that the most effective way to stop the running catalogue of cruelty from continuing is to bring an end to this senseless war – in line with the UN Charter and international law. My most fervent wish is for all people in Ukraine to enjoy the right to peace.

Title: Mr. Giles Duley appointed as the first United Nations Global Advocate for persons with disabilities in conflict and peacebuilding situations
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
05 December 2022
5 December 2022 — The United Nations appointed Mr. Giles Duley on 3 December, the International Day for Persons with Disabilities, as the first United Nations Global Advocate for persons with disabilities in conflict and peacebuilding situations.
Mr. Giles Duley is a documentary photographer, writer, storyteller and the CEO of the Legacy of War Foundation.
In 2011, while working in Afghanistan, Mr. Duley was severely injured by an improvised explosive device and was left a triple-amputee. He underwent dozens of operations and returned to Afghanistan to continue his work as a photographer the next year. His work focuses on the long-term humanitarian impact of conflict and seeks to drive change for people with disabilities through sustainable, localised projects, including in Ukraine where the Foundation has delivered specialised aid including wheelchairs, medical equipment and ambulances. The Global Advocate will speak to the immediate and long-term needs and rights of persons injured in conflict and living with disabilities in conflict and peacebuilding situations, including those affected by explosive ordnance. And he will ensure that the voices of those disabled by explosive ordnance are heard in the larger conversations on persons with disabilities in peacebuilding processes.
Mr. Duley will complement the work of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities. He will advocate for the universalization of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
The United Nations Secretary-General has stated: “There are more than one billion people with disabilities in the world. Realizing their rights is a matter of justice and investment in our common future. It is also central to realizing the core promise of the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind.”
The role will be administered by the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), Department of Peace Operations.

Title: FAO and Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food launch registration for machinery for loading and unloading grain sleeves
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
02 December 2022
Registration will take place in two stages until 11 December through the State Agrarian Registry
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), jointly with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, is implementing a programme to provide farmers with temporary grain storage solutions (grain sleeves). Thanks to the support of the governments of Canada, Japan and the Minderoo Foundation, Ukrainian farmers are benefiting from the use of over 30 000 grain sleeves with a capacity of 200 tonnes each, which is covering 30 percent of the national storage deficit.
In continuation of this programme, FAO and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food are launching the registration process for 105 sets of specialized equipment for the loading and unloading of grain sleeves. Each set consists of one loader, one unloader and one bunker.
Registration will take place in two stages: the first stage is dedicated to the registration of recipients of the equipment; the second stage involves the selection of the final recipients of the equipment as elected by agricultural producers who have benefited from the grain sleeves distributed via FAO’s programme.
The first stage will last until 11 December and is accessible through the following programme in the State Agrarian Registry (SAR): "Receiving equipment from FAO for loading sleeves for grain storage."
Within this stage, potential receivers (operators) of equipment who are ready to provide services for the loading and unloading of grain sleeves on a commercial basis can register their interest. Each applicant is required to provide information on the equipment already in their possession, the oblast to be served and the associated costs for the loading and unloading services.
The second stage will last from 4 to 11 December and is accessible through the following programme in the SAR: "Selection of the recipient of equipment – the provider of services for loading grain sleeves received from FAO."
Within this phase, recipients of grain sleeves from FAO can identify between one and three recipients for the machinery based on the official list generated during the first stage of the registration process. The farmers who recently received grain sleeves from FAO can formally identify the operators that they believe should receive the equipment and should also indicate the number of sleeves that they need to be loaded by the selected operator.
For the convenience of agricultural producers, the list of the potential machinery operators will be published on the websites of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food and the SAR.
In addition, FAO and the Ministry will hold a webinar at 11:00 on 2 December 2022 on the terms of participation in the programme.

Title: Statement at the end of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine’s visit to Kyiv
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
02 December 2022
Kyiv, Ukraine, 2 December 2022

Erik Møse, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine
On behalf of the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, composed of Erik Møse (chair), Jasminka Dzumhur and Pablo de Greiff, I want to welcome you to this press conference.
Since our first visit to Kyiv by the three Commissioners in June, our investigators have carried out several visits in Ukraine. The current visit is the tenth mission of the Commission.
In conformity with the Commission’s mandate from March this year, we have provided an oral update to the Human Rights Council on 23 September 2022 and submitted a written report to the General Assembly on 18 October 2022. It contained our findings concerning events during late February and March 2022 in the four regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy, as requested by the Human Rights Council. As you will know, the Commission found that war crimes had been committed in those regions.
Since then, the Commission has devoted more of its resources to the broader temporal, geographical, and thematic framework set out in our mandate. Investigations are on-going, and we are now preparing the Commission’s comprehensive report which will be submitted to the Human Rights Council in March next year.
This week we have had meetings with different stakeholders in Kyiv, including the Supreme Court of Ukraine, the Prosecutor General, the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, the Minister of Health, the Ministry for Reintegration of the Temporary Occupied Territories, the Ministry of Education and several other Ministries, government institutions and non-governmental organisations. This week also included meetings with diplomatic representations. In Odesa, the Commissioners met with the Deputy Prosecutor of Kherson region and internally displaced persons.

Jasminka Džumhur, Member of Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine
During this visit, the Commission devoted significant attention to the issue of the destruction of the civilian infrastructure of the country, particularly the destruction of its energy and transportation grids. Both are preconditions for accessing rights, and civilian infrastructure is protected by international humanitarian law. The Commission intends to examine this issue in detail and will return to it in its report to the Human Rights Council next March.
The Commission expresses concern about the devastating situation which continues to affect children’s rights and lives. The spectrum of their endangered rights is constantly multiplying. In addition to documented cases of violations to the personal integrity of children, mothers told us that children are facing challenges accessing education. Destroyed and demolished schools in many cases, especially in the zone of military operations, prevent physical access to education. Furthermore, the online education system established during the COVID-19 pandemic continued to be used as one of education models during the armed conflict. However, attacks on the energy system compromises this model’s effectiveness. Ensuring access to education for children in de-occupied regions, such as Kharkiv and Kherson, is a particular challenge.
Destruction and devastation of medical institutions by attacks prevents people to access health protection. Additionally, attacks on transport and energy infrastructure limit mobility of patients and indirectly reduces enjoyment of the right to health. Patients with chronic conditions and those who have need for urgent medical treatment are particularly affected by this situation.
Pablo de Greiff, Member of Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine
The Commission has long insisted that it would take a victim-centric approach to its work, and that this covers accountability in broad terms, including criminal justice, victims’ rights to truth and reparations, as well as guarantees of non-repetition. This is the notion of accountability contained in existing international legal instruments. Exchanges with stakeholders this week confirms the importance of this multidimensional conception of accountability.
The right to truth in the sense of full accounts of what happened to individual victims, or a more comprehensive account of the conflict, will require proper truth-gathering strategies and structures that may come later. In conflict situations, it is not uncommon to begin the process by the recovery of remains and information about missing persons.
In most cases of interstate conflict, ‘reparations’ is often understood mainly in terms of reconstruction, and there is certainly a lot of reconstruction to be done in Ukraine. But reparations go well beyond reconstruction. The establishment of a comprehensive reparations programs is a long-term process, which calls for consultations with those most affected. While its final design and implementation will take time, there are some immediate steps that can be taken by the Ukrainian government without exempting the Russian Federation from its responsibility. Victims have needs that require immediate attention. To this end, the establishment of a victims’ registry or a victim-friendly functional equivalent will facilitate access to support services, for example mental health and psychosocial support to those exposed to violence, including displaced persons.
Consistent with our mandate, we will continue to investigate violations of international human rights law, international humanitarian law and related crimes, and, where possible, seek to identify those responsible. National and international efforts being carried out in Ukraine for this purpose are well-known. The Commission continues to try to contribute to these manifold initiatives. It is important to note that the achievement of criminal justice in circumstances of conflict is a resource-intensive and time-consuming exercise. In its comprehensive report in March 2023, the Commission will also make recommendations concerning the various possible mechanisms of accountability.

ENDS

Title: FAO invites Ukrainian suppliers to participate in local tender for animal feed and supplements
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
28 November 2022
The applications should be submitted through the United Nations Global Marketplace (UNGM) by 12 December 2022
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has launched a national tender to procure animal feed and supplements to support vulnerable livestock keepers in rural areas of 13 oblasts of Ukraine.
The programme aims to cover over 27 000 households in Chernivetska, Dnipropetrovska, Donetska, Ivano-Frankivska, Kharkivska, Lvivska, Mykolaivska, Odeska, Poltavska, Ternopilska, Vinnytska, Zakarpatska and Zaporizka oblasts.
According to the recent FAO assessment on the impact of the war on rural households in Ukraine, around 64 percent of those involved in livestock production reported increasing difficulties in purchasing animal feed. As a result, many rural households are left with little choice than to resort to negative coping strategies such as selling productive assets and reducing expenses on animal feed and health supplements.
The provision of animal feed, mineral supplements and veterinary medicines is necessary for the survival of existing livestock and, most importantly, for preventing rapid animal destocking, especially in contact-line areas.
This activity is part of FAO’s Rapid Response Plan (March-December 2022) and aims to support the most affected rural livestock keeping households to meet the food and nutrition needs of their families. The activity has been made possible with the generous support of Australia, Belgium, the European Union, France, the Louis Dreyfus Foundation and the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund.
For this tender, potential suppliers are invited to submit offers for either the complete quantity or partial quantities of the following inputs for raising poultry, calves and pigs:
-          Crushed Wheat (3 209.1 tonnes in total);
-          Crush Corn (1 517.8 tonnes in total);
-          Universal protein-vitamin-mineral feed supplement (845.65 tonnes in total);
-          Starter protein-vitamin-mineral feed supplement (437.99 tonnes in total);
-          Grower protein-vitamin-mineral feed supplement (437.99 tonnes in total);
-          Finisher protein-vitamin-mineral feed supplement (1 094.975 tonnes in total);
-          Sunflower cake (1 583.85 tonnes in total).
In order to participate in the tender, suppliers are invited to apply through the United Nations Global Market Place www.ungm.org by selecting the following tender:
®    Procurement of animal mineral supplements and feed kits for Ukraine (open for Ukrainian suppliers only)

The closing date and time for the submission is 12 December 2022 at 09:59 CEST (10:59 Kyiv time).
The suppliers are required to be registered (https://www.ungm.org/Vendor/Registration). Detailed instructions on how to access FAO tender documents and submit the bid through UNGM can be downloaded from the UNGM Tender Management page.
On 1 December 2022 at 11:00 Kyiv time, FAO will hold an online conference for potential suppliers to present detailed information on submission requirements, respond to queries and review instructions for registration in the UNGM system. The link to the conference will be shared through the UNGM.

Title: Statement of the Secretary-General – on the renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
17 November 2022
I welcome the agreement by all parties to continue the Black Sea Grain Initiative to facilitate the safe navigation of export of grain, foodstuffs and fertilizers from Ukraine.
The United Nations is fully committed to supporting the Joint Coordination Centre so that this vital supply line continues to function smoothly. The United Nations is also fully committed to removing the remaining obstacles to exporting food and fertilizers from the Russian Federation. Both agreements signed in Istanbul three months ago are essential to bring down the prices of food and fertilizer and avoid a global food crisis.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative continues to demonstrate the importance of discreet diplomacy in the context of finding multilateral solutions.

Title: UKRAINE: HUMANITARIANS BRING WATER, FOOD, MEDICINES AND OTHER ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN KHERSON
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 November 2022
(Kherson) This morning, the United Nations, led by Humanitarian Coordinator Denise Brown, delivered supplies to help thousands of civilians in the city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, less than 72 hours after the Government of Ukraine regained control of the city. This is the first time that aid workers have been able to enter Kherson with humanitarian aid since Russian forces took control of the city in the first weeks of the war in early March 2022.
“The people of Kherson are struggling to meet their basic needs, only adding to the trauma of having endured months of constant bombardments, being forced to flee their homes, and seeing their loved ones being killed or injured,” Ms Brown said. “The people need urgent support, and we must act quickly to help them.”
The city faces a shortage of water and electricity, while markets are running low on food and health facilities lack medicines.
Today’s humanitarian convoy brought food, water, hygiene kits, shelter materials and critical household items, including bedding, thermal blankets and solar lamps, to more than 6,000 people in Kherson. A health centre in the city will also receive medicines to treat more than 1,000 patients over the next month.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) took part in today’s convoy.
The humanitarian community will continue to mobilize resources and supplies over the coming days to expand their operations and bring more aid to people in all areas of the Kherson region, which are now back under Ukrainian control. In recent weeks, life-saving items have already been delivered to more than 12,000 people in other towns and villages retaken by Ukraine in the Kherson region, including Novovorontsovka, Novooleksandrivka, Velyka Oleksandrivka and Vysokopillia.
So far this year in the Kherson region, humanitarian organizations have reached 100,000 people, most of them with cash assistance.
“With the support of our partners, particularly the local organizations, I am confident that we will be able to do much more in the days and weeks ahead,” Ms. Brown said. “We must stand with the people of Kherson in their hour of need.”

Title: Ukraine: FAO reinforces its presence to optimize technical and humanitarian assistance
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
04 November 2022
New agreement with the Government of Ukraine aims to bolster support for farmers.
Rome – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has reinforced its presence in Ukraine by signing an agreement with the Government to set up a Project Office that will facilitate and expand the provision of technical and humanitarian assistance to the country’s most vulnerable communities, especially in rural areas.
Ukraine joined FAO in 2003 and since 2015 the Organization has been operating in two strategic directions: emergency humanitarian response in conflict-affected oblasts and agricultural development across the whole country.
“Following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, FAO has scaled up its activities in the country to support agricultural production and food systems with the aim of protecting the food security of vulnerable households and communities across Ukraine,” said Laurent Thomas, FAO Deputy Director-General and signatory to the agreement on behalf of FAO. “This agreement will extend our cooperation in the country, increase Ukraine’s agricultural capacity and protect the food security of the most vulnerable Ukrainians, leaving no one behind.”
“On behalf of the Ukrainian people and our producers, I would like to thank FAO for the support that has been provided since the beginning of the large-scale invasion by Russia. The production and export capacities of the Ukrainian agricultural sector are being restored and the lives of the people to whom FAO provides assistance are also improving. I am convinced that, with the opening of the Project Office, the cooperation between FAO and Ukraine, which has been going on for many years, will gain new dynamics,” said Yulia Svyrydenko, First Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine and Minister for Economic Development and Trade of Ukraine, and signatory to the agreement on behalf of the Government of Ukraine.
Disrupted supply chains and rising prices
The impacts of the war in Ukraine have severely disrupted the country’s agricultural production and food exports, jeopardizing both local and global food security.
FAO’s Humanitarian Response Update points to the growing evidence that food supply chain disruptions and increasing prices in conjunction with reduced incomes have significantly affected access to and the affordability of food resulting in growing dependence on food assistance. The prices of basic goods, including food, have increased significantly across the country, particularly in areas that have witnessed active fighting. More than half of the rural households surveyed by FAO reported that, over the past three months, food has accounted for over half of their total household expenditure.
Major difficulties expected in the coming months in relation to agricultural production include low returns from the sale of products, access to fertilizers and pesticides, access to fuel and electricity with which to power agricultural and farm equipment, and access to animal health products such as veterinary drugs, animal feed and feed additives. Storage for harvested produce is also in critically short supply.
FAO’s ongoing support to Ukraine
“FAO is actively supporting smallholders and rural families who play a vital role in local food value chains,” noted Raimund Jehle, FAO Regional Programme Leader. “Smallholder farmers are currently being supported with winter wheat seeds to enable them to sustain production levels for the 2023 harvesting season, as well as grain sleeves with which to ensure that harvests from this season are suitably stored and protected. FAO is also supporting rural households with animal feed, multipurpose cash assistance and vouchers with which to purchase other essential agricultural inputs and tools”.
FAO's revised Rapid Response Plan (RRP) requires USD 115.4 million to assist almost one million people in rural Ukraine up to the end of 2022. FAO’s response includes providing crop and livestock inputs along with cash to support the most affected smallholder farmers and livestock holders to meet seasonal deadlines. This support will enable households to produce vegetables, cereal crops, milk, meat and eggs to feed their families.
To address the grain storage crisis, FAO has developed a Grain Storage Support Strategy (GSSS) requiring an additional $65 million. This extension to the RRP aims to deliver more than 4 million tonnes – or 25 percent of the estimated overall need – of grain storage capacity in Ukraine. The Strategy also includes the support of the State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection by strengthening government capacity for food commodity testing and certifications necessary for export at border facilities.
To date, FAO has raised almost $80 million against the combined total requirement of around $180 million under the RRP and GSSS. Additional resources are urgently needed to support vulnerable rural households, particularly in preparation for the approaching winter season.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL  --  REMARKS AT PRESS STAKEOUT
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
03 November 2022
Ladies and gentlemen of the media. Thank you very much for your presence.
I come today bearing a measure of good news – hopeful news in a world churning in turmoil.
It has been said that one might not always appreciate something until it is at risk or gone altogether.
Over the past few days, I believe the world has come to understand and appreciate the importance of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
For stemming the food crisis.  For easing prices and pressures on people around the world.  For reducing the risks of hunger, poverty and instability.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative is making a difference.
I am pleased to announce that, today, the Initiative has hit a new milestone.
As of today, ten million metric tonnes of grain and other foodstuffs have been shipped through the Black Sea corridor.
It has taken just three months to reach this milestone.
Despite all the obstacles we have seen, the beacon of hope in the Black Sea is still shining.  The initiative is working.
It is our collective responsibility to keep it working smoothly.
I thank President [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan and the Government of Türkiye for their crucial contribution for that to happen.
Now that the initiative has fully resumed, I appeal to all parties to concentrate efforts in two areas.
First, to renewal and full implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
Second, to removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian food and fertilizer.
I am fully committed – along with the entire United Nations system – to the achievement of both these essential objectives.
The world needs safe and unimpeded navigation for exports of grain, foodstuffs and fertilizer from Ukraine through the Black Sea.
And the world needs concerted efforts to urgently address the global fertilizer market crunch and make full use of Russian export capacity essential for that purpose.
High fertilizer prices are already affecting farmers around the world.
We cannot allow global fertilizer accessibility problems to morph into a global food shortage.
As we have been reminded in the last few days, all of this is crucial for people everywhere.
We have also some encouraging news from Ethiopia.
Two weeks ago, I stood before you and raised the alarm about the spiraling conflict.
Today, I am pleased to commend the Federal Government of Ethiopia and the Tigrayan People’s
Liberation Front for yesterday’s signing of a Permanent Cessation of Hostilities.
I salute the African Union’s High-Level Panel - President [Olusegun] Obasanjo, President [Uhuru] Kenyatta, and our former colleague Phumzile [Mlambo-Ngcuka] - for their work in facilitating this agreement.
It is a critical first step that paves the way for the unimpeded delivery of lifesaving humanitarian aid and the resumption of public services.
The human cost of this conflict has been devastating.
I urge all Ethiopians to seize this opportunity for peace and I pledge the full support of the United Nations.
From the Black Sea Initiative and the Ethiopian agreement, we can see that they are demonstrations of the power of multilateralism in action and the value of discrete – but determined – diplomacy.
We must never give up in the cause of peace and advancing the values of the United Nations.
That is the spirit that every country must bring to the UN Climate Conference, COP27, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.
COP27 must be the place to rebuild trust and re-establish the ambition needed to avoid driving our planet over the climate cliff.
In the last few weeks, report after report has painted a clear and bleak picture.
Emissions are still growing at record levels.
Instead of going down 45 per cent by 2030 as scientists tell us must happen -- greenhouse gas emissions are now on course to rise by 10 per cent.
Meanwhile, temperatures are on course to rise by as much as 2.8 degrees, with the present policies in place, by the end of the century.
And that means our planet is on course for reaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible and forever bake in catastrophic temperature rise.
We need to move from tipping points to turning points for hope.
That means urgently increasing ambition and trust – especially between North and South.
Specifically, it is time for an historic pact between developed and emerging economies.
A pact in which developed countries deliver on the commitment made in Paris and make an additional effort to reduce emissions in line with the 1.5-degree goal.
And a pact in which wealthier countries provide financial and technical assistance – along with support from Multilateral Development Banks and technology companies – to help emerging economies speed their renewable energy transition, as it is also necessary for us all.
COP27 must be the place to close the ambition gap, the credibility gap and the solidarity gap.
It must put us back on track to cutting emissions, boosting climate resilience and adaptation, keeping the promise on climate finance and addressing loss and damage from climate change.
Getting concrete results on loss and damage is the litmus test of the commitment of governments to help close all these gaps.
I travelled to Pakistan and witnessed one-third of the country under water – with lost lives, lost crops, lost hope.
There is no way anyone can argue there is no loss and no damage.
The world must come together to support developing countries and vulnerable communities.
At COP27, I look forward to launching an initiative to ensure every person on earth is protected by an early warning system within five years.
In short, COP27 must lay the foundations for much faster, bolder climate action now and in this crucial decade, when the global climate fight will be won or lost.
We need all nations and all people on board in these make-or-break next years, starting at COP27.
Thank you.

The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about the ongoing situation regarding the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
He has decided to delay his departure for the Arab League Summit in Algiers by a day to focus on the issue.
The Secretary-General continues to engage in intense contacts aiming at the end of the Russian suspension of its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The same engagement also aims at the renewal and full implementation of the initiative to facilitate exports of food and fertilizer from Ukraine, as well as removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian food and fertilizer.

Title: Accessing health care in Ukraine after 8 months of war: The health system remains resilient, but key health services and medicine are increasingly unaffordable
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 October 2022
Even as Ukraine marks 8 months of a brutal war, the health care system in Ukraine continues to function overall, but spiraling costs, logistical hurdles and damaged infrastructure are making access to essential services all the more challenging for growing numbers of civilians.
These are among the key findings of a recent health needs assessment conducted by the WHO Country Office in Ukraine, shared with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, international and national health partners, and humanitarian actors on the ground.
The assessment focused on identifying health needs and major barriers to access to primary and specialized care and medicines. The methodology took into account the correlation between income and access to specific categories of medical services and supplies for the 18-and-over population of Ukraine.
Some of the specific findings include insights from different geographic areas as well as the health needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The survey, conducted in September 2022, is the first such assessment since the start of the Russian invasion into Ukraine on February 24.
“People across Ukraine report that the major barriers to accessing health care are cost, time constraints to get to and from health facilities, as well as limited transport availability,” notes Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine and Head of the Country Office. “Chief among these is the cost of care. Those who are living in temporarily occupied territories and active combat areas remain the most vulnerable, with 1 in 3 reporting reduced access to services and medicines, compared to 1 in 5 people nationwide.”
“At the same time, the findings recognize that, as of now, the country’s health system remains resilient and overall access to some level of health services is still high,” adds Dr Habicht. “From those who sought care, 95% report having had primary care services and up to 90% had access to health services for chronic conditions. But upcoming wintertime challenges and the latest escalation in fighting could add to a significant burden on the health system, with thousands of civilians living in damaged homes without fuel or power, potentially vulnerable to a range of dangerous cold weather conditions, from frostbite to pneumonia. Another challenge is COVID-19 coupled with seasonal influenza, with a significant percentage of the population still unvaccinated for COVID – a worrying situation at a time when respiratory infections traditionally increase.”
Compounding this scenario are analyses, conducted by the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), that the war could push some 60% of the population, or even significantly more, below the poverty line. The WHO assessment clearly points to mounting economic woes that could further jeopardize the well-being of millions.
“The assessment’s results could support the Government and health partners to address critical gaps in designing an appropriate medium- and long-term response plan,” says Dr Habicht. "We will continue to partner closely with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to find optimal solutions. Even before the war, Ukraine’s health reform process was showing promising results. We must build on that. The commitment to universal health care is real. WHO is here to stay, to support the health system to expand access to health for all, no matter how daunting the challenges may be.”

Details of the health needs assessment
Health needs assessment (HNA) is a systematic method for reviewing health issues facing a population, leading to agreed priorities and policies by health care decision-makers and managers in the country.
Key findings in the assessment include:
Regarding access to medicine, the survey finds that, overall, 1 in 5 people (22%) were not able to get the medicine they needed. In temporarily occupied and active conflict areas, this increases to 1 in 3 people. The situation with IDPs is similarly challenging.
The types of medicines most frequently cited by respondents as difficult to obtain were:
The main reasons for not getting medicine included the increased price of medicine (84%) and the unavailability of medicines at the pharmacy (46%).
Households that consist only of women have significantly less income and higher expenses for health care services and medicines than households that include men. Household income, not surprisingly, affects the level of access to health care services.
Regarding access to primary care, those living in temporarily occupied and active combat areas tend to seek health care services less than those in other areas, while IDPs sought services significantly more often than non-IDPs.
Regarding access to care for chronic conditions, 1 in 3 respondents stated that either they or a member of their household have chronic disease and more than half of these groups (52%) sought health care for chronic conditions. The most common conditions were cardiovascular disease (61%), diabetes (25%) and kidney disease (21%). This is a trend WHO continues to see throughout the country. Also, women respondents tend to have higher needs for services and a better chance of getting needed care compared to men.
The second round of the health needs assessment is planned for December 2022 to monitor changes in the health needs of the population as winter intensifies across the country.

Current health response
In response to ongoing, urgent needs, WHO continues to bring life-saving medical supplies into the country. More than 1350 metric tons of supplies have been delivered to Ukraine since 24 February in coordination with the Ministry of Health. And WHO continues to bring in much-needed supplies to newly liberated areas as well, including the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. Areas including Izium, Lyman, Kharkiv and Sviatohirsk have been reached in the last few weeks with supplies.
Besides tangible medical and humanitarian supplies, WHO is also providing capacity-building and technical guidance to meet ongoing health needs. WHO has so far trained more than 11 000 healthcare workers on a range of issues, including trauma surgery, mass casualties, chemical exposure, epidemiology, and laboratory diagnostics.
Mobile health units supported by WHO continue to ensure that medical consultations can reach the most vulnerable and those who have returned to liberated areas. Our focus with partners has been to ensure extended primary care and support in managing chronic conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, in numerous oblasts.
WHO is also contributing to the National Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Programme launched by the First Lady of Ukraine to support the wider population. Nearly 10 million people at this time are estimated to be at risk of developing a range of mental health conditions, from severe anxiety and stress to post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal tendencies.

Title: UN Commission has found an array of war crimes, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 October 2022
NEW YORK/ VIENNA – Based on its investigations of the events in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy regions in late February and March 2022, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has found reasonable grounds to conclude that an array of war crimes, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in Ukraine. Given the gravity of the identified violations, there is an undeniable need for accountability, the Commission said on the day of submitting a detailed written report to the UN General Assembly.
“The impact of these violations on the civilian population in Ukraine is immense. The loss of lives is in the thousands. The destruction of infrastructure is devastating,” said Chair of the Commission Erik Møse.
The Commission documented attacks where explosive weapons were used indiscriminately in populated areas that were under attack by Russian armed forces. The Commission also found that Russian armed forces attacked civilians attempting to flee.
There are also examples of both parties to the armed conflict, although to different degrees, failing to protect civilians or civilian objects against the effects of attacks, by locating military objects and forces within or near densely populated areas.
Russian armed forces are responsible for the vast majority of the violations identified, including war crimes. Ukrainian forces have also committed international humanitarian law violations in some cases, including two incidents that qualify as war crimes.
The Commission documented patterns of summary executions, unlawful confinement, torture, ill-treatment, rape and other sexual violence committed in areas occupied by Russian armed forces across the four regions on which it focused. People have been detained, some have been unlawfully deported to the Russian Federation, and many are still reported missing. Sexual violence has affected victims of all ages. Family members, including children, were sometimes forced to witness the crimes.
These violations continue to have a devastating effect on civilians. Significantly, victims emphasised the essential role of justice and accountability. Family members who lost loved ones have expressed a strong need for justice to be done. A stepfather whose son was killed in Bucha told the Commission: “I used to want to find those who were responsible and kill them. But now I want the guilty to be put on trial and I want the truth to come out.”
In this regard, the Commission recommends enhanced coordination of international and national accountability efforts to improve effectiveness and prevent harm to victims and witnesses. The Commission, consistent with its mandate, will seek to contribute to the identification of those responsible.
The Commission visited 27 towns and settlements and has interviewed 191 victims and witnesses. Its investigators inspected sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture, as well as weapon remnants, and consulted a large number of documents and reports.
Having paid particular attention to violations committed in the four regions specified in the May resolution - Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy - the Commission will gradually devote more of its resources to the broader time scope, wider geographical and thematic framework as tasked by the March resolution.
Issues of interest will include possible violations in filtration camps, alleged forced transfers of people, conditions under which expedited adoptions of children are allegedly taking place, as well as changes in local administration and so-called referenda, the consequences of which are becoming clearer given recent events.
The full report as submitted to the UN General Assembly can be found here.
The Members of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine are available for interviews.
Background
The United Nations Human Rights Council created the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to investigate violations and abuses of human rights, violations of international humanitarian law, and related crimes that may have been committed in the context of the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The Commission is required to present its findings and recommendations, including on accountability of those responsible for the violations, to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2023. The Commission comprises Erik Møse (Chair), Jasminka Džumhur and Pablo de Greiff.

Title: Agrarians will receive more than 30 000 sleeves for grain storage: second call for applications is open
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
13 October 2022
The call for applications for grain sleeves support, opened for two weeks in late September, was closed on 9 October. In total, 1 494 applications have been received from small and medium-sized agricultural producers requesting a total of 30 120 sleeves for temporary grain storage.
Due to high interest among farmers for this support, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine (MAPF) and the Food and Organization of the United Nations (FAO) are opening a second call for applications for farmers who were unable to apply to the first call. The second call is open until 23 October through the State Agrarian Registry (SAR).
Under the terms of the programme, farmers must have the land area under official cultivation from 100 to 10 000 hectares, and use the received sleeves to store their own harvested products. At the same time, their status – as owner or leaseholder – is not important, as well as legal status: applications from both legal entities and individual entrepreneurs will be accepted. The key requirement is that the location of the cultivated lands must be in the government-controlled territories of Ukraine.
The selection and verification process of applications to the first call has already started, and in the coming days farmers will receive the confirmation of assistance through the SAR and will be notified of the address of the warehouse from which they should  collect their assigned sleeves.
The project is implemented jointly by MAPF and FAO, with the generous financial support of Canada, Japan and the Minderoo Foundation totalling USD 60.5 million. It is expected that the programme will cover 30 percent of the national need for the grain storage.

Title: Briefing note of Spokesperson for UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Ravina Shamdasani on Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 October 2022
The missile attacks by Russian armed forces yesterday which struck cities across Ukraine left at least 12 civilians dead and more than 100 injured in Kyiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia, and in Kyiv and Sumy regions. The location and timing of the strikes – when people were commuting to work and taking children to school – is particularly shocking.
We are gravely concerned that some of the attacks appear to have targeted critical civilian infrastructure. Many civilian objects, including dozens of residential buildings and vital civilian infrastructure – including at least 12 energy facilities – were damaged or destroyed in eight regions, indicating that these strikes may have violated the principles on the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law. Damage to key power stations and lines ahead of the upcoming winter raises further concerns for the protection of civilians and in particular the impact on vulnerable populations.
Attacks targeting civilians and objects indispensable to the survival of civilians are prohibited under international humanitarian law.
We urge the Russian Federation to refrain from further escalation, and to take all feasible measures to prevent civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.
Our Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine will continue corroborating information on civilian casualties resulting from these attacks, as well as documenting violations of human rights and international humanitarian law throughout the country.

Title: HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR DENISE BROWN CONDEMNS WAVE OF DEADLY ATTACKS ON UKRAINE TODAY

10 October 2022
I am horrified by the wave of deadly attacks by the armed forces of the Russian Federation on Kyiv, Dnipro, Lviv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and other cities across most regions of Ukraine this morning.
This new escalation of the war killed civilians as they were just beginning their week. 

The airstrikes hit densely populated urban centres while children were going to school, young people to the university, and others commuting to work. 

I send my most heartfelt condolences to the people of Ukraine, who have, for too long, endured the horrors of this war.

Despite today’s strikes, humanitarian assistance continued to be delivered to people in desperate need of support. 

Humanitarian aid will not stop. The United Nations and the entire humanitarian community are committed to staying and continuing our work to save lives and support people whose lives have been devasted by this war.

Title: Ukraine: 50,000 computers provided to teachers by Google and UNESCO
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 October 2022
As the global community marks the World Teachers’ Day, UNESCO and Google have begun distributing 50,000 computers to Ukrainian teachers to help them deliver distance learning. Training in digital tools will also be provided to them.
A new UNESCO’s expert mission deployed in Ukraine from 24 to 28 September has verified the urgent need for devices to support teaching and learning in the country.
Education is a fundamental right for every child. As ongoing fighting damaging education facilities continues to prevent many Ukrainian students from returning to school, we must provide distance learning tools ensuring learning continuity.
- Audrey Azoulay UNESCO Director-General
To respond to these needs, UNESCO, Google, and the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine have established a large cooperation to supply 50,000 computers for teachers. A first batch of 10,000 computers is currently being distributed to teachers in and around the Dnipro, Chernihiv and Sumy regions. The distribution will be extended to other regions of the country in the weeks ahead.
This is a great example of how the private sector can join forces with public institutions to build and provide sound solutions in times of crisis.
- Audrey Azoulay UNESCO Director-General
Moreover, UNESCO will support teachers in Ukraine by developing pedagogical skills for distance and hybrid learning. Google.org – the company's philanthropic arm – is supporting UNESCO to build a suite of resources and courses for teacher professional development. These resources will focus on mental health, psychosocial support, social and emotional learning, and digital pedagogical training.
As part of this agreement, Google will also provide schools in Ukraine with access to the Chrome Education Upgrade, allowing them to set-up and manage the devices remotely. And is working with local partners to deliver training in online tools to up to 200,000 teachers through a series of workshops and resources. Meanwhile UNESCO will offer full access to its many digital education resources.
According to the national authorities, 2,292 education institutions have been damaged and 309 have been destroyed in Ukraine since 24 February 2022 when the Russian offensive against Ukraine began. As a result, over 40% of Ukrainian schools started their new academic year online.
For seven months, UNESCO has supported the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, by providing its expertise and by mobilizing some 25 partners of its Global Education Coalition, including Google.
Many members have already implemented their commitments, including psycho-social counselling for teachers, scholarships for learners, no-cost access to accredited courses, translation of educational content, etc.

Title: IOM Delivers Critical Aid to Newly Accessible Areas in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
05 October 2022
Kyiv – Communities cut off from humanitarian aid are receiving life-saving assistance from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the first time since the start of the war in Ukraine.
In coordination with other humanitarian organizations, from 16 to 29 September, IOM delivered over 30,000 relief items in 23 trucks to five municipalities in Kharkiv region: Shevchenkove, Balakliia, Chuhuiv, Velykyi Burluk, and Izum. The assistance included solar lamps, bed linen, mattresses, blankets, family hygiene kits, as well as tarpaulin and kits with tools to help residents prepare their damaged homes for winter.
There are nearly 400,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the region of Kharkiv. Thousands of people remain without water, electricity or heating as the existing systems were damaged by recent fighting.
“Our emergency teams were among the first to reach these areas that have seen incredibly heavy fighting in recent weeks,” said Anh Nguyen, Chief of Mission, IOM Ukraine. “People there are in dire need of all kinds of humanitarian assistance, particularly to make their homes habitable for the harsh winter they are facing. We intend to scale up our response and ensure that no one is left behind.”
According to IOM’s latest data, out of over 6 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine, 82 per cent were forced to leave their homes in the east and south of the country. A total of 15 per cent of IDPs report that their housing is not adequate for winter, with as much as 23 per cent facing this challenge in the east.
In Kherson region, IOM delivered 1,200 emergency shelter kits for war-affected populations. The assistance was delivered to local authorities for further distribution in the municipalities of Vysokopillia and Mala Shesternia days after these areas became accessible.
‘’Working with IOM, we’ve been able to deliver shelter kits that can each repair 60 square metres of damaged homes,” said Yaroslav Yanushevich, Head of the Kherson Military Administration. “This is essential given the worsening weather conditions during the cold season.”
Emergency shelter repair kits include plywood, tarpaulin, wooden battens, roofing material, ropes, hammers, nails and other items.
“Every residential building here has been damaged, including damage to windows, walls or roofs,” says Andrii, who lives in the town of Novovorontsovka, Kherson Region, a locality scarred by recent heavy fighting. “There is ongoing fighting next to residential areas, but there are still civilians living here who are not able to leave and are in desperate need.”
This assistance was delivered thanks to funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the European Union.

Title: FRAUD ALERT: UN WARNS THE UKRAINIAN CITIZENS AND AID ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT SCAM SCHEMES USING THE NAME OF THE UKRAINE HUMANITARIAN FUND
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
29 September 2022
(Kyiv): The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has been made aware of various correspondences, being circulated via e-mail and other platforms, falsely stating that they are issued by the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund.
These scams, which are seeking to obtain money and personal details for supposedly legal services to receive benefits from the United Nations are fraudulent.
OCHA, which manages the Ukrainian Humanitarian Fund, wishes to warn the public and aid organizations, civil society organization and volunteer groups about these fraudulent activities and strongly recommend that the recipients of such solicitations to not provide any personal details and to not pay any fee for any organization promising humanitarian assistance.
• The United Nations does not charge a fee at any stage for humanitarian assistance.
• While United Nations organizations might ask for banking data to be able to transfer cash assistance, they will never ask for CVV (three-digit code on the card). Employees of partner organizations should not require it.
• Any citizen who provided the CVV to anyone, should contact his/her bank and block the card immediately. The case should be reported to the police.
OCHA wishes to use this opportunity to remind all Ukrainian citizens who need of assistance following seven months of war, that humanitarian aid is completely free. If someone asks you to pay, do something inappropriate or perform any favour or sexual action in exchange for help, say no and email seareferral@un.org or call our partner hotline 0-800-309-110 / 0-800-30-77-11 / 0-800-331-800.

Title: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is working with the Government and oblast authorities to repair and insulate damaged homes before the winter comes
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
29 September 2022
Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine Ms. Vereshchuk and UNHCR Representative Ms. Lindholm Billing visit homes repaired in Kyiv Oblast through UNHCR’s housing programme
Borodianka, Ukraine – Today, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories, Iryna Vereshchuk and UNHCR Representative in Ukraine, Karolina Lindholm Billing visited homes in the Borodianka raion of Kyiv oblast. The homes, which were damaged during shelling earlier this year, were repaired through the UNHCR housing programme in support of the local oblast authorities’ response.
Since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February, almost 14 million people fled their homes in search of safety, and more than 800,000 families have had their homes destroyed or damaged in missile attacks and shelling.
In close coordination with the Ukrainian government, its local authorities and communities, UNHCR identifies families with specific vulnerabilities, like older age, disability or low income, who need support to repair their homes. This is part of UNHCR’s contribution to the collective effort to provide people with access to dignified and warm housing during the winter.
Following the visit to the families whose homes were repaired, the Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereschchuk said: “We see with our own eyes how the territories of the Kyiv region are being restored and revitalised. Our strategy is to help them rebuild as soon as possible, to ensure safety and to provide them with everything necessary. The residents must be protected and must have the opportunity to heat their homes, buy food or medicine, and receive the services they need. In the Reintegration Plan that we developed together with UNHCR we have clear directions and understanding: who is responsible for what. Here, you can see the results – people get help and know that they are not left alone.”
“The needs across Ukraine are enormous, and UNHCR is committed to doing its part of the joint effort to address these needs. As the winter temperatures can plummet as low as –20 degrees Celsius in parts of the country, UNHCR is racing to repair as many homes as possible before the winter starts so people can stay warm in their homes.” said Karolina Lindholm, UNHCR Representative in Ukraine.
Note:
As part of its winterisation response, UNHCR aims to repair and insulate 8,200 houses through its programme of light and medium repairs, to create or improve 14,400 sleeping spaces in collective centres for IDPs who cannot return home and do not have the means to secure private accommodation. Some 337,000 people will receive cash support to cover increased costs associated with the winter period and 567,000 people will receive essential items like thermal blankets, thermoses and heaters. Overall, UNHCR aims to reach more than 940,000 vulnerable individuals in the winterization response to complement the Government’s efforts.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL -- REMARKS TO PRESS ON RUSSIAN DECISION ON ANNEXATION OF UKRAINIAN TERRITORY
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
29 September 2022
[as delivered]
The Kremlin has announced that a ceremony will take place tomorrow in Moscow that will launch a process of annexation of the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.
In this moment of peril, I must underscore my duty as Secretary-General to uphold the Charter of the United Nations.
The UN Charter is clear.
Any annexation of a State’s territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Principles of the UN Charter and international law.
The United Nations General Assembly is equally clear.
In its landmark Friendly Relations Declaration of 24 October 1970 —repeatedly cited as stating rules of general international law by the International Court of Justice —  the General Assembly declared that “the territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force” and that “no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal”.
And I must be clear.
The Russian Federation, as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, shares a particular responsibility to respect the Charter.
Any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned.
It cannot be reconciled with the international legal framework.
It stands against everything the international community is meant to stand for.
It flouts the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations.
It is a dangerous escalation.
It has no place in the modern world.
It must not be accepted.
The position of the United Nations is unequivocal: we are fully committed to the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders, in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions.
I want to underscore that the so-called “referenda” in the occupied regions were conducted during active armed conflict, in areas under Russian occupation, and outside Ukraine’s legal and constitutional framework.
They cannot be called a genuine expression of the popular will.
Any decision by Russia to go forward will further jeopardize the prospects for peace.
It will prolong the dramatic impacts on the global economy, especially developing countries and hinder our ability to deliver life-saving aid across Ukraine and beyond.
It is high time to step back from the brink.
Now more than ever, we must work together to end this devastating and senseless war and uphold the UN Charter and international law.
Thank you.

Title: UN Human Rights reports dire human rights situation seven months after the start of the Russian Federation wide-scale armed attack on Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
27 September 2022
Kyiv, 27 September 2022– The ongoing armed attack by the Russian Federation against Ukraine has had a devastating impact on the enjoyment of human rights across the country. A new periodic report prepared by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) highlights a wide range of violations of international human rights and international humanitarian law.
These affect both civilians and combatants and include willful killings and numerous cases of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance, torture and ill-treatment, and conflict-related sexual violence.
“Hostilities continue to kill and injure civilians as well as destroy and damage civilian infrastructure. Attacks on civilian objects not only endanger the lives of civilians, but also leave them living in degrading conditions and undermine their rights to health, education, housing, food and water,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of HRMMU.
From 24 February until 25 September HRMMU has recorded 5,996 civilian deaths and 8,848 injuries, including 382 children killed. The actual figures are much higher, as the collection and verification of information from several locations affected by hostilities remain severely hindered.
The report states that 90% of civilian casualties were recorded in areas under Government control when the casualties occurred and 10% in parts of Luhansk and Donetsk regions controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. The majority of civilian casualties documented since 24 February were caused by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.
During the reporting period, HRMMU continued to corroborate the alleged killings of hundreds of civilians by Russian armed forces while they controlled settlements in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv regions in February and March 2022. While most victims were men, they also included women and children.
According to the report, enforced disappearances and the arbitrary detention of local authorities, journalists, civil society activists and other civilians were widespread in territory controlled by Russian armed forces or affiliated armed groups, with 407 cases (359 men, 47 women and 1 boy) recorded during the reporting period. Among those cases, 18 victims (17 men and 1 woman) were eventually found dead. The report also highlights 47 cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, as well as 31 cases that may amount to enforced disappearance (28 men and 3 women) attributable to Ukrainian law enforcement bodies. The victims were people suspected of supporting Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups.
The report documents cases of torture and ill-treatment of civilian detainees by Russian armed forces. Out of 38 civilians released from detention (34 men and 4 women) and interviewed by HRMMU, 33 reported experiencing torture and ill-treatment while detained by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. The report also recorded 34 complaints of torture or ill-treatment in cases of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance reportedly perpetrated by law enforcement bodies of Ukraine.
“I stress that the prohibition of torture and arbitrary deprivation of life is absolute and applies in conflict and non-conflict settings to all persons, whether civilians or combatants. Perpetrators must be held accountable, and victims and their relatives must enjoy their rights to remedy and truth,” said Ms Bogner.
During the reporting period, HRMMU documented the rape of 8 women and 1 girl, 15 cases of sexual violence used as a method of torture or ill-treatment against men, 11 cases of forced public stripping against both men and women considered to be ‘lawbreakers’ and 8 cases of other forms of sexual violence, such as forced nudity, unwanted sexual touching, sexual abuse and threats of sexual violence. Thirty cases were committed by members of Russian armed forces, 2 cases were committed by members of Ukrainian armed forces or law enforcement bodies and 11 cases were committed by civilians or members of territorial defense units. Since the reporting period ended, HRMMU has verified 13 additional cases of sexual violence.
The report also covers the situation of prisoners of war. While during the reporting period, HRMMU enjoyed unimpeded access to places of internment for prisoners of war in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine, it was not granted confidential access to any place of internment for prisoners of war in the Russian Federation or territory controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. However, HRMMU found that in the vast majority of documented cases, Ukrainian prisoners of war were subjected to torture or cruel and degrading treatment by the detaining power. HRMMU also documented the death of two Ukrainian servicemen as a result of torture.
“Such mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war appears to be systematic, not only upon their capture, but also following their transfer to places of internment both in territory of Ukraine occupied by the Russian Federation and in the Russian Federation itself. This is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and the Russian Federation must address it,” Ms Bogner added.
HRMMU also found that some Russian prisoners of war were subjected to torture and ill-treatment by members of the Ukrainian armed forces mostly during their capture or while in transit to places of internment.
“There must be timely and effective investigations into all allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, including torture, ill-treatment, arbitrary detention and sexual violence. Regardless of their affiliation, perpetrators, including persons in positions of command, need to be duly prosecuted,” said Ms Bogner.
The report also describes the so-called process of ‘filtration’ of civilians by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. HRMMU received numerous allegations that men and women who were perceived as having ties with Ukrainian armed forces or state institutions, or as having pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian views, were subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment, and enforced disappearance.
While the report welcomes the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to investigate and prosecute violations of international humanitarian law and of international human rights law perpetrated in the context of the ongoing armed attack by the Russian Federation, it also documents numerous fair trial violations. The report also finds that ‘courts’ in self-proclaimed ‘republics’ sentenced civilians for conflict-related crimes in proceedings that lacked transparency, independence and impartiality.
According to the report, the hostilities have severely impacted the rights of people and groups in situations of vulnerability, including persons with disabilities and older persons, the majority of whom are women. HRMMU documented that in areas affected by hostilities, these groups lacked access to healthcare, adequate housing, heating, water and electricity.
During the reporting period, 17 journalists and media workers, including bloggers, were killed. Ten of them were killed amidst active hostilities, while others were found dead in areas previously or currently controlled by Russian armed forces or affiliated armed groups. The report emphasizes that freedom of expression, including access to media, has been restricted in areas occupied by the Russian Federation or controlled by Russian armed forces or affiliated armed groups.
“We are concerned that the shrinking civic space and highly restrictive environment in areas occupied by the Russian Federation deter people from reporting the human rights violations they have experienced or witnessed,” Ms Bogner said.
The report notes a deterioration of freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol (“Crimea”), occupied by the Russian Federation since 2014. The Russian Federation continues to clamp down on freedom of expression by applying restrictive, vague and ill-defined legislation, penalizing a wide spectrum of real or perceived criticism of the Russian Federation or its armed forces. HRMMU has documented the prosecution of 89 individuals in Crimea for “public actions directed at discrediting the armed forces of the Russian Federation” since the legislation was introduced in March 2022.
The report provides specific recommendations to the governments of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, as well as to the international community, and calls for their swift implementation to improve the human rights situation in the country, better protect civilians and strengthen accountability.
“We will continue to document and report the facts on the ground and give a voice to victims. We consider this to be an essential part of seeking to prevent further violations and hold those responsible accountable for the violations already committed,” Ms Bogner concluded.
HRMMU continues to seek first-hand information concerning international humanitarian law and human rights violations, and encourages victims and witnesses to contact:

Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 September 2022
With donors’ support, FAO and MAPF will provide farmers with 30 000 polyethylene grain sleeves
26 September 2022, Kyiv – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) together with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food (MAPF) announce the start of registration for receiving temporary grain storage equipment (sleeves) of 200 tons each. The programme is implemented with the financial support of the governments of Canada and Japan, and the Australian philanthropic organization Minderoo Foundation.
“Providing such assistance to Ukrainian farmers is part of the FAO Grain Storage Support Strategy, the purpose of which is to address the grain storage deficit,” said Pierre Vauthier, head of the FAO Ukraine office. “This is a critical intervention, the objective of which is to support Ukrainian farmers and contribute to global food security.”
In total, FAO and the Ministry will distribute 30 000 polyethylene grain sleeves. The grain storage equipment will be available for agriproducers: legal entities and individual entrepreneurs who cultivate land on the territory of Ukraine, except for temporarily occupied ones.
“The number of sleeves that the farmer will receive will be calculated according to the number of applications received and in proportion to the area of ​​cultivated land," said Markiyan Dmytrasevych, Deputy Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food.
Applications for participation in the programme have to be submitted through the State Agrarian Registry (SAR). Thanks to this system, farmers do not need to send a physical copy of the application or deliver it, and then check the correctness. It is enough to sign in to the personal electronic account at home, choose among the available support programmes the FAO programme to provide temporary grain storage equipment (sleeves), and fill in the appropriate electronic form.
The main criteria for programme participants:
-          land area under official cultivation (owned or leased) is from 100 to 10 000 hectares;
-          use the received sleeves exclusively for storage of their own-grown products;
-          the cultivated lands must be located in the government-controlled territories of Ukraine;
-          self-delivery of grain sleeves from warehouses in their or in the neighboring oblast (from Dnipropetrovska oblast for agricultural producers from Donetska, Luhanska or Zaporizka oblasts, or from Mykolaivska oblast for agricultural producers from Khersonska oblast).
Small and medium-sized agricultural producers are strongly encouraged to apply.
Application call will be open for two weeks till 9 October. After review and analysing of all received applications, the programme participants will receive confirmation of assistance via DAR, and will also be notified of the address of the warehouse for self-delivery of sleeves to the territory of the agrarian enterprise.
In addition, FAO and the Ministry will hold an introductory webinar where farmers will be able to ask any questions regarding registration and participation in the support programme.

Title: UN AND HUMANITARIAN PARTNERS STEP UP EFFORTS TO ASSIST OVER 150,000 PEOPLE IMPACTED BY RECENT HOSTILITIES IN KHARKIVSKA OBLAST
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 September 2022
Aid workers started deliveries of life-saving items just a few days after the Government of Ukraine announced it had regained control of the oblast
in mid-September
The humanitarian community has, over the last 10 days, dispatched the first part of a series of convoys with urgent relief supplies to areas of Kharkivska oblast that only recently became accessible to aid organizations.

“I visited some of these areas last week, including Balakliia, and I saw for myself the destruction and trauma caused by the war. In some areas, we have seen houses, health centres and schools damaged or destroyed. Authorities are working to repair the damages to the gas and energy systems, but thousands are still without supply. Making sure people are supported and have a warm and safe place to stay now that the cold season is upon us is a matter of life or death for thousands,” said the Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown. 

More than 73,000 people – nearly half of the population living in these areas – have already received food, and 12,000 hygiene kits have been distributed along with household items, including kitchen sets, solar lamps, and blankets to 15,000 people. Medicines, surgical and emergency health kits, enough to treat 10,000 people over the coming weeks, have been distributed to health centres across the areas. Deliveries of essential items will continue. 

The humanitarian community is working closely with national and local authorities, as well as volunteer groups, to deliver aid and help people who have endured the horrors of seven months of war. “The humanitarian deliveries are essential for immediate needs; treating the trauma and the fear will be much harder and take longer,” noted Denise Brown.

Title: UN Commission concludes that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine, expresses concern about suffering of civilians
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 September 2022
GENEVA, 23 September 2022 - Based on its investigations into events in the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has concluded that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine.
The Commission has documented violations, such as the illegal use of explosive weapons, indiscriminate attacks, violations of personal integrity, including executions, torture and ill-treatment, and sexual and gender-based violence. It also found that the rights of children have been violated.
On a visit to Ukraine in June 2022, the Commission observed first-hand the damage that explosive weapons with wide-area effects caused to residential buildings and infrastructure in populated areas, including schools and hospitals. A number of the attacks that the Commission investigated were carried out without distinguishing between civilians and combatants.
“We were struck by the large number of executions in the areas that we visited,” Erik Møse, chair of the Commission, said. “We are concerned about the suffering that the international armed conflict in Ukraine has imposed on the civilian population.”
He added that the Commission is currently investigating executions in 16 towns and settlements, and has received credible allegations regarding many more such cases. Common elements to these crimes included the prior detention of the victims and visible signs of execution, such as hands tied behind backs, gunshot wounds to the head, and slit throats.
Witnesses provided the Commission with consistent accounts of ill-treatment and torture carried out during unlawful confinement. Some of the victims reported that after initial detention by Russian forces in Ukraine, they were transferred to the Russian Federation and held for weeks in detention centres, where they were subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment.
The investigation into sexual and gender-based violence has shown that some Russian Federation soldiers committed such crimes. The age of victims of sexual and gender-based violence ranged from four to 82 years.
The Commission has also found that children were exposed to repeated explosions, violations, forced displacement and separation from family members, as well as other violations.
In the four areas where the investigation was conducted -- Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy -- the Commission processed two incidents of ill-treatment against Russian Federation soldiers by Ukrainian forces. While few in number, such cases continue to be the subject of the Commission’s attention.
The Commission visited 27 towns and settlements and has interviewed more than 150 victims and witnesses. Its investigators inspected sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture, as well as weapon remnants, and consulted a large number of documents and reports.
In the course of its investigation, the Commission met with Government authorities, international organisations, civil society, and other relevant stakeholders.
See: statement delivered to the 51st session of the Human Rights Council.

Background
The United Nations Human Rights Council created the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to investigate violations and abuses of human rights, violations of international humanitarian law, and other crimes that may have been committed in the context of the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The Commission is required to present its findings and recommendations, including on accountability of those responsible for the violations to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2023. Before then, the Commission will submit a report to the General Assembly in October 2022. The Commission comprises Erik Møse (chair), Jasminka Džumhur and Pablo de Greiff.

The Secretary-General warmly welcomes the exchange of more than 250 prisoners of war between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.
This is no small feat, but much more remains to be done to ease the suffering caused by the war in Ukraine. He commends the efforts of both parties.
He will continue to support any additional efforts that may be undertaken, including further exchanges under an “all for all formula" approach.
The Secretary-General reiterates the need for the full respect of international law, including international humanitarian law, with regard to the treatment of prisoners of war.

Title: Denmark contributes $3.6 million to protect women and girls' health and rights in Ukraine and Moldova
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
13 September 2022
The Government of Denmark has contributed 25 million Danish Krone (US$3.6 million) to UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, for its humanitarian response in Ukraine and Moldova. The funding will enable UNFPA to continue prioritizing the reproductive health and protection needs of women and girls affected by the war in Ukraine.
As the conflict enters its seventh month, UNFPA remains dedicated to upholding the rights of women and girls whose lives have been upended by the war. The vast majority of people who have fled the country are women and children, who urgently need health and protection assistance. In the last six months, UNFPA has reached over 6 million people with humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, including through the provision of more than 95 tons of sexual and reproductive health medicines and supplies distributed across Ukraine and Moldova, and the delivery of 25,000 dignity kits.
Denmark’s contribution will help support UNFPA’s humanitarian response to ensure safe births, reproductive health, and address gender-based violence and mental trauma among women and young people. With more than 530  attacks on health facilities in Ukraine, reported by WHO as of 12 September, pregnant women are being forced to leave war-torn areas and traveling to other regions of the country to seek help, where staff and supplies are increasingly scarce. UNFPA will scale up its sexual and reproductive health services and increase access to medical assistance for women and girls, particularly in conflict-ridden and hard-to-reach areas.
UNFPA is also scaling up and strengthening its mental health support , especially for women, girls and young people who have lost relatives, homes, education and career opportunities. UNFPA is running integrated psychosocial programmes to help improve the mental health and well-being of young people affected by the war. In Moldova, UNFPA-supported “Orange Safe Spaces” and mobile teams are offering immediate support and counseling to women and girls, and serve as an entry point for services and referrals for gender-based violence and reproductive health.
“This new contribution from Denmark will go a long way in assisting women and girls who are lacking access to quality reproductive health and protection services as a result of the war,” said Florence Bauer, UNFPA Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. “This will allow UNFPA to continue prioritizing the unique needs of women and girls in the midst of conflict.”
The war in Ukraine is having a devastating impact on the lives of women and girls, in Ukraine, and around the world. UNFPA requires flexible resources to meet the needs of women and girls and to safeguard their rights and choices. In 2021, Denmark was the sixth-highest core contributor to UNFPA. The country has been a longstanding partner in support of UNFPA’s humanitarian action to end gender-based violence and protect sexual and reproductive health and rights.
“More than 6 months of war have taken a dramatic toll on the people of Ukraine,” said Mr. Flemming Møller Mortensen, Minister for Development Cooperation and Minister for Nordic Cooperation of Denmark. “Denmark supports UNFPA in prioritizing the protection and reproductive health needs of women and young people affected by the war.”

Title: Media briefing by Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine Matilda Bogner
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
09 September 2022
Good morning,
Today I am joining you from Odesa – a city in the south of Ukraine where the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission has been present since 2014. Every day, we speak to people across the country and hear from victims who have suffered human rights violations in the context of the armed conflict, which escalated following the armed attack of the Russian Federation.
We will be publishing our next report later this month but let me give you an update on some of our recent findings.
To date we have corroborated 14,059 civilian casualties: 5,767 civilians were killed and 8,292 injured by hostilities. As we have repeatedly said, we know that actual numbers are likely considerably higher.
Since 24 February, our Mission has verified that at least 416 people have been victims of arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances in territory occupied by the Russian Federation or in areas controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups at the time. Of those, 16 were found dead and 166 released. We also documented 51 arbitrary arrests and 30 more cases that may amount to enforced disappearance perpetrated by Ukrainian law enforcement bodies.
We have documented a range of violations against prisoners of war. We have been granted unimpeded access to places of internment and detention in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine. However, the Russian Federation has not provided access to prisoners of war held on its territory or in territory under its occupation, including areas controlled by its armed forces and affiliated armed groups.
This is all the more worrying since we have documented that prisoners of war in the power of the Russian Federation and held by the Russian Federation’s armed forces or by affiliated armed groups have suffered torture and ill-treatment, and in some places of detention lack adequate food, water, healthcare and sanitation. We received information about a dire health situation in the penal colony in Olenivka, where many Ukrainian prisoners of war reportedly have been suffering from infectious diseases, including hepatitis A and tuberculosis. We have also documented many cases where Ukrainian prisoners of war have not been allowed to contact their relatives to tell them of their capture, their location and their health condition. This leaves families of captured soldiers desperate for information, deprived of their right to know what has happened to their loved ones.
We have also been following the cases of several pregnant prisoners of war interned in places controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. We urge the Russian Federation, as the detaining power, to consider the immediate release of these women on humanitarian grounds.
In Government-controlled territory, we have also documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war, usually upon capture, during initial interrogations or transportation to camps for internment. Our Mission has been able to visit a Ukrainian prisoner of war camp. We note, however, that most prisoners of war continue to be held in penitentiary facilities, violating the rule that prisoners of war shall not be interned in close confinement.
While Crimea, occupied by the Russian Federation since 2014, has received less attention in recent months, we have seen a significant deterioration in the situation there. This includes restrictions on the exercise of fundamental freedoms, torture and ill-treatment, enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests, and violations of the right to a fair trial, as well as lack of accountability for such human rights violations. We are concerned that patterns of human rights violations documented in Crimea since 2014 may be repeated in territory newly occupied by the Russian Federation across Ukraine.
In Crimea, the Russian Federation continues to clamp down on freedom of expression by applying vague and ill-defined legislation, penalizing real or perceived criticism of the Russian Federation and its armed forces. Since March, we have documented the prosecution of 89 individuals in Crimea for – and I quote - “public actions directed at discrediting the armed forces of the Russian Federation”.
Teachers in Crimea who refused to endorse the so-called – and I quote - “special military operation” face retaliation and sanctions. Human rights defenders have been arrested and prosecuted for their work, and defence lawyers intimidated. We have documented arbitrary arrests and torture of individuals apprehended in the Russian-occupied Kherson region and transferred to Crimea. In addition, men who cross the administrative boundary line from mainland Ukraine to Crimea have been subjected to so-called ‘filtration’ by the Russian Federal Security Service at checkpoints. According to credible reports received by our Mission, this exposes them to the risk of enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrest, torture and ill-treatment.
Crimean Tatars continue to face intimidation and harassment, police raids and house searches, and prosecution under terrorism and extremism-related offences in proceedings, which often fall short of human rights standards. Furthermore, Crimean Tatar detainees continue to be deported to remote areas of the Russian Federation to serve their sentences.
The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine will continue to document and report the facts on the ground and the voices of victims. We consider this to be an essential part of seeking to prevent further violations and to hold those accountable for the violations already committed. More of our findings on the impact of the armed attack by the Russian Federation on human rights in Ukraine will be presented in our next report, which will be issued on 27 September.
Thank you.

Title: Minderoo Foundation contributes to FAO’s Grain Storage Support Strategy
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 September 2022
A new USD 3 million Minderoo Foundation funded project will cover storage of 264.4 thousand tonnes of grain and oilseeds
8 September 2022, Kyiv – A new USD 3 million project, funded by Australian philanthropic organization Minderoo Foundation, is contributing to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Grain Storage Support Strategy, which is being implemented closely with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine.
“Providing farmers with temporary granaries for storing this year's harvest is a very important and timely decision, as part of the granaries was destroyed or damaged," said Markiyan Dmytrasevych, Deputy Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food. “One of the requirements for farmers for receiving such assistance is registration in the State Agrarian Register, recently launched by the Ministry."
“The Minderoo Foundation funded project will allow for an additional 264.4 thousand tonnes of grain and oilseed storage in Ukraine and strengthen the efforts of the Government of Japan and Canada, aiming to cover grain storage between 2022-2023 along with related technical support and equipment,” said Pierre Vauthier, Head of FAO Ukraine Office.
With the funds of the Minderoo Foundation – the first private source of funding for the Grain Storage Support Strategy – FAO will deliver temporary storage equipment across Ukraine.
Minderoo Foundation Chairman Dr Andrew Forrest AO said the philanthropic organization he and his wife Nicola Forrest AO started in 2001 had a mission to arrest unfairness and create opportunities to better the world.
“Vulnerable nations, such as those in Northern Africa and Central Asia, rely on crops grown in Ukraine to feed their people,” Dr Forrest said. “The longer-term impact of our partnership with FAO will be strengthening food security at the household level in Ukraine, protecting the livelihoods of Ukrainian farmers and ensuring other dependent countries access to adequate supplies of grain, at a manageable cost.”
“People across the world are going hungry and suffering unnecessarily through no fault of their own,” Mrs Forrest, the Co-Chair and Co-Founder of Minderoo Foundation added. “We hope our support helps to alleviate this. We at Minderoo Foundation stand resolute in our support of Ukraine and the brave Ukrainian people.”
To date, with the additional funds from Minderoo Foundation, FAO has raised USD 60 million against the total of USD 65 million requested for the implementation of the Grain Storage Support Strategy.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL REMARKS TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON UKRAINE - ZAPORIZHZHIA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
07 September 2022
Mr. President, Excellencies,
Thank you for convening this briefing on developments in and around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Southern Ukraine.
I want to salute the courageous efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the mission led by Director-General Grossi.
Allow me to also thank the parties for their cooperation.
I will leave it to Director General Grossi to provide an overview of what he and his team observed during their stay.
The United Nations Secretariat proudly supported the IAEA in its critical mission to ensure the safe operation of the plant.
I want to personally thank all the colleagues assisting their mission, especially the 13 UN support and security professionals who played an essential role to allow for the successful deployment of the IAEA mission.

Mr. President,
I remain gravely concerned about the situation in and around the Zaporizhzhia plant, including reports of recent shelling.
Let’s tell it like it is:
Any damage, whether intentional or not, to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia – or to any other nuclear facility in Ukraine -- could spell catastrophe, not only for the immediate vicinity, but for the region and beyond.
All steps must be taken to avoid such a scenario.
Common sense and cooperation must guide the way forward.
Any action that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant is unacceptable.
All efforts to re-establish the plant as purely civilian infrastructure are vital.
As a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces must commit not to engage in  any military activity towards the plant site or from the plant site.  The Zaporizhzhia facility and its surroundings must not be a target or a platform for military operations.
As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarized perimeter should be secured.  Specifically, that would include a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it.
Operators at the plant must be able to carry out their responsibilities, and communications must be maintained.
Now is the time to urgently agree on concrete measures to ensure the safety of the area.

Mr. President,
Regrettably, last month, the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, fell victim to the war in Ukraine.
The outcome document sought to address the issue of the safety and security of nuclear power plants in armed conflict zones, including in Ukraine.
But the Conference failed to reach consensus to utilize the opportunity to strengthen the Treaty.
I appeal to all states to use every avenue of dialogue and diplomacy to make progress on these critical issues.

Mr. President,
Looking ahead, I trust that the IAEA experts now deployed to Zaporizhzhia will be able to carry out their work without hindrance and contribute to ensuring lasting nuclear safety and security in the plant.
All of us have a stake in the success of their critical mission.
Let us commit to do everything we can to support them.
And let us resolve to keep working for peace in line with international law and the United Nations Charter.
Thank you.

Title: Treating diabetes: WHO delivers insulin to hospitals in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
02 September 2022
WHO has delivered more than 26 metric tonnes of insulin pens to hospitals throughout Ukraine in an effort to ensure that people with living diabetes can improve their quality of life.
It is estimated that over 9% of the population in Ukraine is living with diabetes mellitus, a condition that can cause costly and debilitating complications including heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, blindness and lower-limb amputations if untreated.
“Access to insulin can save lives and prevent the development of disabling complications,” explained Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine. “WHO is stepping up its efforts with the Ministry of Health to respond to mounting health needs throughout Ukraine. It is vital that access to insulin and other medicines is made available during these challenging times, as the coming months could test Ukraine’s health system as never before.”
More than 370 000 insulin pens are being disseminated to hospitals in the Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Rivne, Ternopil, Volyn, Zakarpattya and Zaporizhzhia regions. The donations were made possible with support from the pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk and the nongovernmental organization Direct Relief.
Supplying medical facilities and pharmacies with insulin requires a well functioning logistics system to comply with the necessary storage and transportation conditions, in particular the cold chain. WHO is making every effort to provide vital insulin as soon as possible and in full to all patients, including children, who need this therapy.
Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death globally. More than 420 million people are currently living with diabetes, and this number is estimated to rise to 570 million by 2030 and to 700 million by 2045.

Title: WHO delivers ambulances to Ukraine amid ongoing attacks against health care
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
02 September 2022
WHO has delivered 11 ambulances to Ukraine as part of its ongoing humanitarian efforts to save lives and reconstruct the health system in the country.
More than 30 ambulances have now been donated to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine by WHO and its partners since 24 February 2022. More first aid ambulances are set to be delivered later this year.
“These ambulances will save lives and go a step further in ensuring that timely access to emergency care during the war is strengthened and maintained,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine, at a handover ceremony alongside the Minister of Health of Ukraine, Dr Viktor Liashko.
“These ambulances ensure that first aid can reach patients who need medical transportation. As of today, WHO has verified over 500 attacks against health care in Ukraine and many of those attacks have affected the medical transport capacity of the country’s health system. Our ongoing support to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine to empower health-care workers and rebuild the health-care system will continue amid the war.”
The first aid ambulances will be handed over to the Lviv Emergency Medical Service Department and will then be distributed throughout Ukraine.
The Minister of Health emphasized that support from international partners is a powerful tool in sustaining the country’s entire medical system during wartime.
“Emergency health-care workers are the first ones to arrive at the scene of an accident and do everything they can to save people’s lives. Thanks to modern ambulances, health-care workers not only provide timely transport for people who are injured or in critical condition from the accident scene to a medical facility, but also stabilize their condition during transport,” said Dr Liashko.
“Emergency medicine centres and ambulances are also involved in the process of medical evacuation of patients overseas. This component is very important to the proper functioning of the medical system as a whole. We are grateful to WHO for its continued support for our health-care workers because every day each of us does everything in their power to save the lives of Ukrainians affected by the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.”
The donations were made possible with support from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund and allocated through WHO.
WHO has delivered more than 1300 metric tonnes of life-saving medical supplies to Ukraine since the war began. Deliveries include power generators, ambulances and oxygen supplies for medical facilities; supplies for trauma and emergency surgeries; and medicines to help treat noncommunicable diseases.

Title: URGENTLY NEEDED LIFE-SAVING SUPPLIES DELIVERED TO PEOPLE IN MYKOLAIV
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
30 August 2022
Humanitarian organizations carried out a joint mission and delivered urgently needed life-saving supplies to people in Mykolaiv as part of efforts to scale up support for over 550,000 people in need across Mykolaivska oblast.
Yesterday, the last of the six truckloads of humanitarian assistance for 3,000 people sent over the past week arrived in Mykolaiv. These deliveries provided by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the World Food Programme (WFP) will help ensure that aid workers on the ground can reach people with food, necessary household items and other non-food items. The trucks also brought medical supplies that will be distributed by local authorities to enable hospitals in the city to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients.
Also yesterday, during the visit led by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, representatives of UN agencies and NGOs met with oblast and local authorities to ensure the continuous coordination and alignment of the relief operations carried out by different actors and to identify gaps. The mission also met with local NGOs implementing most activities to help people in dire need who have now lived through six months of the war.
The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, highlighted the importance of yesterday’s and other missions to understand the needs of the people living in the most-affected oblasts. “We know first-hand what the remaining residents of Mykolaiv have to go through on a daily basis. On the visits to the city and surrounding areas, my colleagues have seen people, most of whom are older, with empty bottles desperately trying to find a water distribution point,” she said.
The latest deliveries represent only a fraction of what humanitarian partners have been providing to support the most vulnerable people, who had no choice but to stay in Mykolaiv. “The city is completely cut off from the centralized water supply,” reminded Ms. Brown. Medical services are also becoming increasingly limited in Mykolaiv, and the city now hosts less than half of its pre-war population of nearly 500,000.
Since the start of the war, humanitarian organizations have provided aid to over 540,000 people across Mykolaivska oblast. The work increased in scale in August. WFP has delivered food parcels to cover the needs of over 150,000 families for a month. UNICEF has distributed hygiene supplies for 59,000 people, including 11,000 children, as well as medical equipment and medicines to a hospital in Mykolaiv. Water management companies in Mykolaivska oblast have received purifying chemicals that will allow them to provide safe water to 26,000 people. Also, non-food items, including blankets and solar lamps, were delivered by UNHCR and are expected to benefit over 900 people. And UNHCR has provided refrigerators, cooking appliances, washing machines and fans to centres hosting internally displaced people. Other aid partners working in Mykolaivska oblast continue to provide other types of assistance, such as trucking in water to Mykolaiv city.
“We are working non-stop to sustain and increase our support in Mykolaivska oblast but also to other areas heavily affected by Russia’s war on Ukraine. The humanitarian community is already prepositioning supplies to meet the current needs and help people prepare for the upcoming cold months. We will do all we can to ensure that the most vulnerable receive the assistance they require and deserve. They will not be left behind,” Ms. Brown added.

Title: THE KILLING OF CHILDREN IS SHOCKING: DENISE BROWN, HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, ON THE STRIKE IN CHAPLYNE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
25 August 2022
I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine.
Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or travelling with their families. Yes, they should have been safe and they were not.
On behalf of the United Nations and the humanitarian community in Ukraine, I send our most heartfelt condolences to those who lost their loved ones, and I wish a speedy recovery to the people injured.
The human toll of the attack in Chaplyne is just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine. Yesterday, several other attacks across the country also killed civilians. Recent days have also seen intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, in Dnipropetrovska oblast, where hostilities have left a path of destruction, with dozens of houses damaged, as well as schools, shops and pharmacies.
In the six months since Russia’s invasion, Ukrainians have continued to see their loved ones killed, injured and traumatized, their families separated, and their homes, schools and hospitals attacked. Yet, in times of war, civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.
All parties, without exception, must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure so that they are protected, their houses preserved, and essential services remain.

Title: HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR DENISE BROWN TO MEET PEOPLE UPROOTED BY THE WAR IN EASTERN AND CENTRAL UKRAINE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
25 August 2022
WHO:
WHAT:
WHEN:
WHERE:
United Nations Assistant Secretary-General Denise Brown is starting today a three-day mission to eastern and central Ukraine to see first-hand the humanitarian impact of the war and efforts undertaken by humanitarian organizations in the country to support the people affected. This will be Denise Brown’s first visit to eastern Ukraine since she assumed her role as Humanitarian Coordinator for the country, in late July.
In Kryvyi Rih, Mrs. Brown is expected to meet people uprooted by the war and local authorities. The city is now home to more than 70,000 people who had to flee the horrors of the war in the east and in the south. In Kharkiv, where attacks and shelling have, once again, intensified over the last week, Mrs. Brown will visit a collective centre hosting people who lost their houses in the city or had to flee from other parts of Kharkivska oblast. She will meet humanitarian partners and authorities to discuss the response efforts and address possible gaps.
On the last day of her visit, Assistant Secretary-General Denise Brown will be in Dnipro, which hosts the Humanitarian Hub coordinating life-saving operations in eastern Ukraine. She will have the opportunity to discuss with humanitarians the planned efforts to support people during the upcoming winter and the challenges faced by aid workers to provide assistance in areas close to the front line and areas beyond the control of the Government of Ukraine.
Six months since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, nearly 18 million people – around 40 per cent of the country’s entire population – need humanitarian aid. With the winter approaching, the situation will get even worse. Many are living in damaged houses and the lack of access to gas or electricity in large parts of the east becomes extremely concerning and could be a matter of life or death if people cannot heat their homes. The United Nations and humanitarian organizations, most of them Ukrainian national NGOs, reached more than 12 million people with critical aid since 24 February.

Title: Secretary-General's remarks to the Security Council - on Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 August 2022
[as delivered]
Mr. President, Mr. President of Ukraine, Excellencies,
Today marks a sad and tragic milestone – six months since Russia’s 24th of February invasion of Ukraine.
During this devastating period, thousands of civilians have been killed and injured, including hundreds of children.
Countless others have lost their family members, friends and loved ones.
The world has seen grave violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law committed with little to no accountability.
Millions of Ukrainians have lost their homes and their worldly possessions, becoming internally displaced or refugees.
With the onset of winter, humanitarian needs continue to rise rapidly with millions of people in need of assistance and protection.
As these needs skyrocket, it is imperative that humanitarian actors in Ukraine have safe and unhindered access to all people requiring assistance, no matter where they live.
Mr. President,
The consequences of this senseless war are being felt far beyond Ukraine.
We are seeing new vulnerabilities emerge in a global environment already worn out by conflicts, inequality, pandemic-induced economic and health crises, and climate change – with a disproportionate impact on developing countries.
The acceleration of already high food, fertilizer and fuel prices has triggered a global crisis that could drive millions more into extreme poverty, magnifying hunger and malnutrition, while threatening to raise the global humanitarian caseload to new highs and erase hard-won development gains.
Vulnerable communities are grappling with the largest cost-of-living crisis in a generation and high commodity and transportation costs are having major repercussions for existing humanitarian operations.
Mr. President,
Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo will brief the Council on the impact of the armed conflict in Ukraine, both inside and outside the country over the past six months.
As I mentioned on Monday, I wanted to take this opportunity to provide a brief update on my recent travel to Ukraine.
I would like to have been able to do the same yesterday based on my experience in discussions about Zaporizhzhia, but unfortunately I was out of New York with a [inaudible] planned that was impossible to change at such a short notice.
My visit was an important opportunity to follow up on the landmark deal that has brought a measure of hope, especially to developing countries and millions of vulnerable people bearing the brunt of the global food crisis, some of them on the edge of famine.
I can report to the Council that the Black Sea Grain Initiative, signed in Istanbul in July, is progressing well – with dozens of ships sailing in and out of Ukrainian ports, loaded so far with over 720,000 metric tonnes of grains and other food products.
This deal would not have been possible without the constructive approach of both Ukraine and Russia and the efforts of the government of Türkiye.
During my visit to Lviv, I met with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Turkish President Erdogan.
I thanked them for their continued engagement to support the implementation of the Initiative to ensure the safe passage of Ukrainian food products and fertilizers to those in need and to the world at large.
I was filled with emotion visiting the port of Odesa and the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul.
On my visit to Odesa, I went aboard a bulk carrier called the MV Kubrosli Y as it was being loaded with about 10,000 metric tonnes of wheat.
It was deeply moving to peer into the hold of this cargo ship and see wheat pouring in.
Even if in a limited way, the storied port of Odesa – which had been paralyzed for months – is slowly coming to life thanks to the Initiative.
In Istanbul, I saw the WFP-chartered ship, the MV Brave Commander.
It was proudly flying the UN flag with its cargo destined for the Horn of Africa where millions of people are at risk of famine.
I then had the opportunity to walk up the long and narrow gangway of the SSI Invincible II heading to pick up Ukrainian grain in the port of Chornomorsk.
The vessel will carry one of the largest hauls of grain leaving Ukraine to date – more than 50,000 metric tonnes.
Mr. President,
Just a few weeks ago, much of this would have been hard to imagine.
We are seeing a powerful demonstration of what can be achieved, in even the most devastating of contexts, when we put people first.
As I stressed in Odesa and Istanbul, what I saw was the more visible part of the solution.
The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded access to global markets of Russian food and fertilizers, which are not subject to sanctions.
It is critical that all governments and the private sector cooperate to effectively bring them to market.
Together with the task team led by Rebeca Grynspan, I will continue my intense contacts for that purpose.
In 2022, there is enough food in the world – the problem is its uneven distribution.
But if we don’t stabilize the fertilizer market in 2022, there simply will not be enough food in 2023.
Many farmers around the world are already planning to reduce areas for cultivation for next season.
Getting much more food and fertilizers out of Ukraine and Russia at reasonable costs is vital to further calm commodity markets and lower prices for consumers.
I once again commend the parties for their engagement in this process and urge them to continue to build on this progress.
I also renew the call I made in Odesa for a massive scaling up of support to the developing countries getting hammered by the global food crisis.
The shipment of grain and other foodstuffs is crucial, but it won’t mean much if countries cannot afford them.
Developed countries and International Financial Institutions must do more to ensure that developing countries can fully capitalize on the opportunities of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
Mr. President,
Despite progress on the humanitarian front, fighting in Ukraine shows no signs of ending, with new potential areas of dangerous escalation appearing.
Two places were ever-present in my mind – and in my discussions in Ukraine — Zaporizhzhia and Olenivka.
I remain gravely concerned about the situation in and around Europe’s largest Nuclear Power Plant in Zaporizhzhia.
The warning lights are flashing.
Any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant are simply unacceptable.
Any further escalation of the situation could lead to self-destruction.
The security of the Plant must be ensured, and the Plant must be re-established as purely civilian infrastructure.
In close contact with the IAEA, the UN Secretariat has assessed that we have in Ukraine the logistics and security capacity to support any IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant from Kyiv, provided both Russia and Ukraine agree.
I welcome expressions of support for such a mission and urge that to happen as soon as possible.
Mr. President,
I am deeply disturbed by the allegations of violations of International Humanitarian Law and violations and abuses of human rights related to the armed conflict.
International Humanitarian Law protects prisoners of war.
The International Committee of the Red Cross must have access to them wherever they are held.
The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine -- and the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine -- continue to monitor, document and report with a view to supporting the investigation of alleged violations.
Work is also ongoing to deploy the recently established Fact-Finding Mission to Olenivka to look into the incident on 29 July.
This mission must be able to freely conduct its work - to gather and analyze necessary information - and to find the facts.
It is imperative that the mission has safe, secure and unfettered access to all relevant places and persons and to all relevant evidence without any limitation, impediment or interference.
Mr. President, Excellencies,
On this 31st anniversary of Ukraine’s independence, I wish to congratulate the Ukrainian people.
The people of Ukraine and beyond need peace and they need peace now.
Peace in line with the UN Charter.
Peace in line with international law.
Thank you.

Title: After six months of war, Ukraine’s life-saving health system prepares for a challenging winter ahead
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 August 2022
Health authorities and WHO strategize on how best to support critical health needs going forward

Kyiv – At the six-month mark of the war in Ukraine, the country’s badly affected but still-resilient health system is taking stock of lessons learned in providing life-saving care with the support of WHO and partners as it prepares for a challenging winter ahead.
“Six months of war have had a devastating impact on the health and lives of Ukraine’s people, but despite many challenges the health system has managed to survive and deliver care where and when it is needed most,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Though shaken, the health system has not collapsed. WHO continues to support the Ministry of Health of Ukraine to restore disrupted services, displaced health workers and destroyed infrastructure, which is essential not only for the health of Ukraine’s people, but for the country’s resilience and recovery. But no system can deliver optimum health to its people under the stress of war, which is why we continue to call on the Russian Federation to end this war.”
WHO has helped deliver more than 1300 metric tonnes of critical medical supplies in coordination with the Ministry of Health and partners, with more on the way. These include power generators, ambulances and oxygen supplies for medical facilities; supplies for trauma and emergency surgeries; and medicines to help treat noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).
However, attacks on health continue unabated, with 473 WHO-verified attacks recorded this past half-year, resulting in at least 98 deaths and 134 injuries.
“I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again and again: attacks on health care are unconscionable,” stressed Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “Not only are these a violation of international humanitarian law, but they also kill and maim civilians and health-care providers, and severely hinder or prevent the delivery of, and access to, health care to those who need it the most. Amid the horror of war, we continue to witness the heroic efforts of health providers – including the many I’ve been privileged to meet in person myself – who are such a credit to their profession despite their own personal suffering.”
So far this year, WHO has helped train more than 9000 health-care workers on a range of issues including trauma surgery, mass casualties, chemical exposure, epidemiology and laboratory diagnostics. Mental health is another key focus. Stress management training is being provided to health-care workers and the general population on how to safeguard mental health given the sharp rise in war-related psychological distress.
“WHO is stepping up its efforts with the Ministry of Health to ensure that the health workforce is prepared with the necessary skills to respond to mounting needs as winter approaches,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine. “We’re already seeing severe challenges and shortages in many areas, with rising inequalities in access to health and other essentials, impacting, as always, the most vulnerable – women, children and the elderly. Even as we look to a time when peace is restored, we must focus on the here and now – the next six months could test Ukraine’s health system as never before.”

GENEVA, 23 August 2022 - We are concerned by reports that the Russian Federation and affiliated armed groups in Donetsk are planning - possibly in the coming days - to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in what is being labelled an ‘international tribunal’ in Mariupol.
While there are few details available, photos and video footage published in the media and on social media appear to show metal cages being built in Mariupol’s philharmonic hall, apparently to restrain prisoners of war during proceedings.
Under international law, individuals entitled to prisoner-of-war status have combatant immunity and cannot be prosecuted for having participated in hostilities, or for lawful acts of war committed in the course of the armed conflict, even if such acts would otherwise constitute an offence under domestic law.
If prisoners of war are charged with crimes, they are entitled to due process and fair trial guarantees. No sentence or punishment may be passed on them unless it is delivered by an impartial and regularly constituted court.
We recall that international humanitarian law prohibits the establishment of courts solely to judge prisoners of war and that wilfully depriving a prisoner of war of the rights of fair and regular trial amounts to a war crime.
We are furthermore concerned that prisoners of war have generally been held without access to independent monitors, exposing them to the risk of being tortured to extract a confession.  There have also been worrying public statements by Russian officials and members of affiliated armed groups labelling  Ukrainian prisoners of war as ‘war criminals’, ‘Nazis’, and ‘terrorists’, thereby  undermining the presumption of innocence.
We reiterate our calls to the Russian Federation to grant independent monitors full access to all individuals detained in relation to the armed conflict in Ukraine, by the Russian Federation, including those held by Russian-affiliated armed groups.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL - PRESS REMARKS AT JOINT COORDINATION CENTRE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
20 August 2022
It is good to be back in Istanbul and I thank Minister of Defense Hulusi Akar and the Government of Türkiye for your warm welcome.
I thank you even more for your pivotal role in the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
At the heart of this initiative is the Joint Coordination Centre which enables the safe movement of dozens of commercial vessels.
Every member of the delegations represented at the JCC – Ukrainian, Russian, Turkish and United Nations – have been working with dedication and professionalism bringing their unique skills and passion to support this essential work.
They embody what we can achieve with political will, top operational expertise, and collective effort.
I would like to especially recognize our acting coordinator of the UN team Frederick Kenney for his dedication and hard work on this Initiative.  And I welcome, Amir Abdulla, whom I have appointed as Coordinator to lead the UN team. He brings decades of expertise in complex humanitarian operations.

Ladies and Gentlemen of the media,
More than 650,000 metric tons of grain and other food are already on their way to markets around the world.
I just came back from the Marmara Sea where Ukrainian, Russian, Turkish and United Nations teams are conducting joint inspections on the vessels passing through the Black Sea on their way in or out of the Ukrainian ports.
What a remarkable and inspiring operation.
I just saw a World Food Progamme-chartered vessel – Brave Commander - which is waiting to sail to the horn of Africa to bring urgently needed relief to those suffering from acute hunger.
Just yesterday, I was in Odesa port and saw first-hand the loading on a cargo of wheat onto a ship.
I was so moved watching the wheat fill up the hold of the ship.
It was the loading of hope for so many around the world.
But let’s not forget that what we see here in Istanbul and in Odesa is only the more visible part of the solution.
The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russian food and fertilizer, which are not subject to sanctions.
It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market.
Without fertilizer in 2022, there may not be enough food in 2023.
Getting more food and fertilizer out of Ukraine and Russia is critical to further calm commodity markets and lower prices for consumers
We are at the beginning of a much longer process, but you have already shown the potential of this critical agreement for the world.
And so, I am here with a message of congratulations for all those in the Joint Coordination Centre and a plea for that vital life-saving work to continue.
You can count on the full commitment of the United Nations to support you.
Thank you.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL REMARKS TO PRESS IN ODESA
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
19 August 2022
First of all I want to salute Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov.
His wisdom, his competence and his determination were vital for an agreement in the end to be reached involving the UN, Turkey and Ukraine and, on the other hand, UN, Turkey and the Russian Federation.
It is very emotional for me to be here in today in Odesa.
I just saw wheat being loaded into a ship again.
It's obviously a reason for joy. But it is also emotional because of the sadness I feel looking into this wonderful harbor and looking into these terminals practically empty with the possibility that this harbor has to develop that Ukraine and the whole region being cut off because of the war.
As I said it is moving to be here in Odessa and it is especially meaningful to be here on World Humanitarian Day.
For months, the port was paralyzed.
Ships like those here were within minutes of sailing fully loaded with grains and other cargo.
A critical transportation line from a global breadbasket was cut.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative is changing that.
In less than a month, 25 ships have departed from Odesa and other Ukrainian ports loaded with grain and other food supplies.  With more on their way, as the minister has explained.
They have carried well over 600,000 tonnes of food products and counting.
Wheat. Corn. Sunflower oil. Soya beans.
But each ship is also a vessel of hope.
Hope for Ukrainian farmers finally rewarded for their harvest – with storage being freed up for more.
Hope for seafarers and the larger shipping community, knowing that it is once again possible to sail through the Black Sea safely and efficiently.
And, most of all, hope for the world’s most vulnerable people and countries.
Here from Odesa on World Humanitarian Day, I want to make a special appeal to the wealthier world for those bearing the brunt of the global food crisis.
As these ports open, I appeal for wealthier countries to also open their wallets and their hearts.
After all, the movement of grains doesn’t mean much to countries that cannot afford it.
Lower prices on the global food markets don’t mean much if those prices aren’t reflected in local food markets.
A country cannot feed itself if it is starved for resources.
It is time for massive and generous support so developing countries can purchase the food from this and other ports – and people can buy it.
Developing countries need access to financing -- now.
They need debt relief -- now.
They need resources to invest in their people – now.
And all of us must do more to ensure full global access to Ukraine’s food products and Russian food and fertilizers.
That is not easy – but nothing about this initiative is easy.
No one ever expected smooth sailing.
This is an agreement between two parties locked in bitter war.
It is unprecedented in scope and scale.
But there is still a long way to go on many fronts.
Getting more food and fertilizer out of Ukraine and Russia is crucial to further calm commodity markets and lower prices.
But let’s not forget that what we see here in Odesa is only the more visible part of the solution.
The other part that is also important, that we have been defending, relate to the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russian food and fertilizer, which are not subject to sanctions.
It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market.
Without fertilizer in 2022, there may not be enough food in 2023.
I am deeply committed to those objectives, but it will only happen if all parties cooperate.
I am here in Odesa to salute the work being done – and to urge that those efforts continue.
Continue to help bring much-needed relief to global food security.
Continue to improve global food supply and stabilize markets.
And continue to improve the welfare of the most vulnerable, especially those trapped in the most fragile humanitarian contexts.
Let us spare no effort to keep this life-saving effort going and to work for peace.
Peace in line with the United Nations Charter and international law.
Let us take inspiration from Odesa.
Today, Odesa is more than just a shipping centre.
This port is a symbol of what the world can do when we commit to working together for the common good.
The Ukrainian people has been suffering so much. They have witnessed so many deaths, so much destruction that it is legitimate to aspire for peace.
But again, I repeat peace in line with UN Charter, peace in line with international law.
That is the best way to mark World Humanitarian Day and help set the course for a more just and peaceful world for all.

Title: “This much needed aid will help save lives”: UNOPS and Japan deliver more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian supplies to rescue teams in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
19 August 2022
UNOPS and the Government of Japan have completed the successful delivery of more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian relief items to people in Ukraine. The aid was completed in partnership with the State Emergency Service of Ukraine and the Zhytomyr Humanitarian Fund, which delivers support to the regions of Ukraine most affected by the war. Items included firefighting, rescue and medical items and communication devices.
On 27 May, the Government of Japan extended an emergency aid grant to provide transportation support for 114 tonnes of relief items for the most vulnerable people in Ukraine, at the request of the Embassy of Ukraine in Japan.
Speaking about the delivery, Gianni Volpin, UNOPS Ukraine Country Manager, said:
“UNOPS, in partnership with the Government of Japan, has been committed to supporting the people of Ukraine for the last seven years. We remain committed to supporting the people of Ukraine during these challenging times. This much needed aid will help save lives. And we hope that it will also help alleviate at least some of the dire need for special equipment for rescue teams - in particular, first aid kits and medical items.”
The consignees of the aid were the State Emergency Service of Ukraine and NGO Zhytomyr Humanitarian Fund.
“I would like to thank the People of Japan for the important assistance provided to our state through the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in these anxious times. Due to the Japanese aid, Ukrainian rescuers protect the civilian population from various current dangers in a round-the-clock mode,” Yuriy Kagitin, Head of the Main Department of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Lviv region said.
“We have received medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, and medicines that prevent haemorrhaging that are in high demand in our hospitals from Japan. This medical aid will be sorted by the Hub volunteers and delivered to Ukrainian medical care institutions most in need in several oblasts,” said Petro Romanov, co-founder of the Zhytomyr Humanitarian Fund.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL REMARKS TO THE PRESS
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 August 2022
Lviv, 18 August 2022
[As Delivered]
Good afternoon.
President Zelenskyy, allow me to begin by thanking you and the people of Ukraine for welcoming me once again during such a difficult period.
I am also very pleased to be joined by President Erdoğan.
Just a few weeks ago, the two of us were together in Istanbul for the signing of the Black Sea Grain Initiative – a landmark agreement to help vulnerable people in every corner of the world.
Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I have been clear:  There is no solution to the global food crisis without ensuring full global access to Ukraine’s food products and Russian food and fertilizers.
I want to express my gratitude to all parties for their support.
In less than one month, 21 ships have departed from Ukrainian ports and 15 vessels have left Istanbul for Ukraine to load up with grain and other food supplies.
As we speak, more than 560,000 metric tons of grain and other food produced by Ukrainian farmers is making its way to markets around the world.
I am especially pleased that the first UN-chartered vessel carrying Ukrainian wheat is on its way to respond to the needs of people suffering from the worst drought in the Horn of Africa in decades.
And as we speak, more than 560,000 metric tonnes of grain and other food produced by Ukrainian farmers is making its way into markets around the world to people in them.
Meanwhile – and critically – we have seen signs that global food markets are beginning to stabilize.
Wheat prices dropped by as much as 8% following the signing of the agreements.
The FAO Food Price Index fell by 9% in July - the biggest decline since 2008.
Most food commodities are now trading at prices below pre-war levels, but still very high.
But let’s have no illusions – there is a long way to go before this will be translated into the daily life of people at their local bakery and in their markets.
Supply chains are still disrupted.
Energy and transportation costs remain unacceptably high.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
The positive momentum on the food front reflects a victory for diplomacy – for multilateralism – for people caught in the grips of a cost-of-living crisis – and for the hard-working farmers of Ukraine.
But it is only the beginning.  I urge all parties to ensure continued success.
This is an unprecedented agreement and, in my experience, by their very nature, initiatives in conflict situations are inherently fragile.
They must be constantly nurtured.
From day one, the parties of the JCC [Joint Coordination Center] have worked professionally and in good faith to keep the food flowing.
I appeal for this to continue and for them to overcome all obstacles in a spirit of compromise and permanently settle all difficulties.
Getting food and fertilizer out of Ukraine and Russia in larger quantities is crucial to further calm commodity markets and lower prices.
It is essential to provide relief to the most vulnerable people and countries.
And it is vital to help reverse the turmoil in the global fertilizer market that is now threatening next season’s crops – including rice, the most widely consumed staple in the world.
In the meantime, the United Nations will go on working in full solidarity with the Ukrainian people to mobilize all of our capacities and resources – along side our national partners – to continue to provide humanitarian support to people in need wherever it is required.
We will do our best to scale up our operations to face the difficult the coming winter.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
But, of course, the heart of the problem that brings us here remains the war.
As I have stated time and time again, this invasion is a violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and of the United Nations Charter.
The war brought innumerous death, massive destruction and displacement, and dramatic violations of human rights.
People need peace.
Peace in line with the United Nations Charter.
Peace in line with international law.
I remain gravely concerned about the unfolding situation in and around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia.
Common sense must prevail to avoid any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant.
The facility must not be used as part of any military operation.
Instead, agreement is urgently needed to reestablish Zaporizhhia as purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area.
In close contact with the IAEA, the UN Secretariat has assessed that we have in Ukraine the logistics and security capacity to support any IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant from Kyiv, provided both Russia and Ukraine agree.
Military equipment and personnel should be withdrawn from the plant.
Further deployment of forces or equipment to the site must be avoided.
The area needs to be demilitarized.
We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.
Today, I also discussed the investigation of the tragic incident in a detention facility in Olenivka on 29 July.
What happened there is unacceptable. All prisoners of war are protected under International Humanitarian Law.
The International Committee of the Red Cross must have access to them wherever they are kept.
I decided to establish a Fact-Finding mission.
The Terms of Reference of the mission were shared with Ukraine and the Russian Federation, as well as the make-up of the team. It is my intention to appoint General Carlos dos Santos Cruz of Brazil to lead this mission.
General Santos Cruz is a respected officer with over 40 years of national and international public security and military experience, including as a commander of UN peacekeeping operations.
We will now continue to work to obtain the necessary assurances to guarantee secure access to Olenivka and any other relevant locations.
To put it simply, a fact-finding mission must be free to find the facts.
The team must be able to gather and analyze necessary information.
Above all, that means safe, secure and unfettered access to people, places and evidence without any interference from anybody.
We will continue to do all we can to advance this and other efforts correspond to needs of the Ukrainian people.
Once again, my thanks to President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people for your welcome.
You can continue to count on the support of the United Nations to promote human rights, international law and the cause of peace.
Thank you.

I was delighted to accept the invitation of the director of this faculty of international relations of the very old and very respected [National] University of Lviv.
Today, many people think that only governments matter but on the contrary, more and more the contribution of civil society and the contribution of academia are essential in the development of modern democracies.
This school has given very important contributions, namely, to the Charter of the United Nations. One of the members was part of the drafting of the charter and its values were discussed here. Also in research about the Holocaust, and in contributions in relation to several very important aspects of the analysis of violations of human rights and genocide.
That is the reason why, for me as Secretary of the United Nations, it is a very important experience to be able to visit this faculty of Lviv University.

New York, 15 August 2022
In the past few days, there have been repeated comments by various Russian officials accusing the United Nations Secretariat of having either cancelled or blocked a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
I want to clarify a few points. First, the IAEA is a specialized agency that acts in full independence in deciding how to implement its specific mandate.
Second, the UN Secretariat has no authority to block or cancel any IAEA activities.
Third, in close contact with the IAEA, the UN Secretariat has assessed that it has in Ukraine the logistics and security capacity to be able to support any IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant from Kyiv, should both Russia and Ukraine agree.

Title: FAO stands ready to support Ukrainian farmers and rural population

15 August 2022
Raimund Jehle, FAO Regional Programme Leader for Europe and Central Asia, has had his first mission to Ukraine since the beginning of the war escalation in order to express FAO’s readiness to continue providing emergency agricultural support to the most vulnerable and ensuring sustainability of local and global agri-food supplies.
Raimund Jehle emphasized that since 24 February FAO increased its capacity and, in addition to the emergency response programme, now it is resuming projects implemented before the war. He also stressed the importance of timely addressing the challenges to maintain critical food production and address breakdowns in agri-food supply chains.
"We continue to support Ukraine and work closely with the Government of Ukraine, in particular, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, and local administrations to ensure the stability and development of agriculture in this difficult time for the country," said Raimund Jehle. “FAO’s portfolio in Ukraine focus on emergency assistance to the agricultural rural households, addressing storage deficit, supporting value chains development, adaptation to climate change and combating land degradation.”
Following the start of the war, FAO developed and updated its Rapid Response Plan, requiring USD 115.4 million to assist nearly 1 million rural people by providing agricultural assistance and ensuring food security to those most affected by the conflict. Under this programme, FAO has already supported 80 000 people in 13 oblasts of Ukraine and continues providing multi-purpose cash assistance to cover the basic needs of over 5 000 families in the hardest hit locations in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine.
Apart from it, FAO will provide animal feed and pilot a voucher program for the purchase of essential agricultural inputs. Support will be provided to displaced persons and host families in rural areas, as well as to the most vulnerable categories of the population.
In addition to these activities, FAO is working with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine on the implementation of Grain Storage Support Strategy to address the current storage deficit in Ukraine, aiming to deploy temporary storage capacity to farmers through 2022-2023. This will strengthen food security and protect livelihoods at the household and national levels in Ukraine, and ensure other grain import-dependent countries retain access to adequate supplies of grain, at a manageable cost.
"Together with the Ministry of Agricultural Policy, FAO is implementing the Grain Storage Strategy, according to which FAO plans to ensure the storage of 4.07 million tons of grain, which is 25% of the national need. We already completed a tender and are identifying potential suppliers of grain sleeves with supporting equipment, modular storage units,” added Pierre Vauthier, Head of the office in Ukraine. “One of the important requirements for receiving temporary storage equipment will be the registration in the State Agrarian Registry."
Thanks to close collaboration with the Government of Ukraine and our partners, and generous contributions from donors, FAO will continue delivering life and livelihood saving assistance across the country.

Media Briefing 14 August 2022
Thank you very much Minister; and thanks to the colleagues from the media for the opportunity to talk to you today.
I arrived in Ukraine a week ago;
I arrived from a country whose population is suffering from conflict and lack of access to food – where mothers don’t know where the next meal for their children will come from.
Mothers every where , we know, how unimaginable it is that a child goes hungry. Hunger is painful, physically painful
And in Ukraine, you are suffering from the scourge of war; a war that none of us understand.
Take away our labels and our titles, we are all people at the end of the day, and we just don’t understand.
Today we are connected through our shared humanity – and we nod our heads in admiration and respect for the people of Ukraine, and their fortitude and courage
But that is not enough
The Black Sea Agreement serves to support the farmers of Ukraine – yes it will take time, but the ships are moving now – Over the last two weeks, 14 commercial vessels were sent to the world’s market. Not enough, but the system is in place.
It also supports hungry people across the world.
This first shipment of humanitarian assistance, organized by the World Food Programme, enable the UN and our humanitarian partners to literally save lives and alleviate the suffering of millions of people who are now struggling to put food on their table in Ethiopia. The country has been severely hit by the worse drought the Horn of Africa has experienced in decades.
Food sometimes just isn’t available or only available for those who have money to pay the increased cost.
And what about the people of Ukraine
The war has severely impacted agriculture here in the country, leaving thousands of farmers without income and one in three families food insecure. The closure of the ports had left thousands of people without livelihood at a moment when the war was also devastating Ukraine’s economy.
Now, today, we already have nearly 18 million people in the country who need humanitarian aid to survive. And the situation is getting worse by the day.
Local, National and International partners are working to provide that assistance. We managed to reach nearly 12 million in the last six months, but we need to do more.
And we will do more to work with the local organizations – those who were there from day 1.
We need to reach people in need no matter where they are.
Since the war began, the UN and our humanitarian partners have been prevented from sending supplies to areas temporarily beyond the control of the Government of Ukraine. It is imperative that we can provide assistance to everyone who needs it, no matter where they live.
The winter months will soon be upon us – we are working together with the government and regional authorities on winterization – together we need to ensure the population of Ukraine has a safe, dignified and warm place.
The partnership between the UN and Government of Ukraine is key to doing more.

Title: Secretary-General's press statement on Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 August 2022
I am gravely concerned about the unfolding situation in and around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant in southern Ukraine.
I have appealed to all concerned to exercise common sense and reason and not to undertake any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant – the largest of its kind in Europe.
Regrettably, instead of de-escalation, over the past several days there have been reports of further deeply worrying incidents that could, if they continue, lead to disaster.
I am calling for all military activities in the immediate vicinity of the plant to cease immediately and not to target its facilities or surroundings.
I urge the withdrawal of any military personnel and equipment from the plant and the avoidance of any further deployment of forces or equipment to the site. The facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, urgent agreement is needed at a technical level on a safe perimeter of demilitarization to ensure the safety of the area.
The United Nations continues to fully support the critical work of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its efforts to ensure the safe operations of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant. I urge the parties to provide the IAEA mission with immediate, secure and unfettered access to the site.
We must be clear that any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia or any other nuclear facilities in Ukraine, or anywhere else, could lead to catastrophic consequences not only for the immediate vicinity, but for the region and beyond. This is wholly unacceptable.

Title: NEARLY US$4.3 BILLION REQUIRED TO RESPOND  TO WORSENING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN UKRAINE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 August 2022
Intense hostilities since the start of Russia’s invasion on 24 February have left at least 17.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, an increase of around 2 million people compared to April
The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, has today called on the international community to continue its support for life-saving operations in Ukraine, as the war continues to drive an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the country. The call comes as the United Nations and humanitarian organizations in the country revised the Humanitarian Flash appeal to respond to the worsening situation. The financial request increased from US$2.25 billion to $4.3 billion to make sure aid workers in the country have the funding and resources necessary to continue delivering critical assistance and protection services to people across Ukraine until December 2022.
“Over the last five months, we have seen how local, national and international humanitarian organizations have joined efforts across Ukraine to increase the scale and scope of operations and provide assistance to more than 11 million people. The reality is that more people need support,” said Denise Brown, explaining that at least 17.7 million people—over a quarter of Ukraine’s population—will need humanitarian aid in the months ahead. “This is an increase of about 2 million more than what we had estimated during the last revision of the Flash Appeal, in April. And we fear it can even get worse during the winter, as more people will probably displace from areas where they cannot access gas, fuel or electricity to heat their homes,” she added.
Supporting people during the harsh cold season is one of the priorities during the months ahead. The destruction of thousands of houses and the lack of access to fuel, gas or electricity due to damaged infrastructure could become a matter of life or death, if people are unable to heat their homes.
A scale up of the cash assistance is also planned, targeting now 6.3 million vulnerable people until the end of the year. During the first five months of the war, at least 2.3 million Ukrainians received cash assistance to make sure they could make their own choices to meet their vital needs. This also creates a link with the national social protection programme and local markets.
The Humanitarian Coordinator stressed that in addition to the funding, aid groups in Ukraine will need safe and unimpeded access to all war-affected areas. “Since the war began, access has been extremely challenging in areas beyond the control of the Government of Ukraine. I call on the parties to the conflict to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and facilitate the humanitarian response to make sure we can support every person who desperately needs assistance, no matter where they live.”

Title: Inspection of first commercial vessel under the Black Sea Grain Initiative completed
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
03 August 2022
3 August 2022, ISTANBUL – The first shipment of over 26,000 tons of Ukrainian food under a Black Sea export deal was cleared to proceed today, towards its final destination in Lebanon.
A joint civilian inspection team comprising officials from the Russian Federation, Türkiye, Ukraine and the United Nations visited the merchant vessel Razoni this morning. Checks on cargo and crew were conducted on behalf of the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC), set up in Istanbul under the Black Sea Grain Initiative signed on 22 July.
This marks the conclusion of an initial “proof of concept” operation to execute the agreement between the Russian Federation, Türkiye, Ukraine and the United Nations. Three ports in Ukraine are due to resume the export of millions of tons of wheat, corn and other crops at a time of global food insecurity.
The Razoni arrived at anchorage in Istanbul yesterday evening after sailing from Odesa port on 1 August, as the first commercial vessel carrying grain under the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
The Initiative facilitates the export of food and fertilizer from Ukraine under close monitoring.
The team carried out a three hour inspection and confirmed that crew and cargo are as authorised and consistent with the information the JCC received before the vessel sailed from Odesa.
The joint inspection team had the opportunity to discuss with the crew and gain valuable information on the vessel's journey along the maritime humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea that was agreed by the JCC.
The JCC will use this voyage in its ongoing work on fine tuning procedures and processes to enable the continuation of safe passage of commercial vessels across the Black Sea under the Initiative.

Title: USAID announces additional $1.8m for WHO to support the continuity of healthcare in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
03 August 2022
Funds will be used to improve detection of infectious diseases and strengthen surveillance
As Ukraine continues to face the most acute humanitarian crisis in the WHO European Region in decades, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health (MoH) is striving to meet basic health service delivery, surveillance, and pharmaceutical needs.
The health system, already overwhelmed by two years of COVID-19 prior to the war, needs direct support to maintain essential, lifesaving functions and services.
August the 2d, USAID Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman met with Dr. Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Europe. They discussed the United States’ and the WHO’s coordinated response to support Ukraine and the country’s health system recovery and announced that USAID is providing an additional $1.8 million in funding to WHO to strengthen infectious disease surveillance and reporting in Ukraine, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable, including people with special needs, those living in remote areas and internally displaced people (IDP). With this additional support, USAID has now provided $15.5 million to WHO, for critical health support, since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February.
“For almost six months now, Ukraine’s health system has been facing numerous and serious challenges due to the ongoing conflict. We are beginning to see a rise in COVID-19 cases, with a corresponding rise in hospitalizations and deaths, driven by the BA.5 sub-lineage of Omicron which has quickly spread through Europe since early June,” said Dr Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
“On top of that, the war has affected routine immunization activities for highly infectious and potentially life-threatening diseases like measles, polio and diphtheria. A cholera outbreak remains a real and serious risk. And the rapid and unexpected spread of monkeypox in the European Region could further challenge the Ukrainian health system, when the virus reaches Ukraine. The only way to get a handle on these health threats is to have robust and agile surveillance systems that are able to function amid the current conflict and well beyond," continued Dr Kluge.
Working closely with the Ukrainian MoH, the overarching objectives will be to:
“On behalf of WHO, I thank USAID for this generous and timely donation to help protect the health and well-being of the Ukrainian people. Health must be a central pillar of the humanitarian response, but also a key component of Ukraine’s recovery. Investing in health now will pay dividends later, when peace finally comes,” Dr Kluge concluded.

Title: Ukraine: FAO, Canada join forces to address grain storage deficit
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
02 August 2022
Canada contributes USD 40 million to cover 2.4 million tonnes of storage
Kyiv/Rome – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has launched a new USD 40 million (Canadian Dollar 52 million) Canada-funded project to further address grain storage shortages in Ukraine.
The initiative will allow storage of an additional 2.4 million tonnes of grain between 2022-2023 along with related technical support and equipment. This complements the support of USD 17 million recently provided by the Government of Japan to cover 1 million tonnes of grain storage.
This season, with the harvest of winter crops starting in July and spring crops beginning later in the year, Ukraine is expecting to harvest up to 51.1 million tonnes of cereal. Out of a total storage capacity of 75 million tonnes, 14 percent of storage facilities are damaged or destroyed, 10 percent are located in Russian-occupied territories and around 30 percent remain filled with 22 million tonnes of last year’s harvest awaiting export – according to the Government of Ukraine.
“Given the unprecedented storage challenges this year, innovative solutions are required at scale. For this reason support to the sector will remain in high demand, likely into 2023,” said Rein Paulsen, Director of the FAO Office of Emergencies and Resilience. “FAO is responding immediately to this situation while taking a longer-term view and looking to invest in durable solutions that build on sectoral capacity, in coordination with the Government at national and local levels.”
The recently developed Grain Storage Support Strategy – an extension to the FAO Ukraine Rapid Response Plan (RRP) – aims to support the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine to cover 4.07 million tonnes, or 25 percent, of the total estimated national storage deficit of 16 million tons in 2022-23. The strategy also includes the support of the State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection to process and export agricultural products from Ukraine, by strengthening government capacity for food commodity testing and certifications necessary for export at border facilities.
The immediate impact of the strategy will be an expansion and immediate availability of storage capacity at this critical harvest time for Ukrainian producers of grain and oil seeds, while the longer-term impact will be in sustaining global food supplies. This, in turn, will strengthen food security and protect livelihoods at the household and national levels in Ukraine, and ensure other grain import-dependent countries retain access to adequate supplies of grain, at a manageable cost.
“Thanks to the funding provided by Global Affairs Canada, FAO will deliver temporary and fixed grain storage solutions including polyethylene grain sleeves, loading and unloading machinery, and longer-term modular storage units, targeting small and medium-sized farms in 15 oblasts,” said Pierre Vauthier, Head of FAO Ukraine Country Office. “In addition, FAO will procure up to USD 2 million worth of laboratory equipment to support six strategic laboratory facilities in surveillance for animal diseases in accordance with the World Organization for Animal Health’s safe trade rules.”
To date, with the additional funds from Canada, FAO has raised $70.4 million against the total of USD 180.4 million needed under the Rapid Response Plan and Grain Storage Support Strategy. An additional USD 110 million are urgently needed to support vulnerable households in rural areas.

Title: THE SECRETARY-GENERAL REMARKS TO THE MEDIA ON THE BLACK SEA GRAIN INITIATIVE
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
01 August 2022
New York, 1 August 2022
[as delivered]
Good morning.
A few hours ago, a cargo ship loaded with more than 26-thousand tonnes of corn became the first commercial ship to sail from the port of Odesa since 26 February.
It should arrive at the inspection location in Turkish territorial waters tomorrow, 2 August. Following inspection, it will proceed to its final destination in Tripoli, Lebanon – a country heavily dependent on grain imports.
This ship – the Merchant Vessel Razoni – is loaded with two commodities in short supply: corn, and hope.
Hope for millions of people around the world who depend on the smooth running of Ukraine’s ports to feed their families.
The ship’s departure is the first concrete result of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
It has been a long journey since I presented a proposal to the leaders of the Russian Federation and Ukraine at the end of April.
Today’s departure is an enormous collective achievement by the Joint Coordination Centre, set up last week in Istanbul under United Nations auspices, with representatives from Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Türkiye.
The Parties have worked tirelessly to reach this milestone, with the support of the United Nations and Türkiye.
After speaking to my colleagues, I know they worked practically all night, sleeping for just one hour – like all the other delegations at the Joint Coordination Centre.
It is thanks to their commitment that the Razoni was able to leave Odesa safely.
I salute their efforts, and I am grateful to Türkiye for its leadership.
What we’ve witnessed today in Odesa is an important starting point.
It must be the first of many commercial ships bringing relief and stability to global food markets.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative allows for significant volumes of exports from three Ukrainian ports: Odesa, Chornomorsk, and Yuzhny.
Together with the agreed facilitation of the unimpeded access of Russian food products and fertilizers to world markets, it will bring relief and stability to global food markets and help tackle the global food crisis.
Ensuring that grain, fertilizers, and other food-related items are available at reasonable prices to developing countries is a humanitarian imperative.
People on the verge of famine need these agreements to work, in order to survive.
Countries on the verge of bankruptcy need these agreements to work, in order to keep their economies alive.
In line with the humanitarian spirit of the initiative, the World Food Programme is planning to purchase, load and ship an initial 30,000 metric tons of wheat out of Ukraine on a UN-chartered vessel.  WFP will have more details in the coming days.
While this tragic war continues to rage, the United Nations is working every day to bring relief to the people of Ukraine, and to those suffering the effects of the conflict around the world.
This war must end, and peace must be established, in line with the Charter of the United Nations and international law.
I hope today’s news can be a step towards that goal, for the people of Ukraine and the Russian Federation, and for the world.
Thank you.

The Secretary-General warmly welcomes the departure of the M/V Razoni, the first commercial ship leaving Ukraine’s port of Odesa since 26 February 2022. The ship is bound for the port of Tripoli, Lebanon, carrying a cargo of 26,527 tonnes of corn, and is the first vessel to depart under the Black Sea Grain Initiative signed in Istanbul, on 22 July.  Ensuring that existing grain and foodstuffs can move to global markets is a humanitarian imperative.
The first departure is a collective achievement of the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) set up in Istanbul under the auspices of the United Nations, and comprised of representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Türkiye. Since then, the Parties with the assistance of the United Nations have been working tirelessly to implement the agreements reached in that Initiative. The Secretary-General salutes their efforts and he is grateful to Türkiye for its leadership.
The Secretary-General is pleased that, thanks to the tireless efforts, general oversight, and coordination of the JCC, the ship departed safely from the port of Odessa.
The Secretary-General hopes that this will be the first of many commercial ships moving in accordance with the Initiative signed, and that this will bring much-needed stability and relief to global food security especially in the most fragile humanitarian contexts.
In line with the humanitarian spirit of the initiative, the World Food Programme (WFP) is also planning to purchase, load and ship an initial 30,000 metric tons of wheat out of Ukraine on a UN-chartered vessel.  WFP will have more details in the coming days.

The Secretary-General warmly welcomes the official inauguration of the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul today. The JCC is comprised of senior representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Türkiye and the United Nations.
The Secretary-General is grateful to Türkiye for providing the Parties and the United Nations with a platform to help operationalize the Black Sea Grain Initiative. He thanks the Russian Federation and Ukraine for nominating and quickly sending their senior representatives to Istanbul.
He underscores the importance of the Parties working in partnership directly to effectively implement the Black Sea Grain Initiative, with a view to reducing global food insecurity.
The work of the JCC will enable the safe transportation, by merchant ships, of grain and related foodstuffs and fertilizers from three key Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea to the rest of the world.  This will help to effectively respond to and prevent rising global food insecurity.
Together with the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Russian Federation and the Secretariat of the United Nations on promoting the access of Russian food products and fertilizers to world markets, it will help reinstate confidence in the global food market and reduce food prices from their current levels.

Istanbul, 22 July 2022
For months, the Secretary-General has been underlining the importance of facilitating full access to world markets for Ukraine’s food stocks and Russian food and fertilizers.
He travelled to Moscow and Kyiv in April to propose a plan to reach that objective.
Ukraine and the Russian Federation are breadbaskets of the world, producing almost one-third of the world’s wheat and barley and half of its sunflower oil.  Russia is also a top global exporter of fertilizers and the raw materials for its production.
Today in Istanbul, senior representatives from Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Türkiye gathered to sign an initiative which establishes a mechanism for the safe transportation of grain, related foodstuffs and fertilizer from Ukrainian ports to global markets.
The United Nations, represented by the Secretary-General, signed the Initiative as a witness. The purpose of the Initiative is to contribute to the prevention of global hunger, to reduce and address global food insecurity, and to ensure the safety and security of merchant ships entering or departing Ukrainian ports.
In the Initiative, the Parties recognized the role of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in securing the discussions for this Initiative. They went on to request his further assistance in its implementation, in the furtherance of the humanitarian mission of the United Nations, subject to its authorities and mandates.
To facilitate the implementation of their Initiative, the Parties agreed to set up a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul, under the auspices of the United Nations, comprised of representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Türkiye and the United Nations.
The JCC will enable the safe transportation, by merchant ships, of commercial foodstuffs and fertilizer from three key Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea: Odesa, Chornomorsk, Yuzhny.

An agreement was also reached with the Russian Federation on the scope of engagement of the United Nations to facilitate the unimpeded exports to world markets of Russian food and fertilizer – including the raw materials required to produce fertilizers.  This agreement is  based on the principle that measures imposed on the Russian Federation do not apply to these products.
Simultaneously, the Russian Federation has committed to facilitate the unimpeded export of food, sunflower oil and fertilizers from Ukrainian controlled Black Sea ports.
Agreements to facilitate unrestricted access to exports of Ukraine food from the Black Sea along with exports of food and fertilizer from the Russian Federation matter on many levels.
To calm commodity markets, lower prices and provide critical relief to the most vulnerable people and countries getting hammered by an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis.
To the numerous countries in the developing world that rely on wheat and other grain imports to feed their people.
And to assist in reversing the turmoil in the global fertilizer market that is now threatening next season’s crops – including rice, the most widely consumed staple in the world.
The comprehensive agreements secured today in Istanbul are a big step forward in tackling the global food crisis now gripping the world.
They will provide much-needed relief to the most vulnerable people and countries.

21 July 2022
With the support of the World Health Organization Country Office in Ukraine, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine provided professional training to specialists involved in vaccination efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the national immunization programme. 30,182 medical workers and medical students have received much-needed training to protect the population from the vaccine-preventable disease since March 2021.
“WHO СO UKR will continue to support vaccination against COVID-19 in Ukraine. WHO immunization training course for Ukraine is a long-term initiative to ensure the continuity of capacity development for the immunization programme in each region of Ukraine. So the training continues” - said Jarno Habicht, the World Health Organization representative and head of country office to Ukraine.
“Training took place in a cascsde  method. The first wave was the ToT phase (training of trainers). 340 physicians became professional instructors who later on, on the basis of 28 regional training centers, 12 training centers in medical schools, and a medical training center for the military, provided training for vaccination. As a result, Ukraine has achieved the average European level of immunization coverage of the population against COVID-19 by conducting up to 300 thousand vaccinations a day, " - mentioned regarding WHO CO UKR support by Ihor Kuzin, Deputy Minister of Health of Ukraine - Chief State Sanitary Doctor of Ukraine.
By February 2022, more than 30,000 Ukrainian health workers had completed 1,125 2-day vaccine safety and correct administration practices courses.
Each course consisted of 16 hours of in-person training, during which participants learned how to handle and administer COVID-19 vaccine products and how to organize vaccination sessions in various settings. During each training, participants also acquire hands-on skills on how to recognize and manage anaphylaxis and other acute AEFI. The training programme also includes details on how to enter data for each patient into the electronic medical records system and details of the national vaccine deployment plan.
To support the functioning of the established training hubs, the WHO Country Office in Ukraine has provided logistical support, as well as procured and delivered over 287 000 sets of personal protective equipment and 75 000 items of printed educational materials.
Launched in March 2021, this longitudinal immunization training program is part of a partnership between the European Union (EU) and WHO EURO to support the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and routine vaccination in the EU's Eastern Partnership countries. The Public Health Center of Ukraine, the State Expert Center of Ukraine, and the National Health Service of Ukraine were also involved in the project.
Immunization trainings have been supported by WHO in partnership with European Union.

Title: The Government of the Republic of Korea allocates US$ 2 million for women and girls in Ukraine and Moldova
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
21 July 2022
UNITED NATIONS, New York – The Government of the Republic of Korea is allocating US$ 2 million as part of the UN Flash Appeal for Ukraine and the Regional Refugee Response Plan. The funds will support UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, to scale up life-saving maternal and newborn health services and ensure preventative, responsive and protective services and support are in place for gender-based violence in Ukraine and Moldova.
“We continue to rely on the support of our donor partners, like the Government of the Republic of Korea, to ensure UNFPA and our partners can reach the most vulnerable women and girls in Ukraine and Moldova,” said Florence Bauer, UNFPA Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. “We need the continued commitment of all donors to safeguard women’s and girls'  health, rights and dignity.”
Humanitarian needs continue to rise in Ukraine and the region with the war in its fifth month. The conflict is taking a particularly heavy toll on women and girls as they face increased risks of life-threatening sexual and physical violence, exploitation and abuse. The damage and destruction of medical facilities, as well as a shortage of service providers and critical supplies, have also severely compromised the delivery of essential health services, including maternal care and specialized services for women survivors of violence.
“The Korean government is committed to providing assistance to the most vulnerable affected by the war in Ukraine. UNFPA is a key partner to addressing gender-based violence and promoting sexual and reproductive health for women and girls,” said Hyung-Tae Kim, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Ukraine.
UNFPA’s priority is to ensure that women and girls’ rights are protected, including their right to give birth safely and in dignity and to live free from violence. With the support of the Korean government, UNFPA will continue to distribute essential reproductive health supplies and medicines to facilities in war-torn regions in Ukraine. So far, UNFPA has distributed more than 70 metric tonnes of supplies, including for emergency obstetric care and the clinical management of rape, across the country. The funding will also support mobile health teams, providing reproductive health services for the hard-to-reach and those who cannot travel safely to facilities.
The new contribution will also support hotlines and facilities helping survivors of gender-based violence and other women in need, as well as the Orange Safe Spaces in Moldova, which provide psychosocial support, information on gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive health services.
UNFPA urgently requires flexible resources to meet the needs of women and girls in Ukraine and to safeguard the rights and choices of refugee women, youth, and older persons in Moldova.

Title: Polio mission to Western Ukraine to assess critical outbreak response activities being implemented to protect children from further infection especially during this war period.
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 July 2022
Polio mission to Western Ukraine to assess critical outbreak response activities being implemented to protect children from further infection especially during this war period.
The aim of the visit was to assess the polio outbreak response activities like vaccination and surveillance being implemented during this war period and to reawaken the commitment of the regional authorities and Regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention (RCDC) towards the ongoing polio outbreak. During the 3 days mission, the team had discussions with Heads of Health Departments of Regional State Administrations, Representatives of Regional State Administrations and health care workers.
Since the confirmation of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Ukraine last year in Rivne oblast, the GPEI Partners – WHO, UNICEF, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Rotary International – are assisting the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Public Health Center of Ukraine in responding to the polio outbreak in Ukraine.
The polio outbreak is still ongoing and is being complicated by the war, when high population movement started due to the invasion by the Russian Federation, hence increasing the risk of exporting poliovirus to other regions and countries. Despite the war, the catch-up vaccination campaign is ongoing though very slowly. So far 70% of the targeted children have been vaccinated with Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV).
About Poliovirus in Ukraine
Ukraine has been experiencing an outbreak of type-2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) since October 2021. The circulation of virus has been confirmed in two oblasts: Rivne and Zakarpattya.
To date two children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have tested positive for cVDPV2, and the virus has also been detected in 19 asymptomatic contacts.
Since the war began, a lot of population were displaced, including the 2 positive cases whose whereabout cannot be traced. An intensified AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance is ongoing across the country, along with environmental surveillance. To date 61 AFP cases have been reported from January 2022, results have been negative so far.
About international spread
In the current crisis setting, this outbreak poses a substantial risk of international spread due to subnational gaps in immunization coverage in countries surrounding Ukraine since 2020 caused by local-level disruptions in immunization programmes due to COVID-19 pandemic, declining performance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance in multiple countries and mass population movement linked to the war.
About Poliovirus and how to protect children
Poliovirus is transmitted via a fecal-oral route, this can also contaminate the environment hence posing a great risk for vulnerable children. The only reliable way to prevent the development of poliomyelitis is vaccination. The vaccines are free, safe and effective. In Ukraine, children are vaccinated for the prevention of poliomyelitis at the age of 2 and 4 months with an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and at 6, 18 months and 6, 14 years with an oral poliovaccine (OPV). To protect against polio all children MUST be vaccinated against polio with at least 3 doses of the vaccine with an interval of 1 month between each dose.
A catch-up polio vaccination campaign was launched on February 1st targeting children 6 months to 6 years. This activity is being affected by the war but is ongoing in primary health care facilities.
Mission participants about Poliovirus in Ukraine
Dr Ihor Kuzin, the Deputy Minister of Health of Ukraine: “Vaccination rates across the country have dropped significantly because of the war. And our task is to do everything possible to ensure that the coverage of routine immunization is high, one of the priorities is vaccination against poliomyelitis. We organized this joint mission with WHO in three regions: Lviv, Zakarpattya and Rivne, where additional organizational, training and information initiatives are planned to strengthen response to the polio outbreak. Poliomyelitis is a debilitating infectious disease which causes irreversible paralysis and there is no medicine to cure it. Vaccination is the only reliable method of protection. We will not be calm until all children are fully vaccinated against polio and other vaccine preventable infections”.
Orest Chemerys, Director of Healthcare department of Lviv Regional State Administration: “We recognize the fact that we are yet to achieve the desired polio vaccination coverage. Before the war, we were negatively affected by COVID-19. With the war, there are many displaced persons in the territory of the region. We have been working to support the IDPs. We have conducted some awareness sensitization sessions and supported 2 to 3 mobile vaccinations per week. Vaccines are available, there is no problem with availability and logistics now. Some of our challenges in Lviv region is that some communities are hard to reach because they are in mountainous areas, others are along the international border which is also very far and hard to reach. There is also low perception about vaccines amongst these hard-to-reach communities hence low coverage of vaccination in these districts. We request that WHO should organize seminars, webinars to build our capacity about polio”.
Anatolii Pshenychnyi Director of Healthcare department of Zakarpattya Regional State Administration: “We are happy to welcome this delegation who is on an international mission to Zakarpattya and we are expecting technical recommendations on how to deal with the challenges that the region had been facing before the war, and which have become even greater due to the large number of internally displaced persons.
Zakarpattya being a border region with several countries, we had many challenges associated with migration even before the war. Other issues are personal prejudices about vaccination in general, including polio vaccination. We hope to work more actively with territorial communities, looking for our own approach to each community, how to effectively involve them in immunization routines, including polio”.
Raymond Dankoli, WHO Polio Outbreak Response Coordinator: “Polio is one of the diseases that threatens the life and development of a child. Vaccination is one of the safe way to protect children from the threat of infectious diseases. GPEI partners will continue to support and coordinate with regional and health authorities to provide all necessary skills and technical expertise to improve on the country’s vaccination and surveillance indicators. Process of polio vaccine procurement is ongoing to avoid stockout. All eligible children should be presented for vaccination. There are common challenges to all regions however, there are some region-specific challenges. The efforts of the regions to solve their challenges are appreciated. The polio team will continue to work together with the regions to stop further transmission of the poliovirus. I call on everyone to use their circle of control and circle of influence to ensure that all children are vaccinated according to the national vaccination schedule”.
Roman Safonov, Chief sanitary doctor of the Rivne region: “As the representative of the regional authority we can confidently say that we are working hard to ensure everything necessary for vaccination is made available. We ensure that there are trained health workers to administer vaccinations in the health facilities and all the logistics needed to make vaccines available in the health facilities are also provided. However, one of our biggest challenges is wrong perception about vaccination among some parents or caregivers, religious and community leaders. We need a lot of support in this direction so that we get their buy-in as we contribute to eradicating crippling disease as polio and other vaccine preventable infections. We call on international partners to support us in educating these group of influential persons in our communities”.

Title: Humanitarian Coordinator (A.I.) for Ukraine, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, condemns deadly attack on Chasiv Yar
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 July 2022
I am appalled by the latest attack that hit a municipal dormitory for vulnerable people in the town of Chasiv Yar in Donetska oblast, on the evening of 9 July. At least 34 civilians were killed, including a child, when the building where they had been seeking shelter was hit and collapsed. Another nine people were rescued from the debris and are now hospitalized.
On behalf of the United Nations in Ukraine, I send my most heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and wish those injured a speedy recovery. No person should face what millions in Ukraine are going through now, seeing their loved ones killed because of a war. Yet, this attack is only one reminder that in this war, as in other conflicts, civilians pay the highest price.
Over the last days, we saw, once again, the horrifying news of people being killed, injured, and dozens of houses and other critical civilian infrastructure being damaged on both sides of the front line. The use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in densely populated areas of Ukraine, particularly multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic and cruise missiles, is taking a heavy toll on civilians in this country.
In the first 11 days of this month alone, at least 135 civilians, including 6 children, were killed and 280 injured by such weapons in Government-controlled territory, and at least 24 civilians were killed, 4 of them children, and another 86 injured in non-Government-controlled areas, according to the data verified by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. The actual numbers, however, are likely much higher as we continue to corroborate information received during this period.
The parties to the conflict have an obligation under international humanitarian law to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure in times of war. I urgently call on them to respect the law and protect the people of Ukraine. They have suffered enough.

Title: Ukraine: FAO scales up efforts to save upcoming harvest, ensure export of vital grains
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
05 July 2022
Kyiv/Yokohama/Rome – To address the impacts of the war in Ukraine on the global agricultural sector, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has launched a new $17 million project to help Ukrainian farmers save the upcoming harvest in July-August while ensuring export of critical agricultural goods to international markets.
Funded by Japan and implemented jointly with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, the project aims to restore grain storage capacity and functionality of supply chains from harvest to export as well as maintain productive capacity of Ukrainian farmers to enable continued future productions.
“Ukraine’s farmers are feeding themselves, their communities and millions more people around the world. Ensuring they can continue production, safely store and access alternative markets to sell their produce is vital to secure food availability, protect livelihoods, strengthen food security within Ukraine and ensure other import-dependent countries have a steady and sufficient supply of grain at a manageable cost,” said Rein Paulsen, Director of the FAO Office of Emergencies and Resilience.
Ukraine is one of the top-five global grain exporters, supplying more than 45 million tonnes of grain yearly to the global market. According to the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, due to the blockage of Black Sea ports, the country still has 18 million tonnes of last year’s cereals and oilseeds harvest in stores waiting for export. Alternative rail and river routes cannot make up for the lost exports through maritime transportation and bottlenecks along new, potential supply chains that have yet to be resolved.
This season Ukraine is expecting to harvest up to 60 million tonnes of grain. But the lack of export does not allow for the opening of available storage space for the new harvest, since 30 percent of the available capacity of granaries still remain filled with last year’s harvest.
“Within the new Japan-funded project, FAO will address storage deficit by providing the polyethylene grain sleeves, grain loading and unloading machinery to the smallholders and a variety of modular storage containers to the medium-sized producers and associations. Support will be provided to the farmers from ten oblasts of Ukraine: in the east, centre, south and north of the country,” said Pierre Vauthier, Head of FAO Ukraine Country Office.
In addition, the project will provide technical support to the Government to operationalize alternative transport routes for grain export and foster the rapid expansion of technical capacity of the Izmail laboratory. The facility will enable farmers to meet international standards including veterinary and food safety testing and certification.
FAO’s ongoing support to Ukraine
FAO has been operating in Ukraine since 2003 and since 2015 focused its activities on emergency support and development projects.
Following the start of the war, the Organization has developed and updated its Rapid Response Plan, calling for $115.4 million in funding to provide support to almost 980 000 small farmers and medium-sized producers through December 2022.
As of 29 June, FAO has already supported over 75 000 people with emergency agricultural support including distribution of seed potatoes and vegetable seeds and multipurpose cash assistance. An additional 44 000 people will be supported in the coming weeks to produce vegetables, cereal crops, milk, meat and eggs to feed themselves.
This is the second time Japan has contributed to fund FAO’s Humanitarian Response Programme in Ukraine followed by its first contribution in April 2022, adding up to a total of $20 million.
To date, with the additional funds from Japan, FAO has raised $30.4 million. The financial support has been also provided by Australia, Belgium, the CERF Rapid Response, the European Union, France, the Louis Dreyfus Foundation, Ukraine Humanitarian Fund and USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA). With more contributions, FAO would be able to reach more people to bolster food production and improve the food security situation in the country.

Title: EU and FAO supported import of consignment of buckwheat seeds donated by Canada
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
05 July 2022
With the support of European Union and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Union “Millers of Ukraine” have successfully completed the delivery of buckwheat seeds from Canada to Ukraine. The project, realized under the auspices of the Ministry of Agricultural Policy and Food of Ukraine, aims to overcome the shortage of buckwheat in the current year.
In total, Government of Canada bought and transferred to Ukraine 140 tonnes of buckwheat seeds of Sobo variety from Manitoba province. Seeds have come a long way of 8 000 km to Ukraine: across Canada to Montreal port, and to the port of Bremerhaven in Germany where the seeds had been moved to the customs warehouse and reloaded into trucks to Ukraine.
“As seeds are transferred in the form of humanitarian cargo, we have involved the Charitable Foundation "Kvity", which has the authority to receive humanitarian cargo. The costs for the movement of seeds were covered by Canada-Ukraine Foundation, Muehlenchemie GmbH, the USAID, EU and FAO,” said Rodion Rybchynskyi, Head of the Union “Millers of Ukraine”.
The contributions from EU were done within FAO EU-funded project following the request from the Ministry, as two containers were stuck in the port in Germany. Totally, EUR 9 000 were transferred to cover an urgent budget deficit for seeds transportation.
“We understood that cost increased and each day passed means additional costs at the port where the containers are stored.” said Christian Ben Hell, Head of Agriculture Sector at the EU Delegation to Ukraine. “In order to avoid further expenses and secure the distribution of these seeds in high demand in Ukraine, the European Union used part of the funds available under the contribution agreement between the EU and FAO”.
“According to the FAO analysis, since the beginning of the war the price for seeds, plant protection agents, fertilizers and fuel increased 40–45percent. In the upcoming seasons, producers may determine that standing crops are not profitable to harvest,” added Pierre Vauthier, Head of FAO Ukraine Country Office. “Understanding that, we focus our support on the small and medium-sized farmers. These buckwheat seeds are urgently needed to bolster local agricultural sector”.
The actual distribution of seeds is undertaken by the “International Buckwheat Association”, Skvyra Grain Processing and the Union “Millers of Ukraine”. The seeds will be delivered to the farmers from Chernihivska, Kyivska, Lvivska, Poltavska, Ternopilska, Zakarpatska and Zhytomyrska oblasts.
“Having received these buckwheat seeds we are able to support farmers to sow about 2,500 hectares in the west and center of Ukraine,” explained Rodion Rybchynskyi. “Taking into account the specialization, experience of farms and the quality of seeds, the yield from this area will be at least 2 tonnes per hectare, or 5 000 tonnes of buckwheat grain (3 000 tonnes of processed buckwheat groats)”.
According to Rodion Rybchynskyi, the main condition for farmers’ participation in the seed distribution program is the further transfer of the harvest from the received seeds at a fixed price to specialized processors of buckwheat grain, such as Skvyrskiy and Bilotserkiv Combines of Bread Products. In their turn, grain producers have to transfer processed groats at a fixed price to state and social institutions for humanitarian purposes.

Title: UN warns of toxic environmental legacy for Ukraine, region
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
04 July 2022
Nairobi/Kyiv, - Preliminary monitoring of the conflict in Ukraine points to significant impacts on urban and rural environments that could leave the country and region with a toxic legacy for generations to come, according to initial impact monitoring conducted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and partner organizations
The full range and severity of consequences will require verification and assessment, although thousands of possible incidents of air, water and land pollution and the degradation of ecosystems, including risks to neighbouring countries, have already been identified.
UNEP, the environment authority within the UN system, is supporting the Government of Ukraine on remote environmental impact monitoring and is preparing to undertake field-level impact assessments – expected to be a colossal task given the scale and geographical spread of reported incidents.
Support to disaster- and conflict-affected Member States and regions is core to UNEP’s mandate of delivering technical assistance and environmental governance support that keeps the state of the world’s environment under constant review.
Over the past twenty years, UNEP has conducted multiple conflict-related impact assessments, including in Afghanistan, Colombia, DR Congo, Kosovo and the Western Balkans, Iraq, Lebanon, the occupied Palestinian territories, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.
The organization has already conducted an initial scoping visit to Ukraine, in support of the UN Resident Coordinator and at the request of Ukrainian authorities and is mobilizing more support to help assess the broad range of environmental impacts.
“The mapping and initial screening of environmental hazards only serves to confirm that war is quite literally toxic,” said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen. “The first priority is for this senseless destruction to end now. The environment is about people: it’s about livelihoods, public health, clean air and water, and basic food systems. It’s about a safe future for Ukrainians and their neighbours, and further damage must not be done.”
“Ukraine will then need huge international support to assess, mitigate and remediate the damage across the country, and alleviate risks to the wider region,” she added.
As key donors, agencies and Member States meet in Lugano, Switzerland, this week to discuss Ukraine’s reconstruction, the United Nations’ top official in Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, stressed that “restoring Ukraine’s environment must be up at the top of the agenda.”
“Millions of displaced Ukrainians need a safe and healthy environment to come home to if they are expected to be able to pick up their lives. As soon as the fighting ends, and it must end soon, a colossal clean-up operation must be supported,” said Lubrani, the UN’s Resident Coordinator in Ukraine.
According to UNEP and partner data, the conflict has seen damage across many regions of the country, with incidents at nuclear power plants and facilities, energy infrastructure, including oil storage tankers, oil refineries, drilling platforms and gas facilities and distribution pipelines, mines and industrial sites and agro-processing facilities.
The result has been multiple air pollution incidents and potentially serious contamination of ground and surface waters.
Water infrastructure, including pumping stations, purification plants and sewage facilities, has also suffered significant damage, and multiple industrial facilities, warehouses and factories have been damaged, some storing a range of hazardous substances ranging from solvents to ammonia and plastics.
Hazardous substances have also been released from explosions in agro-industrial storage facilities, including fertilizer and nitric acid plants. There are also reports of the targeting of several large livestock farms, where livestock carcasses pose a further public health risk.
In many urban areas the clean-up of destroyed housing will bring its own challenges, with debris likely to be mixed with hazardous materials, particularly asbestos. Satellite imagery has also shown a significant increase of fires in various nature reserves and protected areas, as well as forested areas.
Furthermore, pollution from the extensive use of weapons including in populated areas and the large volumes of military waste, including destroyed military vehicles, creates a major clean-up challenge.

Title: THERE ARE NO EXCUSES: OSNAT LUBRANI, HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, ON THE AIRSTRIKE THAT HIT A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IN SERHIIVKA
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
01 July 2022
Today, the people of Ukraine woke up to see, once again, a group of civilians killed and injured by a senseless attack that this time hit Serhiivka in southern Odeska oblast. I was horrified by the images of the residential building completely destroyed, and my heart broke to see the rescuers still trying to find survivors under the debris. Until yesterday, it was home for the families of at least 16 people that were killed by the strike. Another four people, including a child, were killed in the recreational facility that was also hit nearby, according to the information verified by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Dozens have been injured, and some are now receiving attention at the local hospital.
It has not been even a week since dozens of civilians met the same terrible fate when another airstrike hit a shopping mall in the centre of Kremenchuk, in central Ukraine, killing and injuring many people who were just trying to carry on with their lives. Over the last days, we continued to receive mounting reports of civilians killed and injured due to intense hostilities across both Government and non-Government-controlled areas of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts. 

The level of human suffering caused by this war has no limits. 

The people of this country have had enough and have seen way too many of their loved ones killed, injured and traumatized, their families separated, and their homes, schools and hospitals bombed. It is high time that the parties to the conflict started to decisively comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. I call on them to respect the law and act in accordance with the principle of precaution, doing everything feasible to minimize or avoid civilian harm, including by verifying targets. There are no excuses.

Title: Remarks by Osnat Lubrani, Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, on  the humanitarian impact of four months of the war
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
30 June 2022
30 June 2022. KYIV – Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, held a media briefing on four months of the war on people in Ukraine and UN support efforts.

/As delivered/

Good afternoon to all of you, following us here, on TV or online, for the opportunity to explain how we have been working to alleviate the suffering of millions of people in Ukraine over the past four months.
During the past four months, Ukraine has been the epicentre of the world’s attention. And not for good reasons. Since the start of Russia’s war on Ukraine, the lives of every single woman, man and especially child in this country have been torn apart: their loved ones have been killed, injured and traumatized, their families separated, thousands of homes have been bombed. The level of human suffering cannot be explained with words. But maybe the numbers will give a better idea:
But this is probably not new information for the people of Ukraine who are hearing me today.
We are making every effort to support the people whose lives have been torn apart because of this war. But the Russian Federation, and the Ukrainian Government, they have to do more to protect the people of this country and to make our work possible.
The parties bear the responsibility for every violation under international humanitarian and human rights law. So, to conclude, I call on the parties to comply with their obligations, and protect civilians that have already suffered immensely because of the war, to protect civilian infrastructure that is vital for the people of this country, to decisively and urgently facilitate safe and unimpeded access for humanitarians to all regions, cities, towns, villages, where people need assistance, and to allow civilians to leave these areas if they want to. We are ready to do our part. The parties must do theirs.
Watch the briefing here.

Title: New report by UN Human Rights shows the shocking toll of the war in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
29 June 2022
The armed attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine has led to a grave deterioration of the human rights situation in the country with thousands of civilians killed and injured, massive destruction to civilian infrastructure and housing, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance, torture and ill-treatment, and conflict-related sexual violence, says the new UN Human Rights report issued today.
The report is based on findings by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) and covers the period from 24 February until 15 May 2022.
“The daily killing of civilians, the torture, disappearances and other violations must stop, If the hostilities will not stop, then the absolute minimum required is to fully respect international humanitarian and human rights law and commit to protecting every civilian woman, man and child and those hors de combat,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of HRMMU at the presentation of the report today.
The report documents that many of the means and methods of warfare have been in breach of international humanitarian law (IHL) rules governing the conduct of hostilities. In particular, the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution, which are aimed at avoiding, or at the very least, minimizing civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects, were not respected in numerous instances by Russian armed forces; and on a lower scale by Ukrainian armed forces.
The report documents unlawful killings, including summary executions of civilians that occurred in more than 30 settlements in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions that were committed by Russian armed forces while they controlled these areas in late February and March. As of 15 May, HRMMU had received information about more than 300 such killings. This figure may increase as new evidence becomes available. In Bucha alone, HRMMU documented that at least 50 civilians were killed by Russian armed forces while it was under their control. Cases of torture and ill-treatment of civilians are also highlighted in the report.
The report documents violations of IHL and international human rights law, to varying degrees, by both parties in relation to their treatment of prisoners of war and persons hors de combat, namely cases of extrajudicial execution, torture and ill-treatment, denial of medical assistance, exposure to public curiosity, and violations in relation to the conditions of their internment. While HRMMU enjoys unimpeded access to places of internment of prisoners of war in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine, the report calls for unimpeded confidential access for OHCHR and other independent international monitors to be granted by all parties to the conflict, in particular Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups.
“I stress that the prohibition of torture and arbitrary deprivation of life is absolute and applies all the time to all persons, regardless of whether they are civilians or combatants,” Ms Bogner said. “Perpetrators must be held to account and victims and their relatives must enjoy their rights to remedy and truth,” she added.
The armed attack has also been marred by conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV). HRMMU has received numerous allegations and has been able to verify 23 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, including cases of rape, gang rape, torture, forced public stripping, and threats of sexual violence. The majority of cases were committed in areas controlled by Russian armed forces, but there were also cases committed in Government controlled areas.
“Due to active hostilities, insecurity, mass displacement and stigma, victims of CRSV are often not able or willing to speak to others or register a complaint with law enforcement authorities. Understanding the full scale of sexual violence in this context may take years,” Ms Bogner said.
The report also documents 248 cases of arbitrary detention of representatives of local authorities, journalists, civil society activists and other civilians, many of which may amount to enforced disappearance, attributed to Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. Among those cases, six victims, one woman and five men, were eventually found dead. It also documented 12 cases which may amount to enforced disappearance by Ukrainian law enforcement bodies, of people suspected of providing support to Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups.
The report confirms allegations of forced conscription of men by Russian-affiliated armed groups in Donetsk and Luhansk. OHCHR recalls that forcing civilians to serve in the armed forces of a hostile power is a grave breach of IHL. Men who have been forcibly recruited should not face criminal prosecution by Ukrainian authorities for mere participation in hostilities.
Freedoms of opinion, expression, peaceful assembly and association have been drastically affected since the beginning of the armed attack. HRMMU is alarmed at the security risks faced by journalists and media workers in Ukraine. The report documents 17 cases of deaths of journalists, media workers and bloggers during hostilities, and 14 more cases of injured journalists. Moreover, many human rights defenders have not been able to perform their human rights work due to the ongoing hostilities and large-scale displacement. This has in turn deprived groups in vulnerable situations of invaluable support. In Crimea, the report documented 41 cases of prosecution of Crimean residents for “discrediting” or “calling for obstruction” of Russian armed forces. Multiple media outlets, previously accessible in Crimea, have also been blocked since 24 February 2022, which has seriously restricted the right to freedom of expression on the peninsula.
The report also provides details on the impact of hostilities on the rights of people in situations of vulnerability, including IDPs, Roma, persons with disabilities, and older persons.
The report includes detailed recommendations to the parties and the international community. “The parties should ensure timely and effective investigations into all allegations of violations, including torture, ill-treatment, arbitrary detention and sexual violence, and ensure that perpetrators are duly prosecuted,” Ms Bogner concluded

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY. BRIEFING ON THE IMPACT OF FOUR MONTHS OF WAR ON THE LIVES OF THE  PEOPLE OF UKRAINE AND EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE UNITED NATIONS TO  SUPPORT THEM
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
29 June 2022
//
WHO:
WHAT:
WHEN:
WHERE:

The more than four months of Russia’s war on Ukraine has created an alarming humanitarian situation across the country, particularly in the eastern Donbas region. Hostilities show no signs of abating, as proven by the last days’ intense wave of airstrikes and shelling, which, once again, has left dozens of civilians killed or injured, and homes, health facilities, a mall, and other civilian infrastructure damaged. The United Nations and humanitarian partners in Ukraine have provided life-saving assistance to nearly 9 million people since the war started. However, despite consistent and insistent engagement to negotiate access, humanitarians have been prevented from reaching areas where people desperately need support.
During this media briefing, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, will bring more information about the deteriorating situation, the needs of the people affected and the challenges faced by humanitarians in Ukraine to support those in need. Representatives from five UN agencies in Ukraine will answer questions about their work to make sure people whose lives have been upturned by the war can receive the help they need to survive.
The briefing can be followed online in English and Ukrainian, or at the Media Center Ukraine, in Kyiv.

Title: STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, OSNAT LUBRANI, ON THE AIRSTRIKE THAT HIT A MALL IN KREMENCHUK
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
27 June 2022
I am appalled by the news that an airstrike hit a shopping mall in the centre of Kremenchuk, in central Ukraine, today in the afternoon. Hundreds of people were believed to be inside the mall when it was struck. Although the number of casualties is yet to be known, whatever the number is, an attack that hits a shopping mall is utterly deplorable.
My thoughts and my heart are with the families and loved ones of the people that have been killed, with those injured, and with the people of Kremenchuk and Ukraine that had to witness another tragic event.
This is only one more example of the massive suffering that Russia’s war on Ukraine is causing on the people of this country. During the weekend, we saw the disturbing reports of a new wave of airstrikes and shelling hitting, once again, civilian infrastructure in several regions of Ukraine. Many civilians have been killed or injured, and homes, health facilities and other civilian infrastructure were reportedly damaged.
The United Nations strongly condemns the impact on civilians of these latest attacks, and I call for an independent investigation to hold those responsible accountable. I will not get tired of repeating that the parties to the conflict have an obligation under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. This includes respecting the principle of proportionality on any military operation, which prohibits attacks which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects.

Title: Statement by Amin Awad, Assistant Secretary-General and United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 June 2022
Today marks four months since the escalation of the war in Ukraine.
This war is nothing but a story of loss – loss of lives, loss of homes, loss of jobs. It has wreaked havoc in virtually all spheres of live, uprooted over 12 million Ukrainians, including millions of children, putting the future of an entire generation in peril, and risks throwing millions more into poverty. The war is also rocking global food and commodity markets, threatening to destabilize areas far beyond Ukraine.
The United Nations has expanded its presence in the country, working closely with the Ukrainian government as well as with over 300 local civil society partners and international non-governmental organizations, scaling up assistance at unprecedented speed. We are now reaching almost 9 million people with essential support.
In eastern Ukraine, heavy fighting continues with civilians trapped and cut off from food, drinking water and electricity. We continue to advocate for humanitarian access to these areas to reach civilians requiring urgent assistance.
Now it is time to redouble our efforts.
As we risk entering a protracted stage of the conflict and humanitarian needs continue to surge, we will continue to scale up and work side by side with the Ukrainian Government and its people. To do this, we rely on sustained international support and attention to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.
Winter is looming around the corner, potentially threatening the lives of millions. Humanitarian partners are working on an assistance plan to support the Ukrainian people during the upcoming harsh and long winter. However, the energy crisis goes beyond the capacities of humanitarians, requiring concerted efforts by States to support Ukraine in addressing urgent energy needs.
Those millions uprooted need a durable solution to end their displacement. This requires concerted efforts of all. Today, on the occasion of the launch of his Action Agenda on Internal Displacement, the SecretaryGeneral puts durable solutions first. Durable solutions cannot wait.
At the same, the Secretary General continues pursuing pathways to mitigate the global ramifications of the war’s devastating impact on food security by seeking to unblock critical grain and commodity trade.
The United Nations will continue its tireless efforts to respond. But the war must end now. We need peace in Ukraine.

Title: Humanitarians deliver life-saving supplies to people caught up in the fighting in Donetska oblast
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
21 June 2022
21 June 2022. KYIV — Food, water purification tablets, hygiene and other critical household items were delivered by UN agencies and NGOs in war-affected Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.
The United Nations and its humanitarian partners delivered yesterday 12 trucks of critical relief supplies for nearly 64,000 people in Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, in the Government-controlled areas of the eastern Donetska oblast. Months of escalating and intense fighting in Ukraine are taking an enormous toll on civilians and over 2.2 million people in Donetska oblast alone need life-saving assistance.

The situation in Sloviansk, formerly home to 100,000 people, is particularly concerning. Hostilities have damaged the water system, leaving the 25,000 people who remain in the city—mainly the elderly and the most vulnerable—without piped water. Electricity is limited and basic supplies are lacking in the few shops still working, with increasing prices further impacting people’s access to food and other vital items. “The city is only 10 km away from the front line and has experienced intense shelling over the past weeks. Almost nobody goes to the street. They spend their days hiding from the constant bombardment, without access to basic services,” explained the Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani.

In Sloviansk, humanitarians delivered water purification tablets and vital hygiene supplies to cover the needs of 20,000 people, critical household items to around 2,000 people and enough food to feed around 5,000 people for a month. In Kramatorsk, approximately 37,850 people—out of nearly 78,000 who remain in the city—will receive critical assistance, including kits to purify water and hygiene supplies for more than 20,000 people and food assistance for at least 10,000 women, men, girls and boys.

This humanitarian convoy—coordinated by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which notified both parties to the conflict to guarantee the safety of the operation—was possible thanks to the support of the international community to UN agencies and NGOs working to assist people whose lives have been overturned by the war.

Across the country, more than 300 humanitarian organizations—two-thirds of them national NGOs—have provided over 8.8 million people with life-saving assistance. However, the war has left almost 16 million people in Ukraine in need of humanitarian aid. “We have consistently and insistently engaged the parties to the conflict to make sure we can support people in Ukraine, wherever they are. Yet, we have been prevented from reaching areas where we know people need support now, including Mariupol, Kherson, and most recently Sievierodonetsk. We call on the parties to the conflict to facilitate safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all regions of Ukraine, so we can expand relief operations even further and support people who have suffered immensely because of these four months of war,” concluded Ms. Lubrani.

Title: UN in Ukraine calls for accountability for conflict-related sexual violence and remedy for survivors
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 June 2022
Russia's war on Ukraine has caused enormous suffering for civilians, including civilian deaths, injuries and mass destruction, and has also been marred by incidents of conflict-related sexual violence.
Although conflict-related sexual violence is mostly perpetrated against women, OHCHR has verified cases of sexual violence against women, men and girls. Due to active hostilities, mass internal displacement, the stigma associated with sexual violence and the breakdown of the referral pathways, survivors are often unable or unwilling to report to law enforcement authorities or service providers. Reporting of cases for accountability purposes often takes place only after survivors are in physical and emotional safety and have access to services, including medical and psychological assistance.
Last month, the United Nations and the Government of Ukraine signed a framework for cooperation that supports the design and delivery of priority interventions in the areas of justice and accountability as a central pillar of deterrence and prevention.
The agreement also addresses comprehensive service provision for survivors, including sexual and reproductive health services, medical and specialised mental health services, legal assistance, and livelihood support.
UN Women will continue supporting national partners’ efforts to raise awareness, and prevent conflict related sexual violence, especially within the frameworks of an updated National Action Plan on the Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325.
Following the survivor-centred approach and with strong UNFPA involvement, the online platform Aurora was launched last week. Aurora provides specialised psychotherapy for survivors of gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence. The platform provides remote specialised assistance for survivors in any part of Ukraine, including non-government-controlled areas and abroad.
On this International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict, we reiterate that conflict-related sexual violence is a crime under international human rights and humanitarian law. Adopting a survivor-centred approach to service provision, investigating and documenting all allegations, and ensuring accountability and justice is paramount. It’s also of vital importance to create a safe environment and enhance gender-sensitive mechanisms that will enable and empower survivors to report such violations without fearing of being discriminated against, stigmatised or blamed.

Title: Press Conference by Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine at Conclusion of First Visit to Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 June 2022
Kyiv, Ukraine
15 June 2022
Erik Møse, Chairperson of Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine
On behalf of the Commission of Inquiry for Ukraine, composed of Erik Møse (chair), Jasminka Džumhur and Pablo de Greiff, I want to welcome you to this press conference at the end of the Commission’s first visit to the country.
The Human Rights Council set up the Commission to investigate alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, and related crimes in the context of the Russian aggression against Ukraine, with a view to ensuring accountability. On 12 May 2022, the Human Rights Council also requested the Commission to address events that took place in late February and March in four specific regions of Ukraine. Consequently, the Commission has, during this ten-day long visit in Ukraine given priority to Kyiv city, Bucha, Irpin, Kharkiv and Sumy.
In Kyiv, we met with representatives of the Ukrainian parliament, of several ministries, and with the Prosecutor General, whom we had also met previously. The purpose of these encounters was to exchange information of relevance to the Commission’s mandate and to facilitate future investigations. We also met several Ukrainian NGOs that provided valuable inputs to our work.
During the visits to Bucha, Irpin, Kharkiv and Sumy, the Commission met with local authorities as well as civil society organizations, both of which provided significant assistance. Furthermore, the Commission received accounts from individuals who shared their painful stories.
Although far from fully staffed, the Commission’s first visit was very productive. At this stage we are not in a position to make any factual findings or pronounce ourselves on issues of the legal determination of events. However, subject to further confirmation, the information received and the visited sites of destruction may support claims that serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, perhaps reaching war crimes and crimes against humanity, have been committed in the areas.
In Bucha and Irpin, the Commission received information about arbitrary killing of civilians, destruction and looting of property, as well as attacks on civilian infrastructure, including schools. In Kharkiv and Sumy region, the Commission observed the destruction of large urban areas, allegedly as a consequence of aerial bombings, shelling, or missile strikes against civilian targets.

Jasminka Džumhur, Member of Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine
The Commission also had the opportunity to listen to internally displaced persons, including those coming from the East of Ukraine, who referred to displacement of people. Testimonies also included stories of destruction of civilian property; looting; the confinement, mistreatment, and disappearance of civilians, as well as reports about rapes and other forms of sexual abuse. The Commission will examine all these allegations further.
The Commission is concerned with the impact of the war on children. It considers it necessary to investigate further reports about the alleged transfer of children placed in institutions in the temporarily occupied territories to the Russian Federation as well as information about expedited citizenship and adoption processes for some of these children. In Ukraine, many displaced children have been separated from families. The physical destruction of schools and their use for the accommodation of IDPs raises challenges concerning the children’s access to education.
The Commission has previously stated that it would adopt a victim-centered perspective on its work, and that it would be faithful to its mandate, which asks it to make proposals regarding accountability. Criminal accountability is important, but so are other forms of accountability, including those that enhance the possibility that victims will be able to reconstruct their lives.
The Government of Ukraine is making efforts to meet the diverse needs of victims. While there are areas where greater institutional coordination is probably desirable, doing so while the conflict is ongoing poses particular challenges.

Pablo de Greiff, Member of Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine
The first visit of the Commission will be followed by visits to other parts of Ukraine before the Commission’s oral update to the Human Rights Council in September this year.
We will continue with the process of collecting evidence that may serve accountability purposes; whenever possible identifying individuals or entities, and will pay special attention to violations of a sexual nature, of the rights of children, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations.
The Commission will carry out its work independently, neutrally, and objectively, examining violations and abuses regardless of the identity of the perpetrator. We hope that all parties to the conflict will assist the Commission in its work.
Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to the Government of Ukraine for facilitating our mission, to Ukrainian civil society organisations, victims and witnesses, and to the various United Nations agencies for their kind collaboration. The Commission also wants to thank the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Ukraine for their indispensable collaboration to the visit.
We will be happy to take some questions now.

Title: WHO and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine scale up primary health care services for patients in war-affected areas in Ukraine

11 June 2022
//
Kyiv, 11 June 2022 – Today, WHO Representative in Ukraine Dr Jarno Habicht together with the Deputy Minister of Health of Ukraine Iryna Mykychak visited Moshchun, Bucha and Havrylivka - settlements of Kyiv region, where the majority of hospitals damaged, outpatient clinics destroyed during the war that led to disruption of access to essential health services and significant challenges in obtaining medical care.
According to WHO estimates, more than every third adult in Ukraine have health problems, caused by chronic noncommunicable diseases, and require systematic health care coverage, including counselling and medical support. The approximate number of people with chronic conditions in Bucha municipality (Kyiv oblast) accounts for around 10 000 people and up to 20 000 people in Gostomel, Borodyanka and Dymer communities.
To ensure access to primary health care and medicines in the affected areas of Kyiv region, WHO in Ukraine in partnership with the Ministry of Health and the Ukrainian Academy of Family Medicine initiated a project to support primary health care system in the format of mobile health units to bring essential health services closer to the people of Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka, Dymer, Ivankov and other surrounding communities.
“WHO is extending primary health care services in the communities of Kyiv oblast, severely affected by war. Working closely with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and Ukrainian Academy of Family Medicine, we facilitate access to essential medical services and medicines to people in Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Borodyanka and other hard-hit areas in the region through establishment and operation of mobile health units, which will conduct over 120 community visits and over 1500 primary health care consultations for war-affected patients over the coming months,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine.
“A full-scale war is ongoing in Ukraine, our brave people are defending our land every day. We defend the right to freedom and independence, to the future of Ukraine. Thanks to the international support, we have the opportunity to help the most affected by the war territories of Ukraine, in particular Kyiv region. We are grateful to the joint efforts of the Ministry of Health, WHO and the NGO "Academy of Family Medicine", the residents of the community gained access to medical care and medicines. By supporting local health care facilities, including primary health care centers and family medicine clinics, we are restoring the continuity of medical care to the war-affected population and providing psychological support. From the first days of de-occupation, the joint efforts of the Ministry of Health and the regional military administration organized outpatient medical care by specialists of specialized institutions - the Center for Emergency Care, "Ohmatdyt", the Heart Institute, Kyiv regional hospitals,” said Iryna Mykychak, Deputy Minister of Health of Ukraine.
"We are grateful to the World Health Organization for the partnership in the implementation of the project on mobile health teams in Kyiv region - an important initiative, facilitating access to primary health care services and essential medicines for population in war-affected settlements in Kyiv region," said Iryna Voloshyna, project manager for mobile teams from the NGO "Academy of Family Medicine of Ukraine".
During the visit to Kyiv region, Dr Jarno Habicht and Iryna Mykychak met with health care workers and thanked them for their efforts and tireless work in providing the necessary assistance to the affected population of Kyiv region in these difficult times.
Within the project, doctors in mobile health units conduct community visits, provide consultations and deliver health services, including medical examination, diagnosis, prescribing treatment and medication, referral to specialists/hospital for specialized care, promoting good health and counseling on preventing health problems, managing follow-up. They also focus on community outreach services and home visits to disabled persons and other affected patients in need to extend the essential health services closer to the people.
Over the next three month, the project aims at restoring and ensuring the continuity of care for the war-affected population, supporting local primary health care facilities and health workers with regard to restoration and integration of services into the e-Health system, improving access to and availability of medicines for patients with non-communicable diseases (diabetes, hypertension, asthma, etc.).
The project has been implemented by WHO with the support of Switzerland and the Government of Canada.

Title: A comment by Matilda Bogner, Head of UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), on the occasion of 100 days since the Russian Federation began its armed attack on Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
03 June 2022
A comment from Matilda Bogner, Head of UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), on the occasion of 100 days since the Russian Federation began its armed attack on Ukraine.
The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) has been able to verify the deaths of 4,183 civilians and 5,014 civilians injured, but we know that the actual numbers are considerably higher.
Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects. To date, we have documented the deaths of 3,524 civilians from the use of artillery and tank shelling, multiple launch rocket systems, missile and air strikes.
The extent of civilian death and damage and destruction of civilian infrustructure, strongly suggests that there have been violations of international humanitarian law, some of which may amount to war crimes.
The Mission has also documented the devastating impact of the war on other human rights. Among them we recorded unlawful killings, including summary executions, torture, ill-treatment, and conflict-related sexual violence.
HRMMU has also recorded more than 230 cases of conflict-related detention and enforced disappearance, reportedly perpetrated by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups of self-proclaimed ‘republics,’ as well as 12 cases of enforced disappearance of civilians, reportedly perpetrated by members of Ukrainian law enforcement bodies.
Parties to the conflict should put an end to civilian suffering, and fully respect obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law.
By the end of June, our Mission will issue a report on the impact of the armed attack by the Russian Federation on human rights in Ukraine. The report will include recommendations to all parties to the conflict to prevent further violations and to promote accountability for the violations that have already occurred.

Title: Statement by Amin Awad, Assistant Secretary-General and United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine marking 100 days since the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February

03 June 2022
Kyiv – (3 June 2022)
Today marks 100 days since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. This invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and of the Charter of the United Nations.
This war has taken an unacceptable toll on people and engulfed virtually all aspects of civilian life. This war has and will have no winner. Rather, we have witnessed for 100 days what is lost: lives, homes, jobs and prospects. We have witnessed destruction and devastation across cities, towns and villages. Schools, hospitals and shelters have not been spared.
Families and communities have been disrupted and uprooted. In just over three months, nearly 14 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, the majority women and children – a scale and speed of displacement not witnessed in history.
More than 3 million children saw their education suspended – an entire generation of children whose future hangs in the balance. All over the country, hundreds of thousands of people do not have access to water and electricity, and millions do not know where their next meal is coming from. 15.7 million people are in need of humanitarian support now, with numbers growing.
One hundred days on, the war ravages unabated especially in the east of the country. And with winter coming, millions of civilian lives could be in peril.
The United Nations agencies and humanitarian partners in Ukraine continue supporting those whose lives have been shattered by war. In the past 100 days, we have provided immediate humanitarian aid to some 8 million people across the country, including in besieged cities in the east of Ukraine.
At the same, the United Nations are pursuing every pathway to mitigate the global ramifications of the war’s devastating impact on food security by seeking to unblock critical grain and commodity trade.
Our tireless efforts to respond to the war’s devastating impact will continue, robustly and stead-fast.
But above all we need peace. The war must end now.

Title: Statement by the Secretary-General - on the 100th day of the war in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
03 June 2022
Today marks 100 days since the start of the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The conflict has already taken thousands of lives, caused untold destruction, displaced millions of people, resulted in unacceptable violations of human rights and is inflaming a three-dimensional global crisis – food, energy and finance – that is pummeling the most vulnerable people, countries and economies.
From the first days of the war, the United Nations has been there to support the people of Ukraine in dealing with the humanitarian impact of the conflict, while also drawing attention to the dangers and long-term implications of continued fighting and potential escalation of hostilities for the country, the wider region and the world.
As we mark this tragic day, I renew my call for an immediate halt to violence, for unfettered humanitarian access to all those in need, for safe evacuation of civilians trapped in areas of fighting and for urgent protection of civilians and respect for human rights in accordance with international norms.
The UN is committed to the humanitarian effort. But as I have stressed from the beginning, resolving this conflict will require negotiations and dialogue. The sooner the parties engage in good-faith diplomatic efforts to end this war, the better for the sake of Ukraine, Russia and the world. The United Nations stands ready to support all such efforts.
Thank you,

Title: UNHCR: Ukraine, other conflicts push forcibly displaced total over 100 million for first time
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 May 2022
Figure must ‘serve as a wake-up call’ for more action to promote peace and address all causes of forced displacement, says UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi
The number of people forced to flee conflict, violence, human rights violations and persecution has now crossed the staggering milestone of 100 million for the first time on record, propelled by the war in Ukraine and other deadly conflicts.

“One hundred million is a stark figure -- sobering and alarming in equal measure. It’s a record that should never have been set,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi. “This must serve as a wake-up call to resolve and prevent destructive conflicts, end persecution, and address the underlying causes that force innocent people to flee their homes.”

According to new data from UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide rose towards 90 million by the end of 2021, propelled by new waves of violence or protracted conflict in countries including Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Myanmar, Nigeria, Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In addition, the war in Ukraine has displaced 8 million within the country this year, and more than 6 million refugee movements from Ukraine have been registered.

At over 1% of the global population, the overall figure is equivalent to the 14th most populous country in the world. It includes refugees and asylum seekers as well as the 53.2 million people displaced inside their borders by conflict, according to a recent report from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC).

“The international response to people fleeing war in Ukraine has been overwhelmingly positive,” Grandi added. “Compassion is alive and we need a similar mobilization for all crises around the world. But ultimately, humanitarian aid is a palliative, not a cure. To reverse this trend, the only answer is peace and stability so that innocent people are not forced to gamble between acute danger at home or precarious flight and exile.”

UNHCR will release its annual Global Trends Report on June 16, outlining a full set of global, regional and national data on forced displacement for 2021, as well as more limited updates to April 2022, and details on returns and solutions.

Title: Nearly 5 million jobs have been lost in Ukraine since the start of the Russian aggression, says ILO
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 May 2022
Amid the humanitarian crisis sparked by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, labour markets are being disrupted both in the country and in neighbouring states.
GENEVA (ILO News) – An estimated 4.8 million jobs have been lost in Ukraine since the start of the Russian aggression, according to a new brief by the International Labour Organization (ILO).
The study estimates that if hostilities were to escalate employment losses would increase to seven million. However, if the fighting was to cease immediately a rapid recovery would be possible, with the return of 3.4 million jobs. This would reduce employment losses to 8.9 per cent, according to the brief, The impact of the Ukraine crisis on the world of work: Initial assessments.

The Ukrainian economy has been severely affected by the Russian aggression. Since it began, on 24 February, more than 5.23 million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries. The refugees comprise mainly women, children, and persons over the age of 60. Of the total refugee population, approximately 2.75 million are of working age. Of these, 43.5 per cent, or 1.2 million, were previously working and have lost or left their jobs.

In response to this disruption the Government of Ukraine has made considerable efforts to keep the national social protection system operational by guaranteeing the payment of benefits, including to internally displaced persons, through the utilization of digital technologies.
The crisis in Ukraine may also create labour disruption in neighbouring countries, mainly Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. If the hostilities continue, Ukrainian refugees would be forced to remain in exile longer, putting further pressure on the labour market and social protection systems in these neighbouring states and increasing unemployment in many of them.

The significant economic and employment disruption affecting the Russian Federation are having significant ripple effects on Central Asia, especially countries whose economies depend on remittances from the Russian Federation, such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

These four states are among the top ten countries of origin for migrants in the Russian Federation, and many of these migrants send a significant share of remittances back to their home countries. If the hostilities and the sanctions against the Russian Federation lead to job losses for migrant workers in the Russian Federation and these migrant workers return to their countries of origin, there will be severe economic losses in Central Asia as a whole.

The aggression in Ukraine has also created a shock for the global economy, further complicating the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. This is likely to affect growth in employment and real wages and put additional pressure on social protection systems.

In many high-income countries, which have recently witnessed signs of a stronger labour market recovery, the fallout from the Ukraine crisis may worsen labour market conditions and reverse some of the gains made. The situation is particularly hard in low- and middle-income countries, many of which have been unable to fully recover from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
In March, the ILO’s Governing Body passed a resolution calling on the Russian Federation  to “immediately and unconditionally cease its aggression” against Ukraine. It expressed its grave concern at reports of civilian casualties and attacks on civilian facilities and the severe impact on workers and employers who were risking their lives to continue working.

To mitigate the impact of the crisis on the Ukrainian labour market the ILO recommends several immediate measures, including to:

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, on the evacuations from Azovstal and Mariupol

//
"Another round of evacuations of civilians from Azovstal steelworks and other areas around Mariupol has been successfully concluded today. I am immensely relieved to confirm that more than 170 people who have endured over 10 weeks of intense shelling and fighting are now able to have some respite in Zaporizhzhia, where humanitarian organizations will provide immediate assistance to them.
This new safe passage operation - which brings the total number of people evacuated to over 600 - has been possible thanks to the determination and great work of our teams from the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, with whom I have worked hand to hand during the last 10 days. The close coordination and agreement with the parties to the conflict has also been vital to ensure we could carry out this complex operation safely.
Our work, however, is not yet done. The UN will not forget that scores of people have been prevented from joining the evacuation convoys over the last days. We will continue our engagements with both parties to the conflict to make sure we can reach people in desperate need of humanitarian assistance in Mariupol and other hard-to-reach areas across Ukraine, and ensure that those who want to leave have the guarantees to do so safely and in the direction of their choice."

Title: Minister of Health and WHO Director-General meet in Kyiv to discuss health needs and support for Ukraine

08 May 2022
//
Kyiv, 07 May 2022 – Viktor Liashko, the Minister of Health of Ukraine, and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, met in Kyiv today to discuss the devastating impact of war on Ukraine’s health system, the most pressing health issues and best ways WHO can provide health assistance for Ukrainian primary care facilities, hospitals and pharmacies to ensure continuity of care. “As a child of war myself, I relate a lot to what Ukrainians are going through,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “Building on our longstanding relationship with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health, WHO is more committed than ever to supporting Ukraine’s heroic health workers, with medical supplies and technical support to treat the wounded and deliver care wherever it is needed, but the medicine Ukraine needs most right now is peace. WHO continues to call on the Russian Federation to stop the war.”
“As we work on the immediate response, WHO is here to support Ukraine’s recovery, continue its halted health reforms and ensure that the health system comes out of the war stronger than ever,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine.
“I am deeply impressed and grateful to our doctors for their heroism, which they show every day, saving the lives of Ukrainians under fire. Today, more than ever, we need support from global institutions dedicated to protecting the lives and health of people around the world.
We are grateful for the support provided by WHO to ensure the provision of medical services and the supply of medical devices. We are in touch with the regional office almost around the clock. But as the Minister of Health of Ukraine, I have asked and will ask you to reconsider the termination of the Russian Federation's membership in the WHO Executive Committee and the transfer of the regional office for noncommunicable diseases from Moscow to Kyiv. An aggressor country cannot destroy and kill people with one hand and manage and make decisions in the field of health care with the other hand,” explained Viktor Liashko, the Minister of Health of Ukraine.
During a visit to Ukraine, Dr Tedros met with the representatives of the President’s Office, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Ukrainian health professionals and WHO staff in Ukraine.
Together with Viktor Liashko, WHO Director-General visited health-care facilities in Kyiv oblast and met Ukrainian health workers to hear about their first-hand experience and challenges they face amid the war. Minister of Health and Director-General of the World Health Organization thanked and expressed appreciation to the Ukrainian medical staff for their tremendous work and dedication in providing care to Ukrainian patients in these difficult times.
Ukraine’s health system is facing multiple challenges, with the situation growing more dire by the day. WHO works closely with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine to identify gaps and needs in the country’s health system and respond to meet those needs rapidly.
• To date, WHO has delivered 383 metric tonnes of medical supplies to the health-care facilities across Ukraine, reaching the east, south and north of the country where the need is greatest,
including enough trauma and emergency supplies to conduct up to 15,9001 surgeries medicines and healthcare equipment to serve 650,0002 people.
• WHO has also Established three health hubs in western Ukraine to support medical evacuations, and ensured safe medical evacuation of patients, including those suffering from cancer, for treatment outside Ukraine. More than 50 emergency medical teams have also been deployed to Ukraine and neighbouring countries to provide training and specialized medical care to supplement existing services.
• WHO supports Ukraine in mental health, vaccine preventable diseases, trauma and injury prevention, disease surveillance, health financing and other critical areas, also building capacity of Ukrainian healthcare providers on how to handle mass casualties.

Kyiv – (8 May 2022) - I am profoundly shocked by reports of an attack which struck a school building in Bilohorivka, the Luhansk Region in east Ukraine, where an estimated 90 people were seeking shelter.
The attack, which reportedly left dozens of people dead, is yet another stark reminder of the cruelty of this war. My thoughts are with the victims and their families.
Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be spared in times of war; these obligations under international humanitarian law are non-negotiable. The sooner we seek a peaceful end to the war, the better for the people here in Ukraine and everywhere in the world.
The United Nations agencies and its humanitarian partners in Ukraine will continue supporting those whose lives have been shattered by war.

Title: Ukraine: New UN Women and CARE Report highlights disproportionate impact of the war on women and minoritie
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
04 May 2022
After more than 2 months of war in Ukraine, which has forced millions of refugees and displaced people to flee their homes, a new Rapid Gender Analysis by UN Women and CARE reveals that women and minorities are facing immense hardship when it comes to health, safety and access to food as a result of the crisis. In Ukraine women are increasingly becoming heads of households and leaders in their communities as men are conscripted and yet they remain largely excluded from formal decision-making processes relating to humanitarian efforts, peace-making and other areas that directly impact their lives.
The analysis based on surveys and interviews with people in 19 regions in Ukraine between 2-6 April 2022, sheds a spotlight on the the gender dynamics of the crisis, and recommends actions for governments, the international community and other actors to implement in their humanitarian response.
“When it comes to humanitarian needs of displaced people, locals, and households – women do most of the work – they drive, provide hospitals and locals with medication and food, they care about their disabled relatives and children,” said a woman who participated in the survey.
The Report reveals that the impact of the war is particularly disproportionate for marginalized groups, such as female-headed households, internally displaced people, Roma people, LGBTQIA+ and people with disabilities. Many respondents from Roma communities gave testimony of severe discrimination, both in their daily struggle as well as in access to humanitarian aid.
The analysis also reveals that gender roles are changing in Ukraine. While many men have become unemployed and are primarily engaging in the armed forces, women report taking on new roles and multiple jobs to make up for the lost family income. Women are also performing vital roles in the humanitarian response in local communities, however, despite taking on increasing leadership roles in their families and communities, they are largely excluded from formal political and administrative decision-making processes.
With schools closed, high demand for volunteer work and the absence of men, women’s unpaid care burden has significantly increased. Backtracking on gender equality is already evident in the ongoing crisis. The war is increasing unemployment among the entire population and will likely push women into the unprotected informal sectors of the economy and increase poverty.
Women and girls also highlighted poor access to healthcare services especially for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV), and pregnant, expecting and new mothers as well as rising fears of GBV and lack of food, especially for those in heavy conflict areas. Many respondents also spoke of the challenges and barriers they face in accessing humanitarian aid and services; and around 50% of both, women and men, indicated that mental health was a main area of life impacted by the war.
“The rapid gender analysis proves the urgency to ensure that the humanitarian assistance addresses the different needs of women, men, girls and boys, including those that are from vulnerable groups,” says UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous. “We’re seeing that women have been performing vital roles in the humanitarian response in their communities. It is crucial that they are meaningfully involved in the formal planning and decision-making processes.”
“It is obvious that the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine concerns all genders”, notes Sofia Sprechmann Sineiro, Secretary General of CARE International. “However, a closer look helps to identify what specific needs each group has. Unhindered access to humanitarian aid for people with reduced mobility is a key concern that came up in our analysis, given the high percentage of elderly people or those with disabilities in conflict-affected areas. The same goes for specific support provided for single-parent – mostly female-headed – households as well as unaccompanied children. These groups need to be consulted and prioritized in humanitarian programs.”
Key recommendations of the Rapid Gender Analysis call for:

Title: STATEMENT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR UKRAINE, OSNAT LUBRANI

03 May 2022
Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, 3 May 2022
I am pleased and relieved to confirm that 101 civilians have successfully been evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol and other areas in a safe passage operation coordinated by the United Nations (UN) and the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC). The operation started on Friday 29 April and was agreed with the parties to the conflict, following engagements by the UN Secretary-General António Guterres during his recent visits to Moscow and Kyiv.
Thanks to the operation, 101 women, men, children, and older persons could finally leave the bunkers below the Azovstal steelworks and see the daylight after two months. Another 58 people joined us in Manhush, a town on the outskirts of Mariupol. We have accompanied 127 people today to Zaporizhzhia, about 230 kilometres north-west of Mariupol, where they are receiving initial humanitarian assistance, including health and psychological care, from UN agencies, ICRC and our humanitarian partners. Some evacuees decided not to proceed towards Zaporizhzhia with the convoy.
Over the past days, travelling with the evacuees, I have heard mothers, children and frail grandparents speak about the trauma of living day after day under unrelenting heavy shelling and the fear of death, and with extreme lack of water, food, and sanitation. They spoke of the hell they have experienced since this war started, seeking refuge in the Azovstal plant, many being separated from family members whose fate they still don’t know.
Seeing a 6-months old boy playing with a straw of grass, his delighted mother told me this is the first time in his life he has been able to do that. I saw the tears of joy as family members trapped in different parts of the plant for two months were reunited. Lyudmyla, an elderly woman, spoke of her longing to return to Mariupol where she has lived all her life, but she knew all too well that Mariupol, once a beautiful, vibrant city, is now decimated to rubble, and her family and friends are lost or dispersed. These stories from Mariupol and so many other places in Ukraine are a testament to the cruelty of this unjust war.
Today, we brought people safely to Zaporizhzhia. However, I worry that there may be more civilians who remain trapped. We stand ready to work with ICRC to return to Azovstal to evacuate them, and to do the same in all other areas experiencing intense and escalating fighting across Ukraine. The UN will continue to engage with the parties to the conflict for this purpose.
We are also committed to engage with the parties to return to Mariupol and bring urgent humanitarian support to people living in destroyed building with no access to water or electricity. We know it can be done, and it must be done.

"A safe passage operation to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal steel plant is ongoing today, Sunday 1 May. The efforts are coordinated by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, in coordination with the parties to the conflict.
It was agreed with both parties to the conflict that civilians who had been stranded for nearly two months in Azovstal - women, children and the elderly - will be evacuated to Zaporizka where they will receive immediate humanitarian support, including psychological services.
The operation started on Friday 29 April with a joint UN/ICRC convoy travelling some 230 kilometres from Zaporizka to reach the plant in Mariupol on Saturday morning, local time.
As the operations are still ongoing, we will not provide further details at this point, to guarantee the safety of the civilians and humanitarians in the convoy.
The UN will also continue to push for the safe passage out of Mariupol city for all those civilians who wish to leave. The UN is engaging actively with parties to advance these efforts."

Title: UN Secretary-General's remarks at press conference with President of Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
28 April 2022
--
President Zelenskyy, thank you very much for your warm welcome in these most difficult times.
Today, Ukraine is an epicenter of unbearable heartache and pain.
I witnessed that very vividly today around Kyiv: the senseless loss of life, the massive destruction, the unacceptable violations of human rights and the laws of war.
It is vital that the International Criminal Court and other UN mechanisms conduct their work so that there can be real accountability.
The position of the United Nations is clear.
As I said in Moscow, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and of the Charter of the United Nations.
I am here to focus on ways on how the UN can expand support for the people of Ukraine, saving lives, reduce suffering and help find the path of peace.
I want the Ukrainian people to know that the world sees you, hears you, and is in awe of your resilience and resolve.
I also know that words of solidarity are not enough.
I am here to zero in on needs on the ground and scale up operations.
Let me be very clear. The Security Council failed to do everything in its power to prevent and end this war.  This is a source of great disappointment, frustration and anger.
But the men and women of the United Nations are working every day for the people of Ukraine, side by side with so many brave Ukrainian organizations.
I salute the more than 1,400 staff of the UN — the vast majority of whom are Ukrainian nationals. They are on the ground in 9 operational hubs and 30 locations.
Many have been here from day one — and we have sent in additional personnel since then to serve the Ukrainian people.
They are engaged in an enormously complicated mission under difficult conditions.
This is one of the fastest scale-up operations we have ever undertaken, and we are very much aware that not everything is perfect.  Whatever we can provide pales in comparison to the needs.
I am here to pledge that we will boost our efforts across the board – coordinating with the Ukrainian Government every step of the way.
Until now, we have provided life-saving humanitarian aid to 3.4 million people inside Ukraine – and we are aiming to more than double that number to 8.7 million by the end of August. Some recent estimates show a worst-case scenario in which some 25 million people could be in need of humanitarian assistance by the end of this year. We hope this scenario does not materialize but we are obliged to plan for it.
We are expanding our cash assistance – distributing $100 million per month, reaching 1.3 million people by May and covering 2 million by August.
This will be done in very close coordination with the Ukrainian Government.
This is not a typical humanitarian UN operation in a developing country, with lots of problems of governance and lots of difficulties. Ukraine is a country with a government and a system of support to its citizens, and so the role of the UN is not replace that system, it is to support the Government to support the people of Ukraine.
Our food aid has reached 2.3 million people, but we want to help 4 million by May and 6 million by June, and the plans will be implemented.
With more than 12 million Ukrainians who have fled their homes, we are supporting host countries that have generously received over 5 million refugees. But, more important, we are increasing our capacity to meet the needs of the 7.7 million that have been displaced inside the country based on the recent survey by the International Organization for Migration.
The World Health Organization is delivering medical supplies for trauma and emergency care for more than seven million people. We are also stepping up our vital efforts to extend urgent health care, emergency shelter, water and sanitation and to protect children and end gender-based violence, all in very close contact and very close coordination with the Ukrainian Government.
And we are advancing the work of accountability and justice by monitoring and reporting on human rights violations wherever they are detected.
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
All this work is essential, but it doesn’t address the root cause of all this human suffering: the war itself.
This war must end, and peace must established in line the charter of the United Nations and international law.
Many leaders have made many good efforts to stop the fighting, though these efforts, so far, have not succeeded.
I am here to say to you, Mr. President, and to the people of Ukraine: We will not give up.
As we keep pushing for a full-scale ceasefire, we will also keep striving for immediate practical steps to save lives and reduce human suffering.
Effective humanitarian corridors.  Local cessations of hostilities.  Safe passage for civilian and supply routes.
Today, the people of Mariupol are in desperate need for just such an approach.
Mariupol is a crisis within a crisis.
Thousands of civilians need life-saving assistance.
Many are elderly, in need of medical care or have limited mobility.
They need an escape route out of the apocalypse.
During my visit to Moscow, President Putin agreed, in principle, to the involvement of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol.
Today, President Zelenskyy and I had the opportunity to address this issue.
As we speak, there are in intense discussions to move forward on this proposal to make it a reality.
Finally, let me say that, in many ways, we are at ground zero for the world we need to build – a world of respect for international law, the UN Charter and the power of multilateralism, a world that protects civilians, a world that advances human rights, a world where leaders live up to the values that they have promised to uphold.
That, too, is a struggle – but it is one that we must win for the sake of every country, community and person around the world.
Thank you.

28 April 2022
// A transcript of remarks made to the press in three different locations outside of Kiyv, Ukraine //

BORODYANKA TOWN:
When I see those destroyed buildings, I must say what I feel. I imagined my family in one of those houses that is now destroyed and black. I see my granddaughters running away in panic, part of the family eventually killed. So, the war is an absurdity in the 21st century. The war is evil. And when one sees these situations our heart, of course, stays with the victims. Our condolences to their families, but are emotions are that there is no way a war can be acceptable in the 21st century. Look at that.

BUCHA (Church of the St Andrew the First-Called All Saints)
When we this horrendous site, it makes me feel how important it is [to have] a thorough investigation and accountability. I am glad that International Criminal Court is seized of the situation and that the prosecutor's office was already here. I fully support the International Criminal Court and I appeal to the Russian Federation to accept to cooperate with the International Criminal Court. But when we talk about war crimes, we cannot forget that the worst of crimes is war itself.
Thank you very much.

IRPIN (destroyed Irpinsky Lipki residential complex)
This horrific scenario demonstrates something that is unfortunately, always true:  civilians always pay the highest price. Innocent civilians were living in these buildings. They were paying the highest price for a war for which they had not contributed at all. And this is something everybody should remember, everywhere in the world. Wherever there is a war, the highest price is paid by civilians.

Title: The UN Urges an Immediate Pause in Fighting as the Situation in Mariupol Deteriorates Sharply
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 April 2022
The UN calls for pause in fighting to allow safe evacuation of civilians in besieged Mariupol.
Kyiv – (24 April 2022) - The United Nations on Sunday called for an immediate stop in fighting in the besieged city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine to allow civilians reportedly trapped in the city to get out safely.
“The lives of tens of thousands including women, children and older people, are at stake in Mariupol,” said Amin Awad the UN’s Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine. “We need a pause in fighting right now to save lives. The longer we wait the more lives will be at risk. They must be allowed to safely evacuate now, today. Tomorrow could be too late.” Awad said.
Earlier this month, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a humanitarian pause in hostilities as Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter.
Today on Easter Day, Awad reiterated Guterres’ appeal for a halt to fighting to allow lifesaving supplies into Mariupol and other areas under attack and enable the departure of those wanting to leave amid reports of the situation in Mariupol deteriorating dramatically.
“At a time of a rare calendar alignment of the religious holidays of Orthodox Easter, Passover and Ramadan, it is the time to focus on our common humanity, setting divisions aside,” he said.

Title: The UN Reiterates the Call for an Easter Truce in Ukraine Amid a Growing Humanitarian Crisis and Mounting Displacement
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
20 April 2022
Kyiv, 20 April 2022 – The United Nations today (Wednesday) said it was gravely alarmed by the mounting humanitarian crisis in Ukraine amid an intensifying Russian offensive in the east of the country.
“The loss of life and severe trauma caused by attacks on hospitals, schools and places of refuge is utterly shocking, as is the devastation of critical civilian infrastructure in the country” said Assistant Secretary-General and UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad.
The war has caused the largest and fastest wave of displacement in recent memory. Of the 12 million displaced, more than 5 million have fled the country and at least 7.1 million remain displaced within Ukraine, many of them without water and electricity. Another 12 million are affected by economic hardship and decline in services.
Water infrastructure and power outages have left some 1.4 million people in the eastern part of the country without access to running water, including in besieged Mariupol. Millions more have only very limited access to water and electricity. Some 136 attacks on healthcare facilities were recorded since the start of the hostilities, accounting for more than 68% of worldwide attacks on health care so far this year. Growing insecurity, including due to contamination with explosive devices, is a significant obstacle to accessing hard to reach areas in the east.
“This terrible toll on civilians must come to an end,” said Awad, warning that the war’s devastating impact could affect Ukraine for generations and echoing the UN Secretary-General’s recent call for restraint and a humanitarian pause. Awad said this would allow for safe passage of civilians willing to leave conflict areas and for the safe delivery of urgent humanitarian aid to people in the hardest hit areas of Mariupol, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk.
“During this week which marks a rare calendar alignment of the three of the most sacred religious holidays of Christian Orthodox Easter, Jewish Passover and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan it is the time to focus on converging interests and set aside our differences. The immediate impact of this senseless war is the gravest here in Ukraine but it could have global ramifications, putting 1.7 billion people worldwide at risk of poverty, hunger and destitution” Awad concluded.
Since the beginning of the hostilities, the United Nations and partners scaled up relief operations to reach 2.5 million people across Ukraine. The UN is working closely with the Government of Ukraine to further boost the humanitarian response in the country and strengthen coordination through a newly established high-level National Coordination Platform.

Title: 3.4M EURO donated to WHO to help meet Ukraine’s health needs by Denmark-based Novo Nordisk Foundation
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
13 April 2022
Copenhagen, 13 April 2022
The Novo Nordisk Foundation has donated 25 million DKK (~3.4 million EUR), to the emergency response, as a result of the war, of the World Health Organization in Ukraine and countries that are hosting Ukrainian refugees.
The funds granted by the Denmark-based Foundation are fully flexible and can therefore be swiftly used to cover urgent needs in WHO’s response to a complex health emergency where the situation on the ground is extremely fluid.
“The situation in Ukraine grows more dire by the day and requires continued awareness from the international community. With this grant, the Novo Nordisk Foundation is supporting the important work WHO is doing to ensure access to imperative health services in Ukraine and neighbouring countries affected by the invasion,” says Hanna Line Jakobsen, Senior Vice President, Novo Nordisk Foundation.
The Foundation is one of the largest philanthropic actors in the world. In 2021 alone, it awarded DKK 8.8 billion (EUR 1,182 million) in grants. Previously, the Foundation had, after the war broke out on 24 February, released 55 million DKK/7.4 million EURO to emergency relief efforts in and around Ukraine.
WHO’s emergency appeal
Taking on one of its biggest public health challenges in decades, the World Health Organization in Europe, barely a week after the war started in Ukraine; issued an emergency appeal, detailing priorities and funding needs in the next three months; a total of 52 million EUR.
As of April 13, the appeal is more than fully funded, thanks to donors like the Novo Nordisk Foundation – enabling WHO to reach up to 6 million people in need.
“Contributions such as this mean that we can train health workers to tackle urgent needs, that insulin reaches those with diabetes, that hospital operating theatres remain equipped and stocked, and that tourniquets and morphine reach facilities treating the wounded. This donation, and others like it save lives,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
Based on growing needs and developments in Ukraine and surrounding countries; and the stark fact that the ongoing hostilities have triggered some of the fastest growing population movements in recent memory, WHO will be issuing a second appeal in the coming days.
The total number of forcibly displaced people, internally and across borders, as a result of the war in Ukraine  is currently estimated at 11.4 million. Of the nearly 5 million that have sought refuge in neighbouring countries where they require basic health, nearly half are in Poland.
Within Ukraine’s borders, essential health care is disrupted; jeopardizing the treatment of chronic diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The risk of infectious diseases is significant and routine immunization has come to a halt, as has COVID-19 vaccination. Access to reproductive-, mental- maternal- and ante-natal care, is severely impacted due to security concerns, restricted mobility, broken supply chains and mass displacement.
WHO’s response
To date, WHO has reached more than half a million people in Ukraine – through the delivery of 180 metric tonnes of medicine and emergency medical supplies. The UN health agency’s priority is emergency and trauma care and continuity of essential health services in the war-torn country.
WHO has been in Ukraine since 1994, is the Health Cluster lead agency there and works with more than 80 national and international partners on the ground.
From its warehouse in Lviv, western Ukraine, WHO is delivering medical supplies on a near-daily basis through an extensive supply chain across the entire country. WHO is also working to open an operational hub in Dnipro in eastern Ukraine.

Title: UNDP launches new programme to address the socio-economic impact on Ukraine caused by the war
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 April 2022
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has announced its new support programme to meet the needs of millions of people in Ukraine over the next two years.
“The war in Ukraine continues to inflict immense human suffering and early estimates project that close to two decades of socio-economic progress could be lost if the war continues -- with 9 out of 10 people at risk of falling into poverty,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “As part of a coordinated UN response, UNDP has an unwavering commitment to stay and deliver for the people of Ukraine -- that includes supporting the Government to sustain essential governance structures for emergency response management, deliver vital public services, and protect livelihoods.”
Preventing deep-set reversals in development progress is why UNDP has launched a comprehensive programme to support the Government of Ukraine and UN-led humanitarian and crisis response. “It’s vital that UNDP continues to deliver alongside our UN sister agencies and humanitarian partners,” Steiner said. “The country needs immediate humanitarian assistance, but we also need to keep the local economies going – this is fundamental to ensure that people still have livelihoods.”
The new UNDP programme is informed by early socio-economic assessments and is built around three pillars:
I. supporting the Government-led crisis response and public service delivery,
II. leveraging Ukraine’s human capital, economic capacities and natural resources to meet immediate humanitarian needs and strengthen resilience, social and economic recovery, and
III. strengthening institutions and civil society to maintain the social fabric, uphold human rights and ensure inclusion, protection and empowerment of all people.
UNDP focuses particularly on the most vulnerable and on ensuring women and girls’ equitable access to basic needs and livelihood support; including skills development, business support, and helping to build women’s access to finance, networks and markets. Addressing the increased vulnerability of women to violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, is a priority. UNDP is also engaging local institutions and civil society in the response efforts at community level.
The foundations for UNDP’s scaled-up programme of support now and over a longer period are already in place, with UNDP leveraging its longstanding and extensive field presence in Ukraine, which it has maintained despite the ongoing war, and its extensive partnership network in the country.

Title: Ukraine: UN High Level Officials urge the swift investigation of sexual violence allegations and call for strengthened measures to protect women and girls
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
09 April 2022
This statement is attributable to Ms. Pramila Patten, UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, and Ms. Sima Bahous, Executive Director of UN Women.
NEW YORK (07 April 2022) – We are deeply shocked by the images of civilians killed in Bucha and other localities, and gravely concerned about mounting allegations of sexual violence perpetrated against women and girls in the context of the war in Ukraine. We echo the UN Secretary-General in his calls for the war in Ukraine to stop- now. Such wars and related displacement heighten risks of all forms of sexual violence including trafficking in persons, impacting women and girls disproportionately. Rigorous investigation of allegations of sexual violence must be conducted to ensure justice and accountability, as a central aspect of deterrence and prevention of such crimes. It is vital that all efforts are made to ensure protection and the provision of life-saving and recovery services for survivors of sexual violence. While security and access restrictions continue to pose significant challenges for the verification of information by the United Nations, this should not paralyse urgent and immediate action to put in place prevention and response measures.
The allegations of sexual violence raise serious questions about possible war crimes. International humanitarian and human rights law, which categorically prohibit rape and all forms of sexual violence and inhumane treatment, must be fully complied with by all parties to the conflict. Orders should be immediately issued through their respective chains of command prohibiting rape and other forms of sexual violence, with concrete, timebound preventive measures as explicitly outlined in Security Council resolutions 2106 and 2467.
To respond to the urgent needs of affected populations, the United Nations is bolstering protection and response services for victims and survivors of sexual violence, including for their sexual and reproductive health needs. These services are being designed and carried out in collaboration with Ukrainian civil society, in particular with local women’s organizations. All responses must be survivor-centred, ensuring that the safety and well-being of survivors are the paramount consideration.
We commend and express our appreciation for the countries receiving and hosting refugees and encourage them to ensure that comprehensive services are available for survivors of sexual violence. Member States and civil society can count on our full support in their efforts to prevent and respond to sexual violence, as well as in fulfilling their obligations to securing justice for survivors.

Title: Statement by the UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad on behalf of the United Nations Country Team in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 April 2022
The United Nations agencies in Ukraine are deeply shocked by reports of the missile attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk, in northern Donetska oblast, where at least 39 civilians have been killed, including 4 children, and at least 100 injured.
Since many people have suffered catastrophic injuries, we fear the number of fatalities is likely to rise.
The United Nations calls for an immediate investigation of this attack. It was widely reported over the last two days that the station and surrounding area had been full of civilians attempting to flee intensifying hostilities. We are extremely disturbed by the reports of children, women, the elderly and people with disabilities – the most vulnerable people in the Kramatorsk area – who were caught up in this attack.
The use of explosive weapons with wide area impact in populated areas is a clear violation of international humanitarian law. All military forces, in all conflicts, must not carry out attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. They must do their utmost to protect civilians.
Hospitals in the surrounding area are full. We and our humanitarian partners are ready to do anything we can to help those who are responding to the attack and those who have survived. We have delivered first aid supplies as well as emergency food rations, water purification tablets and blankets.
We continue to call on all the parties to this conflict to allow safe and unimpeded passage for people who wish to leave, to prevent attacks on essential transportation for civilians, and for life-saving relief supplies to reach those unable to move or evacuate.

Title: WHO records 100th attack on health care in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 April 2022
A grim milestone has been crossed today in the war in Ukraine – more than 100 attacks on health care verified by WHO since the start of the war on February 24. The attacks so far have claimed 73 lives and injured 51.
Of the current total of 103 attacks, 89 have impacted health facilities and 13 have impacted transport, including ambulances.
“We are outraged that attacks on health care are continuing. Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, at a press conference. “Peace is the only way forward. I again call on the Russian Federation to stop the war.”
“It’s a truly sad irony that we are recording this milestone of over 100 attacks on health in Ukraine on World Health Day,” noted Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe who visited the humanitarian hub of Lviv in western Ukraine today. “I have been personally struck by the resilience and fortitude of health care providers and indeed of the health system itself in Ukraine. WHO has been working to ensure supply lines remain open to allow lifesaving health and medical supplies to reach cities and towns nationwide, and continued attacks on health make this effort all the more challenging.”

This milestone of over 100 attacks on health spans barely 42 days since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began. The impact of this violence is not only immediate, in the numbers of deaths and injuries – but also long-term in the consequences for Ukraine’s health care system. It’s a major blow to the country’s efforts to institute health reforms and achieve universal health coverage, a goal it had made significant progress on before the war erupted.
“Across Ukraine, 1000 health facilities are in proximity to conflict areas or in changed areas of control,” explained Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine “Health workers throughout the country are risking their lives to serve those in need of medical services, and they, and their patients, must never be targeted. Further, when people are prevented from seeking and accessing health care, either because the facilities have been destroyed or out of fear that they may become a target, they lose hope. The mental health toll wreaked by the war cannot be underestimated, affecting civilians and the health workforce alike."
Attacks on health are unfortunately seen amid conflicts globally. Since 1 January 2022, WHO has verified 160 attacks on health care in 11 countries and territories resulting in 97 deaths and 74 injuries. Outside of Ukraine at this time, Sudan is also witnessing a recent increase in attacks on health care.

Notes to the editor
What’s the definition of an attack on health?
An attack on health care is any act of verbal or physical violence or obstruction or threat of violence that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of curative and/or preventive health services. Types of attacks vary across contexts and can range from physical violence, psychosocial threats and intimidation to use of heavy weaponry against healthcare facilities.
Attacks on health care include attacks on health facilities, transport, personnel, patients, supplies and warehouses.
What’s WHO’s role?
WHO has been tasked by WHA to monitor and disseminate reports on attacks on health (WHA Resolution 65.20).
Our Attacks on Health Care initiative aims to strengthen protection for health workers everywhere so they can provide healthcare in a safe environment without disruption from acts of violence. The initiative has three main pillars of work including (1) the systematic collection of data on attacks, (2) advocacy for preventing attacks, and for stopping them if they occur, and (3) the promotion of good practices and heightened awareness for protecting healthcare from attacks.
How does WHO carry out its role?
WHO’s Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA), launched in December 2017, is the main mechanism for collecting primary source data of attacks on healthcare in countries with complex humanitarian emergencies. Its methodology allows the cataloguing of attacks and provides data based on a level of certainty for each incident. The resulting information is then made publicly available.
Does WHO make other information on attacks on health care publicly available?
WHO does not share data beyond information published on the SSA dashboard, which has specific measures in place to protect the confidentiality of sources and to prevent any further harm to survivors of an attack and the affected community.
Does WHO investigate attacks on health care?
WHO is neither mandated nor equipped to investigate these attacks, including identification of the perpetrators.  WHO’s role is to systematically collect and disseminate data on attacks. It does so by verifying that attacks on healthcare have occurred in order to highlight their extent and consequences. Other bodies within the United Nations system have the mandate to investigate attacks on healthcare and WHO cooperates with them.

Title: WHO and Ukrainian health authorities - united in sustaining health services and medical supply lines on World Health Day and beyond
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
07 April 2022
Lviv, 7 April 2022 – Health system resilience amid the impact of war, urgent and growing needs for affected civilians, and WHO’s support at this time of challenge were center-stage as Ukraine’s Minister of Health, Viktor Liashko met with the World Health Organization’s Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge on World Health Day in Lviv, western Ukraine, where millions of people have sought refuge since the war started on 24 February.
Dr Kluge is on a two-day visit to Ukraine to meet with representatives of the Ministry of Health, Ukrainian health professionals, WHO staff working on the emergency response as well as those directly impacted by the war.
Mr Liashko and Dr Kluge visited different health facilities - a children’s hospital and an emergency hospital among them – thanking health workers for their lifesaving efforts and meeting with internally displaced Ukrainians in need of essential health services.
“Every day I ascertain that our health workers are an example of sacrifice and heroism. They continue saving lives while under attack. Doctors shield pregnant women and newborns with their bodies, and emergency care physicians are the first to go to the hotspots in the country, but none of them have left their jobs. This is an example for the whole Europe and the world,” said Viktor Liashko, the Minister of Health of Ukraine.
“I am here in Ukraine to stand in solidarity with the health care workers in the country. I thank them for their dedication and professionalism – as they continue to deliver care in the face of unimaginable human suffering and in scenes of total devastation - that no nurse, doctor, midwife, ambulance driver, pharmacist, therapist or social worker should ever have to experience,” said Dr Kluge.
WHO has operated in Ukraine since 1994, working closely with the Ministry of Health to identify gaps and needs in the country’s health system - and swiftly respond.
“Our preparation for a potential catastrophic health emergency, including the prepositioning of supplies, actually started years ago, when hostilities occurred in eastern Ukraine. Since the current war broke out, we’ve massively scaled up our operations. Our focus is not only on ensuring that the wounded are cared for but also on maintaining essential health services. That means that all those with chronic conditions have access to medicines and medical services, and that hospitals are stocked to remain operational,” Dr Kluge added. In the past six weeks, WHO has reached at least a half-million people and delivered approximately 180 metric tonnes of medical supplies to health-care facilities nationwide, including in Cherkasy, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Odessa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhya and Zhytomyr.
The shipments include trauma and emergency surgery kits, emergency medical supplies and medicines to support surgical and primary health care needs. WHO also monitors and verifies attacks on health, and has, as of April 6, verified 91 attacks on health care that have caused 73 deaths and 46 injuries. The number of internally displaced people, forcibly displaced by hostilities, now exceeds 7 million. According to IOM, 32% of households of internally displaced people report having a chronically ill family member, 20% a disabled one, and 56% an elderly family member. Also, in more than 60% of the households that are forcibly displaced, there is one child or more, aged 5-18.

Title: Japan contributes US$4.5 million to clear explosive ordnance and remove debris in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 April 2022
The emergency grant will help ensure safe human mobility and access to essential goods and services for humanitarian support.
The Government of Japan announced a contribution of US$4.5 million to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for emergency Explosive Ordnance (EO) clearance and debris removal in Ukraine. The project will help provide safe access for humanitarian deliveries through the restoration and maintenance of critical routes, to be implemented by UNDP over a period of six months in collaboration with UN sister agencies and mine action partners.
Five weeks into the war, the widespread presence of landmines, cluster munition, and other Explosive Ordnance pose a considerable and mounting threat to civilian populations and prevent lifesaving provisions from being delivered to hard-to-reach affected communities which further exacerbate   an already catastrophic and life-threatening situations.
In parallel, the mounting number of damaged and unstable buildings and subsequent extensive debris pose a real threat to human health from uncontrolled collapse, contamination, and prevention of access to basic services.
“Delivery of food and medication are immediate needs for the war-affected communities and can only be delivered when safe passage and access to target locations is safely ensured,” said Manal Fouani, acting UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine. “With this timely and highly strategic support from Japan, such safe access will be further enabled. UNDP highly welcomes the initiative by the Government of Japan to be among the first partners to contribute to the emergency clearance of explosive ordnance and debris removal in Ukraine.”
A statement released on April 5 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan regarding their Emergency Grant Aid for humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries stated that: “The Government of Japan will continue to provide support for and stand by the people of Ukraine who are facing hardship, in collaboration with the international community, including the G7 members.”
UNDP, as the lead UN mine action cluster coordinator in Ukraine and in close collaboration with UNMAS, UNICEF, GICHD, and other partners, will leverage its long-term in-country presence and experience to facilitate safe access for both humanitarian and critical infrastructure repair through:
1. identifying critical delivery routes in close coordination with local authorities on their immediate needs for access and humanitarian actors,
2. liaising with the National Mine Action Authority (NMAA) to survey and clear these routes of EO presence,
3. facilitating safe access with the demolition of any unstable structures and the removal of debris, and
4. maintaining cleared routes for continued safe access.
While the situation remains fluid, UNDP will carefully select the areas for emergency safe access and restoration of critical infrastructure in consultation with the State Emergency Services (SES), the Government of Ukraine and in alignment with partner UN agencies and NGOs, where the humanitarian needs are most acute.
This project is part of the UNDP’s integral response to the UN system-wide appeal launched on 1 March, 2022 to support immediate efforts to protect and assist those most affected in Ukraine.

Title: Ukraine: Crisis averted for now – WHO, PEPFAR and partners ensure supply of antiretroviral drugs for people living with HIV
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 April 2022
Faced with alarming reports of disrupted HIV treatments threatening the lives of thousands of people, WHO, the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Ukrainian authorities and partners are ensuring the supply of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), covering most of the needs of every single person known to be living with HIV in Ukraine for the next 12 months.
“This war has the potential to undermine the hard-earned progress of recent years on a number of health issues, including HIV. We couldn’t let that happen when Ukraine had begun to turn a corner on HIV, with fast-growing access to antiretroviral drugs, as well as improved diagnosis and treatment,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
WHO, together with PEPFAR; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Ukrainian Ministry of Health’s Public Health Centre (UPHC), and the nongovernmental organizations Alliance for Public Health and 100% Life, ensured the procurement of 209 000 packs of the antiretroviral drug TLD (tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir).
This means that most of the needs of every single person known to be living with HIV in Ukraine will be met for the next 12 months. The first batch of the ARVs has crossed the Polish border into Ukraine and is about to be transported to HIV service facilities across the war-torn country.
The threat of disrupted treatments
An estimated 260 000 people are living with HIV in Ukraine. Prior to the war, over half, or nearly 150 000 people, were on life-saving antiretroviral treatment, including more than 2700 children. Without the access to medicines they now have, these people would have been at grave risk.
To keep opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB) at bay, continuous access to ARVs is vital. This is in line with WHO’s strategy of tackling what is sometimes referred to as a dual epidemic; with TB being one of the leading causes of death in people infected with HIV.
“What made this possible in a matter of weeks – much faster than ever before – is the fact that everyone was aware of what was at stake: the looming threat of treatments cut short. Every actor involved did their utmost to prevent disrupted treatments or people forced to change medication, something that can lead to loss of life,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine
Disrupting, stopping or changing HIV treatment can lead to complications including drug resistance, posing a grave threat to a patient’s health and making the disease more difficult and expensive to treat.
In addition to the highly efficient and cost-effective TLD, about to be delivered to health facilities across Ukraine, a procurement of additional ARVs is ongoing. A donation of the HIV drug dolutegravir will also be available soon, to treat infants living with HIV.
Resilient HIV services
The impact of the war has been devastating for Ukraine’s health system. HIV services, however, although still reeling from the impact of COVID-19, have shown remarkable resilience since the war started in late February.
On 21 March, almost a month after the war erupted, only 36 out of 403 antiretroviral treatment sites in the country had shut their doors, while the majority were either fully or partially functioning. Amid the devastation in the city of Mariupol, an HIV-treatment centre remains open. Even in regions hugely impacted by hostilities, such as Chernihiv and Zaporizhia, services have continued.
A number of lessons learned from the pandemic have benefitted HIV services in past weeks – multi-month prescribing, drugs delivered by post and consultations by phone being just three examples of such good practice.
The main need remains in Ukraine
As the number of people fleeing hostilities in Ukraine grows by the hour, currently at more than 4 million, so does the number of refugees in need of consistent access to appropriate medication regimens in host countries. Refugee-hosting countries are advised to support the provision of ARVs to continue treatment for people enrolled in therapy.
However, due to the fact that men are the majority of those in need of ARVs, and that male Ukrainian citizens aged 18–60 are prevented from leaving the country, the main need for the drugs remains within the country’s borders.
As of today, some 6.5 million people are internally displaced in Ukraine.
“Ensuring continued HIV treatment and sufficient stocks where people find temporary refuge – not only in terms of HIV but also in the context of other communicable and noncommunicable diseases – will be an ongoing challenge to humanitarian responders and Ukraine’s health system,” noted Dr Habicht. “WHO and partners will continue to do everything in our power to implement immediate and longer term measures to address Ukraine’s health emergency.”

Note to editors
In 2020, Ukraine had the second highest rate of newly diagnosed HIV infections in the WHO European Region – or 15% of all those diagnosed – as well as the highest rate of AIDS diagnoses that year. Over half of the new HIV diagnoses were attributed to heterosexual transmission, and 38% from injecting drug use.

04 April 2022
Geneva, 4 April 2022
I am horrified by the images of civilians lying dead on the streets and in   improvised graves in the town of Bucha in Ukraine.
Reports emerging from this and other areas raise serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law.
It is essential that all bodies are exhumed and identified so that victims’ families can be informed, and the exact causes of death established. All measures should be taken to preserve evidence.
It is vital that all efforts are made to ensure there are independent and effective investigations into what happened in Bucha to ensure truth, justice and accountability, as well as reparations and remedy for victims and their families.

Title: Mounting civilian deaths, mass destruction and catastrophic humanitarian situation as Russian Federation attacks Ukraine, says UN Human Rights Office
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
28 March 2022
Uzhhorod, 28 March 2022 – There are strong indications that serious violations of international humanitarian law and gross violations of international human rights law have occurred following the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine on 24 February, says a new update issued by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU).
This update includes HRMMU’s findings from the start of the armed attack up to 26 March 2022, and is being published today alongside the 33rd OHCHR periodic report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, which covers the period from 1 August 2021 to 31 January 2022.
“We are appalled, day after day, by the ever rising death toll and human suffering in cities, towns and villages across the country. The war must stop and accountability should be ensured,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of HRMMU.
The update documents that armed forces have used explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas – including missiles, heavy artillery, and rockets, as well as airstrikes. These weapons have caused civilian deaths and injuries, destroyed civilian objects and left civilians without access to healthcare, food, gas, water and electricity.
“Directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects and indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law,” Ms Bogner said. “The extent of destruction of civilian objects and civilian casualties strongly suggests that violations of the principles of distinction, and the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks have been taking place.”
Since the start of the Russian armed attack, as at 26 March, HRMMU has recorded at least 1,119 civilian deaths and 1,790 injuries, including 99 children killed and 126 injured. The actual figures are much higher, as the ability to collect and verify information from several locations affected by hostilities is severely hindered. This particularly concerns the city of Mariupol and the town of Volnovakha (both in Donetsk region), where high numbers of civilian casualties have been reported. 2,623 civilian casualties have occurred in Government-controlled areas, while 286 have occurred in territory in Donetsk and Luhansk regions controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’.
The update also documents arrests and detentions of 24 public officials by Russian troops and affiliated armed groups of self-proclaimed ‘republics’ in areas under their control, 13 of whom have been subsequently released. HRMMU has also documented the arbitrary arrests and possible enforced disappearances of 21 journalists and civil society activists who have been vocal against the Russian armed attack in Kyiv, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions. Seven journalists and media workers have been killed, 13 have been caught in hostilities, and at least one journalist is missing whose last known location was in an area of active hostilities. There are also growing concerns about possible reprisals and retaliation against human rights defenders and civil activists who have been vocal against the Russian armed attack, including Crimean Tatars.
HRMMU has also received information regarding arrests and detentions of more than 300 individuals by Ukrainian law enforcement officers, including three cases where officers allegedly did not provide information to the individuals’ relatives about their formal arrest, places of detention and fate.
The update describes cases of torture and ill-treatment of people believed to be so-called marauders, bootleggers, pro-Russian supporters, and curfew violators in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine. HRMMU has received credible allegations of more than 45 such cases, perpetrated by civilians, police officers and members of the territorial defence. HRMMU is also working to corroborate a number of allegations of conflict-related sexual violence, including rape.
Persons in vulnerable situations have found themselves at increased risk since the armed attack started. People with physical and sensory disabilities and older persons have struggled to access bomb shelters, and also lack access to medicines. Long-term care facilities for persons with disabilities and older people in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions face an appalling humanitarian situation as they lack food, heating, electricity and water as a direct result of the hostilities.
UN Human Rights is committed to continuing its monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation in Ukraine. HRMMU seeks first-hand information concerning international humanitarian law and human rights violations, and encourages victims and witnesses to contact:

Title: Ukraine: 28 days of war, 64 verified attacks on health care, and 18 million people affected
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
24 March 2022
One month of war has had a devastating impact on Ukraine’s health system, severely restricted access to services, and triggered an urgent need to treat trauma injuries and chronic conditions. Destroyed health infrastructure and disrupted chains of medical supplies now pose a grave threat to millions of people.
Impact on health
Close to 7 million people are internally displaced, and the number of people that have fled to neighbouring countries is fast approaching 4 million.
That means that 1 in 4 Ukrainians are now forcibly displaced, aggravating the condition of those suffering from noncommunicable diseases. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 1 in 3 of the internally displaced suffers from a chronic condition.
A number of hospitals have been repurposed to care for the wounded: a shift due to necessity – which comes at the cost of essential services and primary health care. Approximately half of Ukraine’s pharmacies are thought to be closed. Many health workers are displaced themselves or unable to work.
Close to 1000 health facilities are close to conflict lines or are in changed areas of control. The consequence of that – limited or no access to medicines, facilities and health professionals – mean that treatments of chronic conditions have almost stopped.
COVID-19 vaccination and routine immunization has also come to a halt. Prior to the invasion, at least 50 000 people were getting vaccinated against COVID-19 per day. Between 24 February and 15 March, however, only 175 000 people were vaccinated against COVID-19.
Attacks on health care
As of 22 March, WHO had verified 64 incidents of attacks on health care in 25 days (between 24 February and 21 March) causing 15 deaths and 37 injuries. That is 2–3 attacks per day. WHO condemns these attacks in the strongest possible terms.
“Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law, but a disturbingly common tactic of war – they destroy critical infrastructure, but worse, they destroy hope,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO representative in Ukraine. “They deprive already vulnerable people of care that is often the difference between life and death. Health care is not – and should never be – a target.”
WHO’s response
On the day the war started, WHO activated its contingency plans, repurposed staff and projects, and shifted focus to emergency needs – to support Ukraine’s health system and workers.
WHO works closely with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health and authorities to identify gaps and needs in the country’s health system – and swiftly respond. WHO has opened an operations hub in Rzeszów in Poland, developed a pipeline of trauma supplies to most Ukrainian cities, and sent more than 100 metric tonnes of medical equipment over the border, to health facilities across the country.
Some 36 metric tonnes of supplies are currently on their way to Lviv, with an additional 108 metric tonnes in the pipeline, consisting of trauma supplies, medication for chronic diseases, paediatric drugs and blood transfusion supplies.
“What we are delivering – and where – meets the very needs of people on the ground, where Ukrainian health workers are working around the clock in unimaginable circumstances. A team of trained health-care professionals can, with one WHO trauma kit that contains surgical equipment, consumables and antiseptics – save the lives of 150 wounded people. In other words, delivering 10 such kits, means 1500 lives saved,” said Dr Habicht.
As part of a United Nations convoy on 18 March, a WHO truck also reached Sumy in the north-east of Ukraine, carrying critical medical supplies sufficient to treat 150 trauma patients and provide primary health care to 15 000 patients for 3 months. Among other deliveries to health facilities in past days are artificial lung ventilation machines, chemical protection suits, a haematology analyser, liquid oxygen bulk tanks and cryogenic cylinders.
More than 20 emergency medical teams have also been deployed to Ukraine, Poland and the Republic of Moldova, to provide training and specialized medical care to supplement existing services.
In an assessment of the public health situation in refugee-hosting countries, WHO identifies and lists key health risks and makes related recommendations – on vaccine-preventable diseases, maternal and child health, and chronic infectious and noncommunicable diseases.
“I have seen with my own eyes the exceptional humanitarian response in neighbouring countries, but this emergency is far from over. We expect more people – mainly women, children and older persons – with even greater health needs to be displaced in the coming weeks. They may face challenges in accessing the services and medicines that they need – and this can have life-threatening consequences,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.

Title: Update on the UN work in Ukraine 23.03.2022
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 March 2022
We now know that more than 200,000 people lack access to water across the Donetska oblast in the country’s east. That is according to authorities and our humanitarian colleagues.
More people could be cut off from the water supply as clashes continue in the area, potentially leaving millions of people without access to water.
Attacks on healthcare are continuing. The World Health Organization said that, since 24 February, there now have been 64 attacks on health facilities, health care workers and ambulances. Health workers, healthcare facilities and supplies must never be targeted. It is sad that we need to say that over and over again: Any attacks on healthcare are a violation of international humanitarian law.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is managing regional hotlines to help people move safely and have had more than 15,000 consultations in the last few weeks.
They tell us that people are seeking information regarding human trafficking, as well as safe travel, how to seek asylum and obtain refugee status, and how to receive support from diplomatic institutions and other organizations.
And a cash update for you: we are still at 38 per cent level of the $1.1 billion 2022 Ukraine Flash Appeal. We thank the donors who released their pledged money amounts and encourage others to convert pledges to cash as quickly as possible. And of course the phone banks, as they say in telethons, remain open for people who have yet to pledge and we would hope more pledges come through and more cash comes through.

The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is warning that the situation is deteriorating and acute humanitarian needs in areas with ongoing fighting, such as Mariupol, are of particular concern, as the Secretary-General himself said.
The main challenge remains to secure safe access in areas with ongoing fighting.  
Humanitarians continue to engage with the Humanitarian Notification System, in the Russian Federation in Moscow and the Ukrainian authorities in-country. Discussions are ongoing for future convoys to areas with high humanitarian needs, including Mariupol, Volnovakha, Melitopol, and Kherson. 

The humanitarian system has scaled up aid delivery in the last weeks. To date, we, along with our partners, have delivered more than 2,500 metric tonnes of food, with about 3,700 metric tonnes of food in transit or planned to be shipped to Ukraine. 

Over 1,100 metric tonnes of water, sanitation and hygiene items have also been delivered, with more than 930 additional metric tonnes in transit or planned to ship. 
More than 180 metric tonnes of medical supplies have been delivered, with an additional 470 metric tonnes in transit or planned. 
On funding, the Ukraine Flash Appeal for this year has received $428 million so far, and that represents a 38 per cent funding level. 

And today, the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba, urged the parties to immediately cease attacks on schools and hospitals, and on related protected personnel and not to use these facilities for military purposes. She issued a reminder that uprooted children are at their most vulnerable and all must be done to ensure their protection.

We, along with our partners, remain deeply concerned over the impact of reported fighting on civilians trapped in cities in eastern, northeastern and southern Ukraine, including in Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Izyum, Donetsk, Mykolaiv, and Mariupol.
We, along with our partners, remain deeply concerned over the impact of reported fighting on civilians trapped in cities in eastern, northeastern and southern Ukraine, including in Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Izyum, Donetsk, Mykolaiv, and Mariupol.
Since 24 February, more than 10 million people have now been forced from their homes in search of safety and security – nearly a quarter of the population of Ukraine. This includes an estimated 6.5 million men, women and children who are internally displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and nearly 3.5 million people who have crossed international borders out of Ukraine as refugees, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

Humanitarian organizations are concerned about the risk of trafficking and sexual exploitation and IOM has scaled up its trafficking prevention measures, providing verified and safe information to refugees and third-country nationals on the move. IOM has also reinforced its regional hotlines to help people with important safety and resource information.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has verified 6 additional reports of attacks on health care in Ukraine yesterday. As of 20 March, WHO has verified 52 attacks on health care in 25 days. WHO notes that this is more than 2 attacks per day, stressing that this, of course, is unacceptable and that health care must always be protected.
For their part, the UN’s Children Fund and UNHCR, in partnership with local governments and civil society organizations, are setting up what they call “Blue Dots” centers. Those are one-stop safe spaces for children and women. "Blue Dots" centers help to identify unaccompanied and separated children and ensure their protection, as well as provide a hub for essential services and information for travelling families.

The World Food Programme (WFP) said that it has reached more than 330,000 crisis-affected people inside Ukraine with food assistance, and that’s since the beginning of the conflict. Food delivery to cooperating partners is also being scaled up, reaching more than 900 metric tons over the last days. In Kharkiv, WFP doubled its bread distribution through partners, reaching nearly 78 metric tons for about 260,000 people. In Kyiv – following the delivery of 26 metric tons of high-energy biscuits – WFP’s partners have delivered about 325 metric tons of vegetable oil and 478 metric tons of wheat flour to nearly 70,000 vulnerable people. In Dnipro, some 2.2 metric tons of mixed canned food was also distributed to the most vulnerable.

Last Friday, the UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad, said that the first UN-organized convoy reached Sumy with emergency supplies for 35,000 people and equipment to repair water systems to help another 50,000 people. This was organized through good cooperation with the Governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation. We hope that this is the first of many convoys that will make to deliveries to people trapped by the fighting.

Daily attacks reportedly by Russian forces continue to batter Ukrainian cities. Many are reportedly indiscriminate, resulting in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.
Between 24 February and 15 March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights recorded 2,149 civilian casualties. The total consists of 816 people killed and 1,333 injured. The actual number is likely to be much higher, unfortunately.
Most of these casualties were caused by the use in populated areas of explosive weapons with a wide impact area. Hundreds of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed, as have hospitals and schools.
A number of UN senior officials briefed Member States on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. The meeting was chaired by Martin Griffiths, the UN’s Humanitarian Coordinator.

The devastation and suffering in Mariupol and Kharkiv raise grave fears about the fate of millions of residents of Kyiv and other cities facing intensifying attacks. 
International humanitarian law is crystal clear. Civilians are entitled to protection against the dangers arising from military operations. Direct attacks on civilians are prohibited.
Yet, the magnitude of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine cannot be denied. This demands a thorough investigation and accountability.
Speaking from Ukraine, the UN Crisis Coordinator Amin Awad warned that this war has created unprecedented humanitarian challenges that continue to rise. He said that we, along with our humanitarian partners, are on the ground and we are in 17 locations operating out of 10 hubs. However, Mr. Awad stressed that we need to do more and we need safe humanitarian access. 
From Lviv, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for the UN in Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, said that we are working on a joint response to integrate the long-term development needs with the immediate humanitarian response. She noted that water and sanitation have either been partially or totally destroyed in Ukraine, with dramatic and immediate and long-term socioeconomic impacts.
And just a few more details for you on what is happening on the ground. We continue to be extremely concerned that many people – including the most vulnerable groups such as older people and people with disabilities – are trapped in areas of escalating conflict. With essential services disrupted, they are unable to meet their basic needs for food, water, and medicines.
The World Food Programme for its part has been warning that the country’s food supply chain is falling apart: trucks and trains are being destroyed, airports bombed, many bridges have fallen, supermarkets and warehouses have been emptied. WFP said that is has mobilized food supplies for 3 million people inside Ukraine for one month. 
In recent days, the World Food Programme has delivered 26 metric tons of high-energy biscuits in the capital Kyiv, targeting 30,000 people.
In Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine, WFP distributed more than 53 metric tons of bread to 212,400 crisis-affected people. The distribution of value vouchers continues for 2,000 displaced people in Lviv.
For its part, the International Organization for Migration said its newly established hotline has received more than 10,000 calls over the last 10 days, including from people seeking specialized counselling.
The UN refugee agency said that almost 3.3 million people, most of them women and children, have crossed international borders out of Ukraine.
For its part, the UN Children’s Fund said that as of yesterday 17 March, it had dispatched 85 trucks carrying 858 tons of emergency supplies to support children and families in war-torn Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Out of this total, 78 trucks carrying more than 780 tons were sent to Ukraine while the remaining 7 trucks were sent to nearby countries.
A total of 34 trucks have already arrived in Ukraine, with more deliveries expected in the coming days.
In Moscow, our humanitarian colleagues have strengthened the engagement with the Russian Ministry of Defense. We are making progress with both the Russian Federation and Ukraine to allow for regular discussion on specific humanitarian issues, including safe passage and supply routes for humanitarian cargo. We, along with international and local non-governmental organizations, are pushing east towards areas of greater needs. I do hope to have a bit more of an update for you on that front later today.

Title: Russian Invasion in Ukraine Leads to Increased Risks of Human Trafficking – IOM
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 March 2022
Women and children fleeing from the Russian military invasion in Ukraine and heading to other countries face risks of human trafficking, while men staying in the country can also become a prey for exploiters, warns IOM, the UN Migration Agency.
According to the UN data, as of 18 March, over 3 million people have been forced to flee Ukraine to neighbouring countries, including 162,000 third-country nationals. At least 1.9 million people have been internally displaced. They need critical humanitarian support and protection.
In 2021, the IOM Mission in Ukraine identified and assisted over 1,000 victims of trafficking, men, women and children. These numbers are only the tip of the iceberg, as many trafficking survivors do not get identified nor receive assistance. An IOM-commissioned survey estimated that 46,000 Ukrainians suffered from human trafficking during 2019-2021. Eighteen per cent of the respondents surveyed by IOM last year said they were ready to accept an informal and risky job offer abroad, almost a third would do so in Ukraine.
“We know how quickly the criminal world adjusts to changing realities and finds new victims. We call on Ukrainians and other nationals leaving Ukraine to stay alert and be cautious when on the move, at a new place or at home,” said IOM Ukraine Chief of Mission Anh Nguyen.
While cases of human trafficking are usually difficult to identify in the immediate aftermath of mass displacement, initial reports from within and outside of Ukraine indicate that traffickers are ready to exploit the vulnerabilities of those fleeing Ukraine. IOM also flags cases of family separation, unaccompanied and separated children that are on the rise, as well as potential cases of conflict-related sexual violence among protection concerns that are linked to human trafficking. Loss of jobs and income as a result of the war, and limited possibilities to meet basic needs in the case of both IDPs and refugees but also widely the conflict-affected population, will add to the risks.
To address the issue, IOM Ukraine has scaled up the work of the National Migrant Advice and Counter-Trafficking Hotline 527, by extending opening hours, doubling the number of advisers and offering reliable and updated information on a wide range of topics. The hotline, which can be accessed from within Ukraine, has already provided over 12,000 consultations to over 2,400 callers received from 24 February to 16 March only, which is 60 per cent more compared to the same period last year. More than half of the people calling are newly displaced persons. The hotline provides verified information on rights and obligations related to the current procedures of border crossing, services within Ukraine and neighbouring countries, work of border-crossing points, safe travel and countering human trafficking.
IOM has also boosted its prevention work on the ground by developing targeted information leaflets and posters with safe travel rules in times of war, including for women and girls. Additionally to a wide online outreach, IOM has started distributing over 100,000 leaflets, including in partnerships with partner NGOs that provide protection services to IDPs and conflict-affected populations in ten regions in western, southern and central Ukraine, at transport hubs and reception centres, as well as at the border crossing points. Furthermore, targeted trafficking prevention information promoting 527 Migrant Advice and Counter-Trafficking Hotline was disseminated through official social media channels of the Ministry of Social Policy and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, as well as through local authorities.
As media play a key role in trafficking prevention, IOM encourages media outlets to share safe travel advice available at: https://bit.ly/BasicSafetyRules&nbsp;
The IOM-supported National Migrant Advice and Counter-Trafficking Hotline can be reached in Ukraine at 527 (free from mobile phones) or at 0 800 505 501 (free from landline phones) from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Those staying abroad can reach hotline consultants at 527.hotline@gmail.com.

The situation in the country continues to deteriorate with fighting ongoing, including in Mariupol, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sievierodonetsk and Northern Kyiv. Food and water supplies are dwindling and humanitarian organizations are deeply concerned about the well-being of civilians trapped inside these cities.
Large-scale displacement continues with more than five million people on the move in the last three weeks, including almost 3.2 million people, mostly women and children, who have crossed international borders out of Ukraine, and that is according to the UNHCR (United Nations Refugee Agency).
Further on the movement out of Ukraine, UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) transferred more than 5,000 Ukrainian men, women and children from Ukraine’s border with Moldova to Romania between 8 and 17 March, today.
These ongoing transfers have been made in support of the Governments of Moldova and Romania, who agreed on these arrangements.
More than 350,000 people have fled to Moldova, with more than 102,000 refugees staying in the country.
And we are also being told by our humanitarian colleagues that more than 928,000 people are without electricity and some 259,000 people have been cut off from gas supplies across the country, and that is according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy.
The hardest hit areas include Chernihivska, Donetska, Kyivska, Mykolaivska and Zaporizka oblasts.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 43 attacks on health care, and stresses that health facilities, health care workers and patients - as well as medical transport - must always be respected and protected.
Humanitarian operations have so far reached more than 600,000 people with some form of assistance since 24 February.
On funding, the Ukraine Flash Appeal 2022 has received $407 million so far, which represents 36 per cent, and that is up from 22 per cent just yesterday. We very much thank all the donors who have released pledged amounts and moved them into cash, and we encourage others to release money as quickly as possible and report their contribution to OCHA’s (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) Financial Tracking system.
The outpouring of support from people around the world also continues with UN agencies receiving record amounts from private sector companies and from public donations.  The UN’s crisis relief fund for the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund has received more than $3 million in donations from 30,000 people in more than 140 countries.  These are small donations of about $100 each.

The crisis in the country is developing rapidly, with devastating impact on the humanitarian situation. In the worst-affected cities under attack - including Mariupol and Kharkiv - heavy fighting leaves people isolated and facing severe shortages of food, water, and energy supplies.
In Mariupol, tens of thousands of people remain trapped in the city despite reports of some evacuations. Our humanitarian colleagues are particularly concerned about vulnerable groups such as older people and people living with disabilities, who may not be able to flee the conflict. Efforts continue to ensure voluntary safe passage of civilians out of areas with active fighting, as well as movement of humanitarian goods and personnel into areas where needs are most acute. Humanitarian organizations are deploying additional staff across the country and are working to move supplies to warehouses in different hubs to serve people in need.
The World Food Programme said that in Kharkiv, 32.5 metric tons of bread were distributed by one of their cooperating partners to about 140,800 people. So far, about 600,000 people have been reached with some form of humanitarian assistance.
Today, the UN Refugee Agency said that the number of people crossing international borders out of Ukraine has reached 3.1 million.
For her part, the Director-General of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, has condemned the killings of Ukrainian producer and fixer, Oleksandra Kuvshynova and Irish journalist and cameraman, Pierre Zakrzewski, in Gorenka, outside Kyiv on Monday. UNESCO notes that both journalists were killed while reporting for Fox News during shelling, which also injured another journalist, who remains in hospital.

Title: Every day of delayed peace will accelerate a freefall into poverty for Ukraine, warns UNDP
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
16 March 2022
Early data estimates suggest that 90% of the Ukrainian population could be facing poverty and extreme economic vulnerability should the war deepen, setting the country – and the region – back decades and leaving deep social and economic scars for generations to come.
16 March 2022, New York – In the event of a continuing, protracted war in Ukraine, 18 years of socio-economic achievements could be lost, with almost one third of the population living below the poverty line and a further 62% at high risk of falling into poverty within the next twelve months, according to an early projection released today by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
“The war in Ukraine is causing unimaginable human suffering with a tragic loss of life and the displacement of millions of people. While the need for immediate humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians is of the utmost importance, the acute development impacts of a protracted war are now becoming more apparent,” said UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner. “An alarming economic decline, and the suffering and hardship it will bring to an already traumatised population must now come into sharper focus. There is still time to halt this grim trajectory.”
Based on its longstanding, trusted partnership with the Government of Ukraine, UNDP has been working in all 24 oblasts (administrative districts) of Ukraine with more than 332 municipalities, 15 civil society organizations hubs, and more than 17 business membership associations across the country.
As part of the coordinated United Nations Country Team’s response, UNDP is now leveraging this extensive network for immediate and scaled up support to the people of Ukraine, focusing on immediate crisis response and maintaining core government functions for emergency response management and public service delivery.
“In order to avoid further suffering, destruction and impoverishment we need peace now,” said Steiner. “As part of the United Nations’ unwavering commitment to the Ukrainian people, UNDP’s primary focus is to help preserve hard-won development gains. That includes supporting the government to sustain critical governance structures and services, which constitute the bedrock of all societies.”
According to government estimates, at least $100 billion worth of infrastructure, buildings, roads, bridges, hospitals, schools, and other physical assets have been destroyed. The war has caused 50% of Ukrainian businesses to shut down completely, while the other half are forced to operate well below capacity.
Among the largest UN agencies on the ground in Ukraine, UNDP has remained operational throughout the conflict and is now boosting its presence with targeted, specialized deployments in key areas such as debris management, damage assessment and emergency livelihoods including cash-based assistance, and also offering operational entry points and platforms to development and humanitarian partners to channel and scale support to the Government and people of Ukraine.
A series of policy measures in the coming weeks could assist and mitigate a freefall into poverty as the conflict rages on. In view of the scale of the needs and priorities, and of the country’s strong banking and financial services infrastructure, UNDP joins the UN Crisis Coordinator in promoting the use of multi-purpose cash assistance which could help reach the largest number of people in desperate need across the country. For example, UNDP’s initial estimates are that a large-scale emergency cash transfer operation, costing approximately $250 million per month, would cover partial income losses for 2.6 million people expected to fall into poverty. A more ambitious temporary basic income (TBI) that provides a basic income of $5.50 per day per person would cost $430 million a month, based on initial estimates.
In neighbouring countries, and in support of the inter-agency Regional Refugee Response Plan, UNDP is working with UNHCR to ensure a strong focus on resilience and development for the millions of displaced people who have fled the violence. This joint support to refugees and host communities will focus on livelihoods, through income generation and employment.

Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that civilians continue to bear the brunt of the war in Ukraine where intense fighting is reported in the north, east, and south of the country. Airstrikes and shelling have continued with significant damage reported in cities including Donetsk, Luhansk, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, and Zhytomyr oblast.
Our humanitarian colleagues warn that conditions, especially in Mariupol, continue to worsen, and people urgently need humanitarian assistance, including food, water, and medicine.
Today, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said that three million people have now crossed international borders out of Ukraine. Every day for the past 20 days, 70,000 children in Ukraine have become refugees. That is equivalent to 55 children fleeing the country every minute, according to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) – nearly one every second.
The Education Cluster in Ukraine, which is led by UNICEF and Save the Children, says that access to education has affected about 5.7 million children and adolescents between 3 and 17 years of age.

In terms of response, the UNHCR has delivered 16,000 tarpaulins and blankets, mattresses, and jerry cans to 5,400 people impacted by ongoing hostilities in Luhanska oblast in the east. UNICEF and non-governmental organization People in Need have delivered safe water to thousands of people in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, also in the east.
On funding, the Ukraine Flash Appeal for 2022 has received $224 million so far, which represents 20 per cent.

Title: UN allocates $40 million from Emergency Fund for Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 March 2022
(New York, 14 March 2022): As humanitarian needs escalate rapidly in Ukraine, the United Nations humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, today allocated US$40 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to ramp up aid agencies’ efforts to reach the most vulnerable people.
Almost 2 million people are forcibly displaced and on the move inside Ukraine. Many are unable to leave their homes because of heavy combat in cities such as Mariupol, Kharkiv and Kyiv. Twenty-four attacks on health-care facilities have been verified by the World Health Organization.
“Faced with this grim and escalating crisis, we are mobilizing a massive relief effort,” said Mr. Griffiths. “These funds are critical to get operations off the ground immediately. In the early days of our response, fast and flexible funding can make all the difference.”
The CERF funding will help provide life-saving health services, food and shelter to Ukrainians, and support flexible ways to get cash to people in need.
UN agencies have already sent in food and urgent medical supplies to Kyiv and other cities, working through networks of bakeries, shops and health facilities to get supplies in. Where markets are functioning, aid agencies are supporting internally displaced people with cash at reception centres in western Ukraine.
The UN is deploying staff to the conflict-affected east, to operational hubs and warehouses to get food and medicines closer to those in need. The injection of CERF funds also supports programmes for the most vulnerable people, including women-headed families, people with disabilities and the chronically ill.
This is the second allocation since the rapid increase in hostilities in Ukraine. A $20 million injection of funds was announced on 24 February, and a humanitarian system-wide scale-up to ease the suffering of the people of Ukraine has been launched.
A Flash Appeal for Ukraine was launched on 1 March in Geneva. It requires $1.1 billion in immediate funding to support 6 million of the most vulnerable people in Ukraine. Donors responded with significant initial pledges. As of today, donors have reported $219 million in funding for the appeal, or 19 per cent of the requested amount.
Since its establishment 16 years ago, CERF has been one of the fastest mechanisms for providing emergency funding to people in need. The UN thanks the more than 130 Member States and observers, as well as other donors, including private individuals, who have supported the Fund through the years.

Title: Stop Attacks on Health Care in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 March 2022
Today, we call for an immediate cessation of all attacks on health care in Ukraine. These horrific attacks are killing and causing serious injuries to patients and health workers, destroying vital health infrastructure and forcing thousands to forgo accessing health services despite catastrophic needs.
To attack the most vulnerable – babies, children, pregnant women, and those already suffering from illness and disease, and health workers risking their own lives to save lives – is an act of unconscionable cruelty.
In Ukraine, since the start of the war, 31 attacks on health care have been documented via the WHO’s Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA). According to these reports, in 24 incidents health care facilities were damaged or destroyed, while in five cases ambulances were damaged or destroyed. These attacks have led to at least 12 deaths and 34 injuries, and affected access to and availability of essential health services. WHO is verifying further reports, as attacks continue to be reported despite the calls for protection of health care.
Attacks on health care and health workers directly impact people’s ability to access essential health services – especially women, children and other vulnerable groups. We have already seen that the health care needs of pregnant women, new mothers, younger children and older people inside Ukraine are rising, while access to services is being severely limited by the violence.
For example, more than 4,300 births have occurred in Ukraine since the start of war and 80,000 Ukrainian women are expected to give birth in next three months. Oxygen and medical supplies, including for the management of pregnancy complications, are running dangerously low.
The health care system in Ukraine is clearly under significant strain, and its collapse would be a catastrophe. Every effort must be made to prevent this from happening.
International humanitarian and human rights law must be upheld, and the protection of civilians must be our top priority.
Humanitarian partners and health care workers must be able to safely maintain and strengthen essential health service delivery, including immunization against COVID-19 and polio, and the supply of life-saving medicines for civilians across Ukraine as well as to refugees crossing into neighbouring countries. Health services should be systematically available at border crossings, including rapid care and referral processes for children and pregnant women.
It is critical that humanitarian actors have safe and unimpeded access to reach ALL civilians in need wherever they may be. UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO are working with partners to scale up life-saving services and support to meet urgent health needs. We must be able to safely deliver emergency medical supplies – including those required for obstetric and neonatal care – to health centers, temporary facilities and underground shelters.
Health care and services should be protected from all acts of violence and obstruction. Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has already put health systems and health care workers under enormous strain, such attacks have the potential to be even more devastating for the civilian population. For the sake of health workers, and for all people in Ukraine who need access to the lifesaving services they provide, attacks on all health care and other civilian infrastructure must stop.
Finally, we call for an immediate ceasefire, which includes unhindered access so that people in need can access humanitarian assistance. A peaceful resolution to end the war in Ukraine is possible.

Title: WHO is working day and night to keep medical supply chains open and preserve Ukraine’s health system
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 March 2022
Since Russia’s military offensive began in Ukraine on 24 February, WHO has worked around the clock to ensure a constant flow of health supplies so that neighbouring countries have the infrastructure and expertise to meet urgent needs of refugees, and to support Ukraine’s health system to meet the immediate health needs of people within Ukraine’s borders.
Coordinating humanitarian health assistance for people in need
The current estimated number of people impacted in Ukraine is 18 million, of which 6.7 million are internally displaced. Nearly 3 million people have fled the country. Supply chains have been severely disrupted. Many distributors are not operational, some stockpiles are inaccessible due to military operations, medicine supplies are running low, and hospitals are struggling to provide care to the sick and wounded.
WHO is coordinating with partners the provision of humanitarian health assistance, both within Ukraine and on its borders, and providing technical support and surge staff. WHO is providing support across Ukraine through the Country Office, the Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen, as well as from its headquarters in Geneva.
Delivering life-saving medical supplies
As the Health Cluster Lead Agency, WHO is working with partners to alleviate shortages of life-saving equipment and medication, such as oxygen and insulin, surgical supplies, anaesthetics, and transfusion kits to collect, test and safely transfuse blood. Oxygen generators, generators to maintain electrical supply in affected health facilities, defibrillators, monitors, anaesthesia drugs, rehydration salts, gauze and bandages are among the medical supplies WHO and partners are shipping into Ukraine to save lives and maintain health services.
WHO is in constant dialogue with Ukrainian authorities. All supplies are distributed in close coordination with the Ministry of Health, based on WHO critical needs assessments, public health risk, service assessments and logistic capacity. The coming days and weeks will see a constant flow of medical supplies, as part of an effort to ensure people’s access to essential drugs and medical care.
Scaling up surveillance of hazards and diseases
To support operations in and into Ukraine, a WHO support hub is being established in Poland. WHO has also scaled up surveillance and health information dissemination to detect and respond to outbreaks early and better understand needs, threats and health service availability.
WHO and partners have updated the Public Health Situation Analysis for Ukraine, covering health needs and threats to the population. WHO and the Health Cluster also launched the mapping tool 3W, showing who does what and where. Event-based surveillance activities for various potential hazards are also ongoing, including through Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS).
Reporting and condemning attacks on health care
WHO’s mandate for the surveillance of attacks on health care is based on the World Health Assembly Resolution 65.20 adopted in 2012, which requested WHO to provide leadership at global level in collecting and reporting information on attacks on health care. WHO created the Attacks on Health Care initiative to systematically collect evidence on attacks, to advocate for the end of such attacks, and to promote best practices for safeguarding health care from attacks. We report through the Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care.
As of 12 March WHO had verified a total of 31 attacks on health care between 24 February and 11 March 2022, resulting in 12 deaths and 34 injuries, of which 8 of the injured and 2 of those killed were health workers. More attacks are being verified.
WHO strongly condemns acts of violence against health care. Every single attack deprives people of life-saving services. Attacks on health care are violations of international humanitarian law and human rights.

Title: Update on the UN work in Ukraine 14.03.2022

14 March 2022
UKRAINE/HUMANITARIAN SITUATION
On the humanitarian side, the situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate rapidly. Today, the UN Refugee Agency said that more than 2.8 million people have crossed international borders out of Ukraine.
Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that in Mariupol, trapped civilians face life-threatening shortages of food, water, medicine and other basic necessities. They warn that the use of explosive weapons in urban areas, particularly those with wide-area effects, carries a high risk of indiscriminate impact. They stress that parties to the conflict must abide by international law and the core principles that protect human life and dignity.  
We, along with our humanitarian partners, continue to scale up life-saving response across the country and we have reached 600,000 people with some form of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine. It is expected that many more people will be reached in the coming days, given the scope and scale of the humanitarian operation being deployed by humanitarian organizations and partners. The main humanitarian challenge remains securing safe access in areas with ongoing fighting.
On funding, the Ukraine Flash Appeal for 2022 has received $219 million so far, which represents 19 per cent. As you recall, last Friday, this value was $129 million. We thank the donors who released the pledged amounts and encourage others to release the money quickly and report their contribution to OCHA’s Financial Tracking Service.

Title: Secretary-General's remarks to the press on the war in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 March 2022
Ukraine is on fire.
 
The country is being decimated before the eyes of the world.   
 
The impact on civilians is reaching terrifying proportions.   
 
Countless innocent people – including women and children – have been killed.  
 
After being hit by Russian forces, roads, airports and schools lie in ruins.   
 
According to the World Health Organization, at least 24 health facilities have suffered attacks.   
 
Hundreds of thousands of people are without water or electricity. 
 
With each passing hour, two things are increasingly clear:  
 
First — it keeps getting worse. 
 
Second — whatever the outcome, this war will have no winners, only losers. 
 
The United Nations and humanitarian partners are working to ensure safe passage from besieged areas and to provide aid where security permits.  
 
More than 600,000 people have received some form of aid.  
 
As millions of people in Ukraine face hunger and dwindling supplies of water and medicine, I am announcing today that the United Nations will allocate a further $40 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund to ramp up vital assistance to reach the most vulnerable, as we wait for the nations to come. 
 
This funding will help get critical supplies of food, water, medicines, and other lifesaving aid into the country, as well as provide cash assistance to the needy. 
 
But the avenues in and out of encircled cities are more precarious by the day.  
 
I underscore the crucial importance of respecting international humanitarian law.  
 
At least 1.9 million people are displaced inside the country, and growing numbers are escaping across borders. 
 
I am deeply grateful for the solidarity of Ukraine’s neighbours and other host countries, who have taken in more than 2.8 million refugees in the past two weeks.  
 
The vast majority of those making the treacherous journey are women and children who are increasingly vulnerable.   
 
For predators and human traffickers, war is not a tragedy.  
 
It is an opportunity.  
 
And women and children are the targets.  
 
They need safety and support every step of the way. 
 
I will continue to highlight the desperate plight of the people of Ukraine as I am doing again today.   
 
Yet there is another dimension of this conflict that gets obscured.   
 
This war goes far beyond Ukraine.  
 
It is also an assault on the world’s most vulnerable people and countries. 
 
While war rains over Ukraine, a sword of Damocles hangs over the global economy – especially in the developing world. 
 
Even before the conflict, developing countries were struggling to recover from the pandemic – with record inflation, rising interest rates and looming debt burdens.   
 
Their ability to respond has been erased by exponential increases in the cost of financing.  
 
Now their breadbasket is being bombed.   
 
Russia and Ukraine represent more than half of the world’s supply of sunflower oil and about 30 percent of the world’s wheat.  
 
Ukraine alone provides more than half of the World Food Programme’s wheat supply.  
 
Food, fuel and fertilizer prices are skyrocketing.  Supply chains are being disrupted.  And the costs and delays of transportation of imported goods – when available – are at record levels.  
 
All of this is hitting the poorest the hardest and planting the seeds for political instability and unrest around the globe.  
 
Grain prices have already exceeded those at the start of the Arab Spring and the food riots of 2007-2008. 
 
The FAO’s global food prices index is at its highest level ever. 
 
Forty-five African and least developed countries import at least one-third of their wheat from Ukraine [or] Russia – 18 of those countries import at least 50 percent. 
 
This includes countries like Burkina Faso, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. 
 
We must do everything possible to avert a hurricane of hunger and a meltdown of the global food system. 
 
In addition, we are seeing clear evidence of this war draining resources and attention from other trouble-spots in desperate need.   
 
I renew my appeal for countries to find creative ways to finance increased humanitarian and development recovery needs worldwide, and to give generously and to immediately release pledged funds.   
 
My plea to leaders is to resist the temptation of increasing military budgets at the expense of Official Development Assistance and climate action. 
 
In a word, developing countries are getting pummeled.   
 
They face a cascade of crises – beyond the Ukraine war, we cannot forget COVID and the impacts of climate change – in particular, drought.
Against the backdrop of these immense inter-connected challenges, I am announcing today the establishment of a Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance in the UN Secretariat. 
 
I have also asked the Deputy Secretary-General to lead an inter-agency steering committee with partners to oversee this effort. 
 
In the coming days, we will be consulting with Member States willing to champion the actions needed to carry forward the global emergency response that will be required for these looming crises.  
 
Make no mistake: everyday people, especially women and children, will bear the brunt of this unfolding tragedy.  
 
The war also shows how the global addiction to fossil fuels is placing energy security, climate action and the entire global economy at the mercy of geopolitics.   
 
Finally, further escalation of the war, whether by accident or design, threatens all of humanity.  
 
Raising the alert of Russian nuclear forces is a bone-chilling development.  
 
The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility. 
 
The security and safety of nuclear facilities must also be preserved.    
 
It’s time to stop the horror unleashed on the people of Ukraine and get on the path of diplomacy and peace. 
 
I have been in close contact with a number of countries – including China, France, Germany, India, Israel and Turkey – on mediation efforts to bring an end to this war. 
 
The appeals for peace must be heard. 
 
This tragedy must stop. 
 
It is never too late for diplomacy and dialogue.   
 
We need an immediate cessation of hostilities and serious negotiations based on the principles of the UN Charter and international law.   
 
We need peace. 
 
Peace for the people of Ukraine. 
 
Peace for the world. 
 
We need peace now. 
 
Thank you.
Question: Thank you, Secretary-General.  Do you support Ukraine’s calls for a no-fly zone?
Secretary-General:  That is a matter that, as you know, has been analyzed by a number of countries that considered that possibility as a risk of escalation that could create a global conflict.  It is based on that analysis that I think we need to be prudent, even if I understand the dramatic appeal of the Ukrainian Government.   
 
Question: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary-General.  Donetsk authorities reported today that a Ukrainian site was hit at the heart of the city of Donetsk by missile Tochka-U and the warhead of this missile was filled by the cluster munitions.  I was following the Security Council, but I haven’t heard anything about this.  Is the UN aware of this incident?
Secretary-General: I have seen the news about this incident, and I have to say that our position is very clear.  Any attack on civilians or civilian infrastructure is regrettable if accidental and condemnable if done on purpose.  But let’s be clear.  The overwhelming majority of civilian casualties and the overwhelming majority of civilian infrastructure destruction was done in the context of the war by the Russian forces.
Question: Thank you, Secretary-General. It’s Pamela Falk from CBS News. You talk about mediation, but the talks have adjourned for the day. Is there anything you have done or will do, and have you reached out to Russia’s President Putin? Thank you. 
 
Secretary-General: Yes, we are doing our best. I’ve talked with a number of leaders that are in permanent contact with President Putin. And, of course, we consider that it is absolutely essential for an effort – an additional effort – to make the Russian Federation understand that this war is becoming an absolute nightmare and to create the conditions for the war to be stopped and for serious negotiations to be put in place. Thank you very much.

Title: Press briefing notes on Ukraine - Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 March 2022
Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Liz Throssell
Location: Geneva
Date: 11 March 2022
Subject: Ukraine
We remain gravely concerned by the rising death toll and human suffering in Ukraine and call for an immediate end to the attacks. We have so far recorded 549 civilian deaths and 957 injuries since the armed attack began on 24 February, although the actual figure could be much higher.
Civilians are being killed and maimed in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks, with Russian forces using explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas. These include missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets, as well as airstrikes.
Schools, hospitals, and kindergartens have been hit – with hugely devastating consequences. On 3 March, 47 civilians were killed when Russian airstrikes hit two schools and several apartment blocks in Chernihiv. On 9 March, a Russian airstrike hit Mariupol Hospital No.3 injuring at least 17 civilians. We are still investigating reports that at least three civilians may have been killed in the airstrike. We spoke to different sources in Mariupol, including local authorities, indicating consistently that the hospital was both clearly identifiable and operational when it was hit.
We have also received credible reports of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas. On 24 February, a cluster munition exploded at the Central City Hospital in Vuhledar, in government-controlled Donetsk, killing four civilians, injuring 10 others, and damaging ambulances, civilian vehicles and the hospital itself. There were other cluster munition attacks in several districts of Kharkiv, in which nine civilians were killed and 37 injured.
Due to their wide area effects, the use of cluster munitions in populated areas is incompatible with the international humanitarian law principles governing the conduct of hostilities.
Civilian casualties are rising daily, as is general human suffering. We remind the Russian authorities that directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages and other forms of indiscriminate attacks, are prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes.
We also remain concerned by continued reports of arbitrary arrests and detention of Ukrainians who voice their opposition to the Russian attack, including in peaceful protests. We have documented individual cases of such arbitrary arrests in the east of Ukraine, but have been asked not to release details, as there are concerns regarding the safety of those who have spoken to us. We believe that those detained are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment and call for their immediate and unconditional release. We are also concerned by the pejorative use of labels such as “saboteurs” and “mercenaries”, with the intent or effect of exposing certain individuals to higher risks of harm.
We call on the parties to fully respect the rights of everyone under their control. Those who have laid down their weapons or are hors de combat by injury or detention, including prisoners of war, must be treated humanely, and be protected from any form of torture or degrading treatment.

11 March 2022
Highlights of the noon briefing by Stephane Dujarric Spokesperson for Secretary-General António Guterres
UKRAINE/HUMANITARIAN 

The humanitarian situation in Ukraine continues to be deeply concerning and shows the human cost of this war and the human suffering. As I mentioned yesterday, the UN Refugee Agency estimates that 1.9 million people have been internally displaced. Most of them are in the west and north-west with about 500,000 displaced people in Zakarpatska, 387,000 in Lvivska and about 170,000 in Volynska. 

The UN Refugee Agency also said that there are now more than 2.5 million women children and men, mostly women and children, who have crossed international borders out of Ukraine.  

For its part, WHO said that since 24 February, there have been 29 attacks impacting health facilities, health care workers and ambulances. WHO stressed that medical facilities, medical personnel and medical transport must always be respected in war.

We also have reports, from the UN Children’s Fund, that leads the water, sanitation and hygiene work of the humanitarians, that in the east, about 650,000 people in Donetska oblast and about 40,000 people in Luhanska oblast do not have access to water. In Mariupol and Donetska, safe drinking water is urgently needed. 

For its part, the World Food Programme said that 2,000 people have received value vouchers and that it will scale up this distribution to reach more people in areas where markets and systems are functioning. In Kharkiv, a WFP-contracted bakery is increasing its production line with a daily target of 30,000 loaves of bread, and that will benefit about 60,000 people. 

On funding, as of today, the Ukraine Flash Appeal, whichs is asking for $1.1 billion, has received $129 million. It is 11 per cent funded.
UKRAINE/FOOD SECURITY 

Today, the UN food agencies in Rome issued reports showing the implications of the conflict on food security around the world. The World Food Programme is warning that the costs of its global operations look set to increase by $29 million a month. When added to pre-existing increases of $42 million since 2019, the total additional costs WFP is facing is $71 million per month. 
This could spell disaster for millions, as WFP had already warned that 2022 would be a year of catastrophic hunger, with 44 million people in 38 countries teetering on the edge of famine.   

For its part, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization warns that supply chain and logistical disruptions on Ukrainian and Russian grain and oilseed production, as well as restrictions on Russia’s exports, will have significant food security repercussions. FAO said that this is especially true for some fifty countries that depend on Russia and Ukraine for 30 per cent or more of their wheat supply. 

The Director-General of the FAO, Qu Dongyu, noted that food prices, already on the rise since the second half of 2020, reached an all-time high in February of this year, due to high demand, input and transportation costs, and port disruptions. He warned that likely disruptions to agricultural activities of these two major exporters of staple commodities could seriously escalate food insecurity globally, when international food prices are already very volatile.
SECURITY COUNCIL/UKRAINE 

The Security Council held an open meeting on Ukraine. Briefing Council members was the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Izumi Nakamitsu, and she said that the UN is not aware of any biological weapons programmes in Ukraine.  Ms. Nakamitsu noted that this is largely thanks to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, to which both the Russian Federation and Ukraine are States Parties. Ms. Nakamitsu said that situations such as this demonstrate the need to further strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention, to operationalize it and to institutionalize it. She also addressed the worrying issue of the safety and security of nuclear power plants in Ukraine.  Both her remarks and the remarks of Rosemary Di Carlo, the Under-Secretary-General for Peacebuilding and Political Affairs have been distributed to you.  

Ms. Di Carlo noted that the war in Ukraine is now in its third week and fighting continues unabated.  
She said that the Russian armed forces are pursuing their offensive operations and laying siege to several cities in the south, east and north of the country.  
Ms. DiCarlo stressed that all alleged violations of international humanitarian law must be investigated and those found responsible should be held accountable. 
She added that the Secretary-General is grateful to the many Member States that are working towards a diplomatic solution to this dangerous conflict and that he is in regular contact with regional and other leaders.

10 March 2022
We will start off with Ukraine as usual. Another rather depressing update about the humanitarian situation which continues to deteriorate at an alarming pace.
Our humanitarian colleagues estimate that now 1.9 million people have been internally displaced, and more than 2.3 million people have now crossed international borders out of Ukraine, and this is according to the UN Refugee Agency.
Three things are critical in the short term, as Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths has stressed: civilians, whether they stay or leave, must be respected and protected; safe passage is needed for humanitarian supplies; and we need a system of constant communications with parties to the conflict.
In terms of response, humanitarian organizations are deploying additional staff across the country and are working to move supplies to warehouses in different hubs within Ukraine and outside. So far, we - along with our partners - have reached more than 500,000 people with some form of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, including life-saving food, shelter, blankets, and medical supplies. If humanitarian access is secured, we are set to reach much higher numbers given the scope and scale of the humanitarian operations being currently deployed.
The UN Refugee Agency tells us that by 9 March, yesterday, it had delivered 85 metric tons of humanitarian assistance to reception and transit centres in Vinnytsia in central Ukraine, which is hosting people who have fled hostilities further east.
For its part, the World Food Programme today said it is deeply concerned about the impact of conflict on Ukraine’s food security and the waning ability of families in embattled areas to feed themselves.
WFP plans to assist up to 3.1 million people. Their priority is to supply cities inside Ukraine with bulk food, bread, and food rations. 
With consignments of food assistance arriving every day, WFP is in a race against time to pre-position food in areas where fighting is expected to flare.
For its part its sister agency in Rome, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization warns that the coming weeks will be critical as farmers will need to prepare land for sowing vegetables in the middle of March. 
Likewise, between February and May, FAO said that farmers need to start preparing land for planting wheat, barley, maize and sunflowers. FAO stressed that all efforts should be made to protect harvests and livestock and I think we all know the critical role the Ukrainian market for grain is to the rest of the world.
Today, the UN Children’s Fund said that more than 1 million children have now fled Ukraine as the fighting continues to ravage the country. UNICEF said that so far, six trucks carrying nearly 70 tons of supplies have arrived in Ukraine. The supplies include personal protection equipment and medical, surgical and obstetric kits.
Working with its partners, UNICEF teams in Ukraine will be delivering medical supplies to 22 hospitals in 5 different conflict-affected areas in the country, to benefit 20,000 children and mothers. Across the border, three trucks were sent from Copenhagen – which is UNICEF’s warehouse in Europe and the largest humanitarian hub in the world – and those trucks were carrying essential supplies, such as early childhood development, recreational and hygiene kits. These supplies have now arrived in Poland.
And today, the World Health Organization said it has so far delivered 81 metric tons of supplies and is establishing a pipeline of supplies for health facilities across Ukraine. WHO also has released $10.2 million from the Contingency Fund and deployed staff to provide care to refugees.
While we are on the subject of money, the Ukraine Flash Appeal 2022 has received $109 million so far, which represents 9.6 per cent, so we are inching up. That being said, the appeal which was launched by the Secretary-General on 1 March requires US$1.1 billion for a three-month period for humanitarian response inside Ukraine. There’s another appeal for outside from UNHCR. As we have said we encourage the donors who made generous pledges to release the money quickly and report their contribution to OCHA’s Financial Tracking Service.

Title: UN response to articles about the terminology used to describe the situation in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 March 2022
There is a mistaken impression that UN staff were told to avoid using certain words to describe the situation in Ukraine.
It is simply not the case that staff have been instructed not to use words like “war” and “invasion” to describe the situation. In fact, on Monday, the head of political affairs, Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo, tweeted the following: “Nearly two weeks on, it is painfully clear that those suffering the most after Russia's invasion of #Ukraine are civilians - killed, wounded, displaced. This war is senseless. We are ready to support all good-faith efforts at negotiation to end the bloodshed.” (https://twitter.com/DicarloRosemary/status/1500982285142827008?s=20&t=pPJBbU-_GJ4-8fndLl05uQ)
Similarly, the Secretary-General has used a wide range of words in his statements and remarks to the press to describe what is going on.

Title: Joint UN mission visits humanitarian-development nexus projects in eastern Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 February 2022
Osnat Lubrani, United Nations Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, joined Dafina Gercheva, UNDP Resident Representative to Ukraine, and Karolina Lindholm Billing, UNHCR Representative in Ukraine on a visit to eastern Ukraine 9-11 February 2022.
This joint mission focused on humanitarian-development nexus projects, jointly implemented by UNDP and UNHCR. The nexus approach aims to address critical humanitarian and protection needs in a way which is sustainable and simultaneously strengthens local systems and accountabilities, by fostering links and synergies between humanitarian and development actions, in close collaboration with local authorities and local communities. The visited sites constitute strong examples of how this approach can provide sustainable solutions for internally displaced and conflict-affected persons.
The projects were designed in close consultation with the local population, in partnership with the private sector, and local and regional authorities. Budget allocations have been secured from authorities to ensure that the interventions remain sustainable and anchor local ownership.
The projects were made possible by the generous contributions of the European Union. Other important partners include Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.
In Popasna, Luhansk Oblast, on 9 February, Lubrani, Gercheva and Lindholm Billing attended the opening ceremony of the renovated ‘Leleka’ rehabilitation center for children with disabilities.
At the opening ceremony, Lubrani said that the center would ease access to persons with disabilities to much needed facilities and services as well as build their skills and their confidence.
“Meeting the children and the dedicated staff and volunteers, it is rewarding to realize how this center is contributing to full inclusion of people with disabilities in society.” Lubrani said.
Also in Popasna, the mission visited the University of the Third Age, which encourages life-long learning, and boarded Mobile Social Services centers. These roaming vehicles provide medical and sanitary services, but also legal advice, socio-psychological assistance and gardening help, to name a few.
On 10 February, Lubrani, Gercheva and Lindholm Billing visited a Multifunctional Creative Space for Youth Development, in Toretsk, Donetsk Oblast. The creative space allows children, primarily from socioeconomically vulnerable families, to develop their creative talents in a safe space.
Moving on to Niu York in Donetsk Oblast, the mission visited the town’s Cultural Hub – a platform for community initiatives, dialogue, and concerts. Local youth proudly explained that after 70 years of being called Novhorodske, the town regained its original name in 2021. The center also serves as space for an impressive exhibition of photo portraits celebrating women leaders and activists in the community.
The next day, the mission continued to the town of Avdiivka in Donetsk Oblast. There, it visited the Territorial Center for Social Services, which offers psychosocial support, leisure and personal development for older persons who have been greatly impacted by the conflict, including through family separation and trauma.
Also in Avdiivka, children attending the “Renaissance – Music School of the Future” held a moving concert for the visitors. Currently 22 teachers teach music instruments and theory, including Ukrainian music history, to some 180 students.
Afterwards, Lubrani and Lindholm Billing attended the opening of a new traumatology unit at the central hospital of Avdiivka. This improvement will expand access to health care for many Ukrainians on both sides of the contact line.
Lindholm Billing, said that there are still critical humanitarian needs due to the protracted conflict, but highlighted the importance of – wherever possible – addressing these in a way which simultaneously builds the capacity of local communities and authorities to protect the rights and dignity of the population in the future:
“UNHCR, as a humanitarian organization with a protection and solutions mandate, provides different types of support and assistance to help individuals or communities in a particularly vulnerable situation address an immediate need, such as psychosocial support, and strives to work in partnership with development organizations, such as UNDP, to link our programs to their projects aimed at developing local systems and structures. In this way, immediate needs are met, while local systems are developed to address the same or similar needs of other people in the future. The people whose needs our programs are seeking to help, and the local authorities are key actors and partners in this community-based ‘Humanitarian-Development Nexus’ approach.”
At the same time, Gercheva attended the opening of the local court, which had stopped operating after the beginning of the conflict in 2014. New computers and videoconferencing equipment will enable the court to resume hearings right away, thus facilitating access to justice for all Ukrainians.
Gercheva said that all people must have unhindered access to justice – especially those who live in the conflict-affected areas across eastern Ukraine.
“The armed conflict and ongoing pandemic have created additional challenges for justice and rule of law by limiting access to courts, and hindering the movement of people who try to cross the ‘contact line’ seeking protection,” she said. “Despite the many obstacles and formidable challenges, UNDP and its partners will continue to make every effort to enhance the capacity of Ukraine's judiciary.”
During the visit, the UN delegation also met with the heads of Donetsk and Luhansk oblast administrations, to discuss the ongoing partnership and to explore areas for strengthened future collaboration.
The visit also provided an opportunity for Lubrani, Gercheva and Lindholm Billing to host townhall meetings to engage with UN staff, field questions and express strong appreciation for the work of all UN personnel serving in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.
The joint mission was a testament to the UN’s continued engagement for all Ukrainians, with focus on those most vulnerable. It highlighted the potential for further operationalization of the humanitarian-development nexus approach and underscored the UN’s commitment to helping Ukraine achieve the sustainable development goals and ensuring that nobody is left behind.

Title: Renovated rehabilitation centre for children with disabilities opens in Popasna
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
09 February 2022
The centre will provide comprehensive rehabilitation services for children and youth from conflict-affected eastern Ukraine
Today in Popasna, Luhansk Oblast, the opening ceremony has taken place of the renovated “Leleka” rehabilitation centre for children with disabilities. An official delegation of representatives of the United Nations in Ukraine attended in the ceremony.
The centre will provide comprehensive rehabilitation services for children and youth with disabilities not only from the city of Popasna, but also from other settlements in the Papasna community, which have been deprived of such opportunities by the protracted armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Specialists will provide physical rehabilitation services, as well as psychological and pedagogical support.
The renovation of the building and purchase of technical equipment were a joint initiative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in partnership with Popasna City Civil-Military Administration and with the financial support of the European Union under the United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme.
Osnat Lubrani, the United Nations Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, said that without being able to access the facilities and services found in the community, persons with disabilities would never be fully included in society.”
“UNDP and UNHCR have joined hands to adequately respond to the needs of the most vulnerable population, in particular children and young people with disabilities,” Lubrani said.
“The opening of this centre is a vivid illustration of how rehabilitation services are becoming more accessible, and that children and young people with disabilities will be able to use them at any time and without undue hindrance.”
The centre was built in 1983 and until now had not undergone any renovation. During the armed conflict, the roof and windows were severely damaged and as a result, the building began to deteriorate, making it impossible to provide quality rehabilitation services. Until recently, families raising children with disabilities had to travel 60 kilometres, all the way to the regional centre in Sievierodonetsk to receive such services.
Dafina Gercheva, UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, stressed that quality services should be equally accessible to all, especially to the most vulnerable groups.
“UNDP will continue helping Ukraine on its way to a more prosperous, inclusive, accessible and peaceful future, leaving no one behind,” Gercheva said.
With its services the already-renovated centre will cover, in addition to the town of Popasna, the other settlements that are now part of the Popasna territorial community: Vrubivka, and the villages of Komyshuvaha, Pryvillia and Troitske. Moreover, the locals from the neighbouring Hirske community from Toshkivka village and the towns of Zolote and Hirske can now also use the services at the centre.
“People with disabilities are often among those who suffer most from the consequences of armed conflict,” Karolina Lindholm Billing, UNHCR Representative in Ukraine, explained. “They often require targeted support to be able to have their rights protected and access services at the same level as other residents in the community. UNHCR, as a protection agency with a humanitarian mission, is proud to collaborate with UNDP and the local authorities to provide children and youth with disabilities with immediate access to much-needed rehabilitation services, through the rehabilitation of this centre that will remain in the community for a long time.”
Mykola Khanatov, the head of the Popasna City Civil-Military Administration, expressed the Administration’s readiness to support initiatives toimprove the quality of life of vulnerable groups in the community. “Not only children but also young people will receive services in this centre, and this is very important for us,” said Khanatov. “Meeting the needs of community members is what we focus on in our work, and since the community’spopulation has grown since the reform, it is very important for us that all people who need such services have access to them and can use them.”
The centre’s interior was renovated as part of a grant project implemented by the NGO “Popasna Local Community Agency for Local Development” under the United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme with financial support of more than US$20,000 (UAH 574 000) from the European Union. In addition, thanks to the partnership with UNHCR, more than $12,000 (UAH 344 400) worth of technical equipment was purchased, and the Popasna Civil-Military Administration allocated more than UAH 180,000 ($6,500) of budgetary funds to cover some of the repairs.
Background
The United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP) is being implemented by four United Nations agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO).
Twelve international partners support the Programme: The European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland.

I look forward to advancing this health agenda in close cooperation with national and international partners.”
“It is a momentous event as today, for the first time in the long history of our relations, the agreement has been concluded at the beginning of the new year. This proves the strong nature of our cooperation aimed to preserve the health of Ukrainians. The cooperation agreement outlines a number of the challenges facing Ukraine in the healthcare system. Today, we are making a significant contribution to the development of our partnership and future fruitful cooperation,” said Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal.
“The World Health Organization is an important strategic partner for Ukraine. The signing of the agreement once again strengthens our direction in the health sphere and further implementation of the ongoing reforms. The adoption and implementation of the "Strategy for the development of the health care system until 2030" is on the agenda. This is the document, focusing on individuals, patients and their needs. We make every effort to ensure that Ukrainians truly receive quality medical services and are financially protected by the state in the health care sphere,” said Viktor Liashko, the Minister of Health of Ukraine.
“Supporting Ukraine in transforming its health system and achieving better health outcomes for Ukrainian people is of utmost importance to WHO. We reaffirm our support and strengthen cooperation to improve access to high-quality health services and progress towards achieving the universal health coverage and the SDGs. At the same time, we need to ensure the response to the next wave of COVID-19, support response to other disease outbreaks, such as polio, transform health system, as well as respond to humanitarian needs,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine.
Grounded in the European Programme of Work (EPW), WHO’s 13th General Programme of Work (GPW 13) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the agreement will increase collaboration between WHO and Ukraine in the following areas:
Through the agreement, WHO will also support Ukraine in strengthening its public health system, including measures on the prevention and control of vaccine-preventable infections, addressing key communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis, as well as antimicrobial resistance, and tackling non-communicable diseases and their risk factors.
WHO and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine will work towards achieving more equitable, sustainable and accountable health development, take joint action to reduce health inequities and increase financial protection for the Ukrainian people.

Title: WHO in Ukraine and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine launched the exhibition "Ukrainian Health and Care Workers: always at your side" for the Universal Health Coverage Day
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 December 2021
For the Universal Health Coverage Day, which is celebrated annually on 12 December, WHO in Ukraine in partnership with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine have launched the exhibition “Ukrainian Health and Care Workers: always at your side”. The exhibition features the images and personal stories of several health and care workers from across Ukraine, showcasing their experience, highlighting the challenges they face, and celebrating their successes.
“Healthcare workers are the daily frontline defenders of our lives and health, and it is important to ensure that they have decent working conditions, receive decent salaries, have access to mental health and psychosocial support services, to learning and development opportunities as well as socially protected. To mark the Universal Health Coverage Day as well as the International Year of Health and Care Workers 2021, WHO in Ukraine hosts the exhibition “Ukrainian Health and Care Workers: always at your side”. It aims to draw attention to the health workers’ achievements, their needs, challenges and to demonstrate the way the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced their daily work,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine.
“I am sure that 2022 will be a year of care for health professionals. We want our doctors and nurses to feel supported by the government and confident in their future. And we have already envisaged in next year’s budget the market salary for our healthcare workers. Our doctors are always at our side, they daily save the lives of thousands of Ukrainian people, the government’s task is to ensure the most comfortable working conditions and make the work of doctors prestigious,” explained Viktor Liashko, Minister of Health of Ukraine.
The exhibition has been held as part of the International Year of Health and Care Workers 2021, designated by WHO in appreciation and gratitude for the health-care workers’ unwavering dedication in combatting the pandemic and beyond. It aims also to emphasize the importance of universal health coverage, and to pay tribute to the efforts of health professionals in Ukraine.
A series of 12 posters, featuring the images and stories of Ukrainian health and care workers, as part of the exhibition “Ukrainian Health and Care Workers: always at your side”, are exhibited in the premises of the Ministry of Health and the National Health Service of Ukraine in Kyiv, as well as in universities and libraries in Lviv, Odesa, Dnipro, Kharkiv and Uzhhorod, and through the digital channels of Permanent Mission of Ukraine to the UN Office and other International Organizations in Geneva and other Ukrainian diplomatic missions.
Universal Health Coverage Day, marked worldwide on 12 December, provides us with an opportunity to remember the importance of ensuring that everyone, everywhere has access to quality essential health services without suffering financial hardship. Following the principle of “leaving no one behind” of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, health professionals work every day to ensure that all of us receive timely and quality health services, along with access to information and effective medicines. The exhibition calls on us all to be attentive to patients’ needs, and ensure everyone is given good-quality and affordable medical care.
The exhibition has been organized by the WHO in Ukraine, with financial support from the WHO and the European Union (EU) under the WHO and EU initiative on health system development in Ukraine, as well as from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the European Union under the EU-Luxembourg-WHO Universal Health Coverage Partnership, and from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Title: Civic space and fundamental freedoms under pressure in Ukraine, says UN Human Rights
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
09 December 2021
Duty bearers throughout Ukraine need to do more to foster civic space, including by promoting fundamental freedoms and enhancing inclusive and meaningful civic participation in public affairs, says a new UN Human Rights Report released today. The report is based on the work of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) and covers the period from 1 November 2019 to 31 October 2021.
The report looks at civic space and fundamental freedoms in Ukraine, with particular attention to freedoms of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association, and the situation of human rights defenders in territory controlled by the Government, territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’ and self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’ and in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, occupied by the Russian Federation (Crimea).
Journalists working on sensitive political topics faced attacks in Government-controlled territory. Human rights defenders, including those working on women’s rights and gender equality, corruption, minority rights, and the environment also faced attacks, threats, acts of intimidation and hate speech. “In most cases perpetrators were not held to account, contributing to a sense of impunity and fueling further attacks. While we recognize that the Government has made some efforts to improve the situation, more efforts are needed to ensure justice,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of HRMMU.
The report finds that attacks against opposition political parties, their members and staff, increased before and after the 2020 local elections in Government-controlled territory, negatively affecting the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association and the right to participate. The report also describes how those who criticized the implementation of the State language law faced threats, intimidation, physical violence and property damage.
The report highlights that a number of decisions taken by the Government led to the closure of media outlets, thereby restricting freedom of expression and public access to information. The decisions failed to demonstrate compliance with international standards on permissible restrictions on freedom of expression as they were not taken by an independent authority and did not demonstrate necessity and proportionality.
Restrictions imposed by armed groups of self-proclaimed ‘republics’ on free speech in social media led to increased self-censorship and a reduction in open expression of critical opinions about political, social and economic issues. In at least four cases, UN Human Rights found that social media users faced arbitrary detention and criminal penalties for expressing views online. Human rights defenders, particularly women human rights defenders, faced a high degree of insecurity.
“There is little space for free expression and assembly in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’,” said Ms Bogner. “Punishing people for expressing opinions and participating in policy discussions that affect their safety and well-being is contrary to international human rights law,” she added.
In Crimea, journalists faced a genuine risk of retaliation for critical reporting, says the report. The requirement for pre-authorization for peaceful assemblies, and the prosecution of participants undermines the right to freedom of peaceful assembly on the peninsula. Human rights defenders, including criminal defence lawyers, faced prosecution and intimidation as retaliation for carrying out their professional responsibilities. Groups and individuals perceived as opposing the occupation of Crimea or critical of Russian Federation policies in Crimea, such as the Mejlis and Crimean Solidarity, suffered unjustified interference into their activities.
“The Russian Federation, as the occupying Power in Crimea, must take concrete steps to improve the environment for civic space for those that want to express their opinions or carry out peaceful assemblies,” Ms Bogner said.
The report provides specific recommendations to the Ukrainian authorities, to self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’ and self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’, and to the Russian Federation, as the occupying Power in Crimea.
The full text of the report is available in English, Ukrainian and Russian.

Title: COVID-19 pushed Ukrainians to accept risky job offers
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
01 December 2021
One in four Ukrainians is ready to accept a risky job offer either abroad or in another settlement in Ukraine: to work without official employment and even in locked premises, being unable to leave a work place freely; to irregularly cross the border; to give their passports, phones and personal belongings to an employer. These are the key findings of a survey*, commissioned by IOM Ukraine and funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). IOM presented the survey results on the eve of International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, which is annually observed on 2 December to raise awareness about human trafficking and other forms of exploitation.
The survey results suggest that 46,000 Ukrainians suffered from human trafficking during 2019-2021: about two thirds of them were trafficked abroad, and one third were exploited in Ukraine. These latest assessments make IOM estimate that the total number of Ukrainians who have suffered from human trafficking since 1991 is over 300,000 persons.
According to the IOM survey, almost 1.2 million Ukrainians worked abroad in 2021, or 11 per cent more than in 2019. Of those, 42 per cent were employed unofficially, compared to 30 per cent two years ago. Eighteen per cent of the surveyed respondents said they were ready to accept an informal job offer abroad, and way more — 27 per cent, would do so in Ukraine, which indicates that Ukrainians tend to underestimate potential threats in their own country.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has made the population even more vulnerable to human trafficking, as over 2 million persons lost their jobs or spent large amounts of funds on medical treatment,” said Teuta Grazhdani, Policy, Liaison and Project Development Coordinator at IOM Ukraine. “During the last two years, we observe the significant increase of internal trafficking. In 2021, 19 per cent of survivors, identified by IOM Ukraine, were trafficked internally, which is over three times more than in 2020.”
Since 2000, IOM, together with a network of its partner NGOs across the country, has provided individually tailored rehabilitation assistance to over 19,000 trafficking survivors. This included legal consultations and representation in court, medical care, psychological counselling, shelter, vocational training, a grant programme supporting trafficking survivors who aspire to set up their own business, and other forms of assistance.
*The nationwide survey was conducted by Info Sapiens at the request of IOM in September–October 2021. Answers were collected from 5,228 respondents, aged above 14 years old, in every oblast of Ukraine and the city of Kyiv, excluding residents of the non-government-controlled areas (NGCA) of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.

Title: East Expo 2021: Businesses from eastern Ukraine show wares on national stage
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
13 October 2021
More than 70 entrepreneurs from various communities of eastern Ukraine are presenting their products and businesses, eager to find new partners to expand their market horizons.
The East Expo 2021 – the country’s biggest business exhibition for micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, this year held on 13-14 October, kicked off today in Kyiv.
Every year, East Expo gives entrepreneurs from eastern Ukraine an opportunity to present their companies at a top-flight business exhibition, finding new customers and introducing the public to the products they make.
East Expo 2021 is organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) within the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, with the financial support of the European Union and the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. The event is conducted in partnership with the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Kherson oblast state administrations, Donetsk Oblast Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ukraine.
Speaking at the opening of the seventh annual East Expo business exhibition, UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine Dafina Gercheva congratulated the participants and their partners and stressed that the exhibition was an important tool for supporting local economic development.
"UNDP has been working in eastern Ukraine since 2015 to support communities, businesses and local governments in the east,” Gercheva said. “Since 2015, almost 1,500 companies have received grant support, about 4,000 jobs have been created, and about 10,000 entrepreneurs have gained new business skills. Today, MSMEs make up most of the enterprises in Ukraine and around the world, and are essential factors in job creation and in the global economy.”
Gercheva also stressed that despite the economic difficulties caused by the ongoing armed conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, enterprises in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts have proved to be highly resilient, determined, and innovative. They continue to operate, grow, and expand in response to market demand.
In his welcoming remarks, Rémi Duflot, Deputy Head of the EU Delegation to Ukraine, noted that SME development was one of the key directions of EU-Ukraine cooperation.
“It’s a privilege for the European Union to be a key partner and supporter of the annual East Expo event,” he said. “East Expo has already established itself as a dynamic platform for developing the links between businesses from eastern and southern Ukraine with the rest of the country, with the EU, and with other countries. A stronger SME sector diversifies the Ukrainian economy and strengthens its resilience.”
Duflot also referred to the social and economic fallout of the pandemic – a crisis that has hit economies around the world. He noted that the ongoing EU4Business programmes assist SMEs across Ukraine to gain access to finance, markets and skills. He also highlighted the assistance mobilized through the 'Team Europe' approach, which is aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the pandemic and helping companies emerge from the crisis.
In addition to the traditional presentations directly at the event location, the exhibition is being shown online: You can view various products and get acquainted with the businesses on the East Expo and Diia.Business websites, where the profiles of about 150 companies are presented. Each profile contains brief information about the company, along with photo and video presentations.
David Schlaefer, Senior Assistance Coordinator, the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine said it was a great pleasure to open the East Expo 2021. He welcomed the entrepreneurs from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts to the event, saying it was aimed at strengthening business ties, exploring new partner opportunities, promoting products, and facilitating access to new markets.
“The economic recovery of eastern Ukraine is among the United States’ top assistance priorities,” Schlaefer said. “We’re honoured to be contributing to the United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, which strives to revitalize eastern Ukraine’s economy by strengthening local business capacity and job skills, supporting home-grown entrepreneurs, and promoting access to new markets and trade links,” he added.
Valeria Ionan, Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation, emphasised that one of the ministry’s objectives of is to turn Ukraine into a country of entrepreneurs.
“To make this happen, we’re implementing a large-scale business development project called Diia.Business. It’s essential for us that micro and small enterprises feel they have the support and aid of the state. That’s why East Expo is an excellent platform for showcasing regional entrepreneurs at the national level, and for networking and building new partnerships.”

Title: Ukrainian celebrities took part in a new HeForShe movie about gender stereotypes
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 October 2021
The HeForShe movement in Ukraine has released a new educational film "Stereotypes do not define you", which starred famous Ukrainians. First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Emine Dzhaparova, singer Alina Pash, journalist Michael Schur, host and director of the Wild Theater Yaroslava Kravchenko, designer Ivan Frolov, ReFace Head of product and growth Maria Ponomarchuk, official makeup artist of Maybelline NY in Ukraine Mitya Hrybko and football referee Sofia Prychyna shared their experience. The singer and HeForShe advocate Dmytro Shurov (Pianoboy) acted as the main character-narrator. UN Women made a film specifically for students to show that discrimination is not the norm, to teach to distinguish and not tolerate it.
“UN Women Ukraine believes that young people have the power to positively transform our societies, economies, and political systems and put human rights and gender equality at the center of all reforms. We are excited to have joined forces with Ukrainian universities and bring this conversation directly to students”, remarks Erika Kvapilova, UN Women Country Representative in Ukraine.
The heroes of the film said that they also faced stereotypes, sought inner confidence and freedom from the opinions of others. They are convinced that gender discrimination must be counteracted, that sexism on the part of classmates, university administrations or employers must not be silenced.
"When you are offered something that does not agree with your moral principles, and even if the boss or even the president does it, you should speak about your point of view clearly and not be afraid," advises singer Alina Pash.
The film was created as part of the HeForShe University Tour — a global project of the HeForShe movement, which has already taken place in the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Thailand and other countries. In September this year, the Ukrainian HeForShe University Tour went to 5 universities all over Ukraine: Chernivtsi, Lviv, Kyiv, Dnipro and Mariupol. The participants of the shows joined a large-scale discussion about stereotypes, sexism, discrimination and violence.
From October 1, everyone can arrange a screening and discussion of the film, thus joining the HeForShe University Tour. The HeForShe movement in Ukraine calls on student councils of universities and colleges, active high school students, teachers, the youth club’s leaders to support a global dialogue on gender equality. More about the HeForShe University Tour project: https://heforsheukraine.info/universitytour/

Title: Civilian casualties on the rise as the security situation deteriorates in eastern Ukraine, says UN Human Rights
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 September 2021
The full text of the report is available in English, Ukrainian and Russian.
After considerable improvement of the security situation in eastern Ukraine following the strengthened ceasefire in July 2020, the number of civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects has risen and is now at levels seen prior to the strengthened ceasefire. A new report released by UN Human Rights today outlines the human rights situation in conflict and non-conflict areas throughout the country. The report is based on the work of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) and covers the period of 1 February to 31 July 2021.
The report says that during the reporting period, UN Human Rights recorded 62 civilian casualties – 15 killed and 47 injured. This is a 51 per cent increase compared with the preceding six months. This trend is continuing, with an additional 16 civilian casualties (two killed and 14 injured) caused by active hostilities recorded between 31 July and 20 September. The numbers in August and September are the highest monthly figures since June 2020.
“Our civilian casualty records clearly demonstrate that the 27 July 2020 ceasefire resulted in a decrease in civilian casualties caused by active hostilities. It shows that is it possible to put in place an effective ceasefire that protects civilian lives.  If it has been done once, it can be done again. The shelling and shooting must stop and we call on all the parties to the conflict to fully implement measures to strengthen the ceasefire,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of HRMMU.
The report says that COVID-19-related movement restrictions in eastern Ukraine, mostly imposed by armed groups, resulted in a 95 per cent reduction of the number of crossings of the contact line. As these restrictions forced many people to cross from territory controlled by armed groups to Government-controlled territory via the Russian Federation, the adoption and enactment of a law, releasing civilians who have crossed this border on humanitarian grounds from administrative penalties, is a positive step by the Government of Ukraine.
“Due to these restrictions imposed by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’, people are not able to see their families.” Ms Bogner said. “Civilians living in settlements located on both sides of the contact line also expressed frustration about lack of access to water and sanitation, healthcare, public transport and passable roads. Priority should be given to ensuring such services for the conflict-affected population,” she added.
The report expresses concern over the adoption of a regulation that allows for the expropriation of immovable private property considered abandoned or left unclaimed in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’. It not only risks violating housing rights of internally displaced persons, but may also endanger future restitution and creates additional constraints for the return and reintegration of internally displaced persons. The report also states that allegations that workers in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’ have been threatened with a salary reduction or dismissal if they did not obtain Russian citizenship may amount to a form of discrimination and thus be contrary to international human rights law.
Regarding the draft law on the transitional period, recently registered in Parliament, the report notes that while it has some welcome provisions, the draft law is built around a definition of transitional justice that is not in line with international standards and does not ensure a victim-centered approach.
The report documented 12 cases of individuals believed to be linked or affiliated with self-proclaimed ‘republics’ detained by law enforcement officials in violation of international standards and national law, including in violation of the in flagrante procedure. UN Human Rights is also following the investigation into allegations of torture and ill-treatment in Oleksiivska penal colony No. 25 in Kharkiv, and is concerned by reports received that prisoners who complained of torture faced retaliation. In territory controlled by armed groups, 13 cases of conflict-related arbitrary detention were documented during the reporting period, eleven of which are ongoing.
“On 5 August, we were granted confidential access to two women and two men in the Luhansk SIZO. We welcome this development and hope that we will have continued access to detainees there. We also call for such access in territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic,” Ms Bogner added.
The report welcomes the adoption on 20 May 2021 of a law harmonising domestic criminal law with international criminal law, which significantly expands the definitions of international crimes in line with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. “We are concerned that the law has not been signed by the President. It would be a significant missed opportunity not to take this final step to ensure accountability of perpetrators for international crimes,” Ms Bogner said.
The report also notes that the decisions of the National Council for Security and Defence that resulted in the closure of television channels and restriction of access to online media are not in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression.
The report highlights 22 cases of threats and attacks against journalists and other media workers, human rights defenders, LGBTI people or their supporters, and members of national minorities. Twenty-one hate speech incidents were also documented during the reporting period, six of which were directed against Roma and another six against LGBTI persons. The report also noted that in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’, an atmosphere of fear and self-censorship prevailed. Criticism of those in charge and participation in public affairs continued to be discouraged, with UN Human Rights documenting three cases of arbitrary detention of individuals who expressed opinions on social networks.
“Persistent grave violations of human rights in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’, must be immediately halted. Repression against those who express critical or independent views must stop, and fundamental freedoms must be respected,” said Ms Bogner.
With regard to economic and social rights, the report notes the lack of social housing and social services to address the needs of persons with disabilities and homeless people, as well as the difficulties for homeless persons without identification papers to access healthcare services.  Persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities in long-term care facilities also lacked access to adequate medical care, contact with the outside world, and employment opportunities.
Concerning the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, occupied by the Russian Federation,[2] the report highlights that among other issues, the blanket requirement of pre-authorization for public assemblies continued to restrict the freedom of peaceful assembly. The report adds that Crimean Tatars were also affected by this, when law enforcement agencies issued warnings in advance of commemorative dates celebrated by Crimean Tatars.
“These and other continuing violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law by the Russian Federation as the occupying Power must be addressed,” said Ms Bogner. “Crimean Tartars also continued to be targeted beyond the reporting period, with five Crimean Tatar men arrested in Crimea on 3 and 4 September, following searches conducted in their homes by Russian law-enforcement bodies,” she added.
The report also provides a set of specific recommendations to the Ukrainian authorities, to self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’ and self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’, and to the Russian Federation, as the occupying Power in Crimea.

16 September 2021
On 8 September 2021, UNODC, through its Global Firearms Programme (GFP), organized practical training on the investigation and prosecution of firearms trafficking in Ukraine.
15 female criminal justice practitioners from the Prosecutor General’s Office, Security Service of Ukraine and the State Bureau of Investigations participated in the capacity building event, including prosecutors, investigators and operative search officers who work on firearms-related crimes. The training was organized in line with UNODC’s Strategy for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (2018–2021).
The event focused on enhancing the knowledge of the participants in conducting investigations and the prosecution of firearms trafficking cases by understanding how firearms identification and tracing contribute to solving cases with transnational elements. Participants acquired knowledge about the identification of firearms, their parts, components and ammunition, the forms of tracing, stages of tracing, and the tracing procedure.
The training provided knowledge about how information obtained from firearms tracing can be used to guide law enforcement in the detection, investigation and prosecution of firearms trafficking and its links to organized crime or terrorism.
The event was supported through the generous contribution of Germany.

Title: HeForShe University Tour will take place in Ukraine for the first time: a student project on stereotypes and discrimination
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 September 2021
The HeForShe movement in Ukraine is launching a dialogue with students on gender equality
The UN Women's HeForShe solidarity movement for gender equality is going on a University Tour, which will feature five universities in Ukraine. The HeForShe University Tour has already taken place in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Thailand. After the Tours, HeForShe-clubs were created in universities — places of concentration and discussion platforms for caring youth. September 16-29, Ukrainian students and teachers will talk about stereotypes, sexism, discrimination and violence.
Cases of sexism and stereotypes are still encountered by most people in the world. About half of the world's population is Generation Z under the age of 30. And according to a recent global study by the HeForShe movement, gender equality is one of the top five issues for them.
Students often find themselves in situations that weaken their faith in themselves, prevent them from expressing their personality freely or realizing their ambitions, desires and dreams in the future. The reason for this can be both domestic sexism and harassment or even violence, which are sometimes silenced.
As part of the HeForShe University Tour, there will be the premiere of educational movie with the participation of the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Emine Dzhaparova, singer Dmytro Shurov, singer Alina Pash, journalist Michael Schur, host and director of the Wild Theater Yaroslava Kravchenko, designer Ivan Frolov, ReFace Head of product and growth Maria Ponomarchuk, official makeup artist of Maybelline NY in Ukraine Mitya Hrybko and football referee Sofia Prychyna. Specially for Ukrainian students, they shared their stories about stereotypes, the search for inner confidence and freedom from the opinions of others. After watching the film, students will have the opportunity to discuss the topics of discrimination, sexism, tolerance and gender equality with experts, opinion leaders and friends of the HeForShe movement.
Tour schedule:
Since October 1, the film will be publicly available on the Youtube platform, and everyone will be able to organize screenings in their educational institutions and youth organizations.

_________________________________________________________________________
Created by UN Women, the HeForShe solidarity movement for gender equality provides a systematic approach and targeted platform on which men and boys can engage and become change agents towards the achievement of gender equality. Since its launch in 2014, hundreds of thousands of men from around the world including Heads of State, CEOs, and global luminaries, from all walks of life have committed to gender equality. The HeForShe movement in Ukraine is implemented with the financial support of Sweden.

Title: In Sumy and Rivne regions women are taught to build a startups
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
13 September 2021
The joint project of the International Labor Organization and the UNDP is teaching women in Sumy and Rivne oblasts how to start their own businesses. The joint initiative of two UN organizations, aimed at economic empowerment of women during the COVID-19 crisis, will be implemented through a series of trainings in twooblasts until November 2021.
During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, the ILO and UNDP’s study revealed that women's businesses have been affected by COVID-19 crisis way more than men's. The joint ILO-UNDP project "Empowering Women in Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in Ukraine" targets two oblasts of Ukraine - Sumy and Rivne – to support women's entrepreneurship. In Sumy oblast Okhtyrka and Konotop cities were selected for the program, and in Rivne oblast – Korets and Dubno.
The free of charge trainings, designed for women interested in starting their own businesses, were held with the active support of Sumy and Rivne Regional State Administrations and the State Employment Services. Those institutions also have helped to find women interested in enrolling for business trainings. Some participants of the three-day training were invited by the local employment center, the rest were selected based on their submitted business ideas. In total, about 110 women were trained, including those who are inactive or unemployed, as well as 25 women-entrepreneurs whose businesses suffered during the pandemic.
According to one of the participants of training program in Sumy oblast, Ms. Alina Tyshchenko, taking care of her small child currently does not allow her to get a regular job. The training helped her to improve her self-confidence when she found herself going through a difficult times, she gained a new knowledge on tax accounting for entrepreneurs and learned how to open and promote business.
The trainer for the program, Ms. Svitlana Lutsenko, noted that the entrepreneurship training will be useful both for women who already run their own businesses and for those who want to build it from scratch: ‘Taxation groups, registration of enterprise, marketing, developing a business plan are the essential components of our training. Upon completion, the participants will have to come up with their own business plans and go through all fundamental steps that will teach them to successfully start their own business. After the trainings, women will be proposed to get individual consultations to finalize their business plans,’ – says Ms. Lutsenko.
Also, women are trained to conduct a market research to determine sustainability of their business idea, its distinctiveness and ability to compete and survive at the local market. Women are being advised on how to define number of staff, equipment and facilities to implement their business idea, as well as whether additional financial support will be required.
It is expected that trainings will help to improve the situation with women entrepreneurship in both regions.
It should be pointed out, that the trainings conducted by the ILO, do not provide for grants, but educational and mentoring support. The trainings are conducted according to the ILO’s unique methodology under the program "Start and improve your business", initiated by the ILO back in ‘80s, while Ukraine joined the program three decades later. It’s a step-by-step guide that teaches a potential entrepreneur to start own business without any previous knowledge or experience in entrepreneurship. All business ideas, implemented under the program must be environmentally friendly.

Title: World Suicide Prevention Day: Creating Hope Through Action
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
10 September 2021
World Suicide Prevention Day (WSPD), observed worldwide on 10 September under the theme “Creating Hope Through Action”, provides an opportunity to raise awareness of the problem of suicides in Ukraine and around the world and the role that each of us can play to help prevent it.
According to WHO estimates:
In the WHO European Region, men are at least 3 times more likely to die by suicide than women. In Ukraine this difference is even bigger - men are almost 7 times more likely to die by suicide.
“Suicide is one of the priority conditions in the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) launched in Ukraine in 2019 on request of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. The initiative provides family doctors and nurses with the skills to identify and provide basic management of common mental health conditions, including depression, substance use and self-harm/suicide, linking this work with specialist care when required," said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine.
WHO supports Ukraine in improving mental health of individuals and society at large, helping promote the mental well-being, prevent the mental disorders, and increase access to quality mental health care services.
“As a part of mhGAP programme, WHO and partners have trained more than 500 primary healthcare workers across the country to early identify and prevent suicides and bring quality mental health care closer to people”, said Dr Alisa Ladyk-Bryzghalova, Officer on Mental Health in the WHO Country Office in Ukraine.
Suicide is a serious public health problem; however, with the LIVE LIFE approach, WHO aims to prevent suicides and recommends the following key effective evidence-based interventions:

Title: European Union provided Ukrainian Police with vehicles, state-of-the-art IT equipment and heavy duty bomb suit
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
10 September 2021
On 10 September, the EU-funded PRAVO Police programme delivered 18 patrol police cars, 40 public order support vehicles, nine defibrillators, state-of-the-art servers and data storage systems as well as a bomb suit and related equipment for the National Police of Ukraine (NPU). This equipment for approximately EUR 3.4 million will help Ukrainian police to become more effective in performing their critical duties and enhance safety in Ukrainian cities, communities, streets, and roads.
“The EU is the leading supporter of sustainable rule of law reforms in Ukraine. Together with the European Union Advisory Mission, the EU-funded Pravo-Police programme helps to establish a more accountable, transparent, efficient and effective law-enforcement system for the benefit of all Ukrainians”, said Ambassador Matti Maasikas, Head of the EU Delegation to Ukraine.
“The EU Advisory Mission is pleased to support the National Police with public order. EUAM currently provides training for Special Police Units on the new Public Order Concept throughout Ukraine. In combination with the 40 vehicles that the EU hands over today, I am confident that you have a good basis for an effective roll-out of the new Public Order concept,” said Acting Head of EUAM, Fredrik Wesslau.
“Police reform is a crucial component of broader rule of law reform in Ukraine, and the PRAVO Police programme is honoured to contribute to this ongoing transformation which focuses on the delivery of modernised, efficient and human rights-based policing. We are proud to work alongside our partners in the Ministry of Interior, the National Police, and the European Union to provide world-class equipment and technical expertise that will strengthen police capacity at all levels to effectively combat crime and maintain peace whilst protecting citizens’ rights,” noted Fran O’Grady, Senior Programme Manager, UNOPS/PRAVO Police.
The patrol cars will be used to nine regions across Ukraine: Kirovohrad, Lviv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Chernivtsi, Poltava and Khmelnytskyi and enhance police mobility and reduce time while responding to emergency situations. In many emergency and crime response situations, police officers are often the first on scene and must be equipped to provide immediate life-saving first aid. With the help of the defibrillators police officers will be able to increase the survival rate of sudden cardiac arrest victims and save more lives.
A heavy-duty bomb suit and disruptors/de-armers will enhance the capacity of the Donetsk oblast police Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team in demining and disposing of explosive objects, such as mines, bombs and improvised explosive devices, while ensuring safety of the officers and local populations. In 2020 alone, the NPU EOD team in Donbas region responded to over 560 calls, consisting of over 40,000 individual items, with more than two tonnes of explosive content.
Forty public order support vehicles will facilitate the NPU’s adoption of the ‘best European practices in public order management’ methodology that focuses on promoting dialogue, communication and de-escalation during large-scale public events, like football matches, protests, marches or rallies. This approach is based on recognizing fundamental human rights for peaceful assembly and ensuring that people are protected from potential violence during mass gatherings. Additionally, the NPU received 350 sets of protective body armour, helmets, gas masks and gloves for public-order-support teams.
The state-of-the-art IT system will enhance Ukrainian police capabilities to coordinate their work with Interpol/Europol in fighting organised and transnational crime. The system will improve the NPU’s efficiency in handling flows of significant information. It will enable police to register, process, and store data ensuring transparency, controlled and supervised management of automated information, processing of documents, as well as establishment of electronic archives.
This equipment has been procured within the framework of the programme “Support for Rule of Law Reforms in Ukraine in the Areas of Police and Public Prosecution and Good Governance” (PRAVO Police) funded by the European Union and implemented by UNOPS in close coordination with the European Union Advisory Mission to Ukraine. The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to promoting rule of law in Ukraine and to aligning law-enforcement agencies functioning with the best European Union and international practices.
Background information:
The Support for Rule of Law Reforms in Ukraine in the areas of Police, Public Prosecution and Good Governance (PRAVO Police) programme is funded by the European Union and implemented by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in coordination with the EU Advisory Mission (EUAM). PRAVO Police assists the National Police, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the other law-enforcement agencies in Ukraine in reforming public order management and criminal investigation systems, modernising pre-trial investigation frameworks aimed at combating cybercrime and serious and organised crime, introducing community and intelligence-led policing models, establishing an effective witness protection system, enhancing police collaboration with Interpol and Europol, and enhancing its professional development and training system.

Title: Local employment partnerships  will help to improve labour markets in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
03 September 2021
During 2020-2021, the International Labour Organization in Ukraine (ILO) successfully piloted a local employment partnership in Kherson. This activity became possible with the participation of local employers, local State Employment Service, educational institutions and NGOs who formed the mechanism that can effectively address the labor market problems on local level. Potentially, such partnerships may soon start operating all over Ukraine.
After two years of work, a methodology for employment partnerships at the local level, developed by the International Labor Organization, has proven its efficiency in solving the problems of the labor market in Ukraine on the example of Kherson city. Local employment partnership (LEP) is the voluntary union, designed to improve the labour market situation in the local community, by merging efforts of the local employment service, local employers, NGOs and educational institutions.
The partnership was implemented for the first time in Kherson, and now has demonstrated its first tangible results. Its main goal of the partnership was to analyze the situation on the local (city) labor market and identify potential areas of business activity that could bring profit to the local community and employ its inactive or unemployed residents. In Kherson, the LEP was primarily focused on improvement of hotel and restaurant industry. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kherson’s LEP managed to employ 40 citizens who were unemployed or inactive; in addition, 18 winners of a business plan competition received grants from the ILO to start their own businesses. Also, local employment partnership invited best restaurateurs from neighbor areas to retrain students-cooks from Kherson vocational school, so they could better meet needs of the employers. Thanks to the Kherson LEP, occupational standards for cook have been developed and adopted by the Ministry of education at the national level for the entire country.
During the COVID-19 pandemic many people in Kherson, just as across Ukraine, have lost their jobs, with a women, leading the most vulnerable cohort. With the improvement of epidemiological situation, for many of them it remained still difficult to get employed.
Khrystyna Studynska received ILO grant for opening of her business ‘outdoor picnic party rental’ while expecting a baby. She says, even though it’s quite hard to run business and take care of her 6-month-old infant, she always finds a time to push ahead her own startup. “I enjoy my business because it’s so aesthetically nice… you know, all these beautiful kits I provide for picnic rentals they are visually appealing. That’s why I get so many orders for the photoshoot, or romantic dinners outside”. Khrystyna says, initially it was quite complicated to find clients, because her business is unique as such, but very soon people began recommending her to a friends and Instagram followers, so now she even plans to expand her business.
Another ILO’s grant recipient from Kherson, Olena Borysenko, applied for the grant program together with her retired mother. However, only she succeeded to win $3000 for equipment for a coffee shop. “I was so disappointed, as initially I didn’t win a grant, as there was a big competition, - says Olena, - However, I decided to open my business anyway. You, know I have the best cakes in the city and people just love them… My clients posted very positive feedbacks on my sweets on Instagram, and mentor of ILO grant program somehow saw it. It was like a miracle, as few months later I received an ILO grant for procurement of equipment that made my coffee-pastry business really much more productive”.
Participants of the grant program got a mentorship support throughout the course and were trained for several weeks on how to develop their own business plan before obtained a grant. The program targeted, first of all, the most vulnerable groups of population.
Olesia Mikheeva, 51, came to a state employment center after years she spent in a professional journalism at TOP national TV-channel. She was immediately and quite openly informed that she had a very little chances to find a job: ‘I was so angry to hear that, but very unexpectedly it gave me a strong motivation to start my business no matter what. At that day I came home and made a fundamental web research… I used to be a journalist, you know [laughing]… so I know how to find what I need. That’s how I stumbled upon ILO grant program. The grant gave me a second chance in my life to do what I really love’. Olesia’s choice for a business was a jam production. ‘It’s a very artistic process, not a regular cooking, - she says – with ILO’s equipment I developed my unique recipes, some of jams should be even baked in oven’.
In addition to Kherson, the local employment partnerships were also launched in Rivne oblast, as a part of ILO’s project ‘Inclusive labor markets for job creation in Ukraine’, funded by Danish government.
It is envisaged that activities of the local employment partnerships must be flexible and variable enough to make the most of all opportunities and resources on the ground and meet needs of the local communities. Basically, the LEP’s strength lies in a collaboration between educational institutions that train labor potential, the employment service that helps them to get employed, and employers who actually create a demand for a labour force in a certain region. So, the partnership model allows all stakeholders to come together at the local level without anticipating instructions from above. LEPs are designed to became sustainable and after some time of initial support, to operate fully independently. It is noteworthy that this model of cooperation in the field of employment is not a know-how, but is borrowed from other European countries. LEPs have already been successfully implemented by the International Labor Organization in a number of European countries, including Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova and Montenegro.
The International Labor Organization in Ukraine is now developing a step-by-step guide on how to create and facilitate local employment partnerships and plans to provide it very soon to Ukraine for further implementation.

Title: Urgent funding is required to meet the needs of 1.9 million people in eastern Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
20 August 2021
On this World Humanitarian Day, the humanitarian community calls upon international donors to provide urgent funding to help meet the most critical needs of 1.9 million people in eastern Ukraine. In the first six months of 2021, humanitarian actors have provided assistance to over 800,000 people on both sides of the “contact line”. However, if additional funding is not made available, the most vulnerable will be left without support.
Seven years of ongoing armed conflict have pushed millions of people in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts to the brink. In addition, the last 17 months of movement restrictions across the “contact line” aimed to slow the spread of COVID-19 have pushed people into greater dependency on humanitarian assistance.
At the end of last year, humanitarian organizations estimated that 3.4 million residents of eastern Ukraine would require humanitarian assistance in 2021, out of which 1.9 million most vulnerable people on both sides of the “contact line” were targeted to receive humanitarian relief and protection services. Despite existing funding constraints and limited humanitarian access, the UN and its humanitarian partners have already supported over 800,000 in the first six months of 2021.
“The work that humanitarian community does in eastern Ukraine is only possible if we have two key elements: humanitarian access and sufficient funding. Unfortunately, this year so far, we have only received 27 per cent, some US$45.4 million, of the $168 million required to provide humanitarian assistance to 1.9 million Ukrainians on both sides of the “contact line”, noted Ms. Osnat Lubrani, the UN Resident Coordinator, Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine.
In eastern Ukraine, the needs of people continue to outpace the funding as violence and the COVID-19 pandemic continue to persist. With this in mind, the humanitarian community in Ukraine has identified US$49 million of Humanitarian Funding Priorities to set out for international donors time-sensitive funding priorities for the remainder of 2021.
“If we fail to mobilize $49 million in the next five months, more than 600,000 people will not have sufficient access to critical services, and at least 50 medical facilities in eastern Ukraine are not going to be properly equipped to deal with the effects of the next wave of COVID-19 infections. Moreover, some 107,000 persons living in communities close to the “contact line” will not be able to afford to stay warm during winter,” underlined Mr. Ignacio Leon Garcia, Head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Ukraine, in presenting the Document.

Title: Why is inactivity in the labour market a greater problem than unemployment?
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
19 August 2021
By Džemal Hodžić, Chief Technical Advisor, International Labour Organization in Ukraine
Perhaps, it will be a revelation for most readers to learn than inactivity in the Ukrainian labour market is a considerably greater problem than unemployment.
To begin with, it is worth sorting out the terminology. Not all the people who do not have a job are considered unemployed. Indeed, there is a broad category of people who are not jobseekers, hence they are regarded by the International Labour Organization not as unemployed but exactly inactive. According to the ILO definition a person to be considered unemployed must meet three criteria: a) to be out of work, b) to actively look for a job, and c) to be able to accept an offered job within two weeks upon the offer is made. That said, media and official reports usually appeal exactly to statistics of unemployment whereas a great number of inactive individuals beyond purview of all services is just overlooked, therefore it’s quite likely that you will learn about such a category of persons for the first time.
In Ukraine, more than 10 million people aged between 15 and 70 are inactive at the labour market, according to Labour Force Survey 2019. You must admit it’s an impressive figure, and even if we reduce it by about 4 million people being pensioners, more than 6 million  ones of the age group 15-59 are inactive, therefore neither employed nor unemployed. A certain percentage of them are students, and only about 1% do not search for a job because of health. If we take the LFS statistics of unemployed for comparison, there is “only” 1.5 million of them in the country and according to the SES statistics (officially registered with SES there is only about 0.5 million unemployed. Do you see the difference? Usually, inactive people are not on the radar of the public employment service. And, since the inactivity problem does not rise to the surface it is not being addressed as such.
If we compare the statistics of unemployment among men and women in Ukraine, we will have to surprise you again because there will be less women in this category. Why? Because it is women who are more engaged in performing family duties, such as child care and elderly people care. Therefore, they face barriers to enter the labour market. And, as you have already guessed it, it is they who make up a hefty part of the “invisible cohort” of inactive individuals. Just imagine: more than 3.7 million women at age 15-59 are inactive, out of total 6.1 million inactive in the same age group.
Let’s find out now who exactly is harmed by this inactivity – the state, citizens, or, perhaps employers too? The answer is – everyone because the state receives less budget revenue that would be generated by such individuals if employed, in addition to the fact that state actually has to pay some social benefits to some of these groups. Employers in many sectors feel a shortage of labour force, and that niche might indeed be filled by the people from the inactive pool. A huge share of inactive persons would like to work but they cannot do that due to the barriers beyond their control.. Someone’s work skills have become obsolete – for example, of mothers getting back from a 3-years long maternity leave, or of workers having a focused specialization which is no longer demanded in the labour market. Someone has just lost faith in finding a job after years of search. Someone else, for example, has just no transport available to get to a neighboring village to work. Also, a great reason for inactivity is that many families still live with understanding of traditionally dominating social role of the woman as housewife, responsible for domestic work and children’s care. All these people eventually find themselves on the labour market margins.
How can the inactivity problem be tackled? It’s important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution that would solve the problem right away at all levels. However, I believe that there are quite obvious steps that can be made. First of all, it is necessary to have a political will to address this problem. Then, outreach campaigns aimed specifically at a certain group should be launched to inform such individuals that they will be assisted in a job search. Of course, it would be impossible to assist all the groups at the same time, but to decide which specific one to target. It requires multi-stakeholder approach of public employment service, employers in particular, education providers, NGOs, local governments who could altogether design a specific line of measures to help targeted groups of people enter the labour force market. The International Labour Organization has the technical expertise to assist the country to address this issue.
The state could potentially encourage the individuals, having the inactive status, to get registered with the Public employment service , whereas the latter in turn must help a person draft a job placement plan, identify the skills possessed by the person and needing improvement, deliver necessary trainings for skills upgrading, etc.
I will give you an example from my home country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, how the problem of unemployment and inactivity can be successfully tackled. One municipality sold a large empty space which was actually a factory, destroyed during the war in Bosnia to a local employer for only\ euro to arrange a factory there, but with one condition - to employ at least 500 persons from that particular municipality. The local public employment service office realized that there is no labour force with required skills available. Therefore, the the public employment service approached the employer offering its services in finding the needed labour force and developing a training program with the local high school to enable the labour force to acquire the necessary skills. Then, the PES visited all the registered unemployed offering retraining and employment opportunities. As a result the employer hired at the 740 people at the end. Since many families identified a problem of lack of affordable childcare the employer built a kindergarten within the factory and provided enable workers with small children to have an affordable (subsidized by the employer) childcare.
I’ve been working in Ukraine for more than three years, and would like to note that the people’s inactivity problem is not unique to Ukraine. The inactivity problem is rather acute in the European Union and the Balkan countries as well. However, advanced countries do not neglect the inactivity problem, they target the priority groups of inactive people all the time and help them in activation and job placement. Important to note, that employers are often willing to support some activities in assisting the inactive to overcome the barriers to employment as they are also interested in attracting more labour force, particularly in occupations where it is labour shortage identified. It is worth adding that a country does not necessarily be rich to help inactive people find jobs – not at all. The state should merely identify the problem and start making consistent steps towards its solution in partnership among institutions (government/s + public employment service, social and health institutions + education providers + employers + civil society organizations). And the sooner the better.

Title: WHO and Canada to expand support in strengthening the delivery of primary health care and essential health services in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 August 2021
WHO and the Government of Canada (Global Affairs Canada) signed a grant agreement in March 2021 in the amount of 30.38 million Canadian dollars to support 10 countries, including Ukraine, in delivering stronger and more resilient primary health care and essential health services during the COVID-19 response and recovery.
The initiative aims to monitor barriers and enhance access to healthcare services amid the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthen national health policies and regulations as well as ensure capacity building of the healthcare workers in clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and in integrated management of hypertension, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. The project focuses on an equity-oriented, gender responsive and human rights-based approach to ensure that all Ukrainian people have access to health service and medicines, and no one is left behind. It is implemented under the leadership of the WHO Special Programme on Primary Health Care through the Universal Health Coverage Partnership network—one of WHO’s largest platforms for international cooperation on universal health coverage and primary health care. This effort aims to respond to the needs and gaps identified by countries and supports the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, highlighting the urgency of maintaining essential health services and systems.
Ukraine has also received Canada’s additional financial contribution in the amount of 350 thousand Canadian dollars to support the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator Health Systems Connector Implementation in Ukraine. This initiative, launched by WHO and partners in 2020, aims to support the country in identifying and addressing health systems barriers and bottlenecks hindering the effective scale-up and delivery of new and existing COVID-19 tools at the country level. The WHO and Canada collaboration will focus in particular on public health laboratories, field epidemiology investigations and situation monitoring, clinical care and health care workers knowledge, and quality systems for medicines and supply chain.
“The WHO Country Office in Ukraine welcomes this timely contribution and partnership from Canada. In spite of the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic since last year, Ukraine continues to reform and strengthen its health system, investing in primary health care to move towards universal health coverage (UHC), improve health security and progress on health-related Sustainable Development Goals. We continue to work hand in hand with the Government of Ukraine and health authorities to ensure that more people can access quality health services when they need it, without causing them to experience financial hardship, which is the core vision of UHC,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine.
“During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to maintain the delivery of essential and primary healthcare services. We are delighted to work closely with WHO in Ukraine to contribute to the transformative reforms in health sector.  The key objective of the new projects is to support Ukraine in strengthening and building a more resilient health system, also promoting gender equality and human rights at all levels,” said Larisa Galadza, Ambassador of Canada to Ukraine.
Bridging global commitments with national priorities
Canada’s contribution also enhances collaboration among the 13 multilateral health, development and humanitarian agencies working together under the frame of the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (SDG3-GAP) to better support countries in accelerating progress towards the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Primary Health Care Accelerator is among the seven accelerator areas under the Global Action Plan and through this, Ukraine is receiving intensified support for primary health care.
A contribution to the Joint Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction also complements this work by undertaking formative research to identify and analyze specific innovations and modifications made by countries to ensure continued access to and delivery of health services.

Title: FAO announced the launching of “Doradnyk” website, for the development of agricultural  advisory services  in Eastern Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
09 August 2021
On 27 July 2021, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) officially announced the launching of “Doradnyk” website– https://doradnyk.org.ua/ua/ – which will host the latest news in the field of agriculture, announcements, discussions farmers related initiatives and detailed information about advisory services in Eastern Ukraine.

“Doradnyk” website will provide quality advisory services to farmers, in particular, to those from Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

"Farmers, advisory services, representatives of micro, small and medium enterprises, local authorities and all other stakeholders now have the opportunity to consult on any issues related to agricultural and rural development," said Eugen Chiabur, FAO international project coordinator. "The platform has also been designed to facilitate information exchange between various actors of the light model of the agricultural advisory services system", developed by FAO within the scope of the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP).

According to Roman Bezus, FAO expert on agricultural advisory services, “the light model of the agricultural advisory services system is a FAO-developed information and advisory system in which clear roles and responsibilities are given to different actors in the advisory system, depending on their main strengths, at the national, regional and community levels”. The expert also noted that “access to advisory services is extremely important for agricultural producers, especially for those producers who live and work in eastern Ukraine, in conflict-affected areas”.

“Doradnyk” website was developed by FAO and handed over to the Eastern Ukrainian Agricultural Advisory Services, in Donetsk oblast, for further development, management and ownership, in complementarity with two other advisory services in the region, the NGO "Agricultural Advisory Service", from Luhansk oblast, and the Information and Consultancy Center “Agro-Tavria”, from Zaporizhzhia oblast.

“Anyone who has  relevant experience and desire to work with agricultural producers in three oblasts, in eastern Ukraine and beyond, can publish their profile in the "Advisors" or "Service Providers" section of the website and directly promote their services. We hope this approach of facilitating advisory services by various actors will be upscaled to other regions of Ukraine,” added Roman Bezus. "An agricultural producer or a farmer, in turn, after reading the profile of such a person or organization, can request for  appropriate services."

The user has to follow two steps to register: 1) enter a valid email address and come up with a password, or log in using social networks; 2) create a personal account and click "Save". Registered users can then start participating in discussions, commenting on the news, as well as post relevant information about themselves in the sections "Advisors" and "Service Providers"!

Title: UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine handed over ILO legal gap analysis on the ILO Maritime Labour Convention to the Minister of Infrastructure
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 July 2021
At the UN’s meeting with the Minister of Infrastructure Oleksander Kubrakov and his office, Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine, outlined a wide scope of issues that the UN and its Agencies, Funds and Programmes can collaborate on with the Ministry for Infrastructure to boost progress on achieving SDGs. These included sustainable transport, smarter and greener infrastructure and better protection of workers in the maritime industry. The latter was given a special focus as Ukraine strives to ratify the MLC – the ILO flagship Convention that ensures comprehensive worldwide protection of the rights of seafarers and creates a level playing field for countries and shipowners.
National Coordinator of International Labour Organization in Ukraine, Sergiy Savchuk, was also present at the meeting.
The meeting was a crowning moment of a deep review of Ukrainian legislation by the ILO designated legal experts. The review identifies legal gaps vis-à-vis the MLC and offers legal solution to bridge them so that Ukraine can effectively comply with the MLC provisions in law and in practice. The review was prepared following the Ministry’s request to the ILO for technical assistance.
It is expected that the MLC ratification package, inclusive of the draft-law that amends the national legislation to conform to this ILO instrument will soon be prepared for adoption.

Title: UN Food Systems Summit 2021  Ukraine held second National Dialogue
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
21 July 2021
The Food Systems Summit Dialogues are convened by Member States through the organization of "national dialogues" aiming to strengthening the dialogue among diverse stakeholders on key challenges and innovative solutions to make our food systems more sustainable. In Ukraine, the national discussions should result in National Report with a clear roadmap and an action plan for sustainable food systems until 2030. The results will be presented by the President of Ukraine at the UN Food Systems Summit which will take place in September 2021.
The first National Dialogue in Ukraine was focused on the issues of transformation and development of country’s Food Systems, the role of the Ukrainian agricultural sector in supporting global food security, and approaches of government and business to the UN Sustainable Development Goals were discussed. During the event three key areas of action were identified during, including healthy nutrition, environmentally friendly production, resilience to market instability and food availability.
The second National Dialogue on Ukraine's potential for the development of food systems was held on 14 July under the auspices of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine and the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine with the support of United Nations in Ukraine, particularly Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with the participation of representatives of science, public and business associations. The main aim of the event was to to draw public attention to the urgency of the transformation of food systems at the global level (a separate item of the G7 Summit), outline the country's potential and challenges for the development of food systems in Ukraine in the context of global trends, and continue a series of discussions in the framework of the national dialogue on the transformation of food systems in preparation for the UN Summit on Food Systems 2021.
Roman Leshchenko, Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, said in his opening remarks that the issue of foreign trade expansion is currently important given the changes in economic conditions, primarily through the development of innovative technologies in agriculture, while meeting domestic demand. “The Government's position is as follows: Ukraine should increase production, but at the same time provide the population with the access to quality products”, he added.
"Exports of all types of products show quite strong results. But on the other hand, there is a connection with the internal instability of the system, which affects Ukraine's perception of the world. National Dialogues on food systems allow us to see the global picture and understand that we don’t have unique problems, and sometimes even the opposite. The task of the Dialogues is to try to transform domestic policy to show that Ukraine has something to add to global systems and promote Ukraine as an active participant in international trade,", said Taras Kachka, Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine, Trade Representative of Ukraine.
The participants also discussed Ukraine's development zones on the way to a proactive position on the world market, and also identified the next steps on the way to the ambitious goal of becoming a market-forming country.
"The direction of healthy nutrition and leisure is a future trend for the development of humankind. Our ambitious goal at the international level is to support Ukraine to grow a role from an active participant to a market-forming country, ” commented Taras Vysotsky, Deputy Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine.
This is only the first part of a series of National Dialogues, which will be continued on other vectors of food systems transformation.

Title: UN Food Systems Summit 2021  Ukraine held third National Dialogue

21 July 2021
The Food Systems Summit Dialogues are convened by Member States through the organization of “national dialogues” aiming at strengthening the dialogue among diverse stakeholders on key challenges and innovative solutions to make our food systems more sustainable. In Ukraine, the national discussions should result in National Report with a clear roadmap and an action plan for sustainable food systems until 2030. The results will be presented by the President of Ukraine at the UN Food Systems Summit which will take place in September 2021.
While the first dialogue addressed Ukraine’s Food Systems transformation and development, and the second dialogue aimed at the development of food systems, the third dialogue was held on 19 July and was focused on sustainability and environmental friendly production. The dialogue continue a series of discussions in the framework of the national dialogue on the transformation of food systems in preparation for the UN Summit on Food Systems 2021.
The participants of the third National Dialogue discussed the topics of environmental protection in the context of agricultural development, related to the problem of global warming and the consequences that humanity is already actively facing.
“The development of environmental friendly production is a determining factor in the sustainable development of agriculture. The European Green Course sets out a roadmap within which we can find ways to implement reforms in Ukraine and change our politics in line with recent environmental challenges. Most of the changes concern the temperature regime, which, unfortunately, has shown a clear upward trend in recent decades,” said Roman Leshchenko, Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine.
The participants discussed that it is very important for Ukraine to be involved in the European Green Course initiative. However, most participants in the dialogue agreed that Ukraine in the context of the European Green Course already has its positive developments and unique specifics, which is why the terms of this policy should not be copied but adapted to Ukrainian realities.
“In the European Union, the discussion of the Green Course is now developing on the vector of how agriculture can be efficient and at the same time be environmentally safe, and Ukraine already has positive developments in this," said Taras Kachka, Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine, Trade Representative of Ukraine.
Taras Vysotsky, First Deputy Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, added: “The Green Course program must be adapted to Ukrainian realities. The development of measures within the direction of environmental friendly production takes the form of dialogue, and with the understanding that feedback is essential for all participants in the process. State support the implementation of changes, it will focus on motivating agricultural producers, but will also have certain standards for products and production processes”.
The participants also discussed ways of financing the Smart Green Deal and Ukrainian environmental reality. The organizers of the event plan to hold more discussions in the format of the National Dialogue and formulate the remaining vectors of the future system of Ukraine’s food systems transformation.

Title: Helping women fulfil potential in rural Ukraine can make agriculture sector more efficient
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
13 July 2021
As elsewhere in the world, women in Ukraine represent a large proportion of the agricultural labour force and the majority of food producers, and thus play key roles in managing natural resources and promoting the well-being of their families.

To explore and analyse gender issues in agriculture and food security, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has developed the first Country Gender Assessment for Ukraine,. The report – part of FAO’s Country Gender Assessment series, and whose full title is ‘National Gender Profile of Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods (Ukraine)’ – aims to serve policymakers and practitioners engaged in the formulation and implementation of agriculture policies and programmes, researchers and analysts, civil society actors, and other partners.

The report acknowledges women’s role in food systems and rural development, yet it also points out their unequal access to land and other assets and resources, which limits their economic opportunities and puts them at risk of being left behind. Based on these findings, the report provides recommendations on how to address gender inequalities for increased agricultural productivity and food security, and sustainable rural development.

Greater agricultural productivity, food security and rural livelihoods, says the report, cannot be achieved without recognising the distinct and complementary roles of women and men, and ensuring social and economic equality for both groups.

“The report contributes to the existing knowledge base about gender equality in the country, by bringing together gender statistics and experts’ opinions, but also serving as an advocacy tool to provide greater visibility to rural women’s contribution to agricultural productivity and food security,” said Mara Lopes, FAO Ukraine Head of Office. “Women and girls are critical agents in the fight against rural poverty and food insecurity. Supporting them in reaching their full potential will enable agricultural and rural development processes to be more effective.”

“The FAO report on Gender, Agriculture and Rural Development is an in-depth and comprehensive document covering gender issues in the context of different areas of women's and men's lives, including participation in decision-making, freedom from violence, the impact of climate change, access to resources such as land, water energy, education, health and more,” added Kateryna Levchenko, Government Commissioner for Gender Equality Policy. “This makes it a relevant source of information for all a wide range of users”.

However, the report finds that rural women in Ukraine are limited in their capacity to contribute to agricultural production and take advantage of new opportunities, being concentrated in informal jobs and overloaded by multiple responsibilities. These include unpaid informal work on family farms, daily housework, and caring for children and other family members. Despite the heavy workload, their effort is often invisible and receives little recognition or economic or social reward.

“Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many women across the region find themselves in an even more disadvantaged situation, as evidence points to increased rates of domestic violence and longer hours of care work due to the widespread closure of schools,” said Dono Abdurazakova, FAO Senior Gender and Social Protection Advisor. “Rural women with disabilities, women from ethnic minority groups such as Roma women, women who have been internally displaced, and many more, suffer from multiple vulnerabilities.”

One in every six people employed in Ukraine works in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The report reveals that specific job types within that sector tend to fall into either “female” or “male” occupation categories.

Men represent 71 percent of all formal employees in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, whereas women in the same sector tend to work informally. Women make up 56 percent of migrant labour in Ukraine as a whole, and 58 percent of migrant labour in rural areas. Men are more likely to migrate abroad, while women tend to migrate internally.

Unsurprisingly, only 20 percent of farming enterprises in Ukraine are headed by women. What is perhaps more surprising is that women generally undertake manual labour, such as cultivation, planting, weeding, and harvesting perishable vegetables, berries and herbs. Men, meanwhile, tend to undertake mechanised work such as tilling, ploughing and planting fodder crops, harvesting grain and corn (with combine harvesters), and transporting products to markets.

Men are more likely to engage in large-scale crop production (wheat, corn, sunflowers), while women typically focus on horticulture and herbs. The tendency towards distinct tasks is repeated within the livestock sector, with women active in dairy production and work associated with milking and care of cows, and men usually responsible for transportation and mechanised labour.

The report also goes into some detail on food, health and nutrition, broken down by the female and male experience in Ukraine. In terms of life expectancy, Ukrainian women live on average 10 years longer than men, and that gap is even more pronounced in rural communities (76.2 years compared with 65.6 years for men in 2019). This is a pattern reflected across all post-Soviet countries. In Western Europe, by comparison, female life expectancy exceeds that of their male counterparts by just five years.

Title: Conflict-related arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment in Ukraine must stop, says the new UN Human Rights Report
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
02 July 2021
“The prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is absolute. Torture can never be justified,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU). “Seven years since the outbreak of the conflict, it is unacceptable that such egregious human rights violation remain largely unaddressed,” Ms Bogner added.
The new report is based on analysis of over 1,300 individual cases of conflict-related arbitrary detention, including secret and incommunicado detention, and torture and ill-treatment, as well as conflict-related sexual violence, perpetrated by Government actors and by armed groups and other actors in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’ and self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’ (2) documented by HRMMU from 2014 to 2021.
The report sets out the scale of conflict-related detention as well as the prevalence and patterns of conflict-related arbitrary detention, and torture and ill-treatment on both sides of the contact line. It also covers the issue of accountability for violations, including remedy to victims. The report also presents two emblematic cases of places of detention where such violations occurred, in the Kharkiv regional department of the Security Service of Ukraine until 2016 (Annex I) and in the ‘Izoliatsiia’ detention facility in armed group-controlled Donetsk to date (Annex II).
The report estimates that around 4,000 conflict-related detainees suffered torture and ill-treatment from 2014 to 2021 (approx. 3,400 men and approx. 600 women), including an estimated 340 victims of sexual violence. Approximately 1,500 cases were perpetrated by Government actors and approximately 2,500 by armed groups and other actors in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’, according to the report.
From the beginning of the armed conflict, conflict-related detainees faced torture and ill-treatment by Government actors as well as armed groups and other actors in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’. However, the report finds that torture and ill-treatment became less common on both sides of the contact line after 2016. Despite this, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment continues to occur on both sides of the contact line and is systematically carried out in some places of detention in in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’.
The report highlights that both in Government-controlled territory and in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’, torture and ill-treatment, including conflict-related sexual violence, were used to extract confessions or information, as well as to humiliate and intimidate, and to extort money and property.
According to the report, the most common Government entity responsible for these violations was the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) as well as volunteer battalions at the initial stages of the conflict. In territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’, the main perpetrators of arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment at the initial stages of the conflict were various armed groups, and later, members of the ‘ministries of state security’.
The report highlights the prevailing impunity for perpetrators due to a lack of effective investigations into allegations of arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, including conflict-related sexual violence. This means that the right of victims to remedy and reparation for harm suffered remains largely unfulfilled.
“We have observed a lack of political will and motivation to investigate the cases allegedly perpetrated by Government actors, as well as misuse of procedures to avoid proper investigation of such cases,” explained Ms Bogner. “While we can count victims in the thousands, perpetrators brought to account only number in the dozens,” she added.
The report also provides recommendations addressed to the Government of Ukraine, self-proclaimed ‘republics’ and the international community on measures that need to be taken to stop ongoing violations, ensure accountability and adopt measures to prevent future violations.
In particular, the report urges the Government to effectively and promptly investigate the cases, regardless of the affiliation of the alleged perpetrator as well as put in place effective mechanisms of remedy for victims. It also urges self-proclaimed ‘republics’ to release all those arbitrarily detained without delay; to treat all persons deprived of their liberty humanely and according to international human rights and humanitarian law standards and to grant unimpeded confidential access to OHCHR and other independent international monitors to all places of detention, including to the ‘Izoliatsiia’ detention facility.

18 May 2021
“It is well known that traditional gender norms and stereotypes impede both an individuals` ability to reach their full potential and economic development of the societies, limiting women’s opportunities, career advancement and personal development. Men engagement is crucial for women’s empowerment and stable partner relations” - said Tetiana Shulha, Gender focal point at the European Union Delegation to Ukraine.
Participants from Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Moldova, Turkey, Serbia, USA, Sweden took part in the online forum. It served as a platform for experience exchange of men’s engagement initiatives in the Eastern partnership countries, international good practices of men's involvement into care work as well as showcase success of Ukrainian model of work with fathers – the Tatohubs initiative.
For instance, Tatohubs from Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Kramatorsk, Zaporizhia, Troitske and Myrnohrad shared their successes in building a network of fathers’ clubs in big and small cities, engaging fathers into edutainment activities like fishing, “Eco-Toloka” green activities, father’s yoga etc and becoming local centres of fathers’ education, where psychologists conduct group and personal sessions and become allies in fathering. Georgia presented another format of men’s engagement – MenCare Georgia Communication Campaign and Fathers’ Schools piloted at reproductive health centres. Moldova introduced models and programmes for fathers based at schools and youth centres.
“As we strive to progress in building demographic resilience and socio-economic recovery, we must acknowledge the central role that gender equality plays for achieving both goals. This partnership brings together the EU, UN Women and UNFPA to focus on gender-responsive family policies, men-engagement and promotion of more equal distribution of unpaid domestic and care work. Over the past few months we have witnessed many steps taken to address these issues: the adoption of the new law on paternity leave, the Decree of the President of Ukraine on urgent actions of GBV prevention, and the development of comprehensive gender equality programs in several cities. At UNFPA we welcome such developments and are committed to continue working with our partners until we achieve full equality between men and women”, Jaime Nadal, UNFPA Ukraine Representative said.
International experience is crucial while establishing new models of men engagement and advancing gender equality. NGOs Promundo (USA), MÄN (Sweden) and AÇEV (Turkey) together with UNFPA Turkey presented their findings and achievements on work with men in their countries and globally.
Background information:
This initiative is announced in the framework of the “EU 4 Gender Equality: Together against gender stereotypes and gender-based violence” project, funded by the European Union, implemented jointly by UN Women and UNFPA. It seeks to strengthen equal rights and opportunities for women and men by shifting social perceptions around gender roles, tackling gender stereotypes and increasing men’s participation in childcare and other domestic responsibilities. The project lasts from 2020 till 2023.
UNFPA Ukraine is working on promoting responsible fatherhood and men participation in household chores and caretaking of children. Starting from 2020, 3 father’s clubs - in Kyiv, Odesa and Vinnytsia have been launched.

Title: The Japanese government is allocating $ 4.5 million to support the conflict-affected population in eastern Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 May 2021
These include providing medical humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, helping communities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to reduce the impact of COVID-19, delivering humanitarian assistance, and protecting internally displaced persons and people living near the contact line in government-controlled areas of Ukraine, as well as providing immediate help and rehabilitation during emergencies in Ukraine.
At the press conference held today in the Cabinet of Ministers, Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov, in particular, stressed:
"First, on behalf of the Ministry of Reintegration, the Government and the people of Ukraine, I would like to thank the Government of Japan and our international partners - the ICRC and the UN - for their unwavering and consistent support to Ukraine at all levels, in particular for humanitarian aid provided to Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, some parts of which are still under occupation, where people suffer from the effects of Russia's armed aggression, and where national and international humanitarian law is being violated on a daily basis. What the Government of Japan and our international partners are doing today is for the people, for the sake of people and about the people, and we will work in partnership with you to ensure a normal human life for all those who are in the war zone today.”
He reminded that last year the Government of Japan allocated $ 4.23 million to support Donetsk and Luhansk regions under various UN and ICRC programs. "Japan, together with the UN and the ICRC, is already implementing a number of important projects: more than 400 houses affected by the fighting have been restored in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Projects in the field of youth, education and community development were implemented, emergency care was provided within the health care system of servicemen in Ukraine, etc. This year we can refer to the implementation of projects worth $ 4.5 million. "Once again, I sincerely thank you and look forward to meeting with the Ambassador and Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihide Suga at the celebration of Ukraine's Independence Day and the inaugural summit of the Crimean Platform in Kyiv," Oleksiy Reznikov added.
In his turn, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to Ukraine Takashi Kurai shared information about the activities to which the funds will be directed to:
“I am very pleased to announce new assistance projects in the year of Ukraine's 30th anniversary of independence. Japan and Ukraine share the common democratic value and interests: welcoming our shared value, Japan stands firm on the position of supporting the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We also support and respect Ukraine's strategic direction to pursue the European integration and Euro Atlantic Alliance.
Japan, the Ukrainian government, and international community have been working side-by-side to help implement reforms towards further democratization and economic development of this country for the last three decades. Since its independence, Japan's assistance to Ukraine has reached 3.1 billion USD, including 1.88 billion USD since the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. We believe our assistance will contribute to Ukraine’s structural reforms and realizing its goals.”- stated the Ambassador of Japan to Ukraine.
UN resident coordinator Osnat Lubrani also noted the critical need for the assistance, funded by the Japanese government.
«Such support is vitally needed at a time when COVID-19 is exacerbating the already difficult situation of families and communities living on both sides of the contact line in eastern Ukraine, where the conflict is entering its 7th year. Three projects of UN Agencies - IOM, UNOPS and UNHCR - being funded thanks to Japan’s generosity and adopt the right set of approaches to address the needs in the east of the country in a holistic, multi-dimensional approach.
The projects will focus on a myriad of areas to mitigate against the impact that range from humanitarian interventions, such as providing emergency shelter kits and supporting voluntary relocation of conflict-affected persons away from the ‘contact line’, strengthening health care facilities, but also enabling development and social inclusion through programming, such as generating employment through income generation schemes and implementing community support initiatives.
Despite the current humanitarian challenges and COVID-19 pandemic, the UN continues to provide strong support for the conflict-affected population of Ukraine.
The head of the ICRC in Ukraine, Florence Gillette, mentioned that the ICRC's funds provided by Japan, which amounted to 1 million USD this year, has significantly supported the work of the organization in Ukraine on both sides of the contact line:
“Within the last three years have been repaired more than 13’500 houses on either side of the line of contact. In 2021, ICRC plans to help more than 3’700 households to live in more dignified conditions after their dwelling was damaged by hostilities.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, the ICRC distributed more than 300 oxygen concentrators to treat COVID19 patients, including 107 in 2021 to-date. It contributed hundreds of thousands of PPE to health and emergency staff on either side of the line of contact so that they could attend to the needs of the population. More than 60 primary health care centres do receive support from the ICRC, in addition to more than 30 hospitals. Support to repair, maintain and upgrade medical infrastructure continues; in 2021, it will support structures with more than 3’000 beds.
It also supported the places of detention and the penitentiary systems in either side of the line of contact to reinforce their prevention and response plan to the pandemic through technical advice and in-kind donations. Last week only, 9000 hygiene parcels were distributed to places of detention throughout the country. Japan also supports economic security, mine risk awareness and house rehabilitation”. – Ms. Gillette said.

Title: 7 years with no answers. What is lacking in the investigations of the events in odesa on 2 May 2014?
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
30 April 2021
After the end of the Maidan protests in Kyiv, Odesa anti-Maidan groups – critical of the newly established central Government – called for the federalization of Ukraine, while Maidan supporters opposed this.
Tensions in Odesa increased after 19 February 2014, when a group of ‘pro-unity’ protesters and local journalists were attacked by organized groups in front of the Odesa Regional State Administration. During March and April 2014, however, the two opposing groups held rallies in Odesa every week without significant violence.
On 2 May 2014, around 300 well-organised ‘pro-federalism’ supporters attacked a march of about 2,000 ‘pro-unity’ protesters,  including local residents and a large number of football fans known for their strong ’pro-unity’ position, who had arrived from Kharkiv for the football game that was taking place later that day. Clashes between the two groups broke out in the city centre, lasting several hours. Both groups used firearms, resulting in six people being shot and killed (four on the ‘pro-federalism’ side, and two on ‘pro-unity’ side). We were present on the scene and witnessed how the ‘pro-federalism’ groups began throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at the participants of the unity march. The situation spiralled out of control as the police failed to respond effectively to violence from both sides, even though they had been warned in advance of the high possibility of violence.
The presence of ‘pro-unity’ groups was overpowering in numbers and forced the ‘pro-federalism’ groups to scatter: some sought refuge at the top of a shopping centre close to where the clashes were taking place, others ran to a camp they had set up at Kulykove Pole square. While a large group of ‘pro-unity’ supporters marched towards Kulykove Pole, openly demonstrating their aggressive attitude, the police failed to respond, neither restraining the aggressive crowd nor securing the square.
When they arrived, the ‘pro-unity’ individuals destroyed the camp and the ‘pro-federalism’ supporters barricaded themselves in the House of Trade Unions. Mission’s staff saw both sides throwing stones and Molotov cocktails and heard the sounds of gunshots coming from both sides, and then saw the House of Trade Unions on fire. Firefighters from the State Emergency Service (SES) responded with significant delay to numerous emergency calls made by eyewitnesses, including one of our colleagues. By the time they arrived, some forty-five minutes after the first call, forty-two people had lost their lives (34 men, 7 women and a boy). In the absence of the emergency services, we observed some ‘pro-unity’ supporters assisting their trapped opponents to leave the burning building. However, some of those saved from the building were then heavily beaten by the crowd.
Only one person has been charged with murder. This member of a ‘pro-unity’ group is accused of firing a lethal shot that killed a member of the ‘pro-federalism’ groups during the clashes in the city centre. The alleged shooter was identified quickly and arrested on 18 May 2014, however the case has seen little progress, with multiple recusals of judges, disruption of hearings by the defendant’s supporters, and 18  months lost as the prosecution revised the charges. Over the last two years, systemic problems in the judiciary, including the lack of judges and underfunding of courts, as well as COVID-19-related restrictions, have further slowed the trial.
The police have not identified those responsible for the killings of the other five men during the clashes in the city centre. Instead of focusing on identifying the perpetrators of the murders, the police concentrated its efforts on investigating and prosecuting ‘pro-federalism’ supporters for their participation in clashes. The most notable criminal case, highlighting the partiality and bias of the investigation and prosecution, is the case against 19 alleged ‘pro-federalism’ supporters charged with participating in the unrest in the city centre. In September 2017, the court acquitted the 19 men accused, stressing the ineffective investigation and the biased and politically-motivated prosecution of the alleged ‘pro-federalism’ supporters. Recently, Mykolaiv Court of Appeal considering the prosecution appeal on the verdict has placed the case on hold, while they look for some of defendants who have systematically failed to appear for hearings.
In relation to the fire in the House of Trade Unions, while there were investigations into who started the fires, there were no results and no charges have been laid against the supporters of either group.  Instead, the investigation focused on the role of the police in ensuring the safety of people and preventing violence (which started in the city centre), and on the role of the SES officers and officials, who failed to adequately react to emergency calls and deploy firefighters to the scene. None of the court proceedings regarding the role of police or SES officials have been completed. The COVID-19-related slowdown of trials has contributed to further protracting these proceedings.
Victims deserve justice. Crimes should be prosecuted and perpetrators should be brought to account regardless of their political opinions.
In relation to the 2 May 2014 violence, Ukraine is obliged – by the regional and international human rights treaties Ukraine is a party to –  to identify, prosecute and bring to account those responsible for the deaths of 48 persons. The authorities must also ensure equal and effective access for all victims and their families to justice and adequate, effective and prompt reparation for harm suffered.
When authorities fail to investigate human rights violations, people are forced to seek justice through other avenues. In a series of recent judgments by the European Court of Human Rights on the Maidan protests, Ukraine was found to be in breach of its obligation to investigate and prosecute human rights violations and was ordered to pay compensation to the victims. Such findings negatively impact Ukraine’s international reputation.
The prosecution of perpetrators and remedying harm also helps to prevent the recurrence of violations. Finally, the truth uncovered during criminal proceedings can serve as a strong basis for reconciliation efforts.
Our monitoring of the trials related to the 2 May 2014 cases has raised particular concerns regarding the criminal proceedings involving those who participated in the clashes.
The court itself found that the investigation in the case of 19 ‘pro-federalism’ supporters was biased. The authorities only investigated the misconduct of the ‘pro-federalists’ during the clashes and not the misconduct of ‘pro-unity’ supporters.
We have also observed a lack of security and safety for judges and other legal professionals threatened and attacked by ‘pro-unity’ supporters, attempting to influence their decisions or conduct in criminal cases related to the 2 May events. In order to ensure that the members of the ‘pro-federalism’ movement, tried for creating public disorder in the city centre, remained in detention, ‘pro-unity’ supporters attempted to force judges to take decisions to this end. For example, on 27 November 2015, after the trial court released five ‘pro-federalism’ defendants on bail. Following aggressive demands of the ‘pro-unity’ supporters, the prosecution appealed the judge’s decision to grant bail, although it was not provided by the legislation at that time. Three days later, some 50 men prevented the appeal court judge from leaving his office until he initiated the appeal proceedings, and police did nothing to unblock the judge’s room and simply watched what was happening. The same day, ‘pro-unity’ supporters also refused to allow the trial court judges, who had granted the defendants’ release on bail, to leave the courtroom until they signed resignation letters, which, however, they withdrew the next day. In the case of the ‘pro-unity’ supporter accused of killing a supporter of the ‘pro-federalism’ movement, other members of the ‘pro-unity’ movement violently disrupted hearings and verbally abused judges at hearings in order for the case against him to be dropped. The police again did not ensure security of the courtrooms or investigate the interference into justice.
Members of ‘pro-unity’ groups also threatened to kill a lawyer representing ‘pro-federalism’ supporters. Later, as a result of a clash outside the court with a mob of ‘pro-unity’ supporters, the lawyer sustained a fractured finger. Even though some of these incidents occurred in the presence of the police, were caught on camera or perpetrators were identified by victims or witnesses of the attacks, the respective investigations simply remained open without any tangible progress. Impunity for such attacks has understandably affected judges and lawyers’ sense of security, thereby jeopardizing their independence.
A broader sense of intimidation and impunity was also created by attacks against relatives.  ‘Pro-unity’ groups attacked relatives of the victims of the fire at the House of Trade Unions during commemoration events in 2014-2016. The attacks, combined with the police’s failure to ensure security of the commemoration and to investigate such incidents, create an impression that ‘pro-federalism’ supporters are less protected than others in Odesa. The lack of a sense of security, of visible progress and of broad public demand for justice in these cases has led to victims’ relatives losing hope and interest in participating in the court hearings, which in many cases proved the only effective means to ensure some progress toward justice.
Trials fail to progress mainly due to a lack of political will. Arguments about the complexity of the case or difficulties in getting victims to attend the trials cannot be excuses seven years after the events. The lack of security for judges has also contributed to their reluctance to adjudicate such cases. This can be seen in the case against the 19 ‘pro-federalism’ supporters, which was passed between all four district courts of Odesa before finally being sent to a court outside Odesa three years after the case was referred to trial. Similarly, between June 2015 and January 2017, the case against the only ‘pro-unity’ supporter was passed between all four district courts in Odesa, which resulted in a further delay in the trial of more than a year and a half.
Several individuals prosecuted in relation to the 2 May events have managed to flee abroad, to Crimea, Ukraine, occupied by the Russian Federation, or to territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’ in eastern Ukraine and remain out of reach of Ukrainian justice. They include high level officials from the police and the SES, as well as ‘pro-federalism’ supporters. In October 2014, Parliament introduced a procedure for in absentia prosecution, which allows for the prosecution of fugitives in their absence.
However, under the Criminal Procedure Code, those convicted in absentia are not entitled to an in-person retrial of their case, which is required by international human rights standards. Countries they flee to may, therefore, lawfully refuse to extradite them to Ukraine. Unless amendments are made to the Criminal Procedure Code to rectify this, all efforts taken to prosecute perpetrators of human rights violations in Ukraine will be in vain, for the verdicts delivered in absentia will likely be unenforceable.
In order to avoid further delays in the 2 May trials, courts should grant them priority status. Judges and parties to the proceedings, including prosecutors, lawyers and relatives of victims, should enjoy a sufficient level of security, including in the courtrooms, to allow the trials effectively to proceed. In order to ensure the transparency and impartiality of ongoing investigations, the Office of the Prosecutor General should consider transferring them from Odesa to Kyiv.
Moreover, the lack of progress in the appeal proceedings against 19 ‘pro-federalism’ supporters for the past three years due to the failure of the court and police to compel attendance of the defendants, makes us wonder whether we will ever find out who was responsible for the clashes that eventually ended with the loss of 48 human lives.
Seven years on, it may seem that the obstacles are insurmountable and no further results could be expected. But progress is possible. We have seen in the past year, for example, some significant advancements in the investigation of the Maidan events in Kyiv, including the identification of individuals now charged with causing the deaths of protesters and a person, who died in the fire at the Party of Regions office. Moreover, history is strewn with examples of prosecutions that have happened even decades after grave human rights violations took place. Trials in absentia are also possible. Although the punitive aspect of such trials may be disputed, they can help to bring justice to victims, allow for compensation, foster reconciliation, create a historical record and deter future crimes.
Ultimately, what is needed is the political will to ensure justice in these cases.The seventh anniversary is the perfect occasion for the authorities to take firm action to move forward on accountability in relation to the 2 May 2014 events and to show that the rule of law is a guiding principle in Ukraine, rather than a biased system based on political positions.
The courts should prioritize these cases to demonstrate that accountability can be achieved, irrespective of the affiliation of the alleged perpetrators. Parliament should also amend the Criminal Procedure Code to enable those who fled Ukraine to be tried in absentia in full compliance with their right to retrial, thereby allowing for their future extradition.
All victims deserve justice and Ukraine deserves the rule of law.

Title: UNDP and ILO launch a joint pilot project to promote women economic empowerment
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
27 April 2021
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine together with the International Labor Organization (ILO) presented a new joint pilot project called “Economic Empowerment of Women as a Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in Ukraine.”
The project aims to contribute to a sustainable recovery of living standards of the COVID-19 crisis-affected population in Ukraine by promoting and supporting women’s economic empowerment. This is to be done by improving the relevant institutional frameworks, and increasing economic opportunities to improve women’s livelihoods. The project will be implemented in two target regions of Ukraine – Rivne and Sumy oblasts.
UNDP Resident Representative to Ukraine Dafina Gercheva speaking at the launch of the joint project, said that it aims to address shortcomings that were exposed by the pandemic, and to scale up efforts to support vulnerable groups.
“The promotion of women’s economic empowerment is a crucial step that brings us closer to gender equality,” Gercheva said.
“I’m confident that this project will serve as a starting point for a great partnership, promoting equal economic opportunities, and supporting women’s economic resilience – despite the formidable challenges the current crisis is posing.”
Director of the ILO Office for Central and Eastern Europe, Markus Pilgrim, noted that access to the labour market is a key issue in Ukraine – 36 percent of women between 15-64 years are outside the labour force.
“The pandemic sharpened the existing problems of the Ukrainian labour market,” Pilgrim said.
“In times of crisis, entrepreneurship constitutes an important and sometimes unique opportunity for women to get out of poverty, but could also lead to further improvements – decent employment, gender equality and economic empowerment.”
During the presentation of the joint initiative, Regional Development Programme Manager UNDP in Ukraine Mustafa Sait-Ametov and Technical Officer for Enterprise Development and Job Creation at the ILO Office for Central and Eastern Europe, Judith Dongus, provided an insightful overview of the joint pilot project.
“This project is all about promoting gender equality and women empowerment at all levels, including national, sub-national and community levels,” said Sait-Ametov. “Overall, the project aims to contribute to a sustainable recovery of living standards of the COVID-19 crisis-affected population in Ukraine.”
The joint project has a total of four activities with several sub-activities, holistically addressing the topic on the macro-, meso-, and micro levels. Besides several events to encourage inclusive policy dialogue, four local communities and two Business Membership Organisations will be supported to strengthen their portfolio to support women-led businesses.
Dongus said that the project would provide 100 women with training to advance their entrepreneurial skills by applying modules of the world’s largest entrepreneurship development programme.
“Of the 100 women, 60 bankable business plans should be developed,” she said. “Afterwards, 25 women entrepreneurs will receive mentoring assistance to certify their business or other related activities. Furthermore, 25 micro-, small and medium enterprises are selected to receive e-commerce training in the target oblasts. This will allow the businesses to become more resilient through access to digital markets.”
More details of the joint pilot project can be found in the recordings of the presentation in Ukrainian and English.

Title: Most Ukrainians are ready to be vaccinated against COVID-19: UNICEF study
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 April 2021
The study shows that Ukrainians do not only know about the disease from the news: for many COVID-19 has already been experienced in person. Thus, 82 per cent of respondents said that they had faced the disease in their neighbourhood, and 22 per cent indicated that they had been ill themselves, while 43 per cent of respondents said that the disease had had serious consequences for themselves or for their inner circles. (graph 1)
More than two-thirds (71 per cent) of the respondents consider the pandemic to be a threat to themselves and their families. Among those over the age of 60, this figure is even higher at 81 per cent. (graph 2)
Most Ukrainians consider vaccination to be an effective way to protect themselves from COVID-19. If it was possible to be vaccinated for free from COVID-19, 63 per cent of respondents would like to do so, but 31 per cent would only do so with certain vaccines. The older generation is more willing: 71 per cent of those over 60 would agree to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for free. (graph 3)
Ukrainians believe that the main reasons for being vaccinated against COVID-19 are (graph 4):
“The findings of the study will be useful for the policy makers who are conducting COVID-19 vaccination campaigns,” comments Lotta Sylwander, Head of the UNICEF Representation in Ukraine. “For example, we see an interesting fact: 67 per cent of elderly people would advise their relatives to be vaccinated against COVID-19 free of charge (graph 5). This means that people over the age of 60 could become vaccination ambassadors, and persuade relatives, friends, and acquaintances to get vaccinated.”
According to the survey, family doctors enjoy a high level of authority: overall, 64 per cent of Ukrainians and 72 per cent of people over the age of 60 follow their family doctor’s advice when making decisions about vaccination (graph 6). “We have seen already for quite some time that Ukrainians trust their doctors on matters regarding vaccination,” said Anna Sukhodolska, Chief of Communication for Development Section at UNICEF Ukraine. “Hence it is extremely important that family doctors talk to their patients about vaccination, guided only by the principles of evidence-based medicine.”
The study also shows the confidence among Ukrainians in routine vaccination. As a whole, 78 per cent of Ukrainians agree while 84 per cent of people over the age of 60 are more likely to agree with the statement (graph 7) “it is important for a child to be vaccinated and have immunizations”.
About 70 per cent of respondents believe that vaccination is effective in preventing dangerous diseases and 63 per cent consider it to be safe (graphs 8,9). This means that most people in Ukraine understand the need for vaccinations to protect themselves and their children from dangerous diseases like tuberculosis, tetanus, measles, diphtheria, and pertussis.
“For many years, UNICEF in Ukraine has been working on behaviour changes in immunization of children and adults, so we are certainly happy to see such high level of trust towards vaccination,” concludes Lotta Sylwander. “Last year became a stark reminder of the role vaccines play in protecting everybody in the world. Today, vaccination is our greatest hope for overcoming the pandemic and restoring our usual way of life.”
More details about the graphs (in Ukrainian) and results of the study can be found at: https://cutt.ly/NvD35te.
The study was conducted by telephone interviews (calls to mobile phones lasting up to 15 minutes). 2,027 people over the age of 18 were interviewed in all regions of Ukraine, except for the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions not controlled by the Government. The sample is representative of the adult population of Ukraine and corresponds to the data of the State Statistics Service as of 1 January 2020 by sex, age, size of settlement, and region.

Title: The campaign against gender stereotypes #NOMOREGRINGE kicked off on TikTok in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
16 April 2021
TikTok recognized the Ukrainian campaign #NOMOREGRINGE as an impactful and influential project. Officially, 15 most popular TikTokers of Ukraine, 15 opinion leaders from business, public sector, television, and more joined the campaign. They chose the theme of their video from a collection of more than a hundred common stereotypes. Their bias-eliminating videos are available on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, with the official hashtags of the #GRINGE, #NOMOREGRINGE campaign.
The #NOMOREGRINGE hashtag is a neologism originating from the slang word Cringe, a feeling of embarrassment and shame, and the letter "G" from the English word "gender". Gringe is a shame and embarrassment that you feel when someone applies gender stereotypes or voices them.
The very idea of implementing the project arose after a survey of 175 teenagers aged 13-19 years from 25 cities of Ukraine, that was conducted within the framework of the program "EU for Gender Equality: Together Against Gender Stereotypes and Gender-Based Violence", with the support of the EU in conjunction with UN Women and UNFPA. 66.3% of them experienced gender bias towards themselves, 47.3% faced discrimination in various forms, while 53% of Ukrainian teenagers would like to learn more about gender equality issues so to recognize and struggle with gender stereotypes.
"Deep seated discriminatory norms, stereotypes and prejudice remain pervasive, thus holding back women and girls from realizing their rights. We all learn very early on the expectations and limitations of our gender roles, and they are deeply embedded in our social, political and economic structures. Definitely the changes will happen, not overnight, but incrementally and steadily", – comments Erika Kvapilova, UN Women Ukraine Country Representative.
The problem of stereotypes in society is much deeper than individual reactions in response to societal pressure. "A woman has no place in business or IT", "Didn't fight - not a man", "Men don't take good care of children, it's a mother's job, not a father's", "Cooking is only for women". This artificial distribution of gender roles has a very negative impact on society, political, and economic progress as a whole. People feel ashamed, have to comply with social expectations, and fail to be their true selves. Society, in turn, loses so many talents that could be manifested in various fields and areas.
"Biases, prejudices and, as a result, discrimination, create toxicity, reduce productivity, creativity and innovative potential of people and systems. The first step in overcoming any problem is its recognition. That is why we launched the project that, with the voices of 30 influencers from different fields and generations, will show the rudimentary perceptions that influence the behavior of millions of people, - comments Iryna Rubis, founder of Biasless and author of #NOMOREGRINGE.

Opinion leaders, business leaders, TV presenters and actors also joined the campaign, including:
Hector Jimenez-Bravo, Judge of the MasterChef project; Andriy Pyshny, Chairman of the Board of the OschadBank (2014 -2020), founder of the NGO "Vidchui"; Monroe, TV presenter, blogger, public figure; Dmytro Shchebetyuk, public figure, founder of Dostupno.UA; Hryhoriy Reshetnik, TV presenter ("The Bachelor", "The Bachelororette"), actor; Yana Brenzey, host of "Vikna-News"; Julia Zoriy, host of "Morning in the big city"; Volodymyr Yaroslavsky, co-owner of the restaurant “LUCKY”, judge of the MasterChef Ukraine project; Oleksandra Kucherenko, host of "Morning in the Big City"; Oksana Gutzeit, journalist, radio and TV presenter; Serhiy Kostyra, host of the "One for All" project; Olena Voznesenska, actress; Albina Pererva, actress; Olga Martynovska, Judge "Master Chef.

Title: UN in Ukraine launched a Policy Paper on social protection with a focus on pensions within a high-level international conference
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 April 2021
This document – recommendatory in nature, belongs to series of policy papers on key issues for Ukraine, developed by UN and intended to provide policy recommendations for the government of Ukraine and other relevant stakeholders such as civil society, private sector, to improve the social protection system.
The online conference took place within the series of Hernan Santa Cruz Dialogues, held by UN in countries across the globe, aimed to raise awareness and stimulate discussions to advance the realization of socio-economic rights in national settings to enhance economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development. The online event was joined by high-level guests both from the Ukraine’s Government and the global UN organizations, to initiate a national dialogue on social protection in Ukraine, with a specific focus on the pension reform to spur national debate and encourage policymaking in line with the UN global best practices, outlining policy recommendations specific for Ukraine.
Ms. Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, in particular, explained the importance of developing such set of recommendations on pensions, in view of the current situation in Ukraine:
“The ‘pension’ policy paper underlines significant avenues for improving Ukraine’s social protection system, especially in times of COVID-19 that did reveal limitations of the existing social security system as, for instance, workers in the informal economy fell out from coverage by the existing schemes. During previous months the UN discussed with the Government of Ukraine recently adopted National Economic Strategy 2030, that places significant emphasis on the long-discussed pension reform. That is why we decided to focus today on pensions and contribute UN expertise and recommendations to hopefully inform the planned national reform. Today we need to discuss the important steps that should be implemented in order to take into consideration in the course of the pension and social protection reform.”
Pensioners, who are one of the most vulnerable group in Ukraine, today are making 27% of the total population (11 million people). 80% of them receive pensions below the subsistence budget, while 20% of pensioners (above 2 million) have disabilities and require additional assistance.
Ms. Maryna Lazebna, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine raised the crucial issues regarding pension protection in Ukraine:
"Majority of the people receive low pensions, and it is definitely a matter of justice. Today, almost 60% of our pensioners receive a pension below 3,000 hryvnias. In 2003, a three-tier pension system was introduced in Ukraine, i.e. corresponding laws were adopted. Solidarity system, existing today in the country - it works. Accumulative one, the second level, was not introduced in the country, only the voluntary level works, and again, due to the lack of attention of the authorities to this level, we are facing the fact that only 9% of the number of insured persons use voluntary accumulations which is about 1 million people. This is very low numbers and it also exposes a lack of efforts by the government, insufficient attention of the government to the development of voluntary accumulations," - said the Minister.
Ms. Lazebna also reminded that currently in Ukraine 13 million working Ukrainians pay contributions to the Pension Fund of Ukraine in favor of 11 million pensioners.
In her turn, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reiterated that Social protection is a fundamental human right and an essential tool for reducing poverty: “Taking immediate steps to build a better, more comprehensive social protection system is crucial to providing immediate, life-changing assistance – and to longer-term recovery from this crisis”.
Pensioners in the non-government controlled areas (NGCA) in eastern Ukraine have had particular problems accessing their pensions as they need to travel to the GCA to access them. By 2019, some 600,000 pensioners in NGCA had lost access to their pensions due to movement restrictions and complex administrative requirements.
“It is essential that older people who are internally displaced, or whose lives have been otherwise impacted by the conflict, be able to access the pensions which are their right. – continued Ms. Bachelet - Human rights analysis can help reforms address the multiple dimensions of discrimination and inequality that generate poverty – and can provide practical guidance to make people and their well-being the priority. The UN policy paper on social protection, which is being issued today, is one such tool”.
In 2020, a further 270,000 NGCA residents have been unable to make their pension withdrawals inside the GCA due to restrictions on crossing the line of contact. Yet, these pensions are vital for humanitarian reasons and important for the purpose of peacebuilding and social cohesion.
During the conference the ILO Director-General Mr. Guy Ryder outlined his vision for achieving better social protection in Ukraine: “Ukraine is now facing a crucial choice in deciding the future of its pension system. To create a solid pension system, all key stakeholders – the Government, trade unions and employers – must be willing to negotiate. International Labour Standards can provide clear guidance on how to consolidate a better system. At the ILO, we will support all your efforts to achieve comprehensive and sustainable social protection for all. We’ll be there every step of the way to make sure Ukraine can build a better future for all its citizens”.
UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine also expressed concern that in relatively near future Ukraine may face significant economic cost due to demographic decline. Ukraine’s population is projected to fall by 20% by 2050, with a significant increase in the 65+ population, noted Ms Lubrani. The expected sharp increase in the age-dependency ratio, puts pension system sustainability at significant risk. Beyond necessary pension reform, labor policies need to significantly improve to allow investment in life-long learning and continuous improvement of meaningful employment opportunities.
The Dialogues, one of which took place today in Ukraine, are based on the vision and mission of Chilean delegate to the UN Hernán Santa Cruz, one of the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Ukraine is the 2nd country in the world to organize such dialogue and addresses the right to social security and, in particular, the pension reform.

Title: UN in Ukraine is launching its Policy Paper on Social Protection in Ukraine, with pensions in focus
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 April 2021
Ukraine’s social protection system is characterized by low coverage and limited access for the poorest and socially excluded, insufficient quality and gender-responsiveness of social services and growing funding deficits. COVID-19 had a severe impact on existing challenges, affecting in particular people in the most vulnerable situations.
The event aims to highlight policy recommendations for the Government of Ukraine and other relevant stakeholders and facilitate a dialogue on social protection, with a specific focus on pension reform to spur national debate and encourage policymaking on this issue that is compliant with international human rights standards.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, and the Director-General of the International Labour Organization, Mr. Guy Ryder, will join the event via video addresses.
Ms. Maryna Lazebna, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine, national and international experts from international organization, civil society, parliament and trade union representatives will discuss the highlights and recommendations of the UN Policy Paper on Social Protection and key aspects to take under consideration when reforming the pension system in Ukraine.
The event is a part of The Hernan Santa Cruz Dialogues, addressed to raise awareness and stimulate discussions within communities to strengthen the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. The event is organized by the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office.

Title: Nearly half of all women are denied their bodily autonomy, says new UNFPA report, My Body is My Own
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 April 2021
Nearly half of women in 57 developing countries are denied the right to decide whether to have sex with their partners, use contraception or seek health care, according to UNFPA's 2021 flagship State of World Population report, released today.
For the first time, a United Nations report focuses on bodily autonomy: the power and agency to make choices about your body, without fear of violence or having someone else decide for you. This lack of bodily autonomy has massive implications beyond the profound harms to individual women and girls: potentially depressing economic productivity, undercutting skills, and resulting in extra costs to health care and judicial systems.
Key findings: my body, but not my choice
Through this groundbreaking report, UNFPA is measuring both women’s power to make their own decisions about their bodies and the extent to which countries’ laws support or interfere with a woman’s right to make these decisions. The data show a strong link between decision-making power and higher levels of education. The report shows that in countries where data are available:
● Only 55 per cent of women are fully empowered to make choices over health care, contraception and the ability to say yes or no to sex.
● Only 71 per cent of countries guarantee access to overall maternity care.
● Only 75 per cent of countries legally ensure full, equal access to contraception.
● Only about 80 per cent of countries have laws supporting sexual health and well-being.
● Only about 56 per cent of countries have laws and policies supporting comprehensive sexuality education.
“The fact that nearly half of women still cannot make their own decisions about whether or not to have sex, use contraception or seek health care should outrage us all,” says UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. “In essence, hundreds of millions of women and girls do not own their own bodies. Their lives are governed by others.” The report also documents many other ways that the bodily autonomy of women, men, girls and boys is violated, revealing that:
● Twenty countries or territories have “marry-your-rapist” laws, where a man can escape criminal prosecution if he marries the woman or girl he has raped. ● Forty-three countries have no legislation addressing the issue of marital rape (rape by a spouse).
● More than 30 countries restrict women’s right to move around outside the home.
● Girls and boys with disabilities are nearly three times more likely to be subjected to sexual violence, with girls at the greatest risk.
Solutions: the power to say yes, the right to say no
The report shows how efforts to address abuses can lead to further violations of bodily autonomy. For example, to prosecute a case of rape, a criminal justice system might require a survivor to undergo an invasive so-called virginity test.
Real solutions, the report finds, must take into account the needs and experiences of those affected. In Mongolia, for example, persons with disabilities organized to give direct input to the government about their sexual and reproductive health needs. In Angola, young people educated about their bodies, health and rights have been able to seek health care, use family planning, decline sex and petition for justice after sexual violence.
“The denial of bodily autonomy is a violation of women and girls’ fundamental human rights that reinforces inequalities and perpetuates violence arising from gender discrimination,” says Dr. Kanem “It is nothing less than an annihilation of the spirit, and it must stop.
“By contrast,” Dr. Kanem says, “a woman who has control over her body is more likely to be empowered in other spheres of her life. She gains not only in terms of autonomy, but also through advances in health and education, income and safety. She is more likely to thrive, and so is her family.”
The State of World Population report is UNFPA’s annual flagship publication. Published yearly since 1978, it shines a light on emerging issues in the field of sexual and reproductive health and rights, bringing them into the mainstream and exploring the challenges and opportunities they present for international development.
Notes to editors
As the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA helps people obtain contraception and life-saving reproductive health services and information and empowers women and girls to make informed decisions about their bodies and lives.

Title: UNICEF and the IT Ukraine Association created the world’s first VR product to protect children from mines and explosive weapons
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 April 2021
This April, in areas contaminated with explosives, UNICEF will launch this new tool during risk-education sessions in schools with the support of the German and Italian governments. Training sessions will help the children to consolidate the knowledge they receive at the regular lessons in an entertaining way. The training on VR will cover regions affected by the conflict, as well as Dnipro, Zaporizhia and Kharkiv regions, which host ammunition depots and IDPs.
The VR has been built as a journey to teach the user in an entertaining format the rules of safe behaviour with explosive objects. The product is designed for three target audiences: primary, secondary and high school students, as well as for parents and teachers; and offers different features to different groups of users. For example, a version for primary school children has a guide: a character who is already familiar to children from the Super Team Against Mines, a comic book developed by UNICEF as part of explosive ordnance risk education. The guide acts as a helper for the school students, provides tips and accompanies the hero throughout the journey. At the beginning and end of the VR experience, the user takes a special test that measures how informative and useful the VR product has been.
The project was developed by UNICEF and IT Ukraine Association with the participation of a child and family psychologist, and with technical expertise engaged from the HALO Trust, UNICEF’s international NGO partner in delivering the educational sessions. WeAR Studio and MacPaw are technical partners of the project. WeAR Studio has developed the virtual reality software, while MacPaw has provided the VR glasses that give children access to it.
“Since the outbreak of the conflict in eastern Ukraine that is approaching its sad seven-year anniversary, 186 children have died or been injured by mines and explosive ordnance. UNICEF and its partners are continuing risk education about explosive ordnance for children. At the same time, it remains challenging for us to find formats that will be of interest to modern children, and how we get the vital message across to children. Virtual reality is becoming the latest technology that helps shape children’s behaviour through entertainment and consolidate the knowledge gained during lessons,” said Lotta Sylwander, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine. “We look forward to developing the partnership with IT Ukraine Association, as this could be crucial for the well-being of children and  their families in a ‘new’ emerging reality that has faced not only conflicts but also the pandemic challenges.”
“IT Ukraine’s cooperation with UNICEF clearly demonstrates the importance of pooling experience, expertise and resources to address complex social issues. The Mine Awareness VR has no analogues in the world and we hope that very soon, it will be piloted in Ukraine and will prove effective and help save lives around the world. VR makes it possible to individually complete tasks when nobody distracts children and does not interfere with the learning process. We are sure that for most students, it will be their first VR experience, so we hope it will be successful,” said Konstiantyn Vasiuk, CEO of IT Ukraine Association.
A total of 73 respondents of different ages from Luhansk and Donetsk regions took part in testing the VR product, and it proved effective. The testing involved school students, parents and teachers living in the following settlements – Komyshuvakha, Lysychansk, Sievierodonetsk and Toshkivka (Luhansk region), and Blahodatne, Dobropillia, Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk, Novohorodske, Olhynka and Sloviansk (Donetsk region).

Title: UNOPS partners with Association of Women in Law Enforcement to promote gender equality and women leadership in Ukrainian security sector
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
09 April 2021
"This Memorandum aims to establish cooperation and partnership. Over the last three years, the UAWLE has gone through a period of inception, and it is now logical for us to progress to the stage of active development. We intend to broaden the scope of our activities and move from providing support to acting as the benchmark for achieving national and global gender equality goals," said Kateryna Pavlichenko, Chairwoman of the UAWLE Board.
“At UNOPS, we put gender equality at the centre of all our work and look forward to strengthening our partnership with the Association of Women in Law Enforcement to promote gender equality and women leadership in Ukrainian law-enforcement sector” - noted Irina Sahakyan-Vetter, UNOPS Ukraine Country Director.
UNOPS builds foundations for countries to achieve peace and sustainable development, thereby helping people to build better lives. UNOPS is a self-financing organisation that combines the best of the UN and the private sector, focusing on infrastructure, procurement and project management services. Our partners call on us to supplement their own capacities, improve speed, reduce risks, boost cost-effectiveness and increase quality.
The UAWLE brings together women and men representing various law enforcement agencies. The association's key goal is to usher in gender equality and ensure equal rights and opportunities for women and men in law enforcement. The UAWLE's activities are aimed at shaping the image of women in law enforcement as leaders, professionals, experts in their respective fields. Greater visibility and engagement for women at all levels of law enforcement increase the trust levels of citizens, communities, and society in general. It is this principle that is at heart of the UAWLE's activities and development.

Title: EU supports the launch of online Fathers’ Club in Kyiv
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 April 2021
Tatohub.Kyiv is the third club for fathers to be launched in Ukraine in the context of the “EU 4 Gender Equality: Together against gender stereotypes and gender-based violence” programme, funded by the European Union, implemented jointly by UN Women and UNFPA. The first two clubs were launched at the end of 2020 in Odesa and Vinnytsia.
Using Facebook as the main platform, the Tatohub.Kyiv club aims to support men in overcoming gender stereotypes and to promote gender equality by providing information about improving partner relations, providing childcare, understanding child psychology, and learning how to spend meaningful leisure time with children and distribute household chores equally. Fathers and expecting fathers are welcome to join the group on Facebook at: www.facebook.com/groups/tatohub.kyiv.
“Gender equality is a crosscutting priority for the EU, crucial for the democratic governance and social development in any country. We have redefined and up scaled our commitment in the recently adopted Gender Action Plan III where Advancing equal participation and leadership is put among the thematic priorities for the EU support. Tato.Hubs – a tool to engage men in the fight for gender equality, and not only women –  are among the numerous practical steps to support equal participation in family and public life in Ukraine”, said Tetiana Shulha, Gender focal point and sector manager at the EU Delegation to Ukraine.
“Even though we officially launched the Tatohub.Kyiv club today, it already has around 100 participants. This is a clear sign for us of the desperate demand for this kind of support for men in their fatherhood. As a new law on paternity leave is expected to be adopted soon, we plan to help families in keeping work-life balance and support dads at all stages of fatherhood.  We will continue to help men understand the value of men’s engagement for the men themselves, for the children’s performance and well-being, and for women’s empowerment and better partner relations” said Pavlo Zamostian, deputy Representative of UNFPA in Ukraine.
“We all want changes, but we are not hurry up to change ourselves. Tatohub.Kyiv opens opportunities for men to change their habits, take more responsibility for raising children, household chores and leisure activities. With the support of the UN Population Fund, we are launching a new project to jointly promote the values of responsible fatherhood in the city of Kyiv”, said Marina Honda, Deputy Head of the Kyiv City State Administration, City Commissioner for Gender Equality.
Tatohub.Kyiv is managed by the Ukrainian Foundation of Public Health, UNFPA Ukraine’s project implementing partner, and will be operating in partnership with the Kyiv City Council (Service for Children and Family, City Centre for Gender Equality and Violence Prevention, Gender Equality Department) to tackle, among others, the needs of vulnerable fathers and fathers with disabilities.

Title: Innovative ‘Ukrainian New York’ community centre opens in Donetsk Oblast
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 April 2021
Novhorodske, Donetsk Oblast, 6 April – The conflict-affected village of Novhorodske in Donetsk Oblast celebrated the opening of an innovative new community hub, named “Ukrainian New York” in honor of the village’s historic name.
The project to build the centre was led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) via the UN’s Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme in Ukraine (UN RPP), in partnership with UNHCR, private businesses, non-government organizations and the local community.
As well as serving as a base for organizing local initiatives and organizations, the community hub will operate as a psychological health centre, a media centre and an educational centre for training community residents on human rights, the development of soft skills (such as leadership, teamwork, and communications) and setting up youth initiatives.
Danish Ambassador to Ukraine Ole Egberg Mikkelsen, in his video address at the opening ceremony, said Denmark was proud to be among the donor partners for the new community centre.
“With this new community centre, the citizens of Novhorodske will have a place where they can come together to exercise local democracy and conduct educational activities. You can also carry out working group meetings aimed at community development, trainings, workshops and youth projects. This will support local democracy, civil society and community life. These are core values for Ukraine’s transformation and the activities that will take place in this centre will bring these values to life”, emphasised the Ambassador.
Situated just a few kilometres from the “contact line” between the government-controlled and non-government-controlled parts of Ukraine’s Donbas region, the village was badly damaged in the early stages of Ukraine’s 7-year armed conflict.
UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Manal Fouani, speaking at the ceremony marking the opening of the new community hub, said the new centre stands as a symbol of what can be achieved when people work together.
“This centre will serve as a place to bring people together for the common purpose of developing the community, creating civil organizations and initiatives, and mobilizing resources,” Fouani said. “In these difficult times, it is important for people in Ukraine, including those in Donetsk Oblast, to overcome whatever might have divided them in the past and work together for a better future.”
To create the new centre, a partnership was formed between the local community, international development agencies, and private business in the region. Almost half of the funds used to create the centre were raised from local businesses, along with contributions from UNHCR and UNDP, supported by the governments of Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden via the UN RPP. The total cost of the project was around U.S. $63,200.
The project involved the renovation of a dilapidated, 100-year-old building of a former cooperative store. UNDP financial support (funding from the governments of Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden) was UAH 844,882 ($29,600), and UNHCR financial support was UAH 159,100 ($5,600). Local initiative groups and NGOs donated furniture and equipment worth over UAH 285,000 ($10,000).
Regional iron and steelmaker Metinvest Company contributed UAH 600,000 ($21,800) for the structural repair of the building, including its ceilings and façade, and agricultural company Beta Agro Invest LLC contributed UAH 50,000 ($1,800) for the purchase of materials and equipment for the building’s power supply and heating systems.
Local company FOP Lenko OV donated over UAH 16,000 ($590) worth of landscaping work, and members of the local community donated UAH 25,000 ($900) worth of labour to clean the premises and surrounding territory, remove garbage, deliver soil and help with the landscaping of the territory.
Background:
The United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP) is being implemented by four United Nations agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
Twelve international partners support the Programme: the European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland.

Title: Landmines Still Pose a Threat to Two Million Ukrainians
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
05 April 2021
On International Mine Awareness Day, the Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine Ms. Osnat Lubrani calls for the protection and safety of 2 million people in eastern Ukraine who face insecurity due to contamination from landmines and ERW. People there are risking their lives every day to access markets, schools, hospitals and farmland. In 2020, people continued to fall victim to mines and ERW, with at least 70 civilians killed or injured in mine incidents. Since the beginning of the conflict in 2014, over 1,190 mine/ERW casualties* have been recorded in Ukraine. In 2020 alone, 55 civilians were injured and 15 killed by mines or ERW. These are, however, only the verified casualties, and the actual number is likely to be much higher.
“It may take a decade to clear the land that has been contaminated in eastern Ukraine. Landmines and other explosive ordnance will remain a threat to civilians’ physical and socioeconomic well-being for years to come. In the meantime, residents of eastern Ukraine have no choice but to live, cultivate their land and send their children to school in areas littered with landmines,” Ms. Lubrani says. “The Government should continue working towards assuring large-scale humanitarian mine clearance, and the planting of new mines should be avoided at all costs,” Ms. Lubrani adds.
Thanks to donor contributions, humanitarian organizations have been continuously supporting mine clearance operations in eastern Ukraine. In 2020 alone, national and international mine action operators jointly cleared and restored around 5,500 hectares of land, which is almost the size of San Marino or equal to 7,700 football fields.
“Another important task is the setting up of systematic mine victim assistance programmes. Apart from emergency medical help, comprehensive mine victim assistance is not provided in Ukraine,” the Humanitarian Coordinator continues. “I would like to emphasize the importance for the Government of Ukraine to ramp up its efforts to provide mine survivors with highquality functional prostheses, continued medical care, psychosocial assistance, accessible and inclusive services and to ensure that existing laws and policies correspond to the needs of mine survivors,” Ms. Lubrani adds.
“I also call on donors to expand their support to mine action in eastern Ukraine to protect civilians and facilitate recovery efforts, where feasible. Only together can we make sure that eastern Ukraine is free of landmines and ERW,” Ms. Lubrani concluded.
***
The United Nations General Assembly declared that 4 April of each year to be observed as the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action. It is aimed at raising awareness about mines and ERW and facilitating their eradication. Mine Awareness Day is observed to foster the development of national mine-action capacities in the countries where mines and ERW constitute a serious threat to the safety, health and lives of the civilian population.

Title: Survey: Half of Ukrainians obtained at least one e-service over the past year
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
30 March 2021
Half of Ukrainians (53 percent of the population) received at least one electronic service in the last 12 months, according to the results of a survey conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology to identify the experiences, needs, and preferences of adult residents of Ukraine in the use of digital services.
The findings of the survey, “Electronic services: experiences, trust, accessibility”, were presented by Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) supported by the Embassy of Sweden in Ukraine. The presentation was held as part of the #All Digital Week in Europe event.
The most popular e-services among Ukrainians are obtaining passports or other services provided by the State Migration Service (mentioned by 15 percent of respondents). Another 13 percent used the Diia application or portal. Similar shares of respondents used e-services to obtain subsidies, benefits, and social payments.
At the presentation of the survey, Valeriia Ionan, Deputy Minister for European Integration at the Ministry of Digital Transformation, underlined that it is crucial to keep track of people’s attitudes and have real information about their perceptions regarding the state e-services received by 53 percent of Ukrainians over the past year.
“This is important for effective management decisions,” said Ionan. “We will actively work with citizens, especially with elderly people, during the Dia.Digital education project.  This will help raise digital literacy and will enhance trust in the Ministry of Digital Transformation and the Government. It will also let people get access to online medical services, pay utility bills, and get subsidies and social payments.”
During the presentation, Manal Fouani, UNDP’s Deputy Resident Representative in Ukraine, stressed that the process of digitalization, already underway before 2020, has rapidly accelerated during the pandemic. "The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly fostered the rapid transformation of citizen-oriented services and government business-processes," she said, adding that this has brought about a “new normal” as people commute to work on their laptops.
Fouani acknowledged that despite the unprecedented advances in technology, too many people are left on the undigitized side of the digital divide, leaving them without access to the many benefits.  “And – yes – millions of people worldwide cannot even afford a smartphone or internet access," she said.
Fouani said we must understand what Ukrainians have been using from publicly-available electronic services, what went well in terms of user experience, and where there are opportunities for improvement.
“We must make sure that the human rights-based approach is at the forefront of any digital service, leaving no one behind as the country moves forward in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030," said Fouani.
Of the remaining 47 percent of Ukrainians who did not use e-services, almost a quarter (24 percent) said they lacked skills to do so, and one in five non-users (21 percent) reported having no internet-enabled device to access the services, even if they needed them.
At the presentation, Volodymyr Brusilovsky, the Project Manager for the “Digital, Inclusive, Accessible: Supporting the Digitization of Public Services in Ukraine" (DIA Support) project underlined that these results show that to make life easier for everyone, including all vulnerable groups, e-services should be inclusive and affordable for everyone.
“Now that we have a better understanding of needs and experiences of the use of digital services, we will tailor our support to improve the quality of citizens' access to electronic administrative and social services,” Brusilovsky said.
Background information:
The research was conducted at the request of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine and the “Digital, Inclusive, Accessible: Supporting the Digitization of Public Services in Ukraine" (DIA Support) project with support from the Swedish Embassy.
The DIA Support project aims to bridge the digital divide between generations and different social groups in Ukraine, specifically seniors and retirees, persons with disabilities, people living below the poverty line, people living in rural areas, young people living in conflict-affected areas, ethnic minorities (especially the Roma population), IDPs, and veterans returning to civilian life.

Title: New centres for psycho-social assistance to survivors of violence open in eastern Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
30 March 2021
Vuhledar, Donetsk Oblast, and Popasna, Luhansk Oblast, 24 March 2021 – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine has opened a day centre for psycho-social assistance to survivors of violence in the Vuhledar Territorial Community, as well as a 24/7 shelter in Popasna to protect persons who have experienced domestic and gender-based violence.
The centre in Vuhledar was opened and equipped with all of the necessary technical equipment at a total cost of U.S. $39,154 (UAH 1,096,298), while the shelter in Popasna was opened for US$ 51 984 (UAH 1 455 558) under the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, with financial support from the governments of Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland.
The newly opened centres are a safe place for survivors of various forms of violence. Both carry out daily preventive work with people facing challenging life conditions due to gender-based or domestic violence. The centres' specialists provide comprehensive support to beneficiaries, including correctional and rehabilitation services and psychological assistance to GBV survivors.
Oksana Parkhomenko, the director of the Vuhledar City Centre for Social Services for Families, Children and Youth, stressed the importance of creating institutions where violence survivors can receive support and protection.
"Everyone has the right to feel protected, said Parkhomenko. “So it is a piece of good news that our community now has a centre with modern equipment, where each and every person can raise their awareness about preventing and combating violence, as well as receive a range of psycho-social services on this issue."
The Day Centre in Vuhledar functions as a structural subdivision of the local City Centre for Social Services for Families, Children and Youth, and directs the efforts of specialists to reduce the number of cases of domestic and/or gender-based violence through psycho-social work with beneficiaries in self-worth, independence, and knowledge of their rights and opportunities.
Rustam Pulatov, the lead of the Community Security and Social Cohesion component of the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, said that the assistance and support to violence survivors are essential priorities of the programme, which are implemented through prevention activities and the creation of safe spaces, day centres and shelters in communities.
"Any demonstration of violence – domestic, gender-based or of another kind – is a huge problem, which we are systematically working to overcome,” said Pulatov. “In advance, we create conditions where survivors can feel safe and can regain their strength. At the same time, using such centres, we work to prevent the recurrence of violence against survivors and form zero tolerance for its manifestations in society."
Both centres are fully inclusive, contain a psychologist's room, a training room for GBV and domestic violence prevention, bathrooms and a kitchen. The 24/7 shelter in Popasna is also equipped with special living rooms.
Rymma Khomatova, director of the Popasna District Centre for Social Services for Violence Survivors, said the shelter was designed for ten people. It contains four living rooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, a sitting room and a children's play area.
"Beneficiaries will be able to stay here for up to three months,” Khomatova said. “They can get here at the direction of the police or a mobile team of social and psychological assistance operating in the city, as well as the direction of an authorised local authority."
The centres' addresses aren’t being disclosed to guarantee the safety of violence survivors and staff. Vuhledar City Centre for Social Services for Families, Children, and Youth can provide information on the shelter there and its services, and the information about 24/7 shelter in Popasna can be obtained via the contacts below:
In addition to the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, Vuhledar City Council, Vuhledar City Centre for Social Services for Families, Children and Youth, Vuhledar Development Agency, and the NGO "Future Integration" took part in the project's implementation and contributed financing worth US$ 2,582 (UAH 72,290) in Vuhledar, while the shelter in Popasna was jointly financed by the local District State Administration (DSA) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Ukraine. Popasna RSA financially supported the project with a sum of US$ 24 286 (UAH 680,000) and UNFPA contributed US$ 8,481 (UAH 237,458)

25 March 2021
Over 20,000 gather at the SDG Global Festival of Action, calling for transformative change to turn things around for people and the planet
Bonn, Germany, 25 March – Calling for the beginning of a ‘new era’ following COVID-19 recovery, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed alongside United Nations Development Programme Administrator Achim Steiner, spoke today at the fifth annual SDG Global Festival of Action, bringing to attention the urgent need for economic and social change that protects our ecosystems and humanity’s well-being.
The Deputy Secretary-General stated her support for an inter-generational transition, putting youth at the forefront to allow them to shape the SDG agenda, and encouraged countries to listen to its young people to ensure we don’t return to business as usual.
Convened over two days, from 25 to 26 March, under the theme ‘A Turning Point for People and Planet’, the Festival connected government and private sector leaders with changemakers, activists, creatives and more, hosting talks, performances, interactive workshops and exhibits to inspire and mobilize action. Because of the pandemic, the dynamic in-person event moved to a virtual platform, elevating its attendance to over 20,000 remote participants from 203 countries and territories, making it the largest and most geographically diverse Festival ever.
With the world still suffering from the effects of the pandemic and many countries still in lockdown, the year 2021 was framed as a critical year to accelerate progress on the SDGs, with climate, gender equality, poverty and inequalities, and sustainable financing firmly in focus. The Festival aimed to scale up both awareness and ambition ahead of important events such as the G20 meetings, The Generation Equality Forum, The Food Systems Summit and the important COP climate conferences in Italy and Scotland towards the end of the year. Over 300 speakers from 80+ countries represented the wide range of SDG stakeholders, came together to share their knowledge and experience on how to tackle the world’s ongoing challenges, present solutions and discuss what is at stake if we fail to meet the promises of the Sustainable Development Goals.
“It’s become clear that everyone has a role in advancing this transformation,’ said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “On the one hand, we need new policies that steer our societies in the right direction. On the other, each of us is an agent for change. Our individual behaviours will add up to make the difference - powerfully so.” Marina Ponti, Director of the SDG Action Campaign who organized the Festival, echoed the sense of optimism and called to seize the opportunities that came with the unprecedented global crisis we saw last year, noting that we should use what we’ve learned to shift the way we live, consume, earn and produce. “Together, we can dream big. We can act with shared heart and conviction. And we can generate a global turning point that resets our world for good.”
Other speakers during the opening day included SDG Advocate and disability activist Eddie Ndopu who talked about how the pandemic has caused pre-existing inequities to bubble up to the surface, including a crisis of inequality, the ecological breakdown of the planet, and systemic injustices - yet shared optimism in the fact that it has also compounded humanity’s capacity for creativity, genius and resilience. David Nabarro, Special Envoy of WHO on COVID-19, echoed Eddie’s statement in his talk highlighting that only by working together and supporting each other will humanity come through this pandemic with the strength it needs to help set the world on the right path.
Chairman of Japan SDGs Action Promotion Council, Norichika Kanie, was proud to represent Japan as they became the first country to host a local edition of the Festival - the SDG Global Festival of Action from Japan, an integral component of this year’s Global Festival. Sharing local solutions and setting an example of nationwide movement for action, the spin-off was curated by 12 UN agencies based in Japan and featured Goodwill Ambassadors Misako Konno (UNDP) and MIYAVI (UNHCR), popular comedian Yuriyan Retriever, and many other multi sectoral stakeholders. Dr. Kanie urged that we work together to combine our solutions for people and planet, to light the spark for action following the vision set out by the Sustainable Development Agenda.
Representing youth climate advocates, Mitzi Jonelle Tan from the Philippines joined with an impassioned plea to recognize and empower marginalized sectors of society, especially those from the global south, who are on the frontlines of the unequal impacts of climate change, and who are not always included in the conversations on how to confront the crisis.
To interact and engage the participants at the Festival, organizations and experts helped organize 27 workshops focusing on ideation, upskilling, campaign activation and well-being, creating a unique and personalized experience for the 10,000 participants that signed up to join just the workshops alone. Workshop hosts included civil society organisations such as Social Watch, Project Everyone, Humanity Lab Foundation and the World Organisation of the Scout Movement, with more lined up for Day 2.
The creative arts were also represented with musical contributions from global artist Yoko Ono with her ode to the planet ‘I love you Earth’, as well as performances from climate activists including Patti Smith, Bomba Estéreo, and Tenzin Choegyal scheduled for Day 2, The 20 exhibits that were available to participants throughout the program included exclusive pieces by La Triennale Di Milano, street art, photography and immersive media by Oculus, Lavazza, CANON, Google Arts & Culture Lab, and Terry Riley and Sasha Waltz.

Title: UNFPA Ukraine and Citrus launch a partnership to empower and improve the well-being of young people in Ukrainian cities
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
23 March 2021
Youth Well-Being Index is an online tool developed by UNFPA Ukraine to assist municipalities in improving youth policy and youth development projects. It aims to encourage young people to be more active and involved in decision-making at the local level.
The initiative has been implemented in Ukraine since 2019 and already 9 municipalities have joined it.
“Youth participation in decision-making at the city level will assist the city in improving its development programmes. Cities will become more inclusive and youth friendly, promoting young peoples’ engagement and fostering them to stay and raise their lives in their hometowns. The Youth Well-Being Index is a tool that sets the stage for that to happen, since it enables the city to directly ask young people which areas of life they are satisfied with and which need improvement, and calls for finding solutions not just for youth, but with the youngsters themselves  ” said Jaime Nadal, UNFPA Representative in Ukraine.
Citrus joined the initiative in 2020 as a local partner in Odesa, and from 2021 plans to support young people in all cities seeking to become more youth-friendly.
"Youth is the future of our country. Citrus, as a national company that is particularly passionate about supporting initiatives for the development of young people, could not pass by. Every girl and boy deserves to work at a favorite job, learn something new and interesting, live and benefit from the brightest impressions. But for this it is not necessary to look for yourself in the capital and so on. The plans for 2021 are not only Odessa, but also the development of young people across the country. Together with the UN, we want to help young people find themselves in their hometown. "- Dmitry Demidov, SMO" Citrus ".
Citrus will provide discounts on goods sold through online and offline stores to young people who have fully passed the survey in different cities of Ukraine.

Title: Disasters take heavy toll on agri-food systems as new threats emerge
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 March 2021
18 March 2021, Rome - Agriculture absorbs the bulk of the financial losses and damages wrought by disasters which have grown in frequency, intensity, and complexity, says FAO in a new report released today.
At no other point in history have agri-food systems confronted with such an array of new and unprecedented threats, including megafires, extreme weather, unusually large desert locust swarms, and emerging biological threats like the COVID-19 pandemic. These hazards not only take lives but also devastate agricultural livelihoods and inflict cascading negative economic consequences at the household, community, national and regional levels that can endure for generations, the report says.
According to the report, annual occurrence of disasters is now more than three times that of the 1970s and 1980s. Relative to agriculture, industry, commerce and tourism taken as a whole, on its own agriculture absorbs the disproportionate share of 63 percent of impact from disasters, with the least developed countries (LDCs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bearing the major brunt of these scourges.
Thus, between 2008 and 2018, the impacts of natural disasters cost the agricultural sectors of developing country economies over $108 billion in damaged or lost crop and livestock production. Such damage can be particularly detrimental to livelihoods of smallholder and subsistence farmers, pastoralists, and fishers.
Over the analyzed period, Asia was the most hard-hit region, with overall economic losses adding up to a staggering $49 billion, followed by Africa at $30 billion, and Latin America and Caribbean at $29 billion.
"The upheaval set in motion by COVID-19 may push even more families and communities into deeper distress," said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu in the foreword to the report. "Disaster impact is pervasive and requires immediate efforts to better assess and understand its dynamics, so that it may be reduced and managed in integrated and innovative ways. The urgency and importance of doing so have never been greater".
Major threats
The report identifies drought as the single greatest culprit of agricultural production loss, followed by floods, storms, pests and diseases, and wildfires. Over 34 percent of crop and livestock production loss in LDCs and LMICs is traced to drought, costing the sector $37 billion overall. Drought impacts agriculture almost exclusively. The sector sustains 82 percent of all drought impact, compared to 18 percent in all other sectors.
Crop and livestock pests, diseases and infestations have also become an important stressor for the sector. Such biological disasters caused nine percent of all crop and livestock production loss in the period from 2008 to 2018. The potential threat of disasters of this category was rendered evident in 2020 when huge swarms of desert locusts ravaged across the Greater Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and Southwest Asia destroying crops and jeopardising food security.
Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic is placing an additional burden on agri-food systems exacerbating existing, systemic risks with cascading effects on lives, livelihoods, and economies worldwide.
Disaster impacts on food security and nutrition
Disasters extend beyond the economic realm having deleterious consequences for food security and nutrition. For the first time ever, this edition of the FAO report converts economic losses into caloric and nutrition equivalents.
For example, it estimates that crop and livestock production loss in LDCs and LMICs between 2008 and 2018 were equivalent to a loss of 6.9 trillion kilocalories per year. This equals the annual calorie intake of seven million adults.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, disaster impacts during that same time frame convert to a loss of 975 calories per capita per day, accounting for 40 percent of recommended daily allowance, followed by Africa (559 calories) and Asia (283 calories).
A disaster-resilient future is possible
Investing in resilience and disaster risk reduction, especially data gathering and analysis for evidence-informed action, is of paramount importance to ensure agriculture's crucial role in achieving sustainable future, FAO's report argues.
Holistic responses and cross-sectoral collaboration are key in the disaster response. Countries must adopt a multi-hazard and multi- sectoral systemic risk management approach to anticipate, prevent, prepare for and respond to disaster risk in agriculture. Strategies need to integrate not only natural hazards but also anthropogenic and biological threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and must be based on an understanding of the systemic nature and interdependencies of risks.
Innovations such as remote sensing, geospatial information gathering, drones and disaster robotics, and machine learning are powerful new assessment and data gathering tools that have much to offer in the quest to reduce disaster risks in agriculture.
In addition to efficient governance, it is crucial to promote public-private partnerships to address the urgent need for investment in reducing agriculture's susceptibility to disasters and climate change.
About the report
FAO's recurring report The Impact of Disasters and Crises on Agriculture and Food Security presents the most recent trends in agricultural production loss attributed to disasters across all agricultural sectors. The 2021 edition covers 457 disasters in 109 countries across all regions and income categories, including for the first time upper-middle- and high-income countries (UMICs and HICs).
Of the 109 countries to register disaster-related agriculture loss, 94 are in the LDC and LMIC categories, where 389 disasters hampered agricultural production.

Title: Day centre for social and psychological assistance to survivors of violence opens in Kreminna, eastern Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 March 2021
Kreminna, Luhansk Oblast - The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), together with national partners, has opened a day centre for social and psychological assistance to survivors of violence in Kreminna, Luhansk Oblast, to protect people who have experienced domestic and gender-based violence, and whose life or health are under threat.
The centre was opened, overhauled and equipped with all of the necessary technical equipment and furniture at a total cost of U.S. $80,580 (UAH 2,256,240) under the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, with financial support from Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland.
The day centre now opened in Kreminna is designed to be a 24/7 safe place for survivors of various forms of violence. It provides not only a place to shelter and hide from offenders, but also psychological, social and legal assistance from qualified specialists, as well as a number of social, medical and informational services based on an assessment of survivors’ needs. The provision of assistance to a person will be individualised, taking into account their age, gender, health and social status.
Olha Revuk, the deputy minister of Social Policy of Ukraine for European Integration, who was present at the event, stressed the importance of expanding the network of institutions that provide comprehensive assistance to women who face violence and need a safe place to receive the necessary psychological, social and legal support.
"It is important that every person, every citizen of Ukraine, from cities, towns and communities feel protected,” Revuk said. “It is great that such a shelter has been opened in accordance with international standards with the help of our international partners from the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, and we thank them. I emphasise that it is essential that there is an understanding of the importance of implementing the Law of Ukraine ‘On Prevention and Counteraction to Domestic Violence’ by the local and regional authorities. I'm convinced that the new centre will be a place of absolute protection for women and children who suffer from domestic and other forms of violence. Such shelters should be opened in all Ukraine cities, and especially in the regions near the ‘contact line.’”
UNDP Deputy Resident Representative to Ukraine Manal Fouani said that the COVID-19 pandemic further compounded the impact of seven years of conflict and made it even harder for people who have experienced domestic and gender-based violence to find the help they need. These centres are not just needed but essential for the community to provide opportunities and mechanisms for protection in such difficult times.
"These centres are a safe haven for survivors to reflect, become more self-reliant and resilient and more importantly embark on a new life, free from violence and fear,” Fouani said. “They are places for people who no longer have anyone to rely on, and who need a place to turn to for help. Stemming from UNDP’s belief in the centrality of the protection of people, we’re systematically working together with our partners to create such shelters around the country.”
The day centre is fully inclusive, designed for ten adults, with three rooms for visitors, a space for sessions with a psychologist, bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room. All rooms have been adapted to meet the needs of people with disabilities.
UNFPA Deputy Representative Pavlo Zamostian said the day centre's opening was an essential component for ensuring there is a comprehensive response to gender-based violence.
"First of all, it’s a victory for the community, which has received a place to provide quality services and safe shelter for survivors,” Zamostian said. “And no less important, it’s a victory of a partnership: the partnership between the local government, which decided to establish such an institution, allocated co-financing for its creation and fully assumed its maintenance, and UNDP and UNFPA – our constant, reliable partners."
The address of the shelter is not being disclosed to guarantee the safety of violence survivors and staff. Information on the shelter and the services provided there can be obtained via the contacts below:
· Day centre for social and psychological assistance +380 95 202 4341, +380 64 542 4400;
· Mobile brigade of social and psychological assistance +380 63 026 2973, +380 99 366 6308.
Specialists from these institutions can refer women-survivors of violence, including women with children, to a safe place of residence for up to three months.
In addition to the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, Kreminna Town Council, which will continue to subsidise the shelter from the local budget, joined in the project's implementation and financing.

Title: Delivery of Checkpoint Modules, Vehicles, Scanners and other equipment  Will Enable Police based in eastern Ukraine to Better Perform Their Jobs
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 March 2021
When they arrive, the remaining modules will be used at six other National Police checkpoints in Donetsk region.  The modules – delivered together with ten police pick-up cars, 1,162 first aid kits, 700 fire extinguishers, and a state-of-the-art portable explosive ordnance scanner – will allow police to operate in hard-to-reach locations, and significantly enhance their ability to ensure safety of local communities.  The overall worth of the EU support totals EUR 600,000.
PRAVO Police programme (‘Support for Rule of Law Reforms in Ukraine in the Areas of Police and Public Prosecution and Good Governance”) is funded by the European Union and implemented by UNOPS in close coordination with the European Union Advisory Mission (EUAM) to Ukraine.
“PRAVO Police is one of the EU’s key rule of law projects in Ukraine. We are happy to support the National Police in eastern Ukraine, where the population lives under a heightened risk to their lives and health due to the conflict. Reinforcing civilian security is an important step towards better protection for the citizens”, said Xavier Camus, Head of the Good Governance and Rule of Law section at the European Union Delegation to Ukraine.
The NPU says that the equipment will improve police’s response times to crime or emergency situations  and better police officers working conditions.
“With the support of our international partners, we are enhancing police's capacity to provide professional, effective, and timely support to the people of the Donetsk region”, said Artem Kysko, the acting Head of the Main Department of the National Police in Donetsk region. “'With this equipment, we will be able to save more lives, reinforce police presence in the region, and make checkpoint inspections more convenient for citizens. Our priority is to ensure safety in line with international standards”.
The police vehicles will increase mobility of NPU’s rapid response teams, community policing units and police contact points in countryside, especially when covering remote areas.
“In crime and emergency response situations, community police are often first at the scene and so must be appropriately equipped to perform their critical duties” said Fran O’Grady, senior programme manager, PRAVO Police.
A state-of-the-art scanner, also delivered by PRAVO Police, will allow identification and containment of explosive threats when inspecting vehicles, cargo, packages and bags, including larger items, like containers, that cannot be scanned by stationary systems.
EUAM advises and supports law enforcement agencies in Donetsk region through its Field Office in Mariupol, opened in September last year.
“Today’s sizable donations will make it easier for citizens to have access to quality and timely NPU services in Donetsk regions, especially in rural areas. EUAM works side by side with NPU to improve its effectiveness and ability to respond to citizen’s needs. We believe this is essential to increase public trust in law enforcement and, ultimately, Ukraine’s resilience.” said Fredrik Wesslau, Acting Head of EUAM, during the donation ceremony.
Proximity to the conflict zone has led to increased security threats for local civilians in the area, with the common occurrence of human, drug and arms trafficking, unauthorised movement of people and goods across the contact line, activity of militarized organised criminal groups, and daily discovery of explosive devices and remnants of war.
In 2020 alone, Donbas NPU Explosive Ordnance Disposal team responded to over 560 calls. Overall, the team has disposed of 41,000 explosive threats and 2,000kg of explosive substances.

Title: Hostilities and COVID-19 pandemic continue to further exacerbate human rights situation in Ukraine, says UN Human Rights
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 March 2021

KYIV, 11 MARCH 2021 – While the security situation significantly improved in eastern Ukraine in the second half of 2020, a new United Nations (UN) report highlights a series of conflict and non-conflict related human rights violations throughout the country. The report is based on the work of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) and covers the period from 1 August 2020 to 31 January 2021.
“Since the agreement on measures to strengthen the ceasefire that took effect on 27 July 2020, we saw a significant improvement in the security situation and a continued decrease in civilian casualties caused by active hostilities,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of HRMMU.
Notwithstanding this improvement, from 1 August 2020 to 31 January 2021, active hostilities caused injuries to three civilian men. At the same time, mines and explosive remnants of war killed eight people (seven men and one woman) and injured 28 (20 men, five boys, and three women) over the reporting period. Since the beginning of the conflict, HRMMU has recorded a total of 3,375 conflict-related civilian deaths. The number of injured civilians is estimated to exceed 7,000 over the same period. “Even one death or injury is too many. Zero civilian casualties should be the objective. We urge parties to the conflict to fully respect the ceasefire and comply with international humanitarian law. We also underline the need to strengthen mine awareness work, including for children and young people,” Ms Bogner added.
The report highlights that the combined effects of the conflict and COVID-19 pandemic have been particularly difficult for those who need to cross the contact line. From 1 August 2020 to 31 January 2021, the number of crossings of the contact line in both directions decreased by 96 per cent compared with the same period in 2019-2020.
“People need to cross the contact line. Even during the pandemic people still have basic needs, the sick need to access essential medical care, families need to see each other, and older persons need to access their pensions. Everything should be done to facilitate civilians to cross the contact line safely in order to meet their needs and decrease the negative impact of the conflict on them,” Ms Bogner said.
The report outlines that, while in Government-controlled territory the number of cases of conflict-related torture and ill-treatment has decreased in recent years, accountability remains lacking, including in non-conflict cases, and particularly those involving police violence. UN Human Rights stressed the need for the Government to ensure accountability for human rights violations, not only in relation to the armed conflict, but also for all other violations. On this note, the report underlines that seven years after the end of the Maidan protests, accountability is yet to be achieved for the related deaths and killings that occurred.
The report also documents twelve cases of arbitrary detention in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’ and eight cases of arbitrary and incommunicado detention in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’. “The continued denial of access to detention facilities by independent monitors places detainees at particular risk. HRMMU and other international organisations should be granted unimpeded access to places of detention there as soon as possible,” Ms Bogner added.
Over the reporting period, HRMMU documented eighteen cases of threats and attacks against journalists and other media workers, human rights defenders, civil and political activists, LGBTI people and their supporters, and members of national minorities. The report also details a wave of attacks against members and staff of political parties ahead of the local elections, mainly targeting two opposition parties considered by many to be “pro-Russian”. In territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’, armed groups arbitrarily detained individuals for their social media posts.
HRMMU continued to document incidents of hate speech and threats against national minorities, including Roma and Hungarian, and recorded a new wave of hatred and threats against critics of the “Law on the State Language”. “Since the entry into force of certain provisions of the Law on State Language on 16 January, we have seen a surge of hate-motivated attacks and threats against critics of the law and those who expressed positive views about the Russian language. A law on the protection of national minorities and their languages needs to be adopted swiftly in a consultative and inclusive manner,” Ms Bogner said.
The enforcement of so-called ‘legislation’ in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’ discriminates against a number of religious communities, says the report. The report expresses concern that in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’, the right to education may be impacted by the decision to introduce Russian as the ‘official’ language in educational ‘institutions’, and urges armed groups of self-proclaimed ‘republics’ to refrain from taking any measures that prevent study of Ukrainian and minority languages.
The report also highlights vulnerabilities that the pandemic in Ukraine has revealed among underpaid healthcare workers, 83 per cent of whom are women, as well as among homeless persons and people with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities who continue to be deprived of legal capacity in Ukraine.
Concerning the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation,[1] the report highlights, amongst other human rights violations, that deportations and forcible transfers continued. “We recall that international humanitarian law prohibits individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, regardless of the motive,” Ms Bogner said. Unlawful application of Russian Federation criminal legislation by the occupation authorities of the Russian Federation on the peninsula also affected freedom of religion, notably that of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The report also provides a set of specific recommendations to the Ukrainian authorities, to self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’ and self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’, and to the Russian Federation, as the occupying Power in Crimea.
HRMMU also notes that the Government of Ukraine has fully implemented 12 per cent of the Mission’s recommendations made in its previous periodic and thematic reports on Ukraine, and partially implemented 57 per cent, leaving 31 per cent unimplemented. Meanwhile, self-proclaimed ‘republics’ have fully implemented three per cent of recommendations and partially implemented 19 per cent of recommendations, leaving 78 per cent unimplemented. The Russian Federation as the occupying Power in Crimea have not implemented any of the assessed recommendations, and partly implemented three per cent of these recommendations, leaving 97 per cent of recommendations unimplemented.
The full text of the report is available in English, Ukrainian and Russian.

Title: Ситуация с правами человека в Украине продолжает ухудшаться из-за боевых действий и пандемии COVID-19, заявляет Управление Верховного комиссара ООН по правам человека
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 March 2021
В новом докладе Организации Объединенных Наций (ООН) освещается ряд нарушений прав человека по всей стране, которые связаны и не связаны с конфликтом. Документ подготовлен по результатам работы Мониторинговой миссии Организации Объединенных Наций по правам человека в Украине (ММПЧУ) и охватывает период с 1 августа 2020 по 31 января 2021.
КИЕВ, 11 МАРТА 2021 – Хотя ситуация с безопасностью на востоке Украины значительно улучшилась во второй половине 2020 года, в новом докладе Организации Объединенных Наций (ООН) освещается ряд нарушений прав человека по всей стране, которые связаны и не связаны с конфликтом. Документ подготовлен по результатам работы Мониторинговой миссии Организации Объединенных Наций по правам человека в Украине (ММПЧУ) и охватывает период с 1 августа 2020 по 31 января 2021.
«После того, как 27 июля 2020 вступило в силу соглашение о мерах по усилению режима прекращения огня, мы увидели значительное улучшение ситуации с безопасностью и дальнейшее уменьшение количества жертв активных боевых действий среди гражданского населения», – сказала Глава ММПЧУ Матильда Богнер.
Несмотря на это улучшение, в период с 1 августа 2020 по 31 января 2021 в результате активных боевых действий трое гражданских мужчин получили ранения. В то же время 8 человек погибли (7 мужчин и 1 женщина) и 28 получили ранения (20 мужчин, 5 мальчиков и 3 женщины) вследствие взрывов мин и взрывоопасных пережитков войны. С начала конфликта ММПЧУ зафиксировала в целом 3375 смертей среди гражданского населения, связанных с конфликтом. Количество раненых гражданских лиц, по оценкам, превышает 7000. «Даже одна смерть или ранение – это уже слишком много. Целью должен быть нулевой показатель жертв среди гражданского населения. Мы призываем стороны конфликта полностью соблюдать режим прекращения огня и нормы международного гуманитарного права. Мы также подчеркиваем необходимость повышать осведомленность о минной опасности, в том числе среди детей и молодежи», – добавила г-жа Богнер.
В докладе подчеркивается, что от совокупных последствий конфликта и пандемии COVID-19 особенно страдают лица, которым необходимо пересекать линию соприкосновения. С  1  августа 2020 по 31 января 2021 количество пересечений линии соприкосновения в обоих направлениях сократилась на 96 процентов по сравнению с аналогичным периодом 2019 - 2020 годов.
«Людям необходимо пересекать линию соприкосновения. Даже во время пандемии у людей остаются базовые потребности: больные нуждаются в доступе к основным медицинским услугам, членам семей нужно видеться, а людям пожилого возраста требуется доступ к пенсиям. Необходимо сделать все возможное, чтобы гражданские лица могли безопасно пересекать линию соприкосновения, чтобы удовлетворить их потребности и уменьшить негативное влияние конфликта на них», – сказала г-жа Богнер.
В докладе отмечается, что, хотя в последние годы на контролируемой Правительством территории уменьшилось количество случаев пыток и жестокого обращения, связанных с конфликтом, все еще отсутствует ответственность за пытки и жестокое обращение, в том числе в случаях, не связанных с конфликтом, особенно тех, где имело место насилие со стороны полиции. ММПЧУ подчеркивает, что Правительство должно привлечь виновных к ответственности за нарушения прав человека не только в связи с вооруженным конфликтом, но и за все другие нарушения. В этом контексте в докладе подчеркивается, что через семь лет после окончания протестов на Майдане все еще не было привлечено к ответственности лиц, виновных в гибели людей и убийствах.
В докладе задокументировано 12 случаев произвольных задержаний на территории, контролируемой самопровозглашенной «Донецкой народной республикой», и 8 случаев произвольного задержания и содержания под стражей без связи с внешним миром на территории, контролируемой самопровозглашенной «Луганской народной республикой». «Независимым наблюдателям продолжают отказывать в доступе к местам содержания под стражей, что особенно подвергает задержанных риску. ММПЧУ и другим международным организациям следует как можно скорее предоставить беспрепятственный доступ к местам содержания под стражей», – добавила г-жа Богнер.
За отчетный период ММПЧУ зафиксировала 18 случаев угроз и нападений на журналистов и других работников СМИ, правозащитников, гражданских и политических активистов, членов ЛГБТИ-сообщества и их сторонников, а также представителей национальных меньшинств. В докладе приводится подробная информация о нападениях на членов и сотрудников политических партий накануне выборов в местные органы власти, в основном направленных против двух оппозиционных партий, которые многими считаются «пророссийскими». На территории, контролируемой самопровозглашенными «республиками», вооруженные группы произвольно задерживали людей за публикации в социальных сетях.
ММПЧУ продолжала документировать случаи риторики ненависти и угроз национальным меньшинствам, в частности ромам и венграм, и зафиксировало новую волну ненависти и угроз критикам закона «Об обеспечении функционирования украинского языка как государственного». «С тех пор как некоторые положения закона о государственном языке вступили в силу 16 января, мы стали свидетелями всплеска нападений и угроз на почве ненависти в адрес критиков закона и тех, кто высказывал положительные взгляды про русский язык. Следует как можно скорее принять Закон о защите национальных меньшинств и их языков на основе консультаций и при участии всех заинтересованных сторон», – сказала г-жа Богнер.
Применяемое так называемое «законодательство» на территории, контролируемой самопровозглашёнными «республиками», является дискриминационным по отношению к ряду религиозных общин, отмечается в докладе. Также, в докладе выражается обеспокоенность тем, что на территории, контролируемой самопровозглашёнными «республиками», решение о признании русского языка «официальным» в образовательных «учреждениях» может повлиять на право на образование, и содержится призыв к вооруженным группам самопровозглашенных «республик» воздерживаться от любых мер, препятствующих изучению украинского языка и языков меньшинств.
В докладе также подчеркиваются уязвимости, которые выявила пандемия в Украине: среди низкооплачиваемых работников сферы здравоохранения, 83% из которых составляют женщины; среди бездомных лиц, для которых нет достаточно приютов; а также среди людей с интеллектуальными и психосоциальными нарушениями, которые по-прежнему лишены правоспособности в Украине.
Что касается Автономной Республики Крым и города Севастополя, Украина, временно оккупированных Российской Федерацией,[1] то в докладе, среди других нарушений прав человека, подчеркивается продолжение депортаций и принудительных перемещений. «Мы напоминаем, что международное гуманитарное право запрещает принудительное индивидуальное или массовое перемещение, а также депортацию лиц, находящихся под защитой, с оккупированной территории на территорию оккупирующей Державы или другой страны независимо от мотивов», – сказала г-жа Богнер. Незаконное применение уголовного законодательства Российской Федерации оккупационными властями Российской Федерации на полуострове также негативно влияет на свободу религии, в частности Православной Церкви Украины и Свидетелей Иеговы.
В докладе также содержится ряд конкретных рекомендаций украинским органам власти, самопровозглашенной «Донецкой народной республике», самопровозглашенной «Луганской народной республике», а также Российской Федерации как оккупирующей Державе в Крыму.
ММПЧУ отмечает, что Правительство Украины полностью выполнило 12 процентов рекомендаций Миссии, изложенных в предыдущих периодических и тематических докладах по Украине, и частично выполнило 57 процентов. 31 процент остается невыполненным. Вместе с тем, самопровозглашенные «республики» полностью выполнили 3 процента рекомендаций и частично выполнили 19 процентов. 78 процентов остаются невыполненными. Российская Федерация как оккупирующая Держава в Крыму не выполнила ни одного из оцененных рекомендаций, и частично выполнила 3 ​процента. 97 процентов рекомендаций остаются невыполненными.

Title: Statement on occasion of 2021 International Women’s Day by Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 March 2021
COVID-19 has adversely impacted women and deepened gender gaps, whether because women make 80% of front line health workers, or due to the unprecedented heavy increase in burden of care with schools and kindergartens shut for long stretch of time, but also because of the soaring rise in domestic violence associated with pressures, both economic and psycho-social. Considering that prior to COVID-19 there were significant disparities in indicators measuring women’s economic activity, employment, wages, or pensions, compared to men, it not surprising that the economic downturn caused by the pandemic brings disproportionate severe hardship to women.
It is fitting that the theme for the 2021 International Women’s Day is leadership. To shape a resilient, more equal future and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the kind of leadership we need is one in which women are represented equally in all spheres where decisions are taken, so that they are empowered, equally with men, to fully realize their human rights in all spheres of life, including economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights.
The increased representation of women in Parliament and Government of Ukraine to 20% since the last parliamentary elections is an improvement. However, there are still no women among heads of regional state administrations. In terms of participation in the economy, there are significantly fewer women in higher earning management positions. Women in Ukraine do not reach 30% of owners in any segment of business – micro, small, medium, and large.
Women are mainly employed in the public sector, like health care, social welfare, and education, where salaries are generally lower. At the local level women are better represented, particularly at community level they make up to 50% in local councils or in village councils, up to 54%. It is in these lower ranking, lower paying, less visible, yet highly demanding and responsible positions that I have been inspired by the power of Ukrainian women’s leadership. I have been privileged to meet women whose lives are dedicated to caring for their communities. On this International Women’s Day, I salute these women who are champions for what I believe transformational leadership is all about: from the director of the school who is passionate and creative in finding solutions to help disadvantaged children from the Roma community, the social workers, directors of centers for IDPs, shelters for homeless, older persons, or survivors of violence, to directors of hospitals offering palliative care for patients with chronic diseases, heads of kindergartens and schools in conflict-affected settings where access to even basic services remains a challenge and humanitarian needs are acute, department heads in municipalities responsible for social services, heads of community centers, cultural centers, libraries.
Today let us make visible the leadership of countless women who devote their lives with empathy and selfless dedication - not for the pay or the glory - but for their human centered belief in the cause of keeping communities cohesive and resilient in the face of any and all adversities - from insufficient budgets, to unrelenting challenges of conflict, now surmounted by COVID-19. Let us commit today to lifting, emulating, and scaling up their kind of transformational leadership to the highest levels.
The UN in Ukraine welcomes the national efforts to systematically address existing gender inequality, including inequalities in the labour market. Increasing participation of women in the labour market and ensuring their leadership at all levels in all sectors, would translate into an accelerator of progress across all SDGs. Ukraine’s European aspirations alongside Agenda 2030 are powerful guides to bringing more equality and justice into all walks of life, including the productive life which takes at least half of a human lifetime. We need bold decisive action across the world to bring women into the heart of the decision-making spaces in large numbers and as full partners, so that we can make immediate progress on a sustainable, equitable and inclusive world.

Title: UNDP to release report on position of women in Ukrainian economy
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 March 2021
Ukraine ranks second in Europe in the share of women among managers and entrepreneurs (self-employed), the ratio of men to women among managers of legal entities and private entrepreneurs was 59.5 percent men to 40.5 percent women in 2020 – much higher than the world average.
These were among the findings of the report “Women and Men in Leadership Positions in Ukraine: 2017-2020,” which UNDP plans to release in April 2021.
The report, carried out by the Ukrainian Centre for Social Data (UCSD) on behalf of the United Nations Development Programme in Ukraine (UNDP) and with the support of the Swiss government, studied open data from Ukraine’s Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Individual Entrepreneurs and Public Associations, or USREOU.
UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine Dafina Gercheva said advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment is a strong accelerator of development. It is central to UNDP’s mandate and integrated service offer to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development.
“The results of this report show a slight improvement towards gender equality in Ukraine, however much more is needed to ensure gender parity and women’s empowerment”, Gercheva said.
“In the last three years, the overall share of women in leadership positions in Ukraine has increased by nearly half a percentage point to 40.48 percent. This is much higher than the global average of 29 percent.”
Until recently, Ukraine has not been collecting gender-disaggregated statistics, making it difficult to fully assess the differences in the positions of men and women in the economic sphere in Ukraine, or in the management bodies of the country’s organizations and enterprises.
Nicole Ruder, Head of Cooperation, Embassy of Switzerland in Ukraine, said the data about women as entrepreneurs and organizational leaders in Ukraine was more than just a snapshot of the gender dimension in the private sector: “Used wisely, this research can be instrumental for building an appropriate support infrastructure for women entrepreneurship and the development of women's business associations,” Ruder said.
“It’s our hope that the results of this research will be useful for those actors and stakeholders, both governmental and non-governmental, who are working to empower women and to achieve full gender equality in Ukraine.”
The UCSD analysed USREOU data published on the Unified State Portal of Open Data by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine. The dataset as of 7 August 2020 was used for the analysis – the most recent one available. The study is a follow-up to the first large-scale study “Women and Men in Leadership Positions in Ukraine,” which was conducted within the framework of the UNDP project “Strengthening Small and Medium Business Associations” in 2017.
The study found that:
• The gender imbalance among managers and entrepreneurs in the capital Kyiv is much more pronounced compared to the national average. Kyiv is also in the top ten districts and cities with the lowest share of women among managers and private entrepreneurs
• The directors and private entrepreneurs in most sectors of the economy are still predominately men
• The share of women in general increased from 2017 to 2020 by 0.5 percentage points
• Ukraine ranks second in Europe in the share of women among managers and entrepreneurs (self-employed)
• Women predominate in “Accommodation and Food Service Activities”, “Public Administration and Defense”, “Human Health and Social Work Activities”, and predominate most in the “Education” and “Activities of Households as Employers” sectors.
The study "Women and Men in Management Positions in Ukraine: 2017-2020" was conducted by experts from the UCSD as part of the "Strengthening Business Associations of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises" project, which is implemented by UNDP in Ukraine in cooperation with the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture of Ukraine and with the support of the government of Switzerland. UCSD experts developed unique interactive tools to analyze open USR data, which are available here.

Title: UN opens inclusive dialogue for enhancing migration governance in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
05 March 2021
“Migration is crucial for the socioeconomic development of Ukraine; it also represents a key area of the country cooperation framework with the European Union as well as countries in the region and beyond,” said Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine.
COVID-19 has accelerated the need for a comprehensive migration governance framework as envisaged by the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, but also the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement. The pandemic may force up to a quarter of Ukrainian migrants to return, remittances may drop by 20%, and returning migrants are in danger of stigmatisation.
“Ukraine has been a country of origin of labour migration for a long time. According to different estimates, there are currently between 3-5 million Ukrainian migrant workers,” said Anh Nguyen, Chief of Mission at IOM Ukraine. “However, as the economy grows and the demand for labour cannot be matched internally, we will see negative economic, social and security impacts as the flow of labour into Ukraine would be drawn even more from the grey sector if not properly managed or regulated,” he added.
The UN Country Team in Ukraine is convinced that an effective response requires a coordinated whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach that benefits migrants and society and involves full respect for human rights. To this end, Ukraine’s Strategy of State Migration Policy must be accelerated, stakeholder capacity enhanced, and mechanisms for coordination institutionalised and made inclusive.
· Dialogue and cooperation with host countries must be strengthened to protect human rights and to establish well-governed and managed mobility corridors, without leaving the most vulnerable behind.
· Remittance channels must be formalised and simplified, positive domestic conditions and incentives must be created to entice people to stay, to stimulate permanent and temporary Ukrainian migrant and diaspora return and to secure their investment in a productive economy.
· COVID-19 returnees to Ukraine, workers unable to leave and their families must be supported to generate income and aid their integration into the domestic labour market. Their communities and SMEs need support to adapt to changing needs.
· Pathways for safe and regular migration into Ukraine should be opened, by regularising irregular migration, and by granting access to the labour market and official employment where the economy demands.
The dialogue initiated through the launch of the UN Policy Paper, will help validate these recommendations and aims to translate those into concrete actions for reaping the benefits of migration while minimizing the costs. Based on the outcomes of this broad-based dialogue with migration stakeholders in Ukraine, the UN Country Team in Ukraine aims to formulate the new migration-related commitments under the new partnership framework with the Government of Ukraine.
__________________________________________________________________________________
Safe, orderly and regular migration with full respect for human rights is crucial to achieving a wide range of Sustainable Development Goals. The 2030 Agenda recognizes the positive contribution of migrants for inclusive growth and the multidimensional reality of migration. The SDGs consider migrant women, men and children as a vulnerable group to be protected. And Ukrainian migrant workers continue to be at risk to fraudulent recruitment, exploitation and abuse. An estimated 260,000 Ukrainians have fallen victim to human trafficking since 1991, and last year IOM, the UN Migration Agency, assisted a record number of 1,680 Ukrainians who had fallen prey to traffickers in 25 different countries as well as in Ukraine. Yet, the 2030 Agenda also recognises migrants as agents of development. They are integral to the economies of their host countries. They enrich their home countries with knowledge and new skill sets when they return, and they are senders of vital remittances. In Ukraine, this amount reached almost USD 16 billion in 2019, or 10 per cent of GDP.

Title: ‘Infodemic’ of COVID-19 disinformation bad for Ukrainians health, study for UN finds
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
03 March 2021
Ukrainians’ health could be damaged by an ongoing “infodemic” of false and misleading information about the novel coronavirus pandemic, research carried out for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has found.
From March to November 2020, researchers tracked more than 30 million social media messages using the advanced social media monitoring and analytics platform SemanticForce. The study identified over 250,000 messages with disinformation narratives related to COVID-19 in Ukrainian online media, forums, blogs, messenger and social networks.
The study found that false narratives decrease people's willingness to comply with public health guidance (wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, etc.) and make them less likely to recommend vaccination to vulnerable people in their social circle. Moreover, an uncontrolled infodemic had the potential to significantly increase exposure to the COVID-19 disease, the study concluded.
The false narratives identified included fake information related to wearing masks, conspiracy theories about the origin and even existence of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 disease, and false rumours about the effectiveness of coronavirus testing and vaccines.
UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine Dafina Gercheva said the studied showed the infodemic is a real threat to public health in Ukraine, and that it was important for the government to join efforts with non-government organizations, fact-checkers and social media influencers to fight it.
“Conspiracy theories, rumours and malicious disinformation can quickly go viral on social media, especially when there is a low level of public trust in state institutions,” Gercheva said.
“Our study found that by combining the efforts of government, the media, influencers, and other trusted sources, the spread of reliable information can be promoted, and the danger of disinformation about COVID-19 countered.”
In combination with the social media monitoring, the study quizzed 1,000 Ukrainians in a survey of the public’s views of the pandemic. Among the survey’s findings were that around a third of Ukrainians believe their chances of contracting the novel coronavirus are low. The public’s top-three preferred information sources are social media (42 percent), TV (26 percent), and doctors and medics (24 percent). Despite that, Ukrainians said the sources they trust the most are personal doctors and medics (39 percent) and doctors and healthcare professionals (via media) (29 percent), while only 27 percent trust social media as a source of reliable information.
UNICEF Representative in Ukraine Lotta Sylwander underlined that the risks of misinformation have never been higher.
“The infodemic threatens to augment vaccine hesitancy, which in turn could complicate the introduction of new vaccines and erode public trust in the healthcare system,” Sylwander said.
“As the pandemic continues to create uncertainty and anxiety, there is an urgent need for stronger action and a coordinated approach to address fake news and disinformation,” she added.
“Without the appropriate trust and correct information, immunization campaigns will not meet their targets, and the virus will continue to thrive.”
The study offered a range of recommendations for government, media and social media platforms on how to fight the COVID-19 infodemic. The government was recommended to set up a centralized COVID-19 Command Centre to coordinate key groups (the government, non-governmental organizations, fact-checking organizations, media, influencers). To counter the high level of distrust in the government, it should systematically engage influencers of various categories to promote public health messaging, the study said.
Other recommendations include leveraging humour to increase the spread of important public health information, supporting fact-checking organizations with grants, media collaborations and special sections on web sites, and encouraging social media to customize their algorithms to tag disinformation and reduce its occurrence in social media users’ news feeds.

26 February 2021
Irpin (Ukraine), 25 February 2021 – More than 18,000 patients will benefit annually from the diagnostic equipment that the Ambassador of Japan, H.E. Takashi Kurai handed over to the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anatolii Petrenko, in a ceremony at the Military Medical Centre in Irpin today. The digital x-ray is delivered within the “Emergency Assistance for the Healthcare System of Ukraine” project, implemented by UNOPS, with the financial support of the people of Japan of USD 1,736,545.
Thanking the Government of Japan and the UNOPS for cooperation, Deputy Minister Petrenko, added his appreciation of the medical staff, and the “great job in rehabilitation and for being in the frontline of the struggle with COVID-19”.
H.E. Takashi Kurai, the Ambassador of Japan to Ukraine, highlighted the continuous support of Japan to the country, in “its efforts for further democratisation and economic reforms since independence. Since 2014, Japan has allocated approximately USD 1.88 billion in grants and loans to Ukraine”. The Ambassador added that this year Japan will fund an additional project worth USD 1.75 million with UNOPS, for the medical assistance to the Ministry of Defence. “ This will increase the total amount of this kind of support to almost USD 6.5 million since 2014”.
During 2020 project, UNOPS also procured equipment for the Military Medical Centre in Kharkiv - one surgical microscope and electrosurgical system for laparoscopy and Military Medical Centre in Lviv - x-ray system, one stationery digital x-ray system for two working spaces and one electrosurgical system for laparoscopy. Training was provided to all medical personnel who use the equipment.
“At UNOPS, we are honored to be a part of this joint effort. We all know that modern medical equipment is vital for the health system of any country, especially for essential health services during the time of pandemic. UNOPS will continue maintaining the highest international standards in project management and procurement to ensure that the hospitals in Ukraine receive the best equipment possible”, Irina Sahakyan Vetter, UNOPS Ukraine Director, said.
The Military Medical Clinical Centre in Irpin was established in 2014, and conducts around 18,000 radiographic diagnostics every year. The delivered digital x-ray system will contribute not only to the number of patients that can be diagnosed, but also to the quality of the imagery.
Previous projects, implemented by UNOPS, with support of the people of Japan since 2016, provided the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine as well as the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine with modernised medical equipment, the National Police of Ukraine with the radio communications equipment, the State Emergency Services with the demining equipment, and the water company situated in the conflict-affected areas with the utility vehicles and personal protective equipment.

Title: UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine and Ombudsperson agreed on cooperation on a number of strategic areas
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
19 February 2021
The Letter of Intent, signed by UN in Ukraine and Ombudsperson will bring ongoing cooperation of both offices to a new strategic level.
The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine Osnat Lubrani and Liudmyla Denisova, the Ombudsperson for Ukraine met to discuss strategic priorities of work in 2021. During the discussion the parties found a wide range of issues for joint cooperation, considering that human rights is the basis for work of all UN organizations in Ukraine.  Ms. Denisova stressed that her views on cooperation fully coincide with the UN’s international priorities and most of them are reflected in the strategic areas of activity of Ombudsperson’s office for the ongoing year, as well as in the plan of measures for their implementation.
One of the priority areas of cooperation between UN and Ombudsperson’s Office Ms. Denisova named coordination of advocacy for the transfer of persons, that were imprisoned before the start of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine and the transfer of 220 criminal cases against 230 persons and proceedings remaining in courts and law enforcement agencies in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The separate working meeting with the UN will be scheduled to discuss this issue in details.
Achievement of SGDs, especially SDG#10 – Reduced Inequalities and SDG#8 – Decent Work is on the top of the agenda in Ombudsperson’s team, Ms. Denisova noted. Ms. Lubrani, the UN Resident Coordinator, express her willingness to further work on a joint communication and advocacy campaigns on SDGs with the office of the Ombudsperson.
Ms. Lubrani and Ms. Denisova also highlighted a need to address a number of Roma issues in Ukraine and agreed to conduct a joint visits to Roma settlements and communities throughout Ukraine.  In this regard, the special report "The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Roma Community in Ukraine", recently presented by Ms. Denisova, will further involve experts from UN agencies in Ukraine to work on the implementation of the recommendations provided in the report.
Ms. Osnat Lubrani noted that report on Socio-Economic Impact of COVID-19, recently presented by UN Office in Ukraine, revealed that vulnerable groups in Ukraine disproportionally suffered from the pandemic, so she emphasized that, first of all, joint efforts of cooperation with the Ombudsperson is going to be focused on helping these priority groups. Among them UN RC listed women that suffered from gender-based violence that significantly increased during pandemic, children, single mothers, people with disability, people living with HIV and chronical diseases, rural women, health workers, asylum seekers, refugees and those who lost their jobs due to pandemic or those are in danger of loosing it.
Ms. Lubrani also added that UN Office has a full capacity to cooperate with Ms Denisova on countering of hate speech which remains a highly acute problem in Ukraine.
Ms. Denisova praised the good results of cooperation with UN Agencies in Ukraine, in particular, she commended joint work with UNDP on COVID-19 report that will be published in early March. Also, she expressed hope that the Memorandum with ILO that was signed at the end of 2020 will strengthen the capacities of the Ombudsperson’s office for advocating of labor rights in Ukraine. Further cooperation of Ombudsperson with ILO will include such important areas as approving the roadmap for  payment of wage arrears to Ukrainian citizens and developing a new version of the Labor Code in Ukraine
At the end, Ms. Denisova stressed the need to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, improve the institutional capacity of the national preventive mechanism and raise awareness of Ukrainian society about human and civil rights and freedoms.
In 2021 UN in Ukraine together with the Ombudsperson will also conduct a joint study on the integration of migrants in the country and present a special report on the rights of migrants in Ukraine.

Title: UNICEF and PrivatBank CF deliver another batch of oxygen equipment to hospitals
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
11 February 2021
This is the second batch of oxygen equipment UNICEF procured and shipped in partnership with the PrivatBank CF for Ukrainian hospitals in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The oxygen concentrators have already been delivered to the regions of Ukraine. These are Kyiv, Cherkasy, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Lviv, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Volyn and Zakarpattia regions.
Healthcare facilities to receive the equipment were selected factoring the support of other partners on the ground, worsening dynamics in number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and availability of oxygen-supplied beds. According to UNICEF, the average bed occupancy rate in the targeted hospitals is at least 70%.
“The need for oxygen will remain high in the near future. That is why we are grateful to the Foundation for their contribution in helping hospitals receive what they need the most. This partnership is an excellent example of the corporate social responsibility and significant results, when we work as one,” said Lotta Sylwander, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine. “UNICEF is open to collaboration with private sector and appreciates every opportunity to help families in Ukraine during the pandemic.”
“Since the pandemic began, the Foundation has prioritised an oxygen support to hospitals as its key area of intervention. We know the real cost of every breath, and appreciate this opportunity to help Ukrainian hospitals in efficient and tailored manner,” added Anna Pavlova, Director of PrivatBank CF “Helping is Easy!”.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, UNICEF has procured and delivered 463 oxygen concentrators to Ukraine thanks to various partnerships.
UNICEF continues to work with the public and private sectors to support the Government of Ukraine in its response to the pandemic and in preparing for future vaccination against COVID-19 as part of COVAX Facility.

Title: EU supports opening of two clubs for fathers in Vinnytsia and Odesa
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 December 2020
The two clubs were opened in the framework of the “EU 4 Gender Equality: Together against gender stereotypes and gender-based violence” programme, funded by the European Union, implemented jointly by UN Women and UNFPA. Opening similar fathers’ clubs is expected in other Ukrainian cities as well.
“Ukraine is part of the first regional programme covering gender equality in the Eastern Partnership region,” said Martin Schroeder, Head of Operations Section  "Local and Human Development" at the European Union Delegation to Ukraine. “The programme relies on strategies designed to challenge structural gender barriers and norms, with particular emphasis on transforming gender-stereotyped behaviour, strengthening men’s involvement in parenting and domestic responsibilities, and reducing the number of people affected by gender-based violence through prevention interventions with potential perpetrators.”
The established fathers’ clubs have an important educational component which consists of classes on child psychology, stress management, non-violent communication, sexuality education, overcoming gender and other harmful stereotypes. Moreover, they offer classes for new and future parents.
“The latest researches in Ukraine illustrate the prevalence of traditional attitudes with roughly 70% of men believing that the most important role for women is to ‘take care of the house’ and more than 60% agree that mother is the main caretaker of children in families,” – said Jaime Nadal, UNFPA Ukraine Representative to Ukraine. “These attitudes and misconceptions represent a barrier for women to enjoy equal opportunities in life, especially when it comes to career development and economic resilience.”
Fathers’ clubs help men to build stronger relationships with their children and be more engaged in the caretaking process. Around 5% of male workers in Ukraine took paternity leave annually, which means that the biggest load of caretaking and household chores falls on women.

Title: United Nations and WHO in Ukraine presented the UN Policy Paper on Universal Health Coverage
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
17 December 2020
In 2020 the United Nations in Ukraine has developed a series of the UN Policy Papers - analytical documents created jointly by all 16 UN agencies, funds and programs in Ukraine, with the aim to identify policy and priority issues that hinder or pose a risk to sustainable development in Ukraine; and which correspond to contemporary Ukrainian reform priorities (i.e., land reform, social protection, labour legislation reform, health reform etc.).
Health is a fundamental human right, and Universal Health Coverage is its principal expression.
Universal Health Coverage fulfils the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. It means that all people and communities have access to the health services they need and without suffering financial hardship, and that these services are of such quality that they are effective. COVID-19 has vividly demonstrated to all the humanity the importance of a modern health system, to respond effectively to health crises and pandemics, to provide citizens with the health services they need, and to promote critical development goals.
In response to this need the UN Policy Paper on Universal Health Coverage has been developed by the UN Agencies, based on a global best practices, as a set of positions and recommendations, targeting government officials, medical workers, development partners, civil society organizations and wide public in Ukraine.
Speaking on the official launch of the policy paper, WHO Representative, Dr. Jarno Habicht noted:
“Ukraine has made bold steps towards universal health coverage, however there is still much to be done to ensure better health for everyone in Ukraine. The new United Nations Policy Paper on Universal Health Coverage allows us to evaluate progress and provides policy considerations for the future to ensure that all Ukrainians have access to good quality health services and no Ukrainian will have to experience catastrophic health expenditures or become poor when they use health services,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine.
UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine, Ms. Osnat Lubrani said that health has been and is staying very high on the agenda of United Nations agencies and international partners in Ukraine.
In particular, she highlighted that all reforms that currently take place in Ukraine, must be gender-sensitive and inclusive, especially of the most vulnerable and marginalized.
“And above all, despite COVID-19, the Government must prioritize the health sector, it must safeguard and reinvest efficiency gains towards health service improvements, and it must provide a stable and predictable mid-term budget that at the very least maintains current levels of per capita health spending in real term”. – Osnat Lubrani stressed. – “As the UN Resident Coordinator, I wanted to say once again that achieving Universal health coverage is everyone’s business and everyone has its part. The COVID pandemic has demonstrated that the stronger the health system, health financing service delivery, the easier it is to respond to COVID. After the outbreak working on strengthening of health systems and UHC will become even more crucial as it prepares us for the next potential outbreaks”.

Mykhailo Radutskyi, Chairperson of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Committee on Public Health, Medical Assistance and Medical Insurance outlined the challenges and successes in transformation of medical system in Ukraine:
“The basic step for the implementation of universal coverage for the population of Ukraine was the laws adopted by the Parliament on the autonomy of health care facilities and state financial guarantees in 2017. Now we can say that thanks to these two laws adopted on the primary healthcare, 33 million of our citizens use the services of family doctors. We started the second stage [of healthcare reform] last year, but not everything is going as smoothly as we would like, and there are four reasons for that. The first challenge - and we are not unique here, as the whole world community is facing it - is the COVID-19 pandemic. The second problem is the economic crisis, due to which we cannot fully finance the package of medical guarantees. The third reason is the mixed perception of changes in the health care system, both among some doctors, and among patients. The very high level of corruption in the medical system is also a problem. However, one of the great achievements during the reforming process, in particular, thanks to our international partners, is the establishment of a state-owned enterprise for medical procurement. This is very important, especially now, while we are waiting for COVID-19 vaccine”.
Igor Ivashchenko, Deputy Minister of Health of Ukraine:
"Ukraine has recently faced two challenges - the COVID-19 pandemic and the start of health care reform [stage 2]. And in this regard Ukraine's greatest achievement was that the start of the reform was not postponed. The reform has significantly changed all aspects of health care coverage and delivery, including the financing system, the e-health system, referrals to doctors, the involvement of private clinics in the reform, the expansion of the reimbursement program, and the change in the medical procurement system itself. In fact, in addition to changing the funding system, the reform has maximally expanded the full range of mechanisms by which healthcare facilities work with the National Healthcare Service and the Ministry of Health.”
The UN Policy Paper on UHC outlines the main recommendations to achieve universal health coverage in Ukraine, in particular, modernization of hospital care at secondary and tertiary level, the restructuring of Ukraine’s outdated hospital network, the continued development of primary health care and the broadening of access to priority medicines.
As noted in the UN Policy Paper on UHC, the Government must continue to provide leadership and clear direction, and it must support and defend difficult reform decisions.

Title: COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated hardships and discrimination faced by people in Ukraine, says UN Human Rights

17 December 2020
“The closure of entry-exit crossing points in eastern Ukraine has resulted in the separation of families, and the loss of already limited access to healthcare, education, pensions and sources of income for people living there”, said Matilda Bogner, Head of the HRMMU.
The monthly average number of crossings through the contact line in eastern Ukraine decreased from 1.1 million in 2019, to less than three hundred as a consequence of the closure of all five entry-exit crossing points from late March to late June 2020. Although crossings of the contact line have increased since June, their levels remain low, especially in Donetsk region, due to restrictions.
In relation to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation (Crimea), the report highlights that restrictions on freedom of movement introduced by the Governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation have also significantly affected people’s access to work, education, healthcare, property and family links.
“While some of the restrictions might be necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, where persons need to cross on humanitarian grounds, all parties must ensure that freedom of movement is respected, and that crossings of the contact line and ABL are quick, safe and dignified,” said Bogner.
The report also states that people in detention are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as some detention facilities are overcrowded and cannot fully comply with prevention measures such as physical distancing. In Government-controlled territory, the number of cases amongst penitentiary staff grew rapidly in October and November, increasing the risk of infection among detainees and prisoners. While no reliable figures regarding COVID-19 cases in detention are available in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’, self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’ and in Crimea, persons in detention there reportedly lacked personal protective equipment and access to adequate healthcare.
Access to justice and the right to a public trial were also affected by COVID-19-related restrictions, with some courts prohibiting observers and journalists access to their premises.
The report also highlights incidents of hate speech and discriminatory acts towards different groups, including persons potentially infected by the COVID-19, LGBTI, Roma, homeless persons and healthcare workers, as a direct or indirect consequence of the pandemic. It further documented the involvement of public authorities in hate speech incidents, in clear breach of their human rights obligations.
The report highlights the COVID-19 impact on frontline healthcare workers who must deal with heavy workloads while facing issues such as the lack of healthy and safe working conditions, fair remuneration and mental health support services.
“Conditions of work of all healthcare workers must be improved. Female and male healthcare workers need to receive decent pay, safe and healthy conditions of work, and compensation for work related illnesses and injuries, including for COVID-19,” Bogner added.
The report emphasizes that response measures should ensure that no one is left behind, particularly those from vulnerable groups who were already facing discrimination.
“People in vulnerable situations, like Roma, persons with disabilities, older persons and persons living in homelessness, and particularly women and girls within these groups, faced even more limited enjoyment of the rights to health, work, education and an adequate standard of living since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic”, she said.
It concludes with targeted recommendations, both short-term and long-term, to the Government and other actors to remove existing barriers and combat discrimination. The Government should also consult representatives of groups at risk and civil society while designing and implementing COVID-19 responses and socio-economic recovery measures.
“We know that further human rights concerns are expected to emerge, as the number of infections in Ukraine continues to rise and the impact of the pandemic is constantly evolving. Placing human rights up front and centre provides a roadmap to ensure we leave no one behind and recover better, creating a more resilient society”, Bogner concluded.

Title: Ukraine inches forward in human development
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
16 December 2020
Ukraine recorded slow but steady development progress over the previous year, according to this year’s Human Development Report, released today by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
Ukraine’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.779— which put the country in the high human development category— positioning it at 74 out of 189 countries and territories. The rank is shared with Grenada, Mexico and Saint Kitts and Nevis. Between 1990 and 2019, Ukraine’s HDI value increased from 0.725 to 0.779, an increase of 7.4 percent.
Dafina Gercheva, UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine said Ukraine’s Gender Development Index (GDI), a component of the overall human development index tracking gender-based inequality, was showing progress.
“Ukraine saw gains in women’s representation in parliament last year, and its GDI value of 1.000 is better than the regional average of 0.953,” Gercheva said.
“But there remains a lot to do to ensure equal access to opportunities and choices for men and women in Ukraine.”
While globally Ukraine is in the high human development category (HDI above 0.753), it is below the average for the Europe and Central Asia region (0.791), and it lags behind other large countries in the region Kazakhstan (0.825) and Russia (0.824).
The new report includes a series of adjustments to take into account inequalities in society, meaning that the components of the index are not directly comparable with those given in previous reports.
As HDI is an average measure of basic human development achievements across a country, the HDI masks inequality in the distribution of human development across the population at the country level. To capture the effect of inequality on human development, the 2010 Human Development Report introduced the IHDI, which takes into account inequality in all components of the HDI (by ‘discounting’ each component’s average value according to its level of inequality.)
When so adjusted, Ukraine has an IHDI of 0.728, with a “loss” of development due to inequality of 6.5 percent. While it still trails both Kazakhstan (0.766) and Russia (0.740), their respective losses, at 7.2 percent and 10.2 percent, are higher, reflecting greater inequalities in these countries. Ukraine also edges ahead of the average IHDI for Europe and Central Asia (0.697), where the average loss of development due to inequality in 11.9 percent.
The report data depicts the state of human development before the COVID-19 pandemic. Data reflecting changes caused by the pandemic and its socioeconomic fallout in 2020 will be available in 2021 and will be presented in tables and related analyses of the 2021 Human Development Report, UNDP said.
The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest crisis facing the world, but unless humans release their grip on nature, it won’t be the last, the report warns. It includes a new experimental index on human progress that takes into account countries’ carbon dioxide emissions and material footprint.
The wider report lays out a stark choice for world leaders – take bold steps to reduce the immense pressure that is being exerted on the environment and the natural world, or humanity’s progress will stall.
“Humans wield more power over the planet than ever before. In the wake of COVID-19, record-breaking temperatures and spiralling inequality, it is time to use that power to redefine what we mean by progress, where our carbon and consumption footprints are no longer hidden,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.
“As this report shows, no country in the world has yet achieved very high human development without putting immense strain on the planet. But we could be the first generation to right this wrong. That is the next frontier for human development,” he said.
The report argues that as people and planet enter an entirely new geological epoch, the Anthropocene or the Age of Humans, it is time to for all countries to redesign their paths to progress by fully accounting for the dangerous pressures humans put on the planet, and dismantle the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that prevent change.
To illustrate the point, the 30th anniversary edition of the Human Development Report, The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene, introduces an experimental new lens to its annual Human Development Index (HDI).
By adjusting the HDI, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standards of living, to include two more elements: a country’s carbon dioxide emissions and its material footprint, the index shows how the global development landscape would change if both the wellbeing of people and also the planet were central to defining humanity’s progress.
With the resulting Planetary-Pressures Adjusted HDI – or PHDI – a new global picture emerges, painting a less rosy but clearer assessment of human progress. For example, more than 50 countries drop out of the very high human development group, reflecting their dependence on fossil fuels and material footprint.
Despite these adjustments, countries like Costa Rica, Moldova, and Panama move upwards by at least 30 places, recognizing that lighter pressure on the planet is possible.
“The Human Development Report is an important product by the United Nations. In a time where action is needed, the new generation of Human Development Reports, with greater emphasis on the defining issues of our time such as climate change and inequalities, helps us to steer our efforts towards the future we want,” said Stefan Löfven, Prime Minister of Sweden, host country of the launch of the report.
The next frontier for human development will require working with and not against nature, while transforming social norms, values, and government and financial incentives, the report argues.
For example, new estimates project that by 2100 the poorest countries in the world could experience up to 100 more days of extreme weather due to climate change each year- a number that could be cut in half if the Paris Agreement on climate change is fully implemented.

Title: UN Human Rights Office to release its new report on the impact of COVID-19 on human rights in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 December 2020
Matilda Bogner, Head of Mission, will present the report at a press briefing at 13:15 on Thursday, 17 December 2020, at the Ukraine Crisis Media Centre (Khreshchatyk Street, 2 (Ukrainian House), Kyiv).
The report covers the period from 20 February 2020 to 6 December 2020. It describes hardships and deprivations faced by the conflict-affected population in eastern Ukraine, in particular because of restrictions on freedom of movement and their impact on the enjoyment of social and economic rights. The report also covers the effect of COVID-19-related restrictions on groups in vulnerable situations, and particularly women and girls within these groups, which include healthcare workers; Roma; persons with disabilities and older persons, in particular those living in long-term care facilities; and persons living in homelessness.
The report concludes with recommendations of targeted actions that will enable the Government and other actors to ensure that human rights are at the core of the COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.
The press conference will be in English, with interpretation into Ukrainian and sign language.

Title: UN launches joint programme to help Ukraine finance work on Sustainable Development Goals
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
14 December 2020
The United Nations Development System in Ukraine has launched another flagship initiative to strengthen Ukraine’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) financing architecture at the national and regional levels.
The United Nations Joint Programme on SDG Financing in Ukraine will develop new public and private financing solutions, while ensuring the more efficient use of existing finances, in alignment with Ukrainian government priorities. The joint programme, which has almost US$1 million in financing and which will run until the end of July 2022, will work closely with the Prime Minister’s Office, the Secretariat of the Cabinet of Ministers and line ministries to optimize resource allocation and identify new sources of financing.
UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine Dafina Gercheva said UNDP would serve as the technical lead for the new initiative, working closely with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
“This new and exciting joint programme leverages the comparative advantages of an interagency approach under the overall leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office,” Gercheva said.
“It emerged out of the UN Joint SDG Fund, an innovative instrument launched by the UN Secretary General this year to encourage transformative policy shifts accompanied by the strategic investments required to accelerate progress in attaining the SDGs.”
The joint programme has the expected overarching outcomes of improving Ukraine’s SDG planning and financing architecture at both the national and the decentralised, regional levels. The programme will focus on producing a Development Financing Assessment to help form SDG-oriented financing priorities at the national and region levels, improving strategic planning and budgeting for the health sector nationally and in the regions, and adopting and leveraging new SDG financing mechanisms.
Background

Title: Ukrainians became more tolerant and active in defending their rights: results of the survey
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
10 December 2020
The results of the third wave of the national sociological survey "What Ukrainians know and think about human rights: assessment of changes (2016 - 2020)" were presented on Human Rights Day. The survey was conducted in 2020 by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation in cooperation with the ZMINA Human Rights Centre supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Ukraine.
The top priorities for Ukrainians continue to be freedom (84 percent of respondents said it was core value), justice (72 percent), and security (63 percent). However, compared to 2016, the importance of security for Ukrainians as a fundamental value has decreased by 8 percent. Compared with the results of polling in 2016, the number of Ukrainians for whom tolerance is a fundamental value increased in 2020 by 6 percent – one-third of Ukrainians consider it to be a fundamental value.
This is the third large-scale survey of human rights in Ukraine conducted by UNDP and its partners, but this year the results of the polling were affected by the global crisis caused by the pandemic. This might be the reason for some of the changes identified by the study, among which are some positive tendencies. Specifically, Ukrainians became more active in defending their rights and more tolerant of each other, according to Svitlana Kolyshko, Human Rights Team Lead and UNDP Ukraine Project Manager
“The COVID-19 pandemic affected everyone and made Ukrainians re-evaluate their views and attitudes to each other,” Kolyshko said. “Tolerance and respect for human rights should be at the forefront of the response to the global crisis. They will help Ukraine to move forward in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Agenda 2030.”
Compared with 2018, this year’s results show that Ukrainians’ willingness to agree to restrictions on the rights of certain social groups has decreased, specifically their readiness to restrict the rights of former convicts (-3.8 percent), representatives of the LGBTQI + community (-3.2 percent), persons with drug addictions (-1.8 percent), homeless people (-1.8 percent), people with specific political views (-1.6 percent) and Roma people (-1.4 percent).
Ukrainians score the observance of human rights below average levels. Specifically, on a scale of 1 to 5, the observance of cultural rights was scored as 3.2 points, political rights – the right to choose authorities, to establish political parties or civil society organizations, the right to freedom of assembly – scored 3.1 points, fundamental rights – right to life, personal freedom, freedom of speech – were scored as 2.9 points, ecological, and social and economic rights – 2.5 points.
Andriy Sukharyna, a political analyst at the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, said that this year the assessment of how different rights are observed has somewhat improved compared to 2016 and 2018.
“Respondents better assessed political and cultural rights’ observance in 2020 compared to previous years,” Sukharyna said. “However, most of the scores remain low, specifically, the observance of social and economic rights, or ecological rights, are assessed by the respondents as being below a satisfactory level.”
During the COVID-19 crisis, Ukrainians have become more active in defending their rights. The number of respondents who have tried to defend their rights increased from 42 percent in 2016 up to 60 percent in 2020. The number of men and women who succeeded in defending their rights also increased, from 14.5 percent in 2016 to 19.3 percent in 2020.
However, along with legal mechanisms of defending their rights like going to court (16 percent), Ukrainians used non-legal methods, such as turning to relatives or friends for help (15 percent).
In 2020, the attitude of Ukrainians to lynch law changed. In 2020, 60 percent of respondents consider lynch law unacceptable, while in 2016 only 50 percent of respondents thought so. At the same time, since 2016, the share of respondents who are willing to justify taking the law into their own hands under certain circumstances, as well as those who consider it the only possible way to protect their rights, has significantly decreased.
The survey shows that during the past year, 85 percent of Ukrainians have not participated in any protest action, even on social media. Along with this, about 25 percent think that the most effective way to protect rights is to address the media, while 22 percent think that there are no effective mechanisms to protect their rights.
“Though the number of people supporting lynch law has decreased, still about half of Ukrainians do not believe in state mechanisms to protect their rights,” said Volodymyr Yavosrky, an expert from the ZMINA Human Rights Centre. “This demonstrates a long-lasting crisis in the judiciary and law-enforcement spheres. Weak mechanisms to protect rights and lack of trust leads to a decline in people’s activeness in protecting their rights. This might cause negative tendencies, as the human rights situation improves in those countries where people stand up for their rights,” said Yavosrky. Check  here  for more results
Background information:
A nationwide survey on human rights in Ukraine was conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation on October 6–19, 2020. A total of 2,002 respondents were interviewed face-to-face in a sample representing the adult population of Ukraine (excluding the non-government controlled territories). The sample is representative of such indicators as gender, age, type of settlement, and area of residence. The maximum random sampling error does not exceed 2.2%.
This is the third nationwide survey “What Ukrainians Know and Think About Human Rights” conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic initiatives foundation in cooperation with the ZMINA Human Rights Centre with the support of the Human Rights for Ukraine project, which is implemented by UNDP Ukraine and financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark. The results of the previous studies conducted in 2016 and 2018 are available at the website.

Title: EU challenges gender stereotypes in a new awareness-raising campaign "Fight Like a Girl"
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
09 December 2020
“Gender-based and domestic violence are human rights violations. Gender stereotypes fuel the continuous existence of this plight. Equipping young people, notably girls and young women against violence, and giving them tools to dismantle stereotypes is key to a more democratic, safer and more prosperous future. There could not be a better name for this campaign than #fightlikeagirl and the EU is happy support UN Women, UNFPA and Gender Stream as representatives of Ukrainian civil society in its implementation”, said Martin Schroeder, Head of the Local and Human Development Section at the EU Delegation to Ukraine.
The campaign is the part of the global campaign 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, which takes place annually from 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, till 10 December, Human Rights Day.
The project Fight Like a Girl launches fifteen entertaining explanatory videos that will debunk stereotypes on women and girls and teach the audience how to identify different forms of gender-based violence and understand some forms of cybercrimes that affect women and girls. Consent to sex, sexual security during COVID-19 pandemic, understanding toxic relationships will bring up and explain essential topics for girls and young women. The series of videos on self-defense, created in partnership with the National Police of Ukraine, will teach women and girls how to respond to potential attacks of an abuser and ensure safe escape.
The campaign is produced by the NGO Gender Stream, a grassroots women's rights initiative from Dnipro, and UN Women in Ukraine. It speaks in a friendly and fun voice of a trusted peer and friend on a Instagram account @FLG_UA, and promotes the hashtags #бийсяякдівчина #fightlikeagirl.
In a series of 15 videos, the audience will hear the voices of Ukrainian influencers:
● Stanislav Korolev, musician, member of the band "Yuko";
● Oleksandra Gontar, journalist of the Toronto Television YouTube project and poet;
● Volodymyr Beglov, Head of the Human Rights Education Center in Lviv;
● Natalia Shevchuk, Director General of the Social Film and Advertising Festival;
● Olga Zhukovtsova, actress of the Women's Quartal;
● Katro Zauber, Ukrainian DJ
● Vitaliy Zhadan, tactical training instructor, National Police of Ukraine.
"I hope that the project Fight like a girl will reach many women and girls, and it will empower them to change their lives. In a society where you do not feel protected, it is vital to finally try to create security for yourself (as much as possible)", – said Oleksandra Gontar, TV host and participant of the project.
Background information:
In Ukraine and worldwide, gender-based violence is widespread and systematic, gaining even more momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost half (49%) of women in Ukraine say they have experienced sexual harassment. Under quarantine, the number of registered domestic violence cases rose to over 54%1, and the number of calls to the National Hotline for the Prevention of Domestic Violence doubled2.
The campaign was produced in the framework of the "EU 4 Gender Equality: Together against gender stereotypes and gender-based violence" programme, funded by the European Union, implemented jointly by UN Women and UNFPA. The videos were produced with the financial support of the European Union. Their contents are the sole responsibility of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the European Union.

Title: How Regions Respond to the COVID-19 Outbreak: A New Analytical Tool in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
04 December 2020
The tool helps to systematically collect, and structure collected information related to regional COVID-19 response and to store it in one place. The electronic portal PHRM was launched in October 2020 together with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Public Health Center. It allows the Ministry of Health (MoH), UPHC, regional health authorities and other stakeholders to monitor the policies and epidemiological situation across regions in a systematic manner.
This is the first tool of its kind among the countries of the WHO European Region. It builds on the joint initiative between the WHO Regional Office for the European Region, the European Commission and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, and the Health System Response Monitor (HSRM)1.
Using the findings of the tool, the national and regional authorities can adjust the COVID-19 response. WHO Representative in Ukraine, Dr Jarno Habicht, highlights that “ this tool is crucial for national and regional authorities to coordinate restriction measures, interventions, policies and messages for the COVID-19 response in Ukraine.”
As WHO Representative in Ukraine, Dr Jarno Habicht added that ”the tool could also be a useful source of information in investigation of new outbreaks in a given region, for instance relaxing public health measure and allowing big congregation of people resulting in high infection rates in subsequent weeks. With the tool, the emergency coordination centers in the Ministry of Health and the Ukrainian Public Health Center will be able to regularly check what is the epidemiological picture and for example, governance or financing arrangements on COVID-19 response in Lviv region as compared to Zhytomir and if/how these differ from national standards and policies.”
Data collection in the regions began in May 2020 and took place in several rounds. The monitoring is focused on health-related measures taken by regional authorities to cope with the outbreak.
"Сoordination of all actions with the regions is extremely important today. We welcome the tools that facilitate this coordination and help us to provide the most effective public health response to COVID-19. We're discovering the opportunities of regional monitoring and consider the possibility of integrating it into the daily work of emergency coordination centers to support our public health response.," said Deputy Minister of Health, Chief State Sanitary Doctor of Ukraine Viktor Liashko.
The findings of the tool so far demonstrate that there is considerable variation in the implementation of measures in the regions, reflecting general capacity of the region and leadership of regional authorities. Also, study identified some gaps legislation in the field of public health which should be adressed by authorities. On the positive side, in several regions (e.g. Chernivtsi, Volyn), previously neglected facilities of the Laboratory Centers of the MOH were renovated during the quarantine period.
”Large decentralized countries, such as Ukraine, face distinctive coordinating challenges. Subnational governments are responsible for critical aspects of public health measures, managing health facilities, social services, and aspects of economic development. Because such responsibilities are shared among levels of government, coordinated effort is critical. At the same time, subnational governments can have different policy priorities and capacities. Intergovernmental coordination is a constant focus of policy and politics in these countries, but the scale of the COVID-19 crisis creates novel problems, e.g. of who decides whether people can travel across regional borders within countries, or who decides how to respond to regionalized outbreaks as countries reopen”, - says Elina Dale, Health Policy Adviser, WHO Country Office in Ukraine.
The Regional Public Health Response Monitor (PHRM) consists of a questionnaire with six blocks of questions on response measures in the  areas covering management and coordination, funding, preventing transmission (restrictive measures and physical distancing, epidemiological surveillance and investigation of cases, laboratory testing, health communication), planning of services, case management and support of essential health services during the epidemic (vaccination, pregnancy and childbirth care, EMS, etc.), physical infrastructure and human resources, logistics and operational support. Also, public health data is supplemented with data on the epidemiological situation in each specific region in the dynamics.
The Ministry of Health is deeply interested in the initiative. The next step will be a detailed study of response in the most critical areas, such as schools reopening; ensuring access to basic medical services, etc. and further in-depth analysis of the data obtained in conjunction with the epidemiological situation.

Title: Half of Ukrainians think most of spring’s lockdown measures were reasonable
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
27 November 2020
The ZMINA Human Rights Centre, with analytical support from the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and supported by UNDP Ukraine, has conducted a sociological survey to identify Ukrainians’ attitude to the lockdown measures introduced by the government in spring 2020.
The national survey shows that most respondents supported the requirement for a 14-day period of self-isolation for people arriving from abroad or from non-government controlled territories (72 percent). Most of those polled also supported restrictions on public cultural, entertainment, and sports events for more than 10 people (63 percent), and the restriction on religious gatherings at places of worship (60 percent).
Svitlana Kolyshko, Human Rights Team Lead and UNDP Ukraine Project Manager of the “Human Rights for Ukraine” project, stressed that sociological surveys are vitally important for identifying strong and weak spots of national policies and state decisions.
“Ukraine is facing the necessity to introduce additional lockdown measures,” Kolyshko said. “To adopt well-balanced and human rights-based decisions, it is necessary to understand which human rights may be violated, which restrictions are inefficient, and on the contrary which decisions are reasonable and perceived by people as safety measures.”
Andriy Sukharyna, the political analyst of the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, said respondents often supported measures that mainly do not relate to their everyday life, or those for which the government succeeded in communicating and explaining the potential risks for the mass spread of the disease.
“That is why, to reduce social tension and for the better perception of measures aimed at tackling the pandemic, the government needs to regularly and thoroughly explain the reasons why such measures were adopted,” Sukharyna said.
Most of the respondents supported the restriction for transportation between the countries, and 57 percent of those polled supported self-isolation for people over 60 years old. Restrictions on public catering were supported by 56 percent of respondents.
Along with this, some measures were perceived by Ukrainians as unreasonable. Among them, the restriction on public transportation within settlements, which was supported by only 27 percent, compared to 68 percent against. The restriction on public transportation between settlements was supported by 28 percent, compared to 68 percent against. Also, the requirement to carry ID documents outside the home was supported by only 32 percent. The restriction on going to parks, recreation areas, sports/playgrounds was supported by 36 percent of respondents, compared to 59 percent against.
Nearly all lockdown restrictions were more supported by youngsters (18 – 29 years) compared to people aged 30 – 39 years. Also, women supported lockdown measures more than men.
On the eve of the new wave of the pandemic this winter, experts from the ZMINA Human Rights Centre stress that all the restrictions limiting people’s presence in public spaces should be non-discriminatory, the same for everyone, and be based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization.
See more about the results of the survey in the infographics.
Background information:
The survey was conducted on 12-16 September 2020 using CATI methodology (computer-assisted telephone interviews), based on a random sampling of mobile phone numbers. The sampling is representative of the population of Ukraine aged 18+. The survey was conducted in all oblasts of Ukraine, apart from the non-government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. During the survey, 2001 questionnaires were filed in. The statistical deviation of sample (with a probability of 0.95 and taking into account the design effect of 1.1) does not exceed: 2.4 percent for indicators close to 50 percent, 2.1 percent for indicators close to 25 percent, and 1.5 percent for indicators close to 10 percent.
The survey was carried out by the ZIMA Human Rights Centre, with analytical support from the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and support from the Human Rights for Ukraine project, which is implemented by UNDP Ukraine and financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark.

Title: Humanitarian actors seek US$168 million to support 1.9 million conflict-affected people in eastern Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 November 2020
The ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine has taken the lives of over 3,000 civilians and injured more than 7,000. The ceasefire that was established in late July 2020 has contributed to a welcoming reduction in the number of casualties; however, ongoing hostilities are likely to continue to affect the lives of the people of eastern Ukraine. The COVID-19 pandemic is also expected to continue to have a profound effect on those already made vulnerable by the conflict through at least mid-2021.
“For almost seven years now, millions of people in eastern Ukraine have been longing for peace. In the absence of peace, many of them continue to rely on the humanitarian assistance provided by dozens of UN agencies as well as national and international NGOs. It’s with a heavy heart that I launch the sixth appeal calling for donors’ support to meet the needs of the most vulnerable children, women and men that count on us until this long-awaited peace finally comes”, said Ms. Lubrani.
The 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan – a strictly prioritized and comprehensive plan of action – lays out how over 120 partners aim to assist 1.9 million of the most vulnerable people in 2021. The Plan encompasses different sectors, including education, food, health, protection, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene. It seeks to complement the efforts already being undertaken by the Government of Ukraine and to support the handover of service delivery to local providers, wherever possible.
Since 2014, the United Nations and humanitarian partners have been on the ground in eastern Ukraine, providing relief and protection assistance worth more than $1.2 billion. Each year, humanitarian actors have reached over one million people on both sides of the ‘contact line’ and more than one million people have already received assistance during the first nine months of 2020.
“Ukraine highly appreciates the efforts of international humanitarian organizations, donors and the humanitarian community that operate in Ukraine despite the challenging working environment. I am grateful that, for the 7th year, you have been helping us help our citizens who suffered from this war. And especially now, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The assistance of humanitarian organizations will remain vital in 2021,” emphasized Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Reintegration Mr. Oleksii Reznikov. “We join the call of the humanitarian community and ask donors to support the humanitarian response efforts in eastern Ukraine.”
“The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the tables for many, especially for those already made vulnerable by the conflict who can barely make ends meet. And it is not abating any time soon — even with vaccines on the horizon,” Ms. Lubrani said. “It is a matter of basic human
solidarity, and it is our obligation to come to the aid of those who need assistance. We encourage everyone to join us. Only with your support can we make sure that everyone is safe and no one is left behind,” Ms. Lubrani concluded.

Title: The United Nations in Ukraine and the Wild Theater present NEW SCARS an interactive project against gender-based violence
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
25 November 2020
In Ukraine and worldwide, gender-based violence is widespread and systematic, gaining even more momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost half (49%) of women in Ukraine say they have experienced sexual harassment. Worldwide, 86% of rape survivors and 78% of domestic violence survivors are women. Under quarantine, the number of calls to the National Hotline for the Prevention of Domestic Violence has doubled.
The New Scars project is about violence that is difficult to recognize but it leaves a phantom pain for many years. Violence can have different manifestations: psychological, economic, physical, sexual. The fear and shame of being stigmatized as survivors of violence force women and girls to remain silent. Only acknowledging the problem and giving the voice to the survivors can make society fund, respond, prevent and collect data to eliminate violence against women and girls.
The premiere of the performance "New Scars" takes place on November 25 at Dovzhenko center, it will go live on UN in Ukraine YouTube Channel. The interactive game version of the play will be available for the audience on the website https://scars.org.ua/en/ . The performance will be available on TV UA: Culture and streaming service MEGOGO.
Stories of "scars" were collected by the playwright Kira Malinina, director - Natalka Syvanenko, artist - Lesya Golovach, Masha Ryapulova and Lida Soklakova worked on the script of the play.
Cast: Anna Kuzina, Anna Abramyonok, Anna Serdyuk, Marina Serdeshnyuk and Rimma Zubina.
“As the pandemic takes a foothold, we are witnessing increased rates of gender-based violence in public spaces in addition to domestic violence. You have a role to play. Everyone can make a difference and support women and girl survivors of violence to stay safe and free of violence, make sure judicial systems continue to prosecute abusers, create safe ways for women to seek support, and more.” – Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident & Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine.
"New Scars" are impressive because they are based on real stories shared with us by women of all ages from different parts of the country. These are stories full of pain and despair, but everyone who will watch the play will understand, there is a way out, “- Yaroslava Kravchenko, founder of the Wild Theater, advocate of the HeForShe movement in Ukraine.
In support of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, led by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the UNiTE to End Violence against Women Campaign (UNiTE) calls for global action to increase awareness, galvanize advocacy efforts, and share of knowledge and innovations. In recent years, the UNiTE campaign has utilized the color orange to represent a brighter future, free from violence against women and girls, as a unifying theme running through its global activities.
In support to the movement against gender-based violence, we encourage everyone to step up and share the stories against violence on social media and choose an orange item of clothing, make-up or accessory for photos and videos. Please hashtag your voice with #16days #новішрами #шрами and the @un_ukraine tag.

The initiator is Masha Efrosinina, who since 2018 is the Honorary Ambassador of the United Nations Population Fund in Ukraine and opposes violence against women and stands for gender equality.
"Get out of the circle of violence" - this is the message of Masha Efrosinina, Olya Polyakova, MONATIK, Yulia Sanina, Taras Topolya and Alyosha to people.
The social video is the first video work to gather so many stars around the problem of domestic violence.
Watch video: https://youtu.be/AqOsuaou8qQ
"Unfortunately, domestic violence is still silenced and tolerated in society. Thanks to the engagement and support of celebrities, with their bold, visible and powerful voices, awareness about domestic violence will be raised, and it will no longer be justified or devalued" - said UNFPA Representative to Ukraine Mr Jaime Nadal.
According to the latest UNFPA Ukraine's surveys in 2020, one in four Ukrainians believes that physical violence against women can be justified, and 17% of the population believe that a woman should be silent about abuse by a man to save her family.
The international campaign "16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence" begins on November 25 and lasts until December 10. The video was created with the financial support of the UK government as part of the Break the Circle campaign that helps identify violence and find help.

20 November 2020
The cars will be delivered to nine regions across Ukraine: Kirovohrad, Lviv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Chernivtsi, Poltava and Khmelnytskyi regions. In addition, traffic police and public order equipment, including special purpose and high visibility vests, megaphones, skid chains, tow ropes, barrier bands, start cables, traffic cones and road accident signs, were delivered to the NPU last month.
“Domestic and gender-based violence is a human rights violation and should not be tolerated in a democratic society.  Domestic violence mobile response groups are key to fighting domestic violence and the EU is proud to support the National Police of Ukraine in making it more effective, via our flagship PRAVO Police project” said Xavier Camus, Head of Operations Section "Good Governance and Democratisation” at the European Union Delegation to Ukraine.
This equipment has been procured within the framework of the project “Support for Rule of Law Reforms in Ukraine in the Areas of Police and Public Prosecution and Good Governance” (PRAVO Police) funded by the European Union and implemented by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in close coordination with the European Union Advisory Mission to Ukraine. The overall objective of the project is to contribute to promote the rule of law in Ukraine and to align its functioning with the best European Union and international practices.
“I am incredibly proud that UNOPS is part of the collective effort pursued by the Ministry of Interior, National Police, and the European Union to make a real difference in the lives of victims of domestic violence, the majority of which as we know are the most vulnerable, women and children” noted Irina Sahakyan Vetter, Country Director of UNOPS in Ukraine.

Title: UNICEF calls for averting a lost generation as COVID-19 threatens to cause irreversible harm to children’s education, nutrition and well-being

19 November 2020
Children and adolescents account for 1 in 9 of reported COVID-19 infections, according to new analysis released ahead of World Children’s Day
NEW YORK, 19 November 2020 – UNICEF warned in a new report today of significant and growing consequences for children as the COVID-19 pandemic lurches toward a second year.
Released ahead of World Children’s Day, Averting a Lost COVID Generation is the first UNICEF report to comprehensively outline the dire and growing consequences for children as the pandemic drags on. It shows that while symptoms among infected children remain mild, infections are rising and the longer-term impact on the education, nutrition and well-being of an entire generation of children and young people can be life-altering.
“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a persistent myth that children are barely affected by the disease. Nothing could be further from the truth,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “While children can get sick and can spread the disease, this is just the tip of the pandemic iceberg. Disruptions to key services and soaring poverty rates pose the biggest threat to children. The longer the crisis persists, the deeper its impact on children’s education, health, nutrition and well-being. The future of an entire generation is at risk.”
The report finds that, as of 3 November, in 87 countries with age-disaggregated data, children and adolescents under 20 years of age accounted for 1 in 9 of COVID-19 infections, or 11 per cent of the 25.7 million infections reported by these countries.
In Ukraine, children and young people under 20 years of age accounted for 1 in 15 of COVID-19 infections, or 6,7 per cent of the 557,657 thousands infections reported.
More reliable, age-disaggregated data on infection, deaths and testing is needed to better understand how the crisis impacts the most vulnerable children and guide the response.
While children can transmit the virus to each other and to older age groups, there is strong evidence that, with basic safety measures in place, the net benefits of keeping schools open outweigh the costs of closing them, the report notes. Schools are not a main driver of community transmission, and children are more likely to get the virus outside of school settings.
COVID-related disruptions to critical health and social services for children pose the most serious threat to children, the report says. Using new data from UNICEF surveys across 140 countries, it notes that:
More alarming data from the report include:
To respond to this crisis, UNICEF is calling on governments and partners to:
“This World Children’s Day, we are asking governments, partners and the private sector to listen to children and prioritize their needs,” Fore said. “As we all reimagine the future and look ahead toward a post-pandemic world, children must come first.”

Title: STEPS survey reveals high prevalence of noncommunicable disease risk factors in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 November 2020
“While NCDs represent a significant global public health challenge, this is particularly so in Europe, where they cause 89% of deaths and 84% of years lived with disability. The current COVID-19 pandemic serves as a reminder of the impact of NCD comorbidities, which have a detrimental effect on both disease severity and sickness duration,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
“The STEPS survey in Ukraine makes an important and relevant contribution to the European Programme of Work, as it measures not only the prevalence of NCD risk factors but also the coverage and effectiveness of selected priority interventions,” Dr Kluge added.
“WHO has supported Ukraine in addressing NCDs in the country in the past years,” explained Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine. “To complement actions with population-level surveillance, the STEPS survey, conducted in Ukraine for the first time, allows us to determine the behavioural and biological risk factors for NCDs, and to collect extensive relevant data across the country to evaluate progress, set priorities, and plan policies, interventions and actions to protect Ukrainian people’s health and reduce the rate of mortality due to NCDs in coming years.”
Tobacco and alcohol use, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diets are the major risk factors for NCDs, including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic lung diseases. NCDs cause 91% of all deaths in Ukraine.
To assess the major behavioural and biological NCDs risk factors among the Ukrainian population, the nationwide population-based health examination survey was conducted in 2019 using the WHO STEPS methodology. In total, 4409 adults aged 18–69 years were interviewed and examined to collect data on key NCDs risk factors, including tobacco and alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity.
The study revealed very high prevalence of NCDs and their risk factors in Ukraine, including high tobacco and alcohol consumption, very high salt intake, and low fruit and vegetable intake. Despite relatively low levels of insufficient physical activity, overweight and obesity are widespread in the country.
“Ukraine, like most other European countries, is characterized by a significant prevalence of NCD risk factors, which are responsible for the critical health indicators of the Ukrainian population,” said Mr Maxym Stepanov, Minister of Health of Ukraine.
“As the STEPS survey was conducted in Ukraine for the first time, it was mainly aimed at obtaining basic information on the main NCD risk factors, both behavioural and biological. The country included some additional questions related to mental health, cervical and breast cancer, and injury and violence in the survey. In this way, the information obtained can serve as a starting point for monitoring NCD risk factors in Ukraine, allowing the effectiveness of the National Plan implementation to be monitored,” he added.
The study results were presented during an online event in Ukraine on 17 November 2020. They will allow the country to track progress on the health-related Sustainable Development Goals as well as national, regional and global action plans and commitments related to the prevention and control of NCDs and their risk factors.
The survey was conducted by WHO, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the Public Health Centre of the Ministry of Health and the Oleksandr Yaremenko Ukrainian Institute for Social Research, with support from the World Bank.
Background information
The WHO STEPS tool is a standardized method for collecting, analysing and disseminating comprehensive data on NCDs, their risk factors and the responses of health-care systems. Data are collected on a wide range of behavioural and biological risk factors, as well as on individuals’ medical history of NCDs. The full text of the report is available in English and Ukrainian.

Title: Women face increased workload, salary cuts and domestic violence during pandemic
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 November 2020
While the COVID-19 disease doesn’t discriminate in whom it infects, its consequences have a disproportionate effect on the rights of women and men.
That was the key message of the analytical report “The Impact of COVID-19 on Women’s Rights in Ukraine,” which was presented today by the Jurfem Association of Women Lawyers of Ukraine. The report was prepared in partnership with the Office of the Government’s Commissioner for Gender Equality Policy, the Equal opportunities caucus in the Verkhovna Rada with the UNDP in Ukraine support.
The research identified challenges and provided recommendations to improve the situation with women’s and girls' rights during the COVID-19 pandemic, and assessed its impact on their labour and family rights. Specifically, women feel overwhelmed by the extra burden of combining housework, caregiving, and remote work – more than 56 percent of the women polled said it was negatively affecting their work.
Svitlana Kolyshko, Human Rights Team Lead and UNDP Ukraine Project Manager of the “Human Rights for Ukraine” project, stressed that to overcome the consequences of the pandemic it was vitally important to systematically monitor how human rights are observed.
“Human rights should be at the core of any decision,” Kolyshko said. “To identify which human rights are being violated, or which social groups are the most vulnerable, or who is being left behind, why this is happening and how to address these issues on the national or local level – systematic monitoring and disaggregated data is required.”
“That is how the state will be able to identify which bottlenecks have dramatically narrowed due to the emergency and the pandemic. This qualitative assessment will help in adopting well-designed, and balanced decisions to overcome the consequences of the pandemic and prevent new violations of human rights.”
Head of the Jurfem Association of Women Lawyers of Ukraine Khrystyna Kit underlined that the crisis is a long-lasting one, and it was necessary to consider the lessons learned during the first wave of the pandemic.
“That was the main goal of the research, in which we focused on two key topics – the impact of the pandemic on work and family spheres,” Kit said.
“The findings of the research provided us with interesting insights about what measures can be adopted so that the next waves of the pandemic are not so painful. The consequences of the COVID-19 are long-lasting and will be even more visible after we beat the pandemic.”
The research also shows that the income of about 40 percent of the women polled decreased. Though men also faced a decrease in income, women still earned less because of the gender pay gap, which remained the same – during the pandemic women continue to be paid about 20 percent less than men.
Among other negative impacts of the pandemic is the increased number of cases of domestic violence. More than 40 percent of those who faced domestic violence among the respondents said they had never experienced it before the lockdown.
Based on the report’s key findings, the experts provided their recommendations on how to address the consequences of the lockdown in the short-term and long-term perspectives. Specifically, they recommended that:

Title: UNHCR opens art-installation “Invisible Children: Under the Risk of Statelessness”
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 November 2020
12 November, Kyiv, Ukraine – UNHCR Ukraine carries out a social media campaign on 12-15 November to raise awareness about the issue of statelessness in Ukraine and to end it by 2024.
As part of its global #IBelong campaign which was launched in November 2014 and aims to end statelessness within ten years, UNHCR called on all states to reinforce their efforts in ending statelessness by 2024. Statelessness remains an issue that affects the most vulnerable and stigmatized members of society and that is ignored by the general public.
While observing the sixth anniversary of the campaign, UNHCR Ukraine has organized a number of activities to raise awareness about the issue of statelessness in Ukraine and to engage wider audience in combatting it.
On 12 November, from 5 pm to 10 pm, a show dedicated to the campaign will be projected on the media-façade of the Gulliver Mall in Kyiv (1-A Sportyvna Square). Also from the same date, a giant teddy bear holding a birth certificate will stand in the entrance hall of the Gulliver Mall for four days, until 15 November. This installation titled 'Invisible Children: Under the Risk of Statelessness' evokes the risk of statelessness among children born in non-government controlled parts of Ukraine and who have not yet obtained a Ukrainian birth certificate. One of the 10 actions to end statelessness is to ensure birth registration for the prevention of statelessness.
“The teddy bear reminds us that efforts are still needed in Ukraine to ensure that children born in the non-government-controlled (NGCA) parts of the Donetska and Luhanska oblasts obtain Ukrainian birth certificates. Without Ukrainian birth certificates, they may face risks of statelessness. - says Pablo Mateu, UNHCR Representative in Ukraine. - UNHCR estimates that, as of October 2020, approximately 60,000 children born in NGCA have not yet obtained a Ukrainian birth certificate. UNHCR continues to advocate for simplification of birth registration so that the procedure is responsive to the specific needs of families in NGCA.”
The UNHCR Ukraine invites everybody to make a post in social media using the hashtags #IBelong #EndStatelessness #ЯІсную. The participants of the campaign will be able to win a toy teddy bear and other prizes based on random selection.
Today millions of people around the world are denied a nationality. As a result, they often have difficulty accessing basic rights such as education, healthcare, employment and freedom of movement. Without these things, they can face a lifetime of obstacles and disappointment.
In Ukraine, UNHCR estimates that around 40,000 persons fall under its mandate on statelessness with a vast proportion belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups such as Roma, homeless persons, older people holding Soviet passports, as well as persons released without documents from penitentiaries (in particular persons who were never documented and/or who have their residence registration in NGCA). UNHCR and its partners provide them with legal assistance.
In 2020, Ukraine adopted a law introducing a Statelessness Determination Procedure. The adoption of this law represents an important step towards ending statelessness in Ukraine. UNHCR welcomes this achievement. The law will give thousands of people who lack a nationality a chance to work legally, study and access healthcare among other rights and opportunities, and will ultimately provide a pathway to citizenship, once they are recognized as stateless. It is crucial that the law is implemented soon.
UNHCR stands ready to support authorities in the implementation of the law and has offered its assistance to Ukraine’s State Migration Service to train key staff in their regional departments as well as legal practitioners, including from the state-run Free legal Aid Centers. UNHCR will also raise awareness among concerned populations on the possibility to apply for statelessness status.

Title: WHO/Europe and Ukrainian Government sign Biennial Collaborative Agreement for 2020-2021
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 November 2020
WHO/Europe and the Government of Ukraine, represented by the Ministry of Health, have signed a Biennial Collaborative Agreement (BCA) for 2020–2021. Signed by Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, and Maxym Stepanov, Minister of Health of Ukraine during a virtual ceremony, the agreement strengthens cooperation to improve the health of the Ukrainian population, and accelerate progress towards universal health coverage and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.
“WHO supports Ukraine in building a healthier future for its citizens. To improve the population’s health and access to high-quality health care, this Biennial Collaborative Agreement with the Ukrainian government sets out a framework for cooperation for 2020–2021. The agreement will strengthen the Ukrainian health system and health governance, and help ensure delivery of high-quality, people-centred health services,” said Dr Kluge.
Mr Stepanov added: “The Ministry of Health and WHO have a long history of effective collaboration, contributing to sustainable changes in the health of the Ukrainian population. We welcome the signing of the Biennial Collaborative Agreement with WHO, which will strengthen our cooperation and allow us to establish a long-term health strategy, continue implementing transformative changes in the health system for the benefit of the Ukrainian people and ensure access to essential health-care services, including better access to mental health services and vaccines”.
Based on the European Programme of Work (EPW), WHO’s 13th General Programme of Work (GPW 13) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the BCA aims to support Ukraine in maximizing the opportunities for improving population health, reducing health inequities and strengthening overall health governance in Ukraine.
Priority areas
Under the agreement, the 2 parties agreed to collaborate in 5 core priority areas:
“Over the past years, Ukraine has made bold steps in reforming its health system to achieve equal access to essential health services, with a focus on primary health care, and has progressed to provide access to affordable, safe and effective medicines and vaccines. In 2020, WHO/Europe is contributing to the COVID-19 response and simultaneously making efforts to continue health system strengthening. Our objective is to collaborate with numerous partners to improve health outcomes for the Ukrainian population in the coming decade,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine.
On signing the agreement, aimed at enhancing strategic collaboration, WHO/Europe and the Ukrainian government will work together to improve access to quality essential health services, medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and devices for primary health care. They will also work towards reducing financial hardships for the Ukrainian population, accelerating the country’s preparedness for health emergencies, strengthening country capacity in data and innovation, and addressing the economic, social and environmental determinants of health.
The BCA is aligned with the European Programme of Work 2020–2025 – “United Action for Better Health in Europe”, adopted earlier this year with the purpose of strengthening the leadership of health authorities in the WHO European Region, while accelerating progress towards achieving the SDGs, and ensuring no one is left behind.

Title: "Women Are Key to Peace" Campaign starts in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
03 November 2020
UN Women in Ukraine launches the “Women Are Key to Peace” campaign on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the UNSC Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security. The Resolution calls for meaningful participation of women in all peace processes.
Including women in peace and security brings better outcomes. The evidence is clear: having women at the peace table generates greater buy-in and strengthens accountability for implementation. Women’s participation also makes peace more durable because, with their input, agreements go beyond the realm of power to the realities of people. Peace processes involving women as witnesses, signatories, mediators and negotiators showed a 20% increase in the probability of a peace agreement lasting longer than 2 years, and a 35% increase in the probability of a peace agreement lasting 15 years. In addition, when women are involved, protests are more likely to remain nonviolent.
Since the adoption of the Resolution on 31 October 2000, there has been a substantial increase in the frequency of gender-responsive language in peace agreements and the number of women, women’s groups and gender experts who serve as official negotiators, mediators, or signatories.
However, despite the important role of women, they are often kept out of the political and negotiation processes in Ukraine. The “Women Are Key to Peace” campaign is designed to raise awareness of women’s role in peacebuilding, as well as to tell the real stories of those women who find themselves at the epicenter of conflict.
Nine videos telling these stories, will be broadcast on 1+1, ICTV and STB TV channels. Women at the center of the stories – doctors, teachers, businesswomen, military veterans, civic activists, leaders of self-help groups and social rehabilitation centers – are leaders who have found effective solutions during the conflict and now help others.
To continue implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda, on 28 October 2020, the Ukrainian Government approved its’ second National Action Plan for the period of 2021-2025, outlining new goals and objectives for women’s participation.
The “Women Are Key to Peace” campaign will run until November 31. You can follow its development on the project’s website, as well as on UN Women and partner websites and social media.
The campaign is realized by UN Women with financial support from Norway, Sweden, Canada, Denmark and the European Union.

29 October 2020
Today, on 29 October, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) facilitated the first-ever virtual roundtable between representatives of the donor community in Ukraine and the local authorities in Luhanska oblast. During the virtual meeting, the participants discussed humanitarian needs in the region and how COVID-19 has aggravated them, medium and long-term challenges, and ways the donor community, development and humanitarian actors can support the local authorities in tackling them in a coordinated manner.
Among the participants were Mr. Serhii Haidai, Head of the Luhansk Oblast State Administration, Ms. Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Kaimo Kuusk, Ambassador of the Republic of Estonia to Ukraine, Mr. Ole Egberg Mikkelsen, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Denmark to Ukraine, Mr. Erik Svedahl, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Norway to Ukraine, as well as representatives of Canada, Denmark, Japan, Lithuania, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Several UN agencies, ICRC and humanitarian actors operational in eastern Ukraine also took an active part in the meeting.
‘Over recent years, Luhanska oblast has been enjoying the strong support of our international friends. Jointly, we have implemented a number of infrastructural and social projects. At the same time, like other countries worldwide, we have been fighting against the spread of a deadly virus. We are grateful to our partners for supporting health-care institutions and providing personal protective equipment and medicines,’ said Mr. Haidai. ‘I am confident that such online communication with representatives of Embassies, humanitarian and development actors will help us promptly resolve the challenges Luhanska oblast faces, especially after the recent wildfires and due to hostilities. We are looking forward to continuing our cooperation with reputable humanitarian and development organizations,’ the Head of the Luhansk Oblast Administration, Mr. Serhii Haidai, concluded.
‘I would like to thank the donor community and the local authorities in Luhanska oblast for expressing their great interest in engaging in an open discussion about the situation in the region,’ Ms. Lubrani noted. ‘This is a new format of direct engagement that we believe will help improve our cooperation and create a bridge between beneficiaries and the donor community.’ Ms. Lubrani added. ‘Since 2014, donors have contributed some US$1.2 billion for the humanitarian response, and hundreds of millions more for recovery efforts in eastern Ukraine. We hope that such discussions will also lead to greater collaboration among humanitarian and development actors in order to reduce needs, risks and vulnerabilities in our common commitment to “leave no one behind” and the Sustainable Development Goals,’ Ms. Lubrani noted, concluding her address.

Title: UN75: The Future We Want, The UN We Need
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 September 2020
In January 2020, the United Nations launched the global consultation to mark its 75th anniversary. Through surveys and dialogues, it asked people about their hopes and fears for the future – representing the UN’s most ambitious effort to date to understand expectations of international cooperation and of the UN in particular. It is also the largest survey to date on priorities for recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 21 September 2020, over a million people from all countries and all walks of life had taken part. Their answers provide unique insights into what the public wants at this challenging time for the world. They are released today to coincide with the UN General Assembly’s official commemoration of the 75th anniversary, held under the banner: the future we want, the UN we need. Key findings include: Priorities for action
• Across regions, ages and social groups, respondents were broadly united in their priorities for the future.
• Amid the current COVID-19 crisis, the immediate priority for most respondents is improved access to basic services – healthcare, safe water, sanitation and education, followed by greater international solidarity and increased support to those hardest hit. This includes tackling inequalities and rebuilding a more inclusive economy.
• Looking to the future, the overwhelming concerns are the climate crisis and the destruction of our natural environment. Other priorities include: ensuring greater respect for human rights, settling conflicts, tackling poverty and reducing corruption. Perceptions of the UN
• Over 87% of respondents believe global cooperation is vital to deal with today’s challenges, and that the pandemic has made international cooperation more urgent.
• Seventy-five years after its founding, six in 10 respondents believe the UN has made the world a better place. Looking to the future, 74% see the UN as “essential” in tackling the challenges.
• However, respondents want the UN to change and innovate: to be more inclusive of the diversity of actors in the 21st century, and to become more transparent, accountable and effective.
“Across this anniversary year, we have engaged in a global conversation. And the results are striking. People are thinking big – they are also expressing an intense yearning for international cooperation and global solidarity. Now is the time to respond to these aspirations and realize these aims. In this 75th anniversary year, we face our own 1945 moment. We must meet that moment. We must show unity like never before to overcome today’s emergency, get the world moving and working and prospering again, and uphold the vision of the Charter.” - United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres
Background
• In January 2020, the UN Secretary-General launched the UN75 initiative, not as a celebration, but as the world's largest conversation about current global challenges, and the gap between the future we want and where we are headed if current trends continue.
• The Secretary-General saw UN75 as an opportunity for the UN to listen to the people it serves and identify their priorities and suggestions for enhanced global cooperation. UN75 was initiated to better understand people’s hopes and fears for the future, inviting people everywhere to imagine the future they want and contribute ideas on how to make it a reality, building a better and more sustainable world, for all.
• Through formal and informal surveys, and dialogues held across the world, the exercise was intended to take stock of global concerns and gain views from across the world on what sort of global cooperation is required. It was also intended to re-imagine what role the United Nations might play in helping to address our global challenges.
• After the pandemic made in-person gatherings challenging in many parts of the world, the initiative increased its efforts to reach people online, expanding the one-minute survey and social media outreach to shift the dialogues to online settings, where possible. At the same time, it put more emphasis - and resources - on reaching those without internet access: working with UN offices and other partners on the ground, and through telephone and SMS communications.
• By adding questions on building back better from the pandemic, it was able to conduct the largest and most diverse global survey to date on post-COVID priorities.
• To date, over 1 million people have taken the one-minute survey in all UN Member and Observer States and more than 1,000 dialogues have been held in 82 countries across the world. In addition, 50,000 in 50 countries took part in independent polling by Edelman and the Pew Research Center, and artificial intelligence analysis of social and traditional media was conducted in 70 countries, along with academic and policy research mappings in all regions.
• Together, they represent the UN's most ambitious attempt to undertake a global reality check and hear from “we the peoples” on their priorities and suggested solutions to global challenges, providing unique insights into the future we want and the UN we need.

Title: The pandemic has further exacerbated existing inequalities and vulnerabilities in Ukraine, says UN Human Rights
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
22 September 2020
“COVID-19-related restrictions have deepened the hardships faced by the conflict-affected population in eastern Ukraine. The closure of entry-exit crossing points has separated families, left people without access to social benefits, and limited access to medical care and education”, said Matilda Bogner, Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. “We welcome the Government decision allowing internally displaced pensioners not to undergo identification checks every second month. However, we are concerned about reports that some regions have begun to request this, despite the continuation of the pandemic and related restrictions”, she added.
Since the conflict started, the total death toll for civilians has reached at least 3,367, and more than 7,000 civilians have been injured. From 1 January to 31 July 2020, the Mission recorded 107 civilian casualties: 18 killed (ten men, seven women and one boy) and 89 injured (49 men, 30 women, six girls and four boys).
While the report highlights spikes in hostilities resulting in civilian casualties in March and May, it welcomes the package of additional measures to strengthen the ceasefire that took effect on 27 July. These measures contributed to easing the effects of the conflict on the civilian population with zero civilian casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure resulting from active hostilities recorded since 1 August 2020. “We urge parties to the conflict to respect the ceasefire indefinitely and to fully comply with international humanitarian law. Zero civilian casualties must remain the objective”, reiterated Ms Bogner.
The report says that arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment remained a systemic problem both in territory controlled by the Government and in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’. “Efforts by the State Bureau of Investigation to investigate events at Kaharlyk police station and other allegations of torture and ill-treatment are encouraging, but more needs to be done. We recommend ensuring the effective documentation and investigation of all allegations of torture in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol, and prosecution of alleged perpetrators, including persons in position of command ”, said Ms Bogner. She also reiterated that international organisations must be granted unimpeded access to places of detention in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’ as soon as possible.
Those who were already in vulnerable situations have suffered even more since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, says the report. Groups such as Roma, persons with disabilities living in the community, those living in homelessness, or older persons and persons with disabilities living in long-term care facilities, already faced limited enjoyment of the rights to health, work, education and an adequate standard of living before the pandemic, and have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and Government measures to address the pandemic.
The report outlines that the number of attacks against peaceful assemblies, political activists and offices of political parties increased as Ukraine approaches local elections in October 2020. Seven physical attacks were recorded against journalists, and others occurred in the form of online threats and acts of intimidation. In Government-controlled territory, some LGBTI pride events held since the end of the reporting period also faced violence. “We are concerned that impunity for attacks against journalists and political actors, as well as members of minorities, such as Roma and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, creates a climate where more attacks can occur. Such attacks have a chilling effect on civic space and the exercise of fundamental freedoms which are so important for the holding of free and fair elections”, said Ms Bogner. In a broader context, justice also remained elusive. During the reporting period, victims’ struggle for justice has, in far too many cases, not resulted in accountability for perpetrators, including for conflict-related human rights violations and for the killings and violent deaths during the Maidan events and on 2 May 2014 in Odesa.
The report also highlights the lack of freedom of peaceful assembly in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’, referring to protests by coal miners over salary delays, which reportedly resulted in a series of arrests of participants.
Concerning the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation1, the report highlights, amongst other human rights violations, limitations on the manifestation of religious practices. “We call on the Russian Federation, as the occupying Power in Crimea, to end the prosecution of Crimean residents for peaceful manifestation of their religious beliefs and to stop conscripting Crimean residents into the Russian Federation’s armed forces”, added Ms Bogner.
The report provides a set of specific recommendations to the Ukrainian authorities, to all parties involved in hostilities, and to the Russian Federation, as the occupying Power in Crimea.
The full text of the report is available in English, Ukrainian and Russian.

Title: Comprehensive assessment confirms devastating impact of COVID-19 in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 September 2020
The results of a comprehensive interagency socioeconomic impact assessment, presented to Government on Friday, confirm that the COVID-19 pandemic is pushing the country towards its worst recession in decades – possibly a depression, with terrible consequences for the most vulnerable. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Ukraine has reported nearly 170,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 3,400 deaths.
The United Nations System conducted more than 50 studies to assess the full scope of the pandemic in Ukraine. The socio-economic assessment of the impact on businesses and households, led by UNDP in collaboration with UN Women and UN Food and Agriculture Organization, found that 84 percent of households have lost income and 43 percent have at least one family member who has lost a job. More than two thousand households and enterprises across the country participated in the survey, which is now informing policies and programmes designed to improve lives and livelihoods in the wake of the crisis.
“We must plan for the worst and hope for the best, planning as far ahead as possible,” said UNDP Resident Representative Dafina Gercheva. “What we do now will both soften the blow from the pandemic and contribute directly towards rebuilding the country forward – better, stronger, and more resilient than ever before. The actions we take now will determine what kind of world emerges from this crisis.”
Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said with the onset of the pandemic, the Government had been faced with the task of finding a balance between epidemic restrictions and allowing the economy to work. “The solution was an adaptive quarantine,” Mr. Shmyhal said. “It allows us to respond quickly to outbreaks in certain areas, but without having to stop the country.” He added that the Government is currently developing a set of measures to allow the resumption of economic growth. In particular, “business support programmes, the privatization of state-owned enterprises, and the stimulation of consumer demand.”
Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine, told the Prime Minister the entire UN family in Ukraine is proud to support the Crisis Coordination Management Unit at the Prime Minister’s Office, which was established by UNDP and is providing technical advice to the Government on the socio-economic recovery. “I would like to praise the efforts of the Government to develop the sectoral response strategies that the Unit has been supporting, which draw significantly from the UN socio-economic impact analysis,” Lubrani said. “This crisis is an opportunity to ensure a transformational change though better policies in taxation, social assistance, governance and anti-corruption, environment and climate change.”
The assessment revealed the crisis has impacted people differently in terms of: 1) gender (women, especially those in lower paid, retail sector jobs have been disproportionally affected); 2) economic status (those in higher-paid “desk jobs” can work remotely, while those in lower-paid more manual types of employment have in many cases lost jobs or been laid off); and 3) location (people living in urban areas tend to have much better Internet coverage, access to state services, transport, and employment prospects than those in rural areas).
Additional highlights from the report:
· The crisis and the imposed quarantine and lockdown have caused a reduction in outputs, household spending and trade. The global value chains have been disrupted and this will lead to a steep decline of GDP in Ukraine.
· In general, an over-reliance on social transfers and remittances to drive the economy made the country particularly vulnerable to shocks.
· More than 8 percent of SMEs are on the brink of bankruptcy and may have to close down.
· Unemployment is increasing.
· More than 9 million people may fall back into poverty during the pandemic (increase from 6.3 to 9 million).
· Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the crisis because of their high exposure to the virus. Women account for 82 percent of the total health and social workers (compared to 70 percent average worldwide).
· The crisis and the lockdown have also led to a spike in domestic violence. The reported cases have increased by 30 percent. Many more have no doubt gone unreported – such is the tragic and unfortunate nature of domestic violence.
Recommendations for a sustained recovery to build forward better include:
· COVID-19 response actions should focus first on vulnerable groups such as women, older persons, and people living with chronic health conditions and disabilities.
· Sustain reforms and re-prioritize government spending and policies.
· Create fiscal space through international financing, progressive taxes, increased government efficiency and transparency, and anti-corruption efforts.
· Leverage UN Country Team expertise and institute policies and recovery plans that follow international best practices.
· Maintain essential services and treat COVID-19 at the primary health care level as much as possible.
· Confiscate ineffective or fake medications through improved monitoring and public outreach.
· Scale up spending on health and continue reforms to the public health system.
· Make remote learning available to all students and train teachers in online learning tools.
· Promote a sustainable, inclusive “green” recovery and remove remaining direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies.
Early UNDP actions in response to COVID-19 in Ukraine
In Ukraine, UNDP acted to support the Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic from the very first days of the crisis. On 17 March, just over two weeks after the first case of the COVID-19 disease was confirmed in the country, the Government imposed a strict set of quarantine measures, including closing the country’s borders and requiring citizens to stay at home, only being allowed to go outside to buy food and medicine.
“With the country under quarantine,” said Ms. Gercheva, “UNDP immediately mobilized its partner networks and contributed to the COVID-19 response, providing information leaflets via a housing improvements project that reached around 1.8 million people. Disinfectant and personal protective equipment was provided to medical workers, police and rescuers in eastern Ukraine.” In April, UNDP Ukraine also initiated monitoring on access to public information, with the focus on the COVID-19 outbreak response at the local level. Work has also begun on integrating aspects of coronavirus-related stigma and discrimination to the agency’s work through the Ombudsperson’s regional network. UNDP helped the Government set up Crisis Coordination Management Units, under the Prime-Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with technical coordination by the Vice-Prime-Minister on European and Euro-Atlantic Integration. UNDP then launched a campaign to encourage solidarity and kindness during coronavirus pandemic, and a joint initiative with the independent internet publication platfor.ma to help young women and men aged 14 to 22 to cope with self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine restrictions while staying at home, via the monthly Instagram challenge #bemyquarantine_UA. In another initiative, UNDP organized a hackathon called the #HackCorona Challenge in partnership with the Ministry of Digital Transformation to identify the best tech-based solutions for mitigating and addressing the challenges caused by COVID-19. In conflict-affected east of the country, UNDP helped ten businesses from conflict-affected eastern Ukraine, previously supported by the agency with business grants, to launch online stores selling products from coffee and honey, to linen, home décor and souvenirs.
The most recent UNDP initiative to help improve the conditions for ordinary Ukrainians is through a Chatbot the organization developed in partnership with the Ukraine Chamber of Commerce. The chatbot responds automatically to user queries about ways for micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It can also produce pre-filled force majeure certificates and forms to present to landlords and banks.
Ms. Gercheva said it is clear the pandemic is more than just a public health challenge and that the response requires coordinated and sustained efforts from all government ministries supported by UN Development System. “in close collaboration with other members of the UN family, UNDP will continue to support the Government of Ukraine in providing a coordinated, efficient and inclusive response to the COVID-19 crisis, leaving no one behind,” said Ms. Gercheva.

Title: European Union and WHO deliver over 100 oxygen concentrators for COVID-19 patients in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 September 2020
The equipment was procured by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, with funding from the EU, through the Solidarity for Health Initiative. The goods are valued at over EUR 78 000.
Oxygen concentrators are a non-invasive way of providing oxygen to patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Such supplemental oxygen is the first essential step for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with low blood oxygen levels and should be a primary focus for treatment.
After necessary administrative steps by authorities, the oxygen concentrators will be distributed by the WHO Country Office according to the needs of the healthcare facilities identified by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine.
All the equipment delivered has been checked to ensure it meets quality and safety standards.
“The pandemic is not over. The spread of COVID-19 in Ukraine is alarming and requires coordinated action from all. Through the Solidarity for Health Initiative, the EU and the World Health Organisation are providing emergency assistance to respond to critical medical needs. Thanks to our partnership, we were able to purchase and deliver, despite the worldwide shortage, oxygen concentrators which are essential to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients in 44 hospitals across the entire country. It is now very important to proceed urgently with the clearance of these critical supplies in order to allow frontline hospitals to benefit from them. This is part of the European Union’s #TeamEurope approach, in the context of which it is mobilising a COVID-response package of EUR 190 million for Ukraine.“ Ambassador Matti Maasikas, Head of European Union Delegation to Ukraine said.
“In the context of the Coronavirus crisis, WHO is working to maximize the availability of critical medical supplies to the most vulnerable. We are focused on fulfilling urgent requests and really appreciate that with the Solidarity for Health Initiative project we are making a difference in Ukraine. Delivery of these oxygen concentrators will be crucial in treating the most severely affected patients in the areas with the highest numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19“, underlined WHO Representative in Ukraine Dr. Jarno Habicht.
“In response to the COVID-19 pandemic it is very important not only to respond quickly to all challenges which the health system was facing at the beginning of the crisis, but also to ensure prompt and structured response for later. Increasing the capacity of frontline hospitals in the most COVID-19 affected areas in Ukraine to treat severe cases of COVID-19 is vital as it helps to reduce the burden on health systems and support people who are bravely fighting the virus “, added Deputy Minister of Health (MoH) and Chief State Sanitary Doctor of Ukraine Dr. Viktor Liashko.
In the first phase of the project, a shipment of around one million units of personal protective equipment for 50 COVID-19 dedicated hospitals and essential supplies for 27 COVID-19 laboratories were procured and delivered.
The provision of these critical supplies is part of the European Union’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, currently affecting more than 216 countries and territories. The total COVID-19 response package from the EU for Ukraine is EUR 190 million. The funds are being used for emergency needs in healthcare, longer-term strengthening of the health sector, as well as socioeconomic recovery. Ukraine is also set to benefit from a special Macro-Financial Assistance worth EUR 1.2 billion.
The project builds upon the European Union’s and WHO’s ongoing support to Ukraine.
Background information:
“Solidarity for Health Initiative” is a joint effort of the European Union and WHO Regional Office for Europe in six countries of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine. The project is aimed to help prevent, detect and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen the EU’s Eastern Neighbourhood’s capacity to respond to public health emergencies. The project is implemented by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and WHO country offices, in close coordination with EU Delegations, national authorities and development partners, including those in the United Nations system.
The role of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine is to support the country in creating and strengthening policies for sustainable health development. This includes providing technical guidance in public health-related issues, supporting the development of standards and guidelines, building up local relationships for efficient technical cooperation, and ensuring that public health measures are coordinated and in place during crises.
Currently, the Country Office in Ukraine is focusing its work on COVID-19 response and cooperation with the health authorities and other institutions involved in the country-level coordination, planning, and monitoring, case investigation, infection prevention and control. WHO has been supporting improving the national and regional capacities to diagnose COVID-19 via the national laboratory system, and also improving clinical standards and approaches in the country.

Title: On the 25th anniversary of landmark Beijing Declaration on women’s rights, UN Women calls for accelerating its unfinished business
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
15 September 2020
Twenty-five years ago today, the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing set a path-breaking agenda for women’s rights. As a result of the two-week gathering with more than 30,000 activists, representatives from 189 nations unanimously adopted the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. This historic blueprint articulated a vision of equal rights, freedom and opportunities for women – everywhere, no matter what their circumstances are – that continues to shape gender equality and women’s movements worldwide.
A quarter century on, the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, calls for urgent action: “With nations around the world searching for solutions to the complex challenges of our age, the leading way for all of us to rebuild more equal, inclusive, and resilient societies, is to accelerate the implementation of women’s rights – the Beijing Platform for Action. That vision has been only partly realized. We still live in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture, and this simply has to change”.
The Beijing Platform for Action imagined a world where every woman and girl can exercise her freedoms and choices, and realize her rights, such as to live free from violence, to go to school, to participate in decisions and to earn equal pay for work of equal value. As a defining framework for change, the Platform for Action made comprehensive commitments under 12 critical areas of concern.
Twenty-five years later, no country has fully delivered on the commitments of the Beijing Platform for Action, nor is close to it. A major stock-taking UN Women report published earlier this year showed that progress towards gender equality is faltering and hard-won advances are being reversed. Women currently hold just one quarter of the seats at the tables of power across the board. Men are still 75 per cent of parliamentarians, hold 73 per cent of managerial positions, are 70 per cent of climate negotiators and almost all of the peacemakers.
The anniversary is a wake-up call and comes at a time when the impact of the gender equality gaps is undeniable. Research shows the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating pre-existing inequalities and threatening to halt or reverse the gains of decades of collective effort – with just released new data revealing that the pandemic will push 47 million more women and girls below the poverty line. We are also witnessing increased reports on violence against women throughout the world due to the lockdowns, and women losing their livelihoods faster because they are more exposed to hard-hit economic sectors.
While much works remains on fulfilling the promises of the Beijing Platform for Action, it continues to be a global framework and a powerful source of mobilization, civil society activism, guidance and inspiration 25 years later.
The upcoming UN General Assembly later this month will be a key opportunity to bring to the forefront the relevance of the Beijing Declaration and move the needle on implementation, with a High-Level Meeting attended by global leaders on “Accelerating the Realization of Gender Equality and the Empowerment of all Women and Girls” on 1 October. The event will showcase how building equal and inclusive societies is more urgent than ever, as the COVID-19 pandemic ravages lives and livelihoods.
Calling on world leaders to use their political power to accelerate robust action and resources for gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, UN Women Executive Director, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, said: “This is a re-set moment. On this important anniversary, let us reaffirm the promises the world made to women in 1995. Let us draw on the activist spirit of the Beijing Conference and commit to forging new alliances across generations and sectors to ensure we seize this opportunity for deep, systemic change for women and for the world.”
The anniversary will be further commemorated in the context of the Generation Equality Forum, a civil society–centred, global gathering for gender equality, convened by UN Women and co-hosted by the governments of France and Mexico , foreseen to take place in the first half of 2021.

Title: UNICEF calls to strengthen protection of schools in eastern Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
09 September 2020
Over 750 schools and kindergartens have been damaged or destroyed since the hostilities began, and many more have experienced disruptions to the education process. With a fragile ceasefire in place, nearly 400,000 children are going to school near the ‘contact line’, where shelling and extreme mine contamination threaten their lives and wellbeing.[1]
During the previous school year, 19 attacks on schools were reported, of which five took place in April 2020 alone. During one incident, a seventeen-year-old girl was injured by shrapnel in her schoolyard.[2]
Despite no attacks being observed on schools in the last two months, children are continuing to learn in militarized environments. In the last two years, the number of cases in which military positions were observed less than 1 km from operational educational facilities was higher than the previous two years. According to the OSCE SMM report [3], 36 educational facilities on both sides of the ‘contact line’ were observed to be in close proximity to military objects in 2019.
Such close proximity of military sites to educational facilities is putting children, teachers and families in danger. Living in a conflict setting takes a devastating toll on the psychosocial wellbeing of an entire generation of children growing up in eastern Ukraine.
In November 2019, Ukraine became the 100th country to endorse the Safe Schools Declaration, committing itself to take concrete measures to protect students, educators and educational facilities during armed conflict.
“It has been nearly a year since Ukraine signed the Declaration. This is the time to turn the commitment into actions, said Lotta Sylwander, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine. ‘I have spoken with parents, children and teachers. They all are asking for a protective and safer learning environment. This is an achievable task if the Government is looking for solutions, and if decisiveness and will are there.”
A joint effort is required by all partners at national and regional level in accordance with the Action Plan proposed by the Ministry of Education and Sciences of Ukraine. These partners include the Ministry of Defense, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Ministry for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, Ombudsman’s offices and civil-military administrations in the east.
As the next step, the government institutions should take the following actions:
· develop a monitoring and reporting mechanism on attacks on educational facilities;
· conduct a risk assessment identifying the educational facilities at greatest risk of being targeted or used for military purposes;
· ensure that an early warning system and security protocols are in place for children and teachers;
· include Safe School Declaration principles and guidelines into military manuals and coursebooks while military training is provided;
· integrate conflict-sensitive approaches in education policies, syllabi and coursebooks.
UNICEF is working with partners across eastern Ukraine to provide support to educational facilities so that repairs can be made to damaged schools and kindergartens, and so education supplies - such as educational kits, furniture and sport equipment - can be replaced. In addition, UNICEF and partners are providing much-needed counselling, psychosocial support, and information about the risks of mines to hundreds of thousands of children, youth and caregivers affected by the conflict.
UNICEF and partners stand ready to support measures to further protect children and ensure full implementation of the Safe Schools Declaration.

Title: New UN report reveals human rights violations perpetrated in the context of criminal cases related to the conflicts in eastern Ukraine and in Crimea
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
27 August 2020
“Over six years, we have been documenting human rights violations in criminal cases in the context of the conflicts in eastern Ukraine and in Crimea. We call on those responsible to end these unlawful practices and ensure respect of the right to a fair trial for all individuals,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.
In Government-controlled territory, the report highlights widespread violations of the rights to liberty and security, legal counsel, a fair hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal, trial without undue delay and access to an effective remedy, as well as violations of the right not to be compelled to self-incriminate.
The report states that these violations run through all stages of criminal proceedings. The majority of violations could be addressed without legislative amendments, as they are mostly a result of the lack of enforcement of relevant fair trial guarantees, while others would require legislative amendments, as set out in the recommendations of the report.
In territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’(4), the report highlights that both the framework and practice applied in conflict-related ‘crimes’ did not respect basic elements of fair trial and related human rights. The report’s findings suggest that the bodies processing conflict-related ‘cases’ are neither independent nor impartial. The ‘proceedings’ are closed, held without access to a lawyer of one’s choice, and are often accompanied by incommunicado detention and the use of torture and ill-treatment.
“The practices of ’preventive arrest’ and ‘administrative arrest’ amount to incommunicado detention and allow torture and ill-treatment to flourish. Such practices need to be halted immediately. The international community, including the Russian Federation, should use its influence on the self-proclaimed ‘republics’ to stop these grave human rights violations”, Ms Bogner added.
In Crimea, in conflict-related cases documented by the OHCHR, the justice system applied by the Russian Federation as an occupying Power often failed to uphold fair trial rights and due process guarantees. “Russian Federation authorities in Crimea must respect fair trial rights according to their obligations as an occupying Power under international humanitarian law and international human rights law,” emphasized Ms Bogner.
The report is based on over 1300 in-depth interviews with victims and witnesses of human rights violations, monitoring of 1,280 court hearings, and examination of more than 3,300 court documents and other relevant material.
The report also provides recommendations on measures that need to be taken to prevent further violations of the right to a fair trial more broadly, not just in conflict-related criminal cases. The full report is available in English, Ukrainian and Russian.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1 Recalling that the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders was affirmed by General Assembly resolution 68/262, the report focuses solely on human rights issues.
2 The report is based on the work of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) and presents HRMMU’s monitoring and analysis of individual cases throughout Ukraine, including in Crimea and in territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’ and the self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’ from 14 April 2014 to 13 April 2020.
3 UN General Assembly resolution 68/262, reaffirming the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and General Assembly resolutions 71/205, 72/190, and 73/263 recognizing Crimea as a territory of Ukraine temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
4 While armed groups and other non-State actors cannot become parties to international human rights instruments, where they exercise government-like functions and control over a territory, they must respect human rights standards when their conduct affects the human rights of individuals under their control. Therefore, noting the mandate of OHCHR to promote and protect the human rights of everyone, everywhere, the report assesses how the human rights of persons living in these territories are affected when such actors exercise government-like functions. As such, it does not legitimize the processes or the structures themselves.

Title: On world counter-trafficking day, IOM reports a sad record on trafficking from Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
02 August 2020
“In crisis situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, migrants are often at risk of increased vulnerability to human trafficking and exploitation,” said Anh Nguyen, Chief of Mission at IOM Ukraine, opening an IOM-supported exhibition entitled Expectations vs Reality on 30 July, the World Counter-Trafficking Day, in the capital Kyiv. “People may become victims as a result of losing their jobs due to the pandemic while vulnerabilities of persons already at risk of trafficking may be further increased by the economic slowdown,” he explained.
Trafficking survivors assisted by IOM in the first half of 2020 were exploited in 22 different countries, including Ukraine itself. The Russian Federation remained the top destination country for human trafficking from Ukraine, with 55 per cent of the victims assisted by IOM Ukraine from January to June 2020 having suffered there. Poland ranks second with 28.7 per cent, while internal trafficking, including the annexed Crimea and the non-government-controlled territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, accounted for eight per cent of cases.
Following the trend of the previous years, 71 per cent of victims were male, and the overwhelming majority (97%) of victims identified in the first half of 2020 were trafficked for labour exploitation.
To strongly remind Ukrainians about the risks of irregular employment, IOM supported the request of the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine, the National Counter-Trafficking Coordinator, and partnered with A21 NGO and the OSCE Project Co-ordinator to launch a national trafficking awareness campaign. The exhibition Expectations vs Reality, opened in Kyiv on Thursday, is a part of this joint initiative, enlightening about a harsh reality that a luring but informal employment offer may turn into. The exhibition will be displayed in Kyiv until 12 August and then will visit 16 regional cities of Ukraine. The project also promotes the new IOM-supported website www.worksafe.org.ua which features the stories of trafficking survivors and also provides tips on how to avoid being exploited, referring visitors to useful government resources as well as to the IOM-supported National Counter-Trafficking and Migrant Advice Hotline 527.
“To counter modern slavery in times of COVID-19, existing national mechanisms of referral and response should be scaled up to offer much-needed medical assistance and socioeconomic reintegration support to vulnerable migrants, including victims of trafficking, violence and abuse,” stated Anh Nguyen.
IOM has been assisting trafficking survivors in Ukraine for 22 years, and over 17,000 victims have received medical, psychosocial and legal assistance, vocational training and equipment to help them start their life again.

Title: EU and UNOPS handed over 380.000 items of personal protective equipment from COVID-19 to National Police of Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
16 July 2020
On 16 July 2020, the European Union together with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) provided to the National Police of Ukraine high-performance personal protective equipment, including more than 150,000 respirators, 170,000 medical masks and 60.000 protective overalls. The supplies are worth more than EUR 500,000 and were delivered through the project "Support for Rule of Law Reforms in Ukraine in the Areas of Police, Public Prosecution and Good Governance (PRAVO Police)" implemented by UNOPS in close coordination with the European Union Advisory Mission (EUAM). This protective equipment will help officers to stay safe while performing their duties amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ukrainian police officers and first responders are on the front line keeping the public safe. Protective measures like physical distancing are not always an option for these professionals, leaving them at a higher risk of contracting and spreading the novel coronavirus as they perform their critical jobs.
The EU Ambassador Matti Maasikas noted: “We are providing this personal protection equipment to the Ukrainian policewomen and policemen so that they could be safe when doing their daily work in service of the citizen.” He added: “This delivery will significantly improve National Police’s capacity to work in times of the pandemic.”
“We would like to thank our partners who are delivering the first batch of the planned support items today, including respirators, masks and protective overalls. The officers of the National Police of Ukraine are enforcing quarantine measures across the country on a daily basis as well as performing other policing functions, and we are glad to be able to ensure they are well-protected.”- noted Oleksandr Fatsevych, Deputy Head of the National Police of Ukraine
“We are proud to be a trusted partner of the European Union and the Government of Ukraine during these challenging times to deliver personal protective equipment to the Ukrainian police officers who are working on the frontlines, ensuring public order and safety,” said Irina Sahakyan Vetter, UNOPS Director in Ukraine.
There is a shortage of personal protective equipment for law-enforcement officers who are in constant danger of being exposed to COVID-19. To bridge this gap, PRAVO Police in close coordination with the EU Delegation to Ukraine, the EUAM, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine and the National Police of Ukraine organised the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment that will help law-enforcement officers to stay safe while performing their duties.
Background information:
The Support for Rule of Law Reforms in Ukraine in the areas of Police, Public Prosecution and Good Governance (PRAVO Police) project is funded by the European Union and implemented by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in coordination with the EU Advisory Mission (EUAM). The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the reform of the Rule of Law system in Ukraine and to align its functioning with the best European Union and International practices.
PRAVO Police assists the National Police and the Ministry of Internal Affairs in reforming public order management and criminal investigation systems, modernising pre-trial investigation frameworks aimed at combating cybercrime and serious and organised crime, introducing community and intelligence-led policing models, establishing an effective witness protection system, enhancing  police collaboration with the Interpol and Europol, and enhancing its professional development and training system.

Title: WHO and EU deliver essential supplies to 27 COVID-19 laboratories to enhance Ukraine’s testing capacity
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 July 2020
The total amount of the goods worth over EUR 3.5 million include consumables, reagents and critical laboratory equipment to speed up, scale up and automatize PCR-testing. They are procured as part of a larger assistance package from the EU, through its “Solidarity for Health Initiative”, implemented by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Ukraine.
In an event today, the part of the supplies were handed over to the Kyiv Regional Laboratory Center by Head of the Local and Human Development Section of the EU Delegation to Ukraine Frederik Coene and WHO Representative in Ukraine Dr. Jarno Habicht.
Frederik Coene, the Head of the Local and Human Development Section of the EU Delegation to Ukraine, said: “COVID-19 is a defining challenge for public health and a test of global solidarity. It is extremely important to ship consumables, reagents and critical laboratory equipment to speed up, scale up and automatize PCR-testing. Thanks to WHO as an organization with the necessary technical knowledge it has become a reality.
Investing in health must be at the centre of development, it is a necessity and a pathway to security, prosperity and peace. When the world unites to confront a common health threat, anything is possible.”
The equipment delivered are of types included in WHO’s list of quality-assured products and will allow speeding up and expanding testing for COVID-19 across the country, detecting the disease in a timely manner and controlling its spread. For example, one PCR thermocycler enables 400-600 additional tests per day. An automatic station for RNA extraction doubles the speed of detecting the presence of the coronavirus RNA. This quick processing saves health care workers time and energy and helps decrease the probability of human error.
Dr. Jarno Habicht, the WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine, said: “WHO will continue to bring life-saving shipments and expertise to Ukraine, despite the ongoing global shortage of COVID-19 supplies. The laboratory supplies that WHO is making available, thanks to funding from the EU, will allow for wider and increased testing for COVID-19 across the country. Enhanced testing is critical for detecting the disease in a timely manner, controlling the spread of the virus and saving lives.”
The supplies will be distributed to 27 laboratories – the Region Laboratory Centers and Public Health Center – which are on the frontlines of COVID-19 response, and among them cover most of the testing in all regions of Ukraine.
“In the first weeks of the pandemic, we have not only responded quickly to the challenges, but also acted for the future. Our team began to develop joint long-term plans with international organizations to strengthen the laboratory capacities. Now we are following this plan and are gradually preparing for a possible second wave of COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Ukraine has already increased the number of PCR tests conducted per day — from 300 to 14 000," said Deputy Minister of Health, Chief State Sanitary Doctor of Ukraine Viktor Liashko.
This is one of several deliveries that will continue through to August 2020, with supplies to be distributed to laboratories according to needs identified by the Ministry of Health in Ukraine and the Office of President of Ukraine.
Galyna Hrynchuk, the Head of the Kyiv Regional Laboratory Center:
“Ukrainian laboratories are doing everything in their power for rapid testing of suspected COVID-19 patients. Employees often work long hours, including weekends. Our resources are limited, so this is a very useful and timely help.”
The donation of the laboratories supplies such as equipment, consumables, reagents is a part of the European Union’s response to the outbreak of COVID-19, currently affecting 216 countries and territories. The total COVID-19 response package from the EU for Ukraine is EUR 190 million.
The funds initially will be used to meet immediate emergency needs, such as procuring essential supplies and training for health-care workers, frontline responders and patients. In the longer term, the assistance will be assigned to strengthening the country’s capacity to respond to public health emergencies. The project is built upon the European Union’s and WHO’s ongoing support to Ukraine.
Background information: “Solidarity for Health Initiative” is a joint effort of the European Union and WHO Regional Office for Europe in six countries of eastern Europe and the Caucasus – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine. The project is aimed to help prevent, detect and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen the EU’s Eastern Neighbourhood’s capacity to respond to public health emergencies. The project is implemented by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and WHO country offices, in close coordination with EU Delegations, national authorities and development partners, including those in the United Nations system.
Background information about the role of WHO in COVID-19 response: The role of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine is to support the country in creating and strengthening policies for sustainable health development. This includes providing technical guidance in public health-related issues, supporting the development of standards and guidelines, building up local relationships for efficient technical cooperation, and ensuring that public health measures are coordinated and in place during crises.
Currently, the Country Office in Ukraine is focusing its work on COVID-19 response and cooperation with the health authorities and other institutions involved in the country-level coordination, planning, and monitoring, case investigation, infection prevention and control. WHO has been supporting improving the national and regional capacities to diagnose COVID-19 via the national laboratory system, and also improving clinical standards and approaches in the country.

Title: Government of Japan provides USD 4.2 million through UN and ICRC projects for recovery and support of vulnerable population in eastern Ukraine

01 July 2020
Press conference, dedicated to launch of new financial aid by Japan, took place on Wednesday, 1 July in the Cabinet of Ministers with the participation of vice-prime-minister of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories, Ambassador of Japan to Ukraine and representatives of ICRC and the UN.
“Japan stands firm on the position of supporting the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine and has been actively and continuously providing support to Ukraine since its independence. While Ukraine is still facing challenges ahead, let me assure you that the Government and the people of Japan are committed to continue their support to the people of Ukraine. - noted Ambassador of Japan in Ukraine Mr. Takashi Kurai. - Japan’s assistance to independent Ukraine over the last 29 years has reached 3.1 billion USD in a wide range of areas. This includes 1.87 billion USD of assistance to the Eastern Ukraine since 2014. One of the priorities of Japan’s assistance today is to improve safety, security and welfare of the local residents in Donetsk and Luhansk regions”.
Today, Japan’s support to eastern regions includes development of the local SME businesses, renovation of damaged houses for IDPs, provision of medical equipment, enhancing people’s economic safety.
Mr. Oleksiy Reznikov, Vice Prime Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine wholeheartedly expressed his gratitude to the Government of Japan and international partners for their continuous support and long-term successful cooperation:
"On behalf of my Ministry, the government and people of Ukraine I would like to express my profound gratitude to Japan and our international partners – ICRC and the UN. Everything that you do has a crucial humanitarian value for Ukraine. Today the Japan’s government is providing its financial support for the people and about people, just as teams of UN and ICRC in Ukraine do. They are our friends – a true ambassadors of warmth, empathy and love which they bring all to the people suffering today from the hybrid war. We enjoy our partnership with you, and we stay committed to ensure all the necessary support for everyone who is living now in a conflict zone”.
As per UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, this year Japan-funded projects, implemented by the UN, will be focused on a wide range of assistance:
“Today I note great progress, achieved jointly with the generous support of the Government of Japan and in cooperation with the Government of Ukraine, which is highly evaluated by beneficiaries - people and communities of eastern Ukraine, severely affected by the conflict. – said Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine. – This year UN projects on the east of Ukraine, funded by the government of Japan, will be focused on increasing job opportunities and access to business skills for conflict-affected people, on development of micro, small and medium enterprises sector in the eastern regions of Ukraine and creation of new jobs. As in previous years, we will be procuring medical equipment to improve quality of care in the Military Medical Clinical Centres under the Ministry of Defence”.
Since 2014, the UN through its agencies, implemented Japan-funded programmes that included reconstruction of more than 30 socio-economic infrastructure facilities in Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, including bridges, pump stations, healthcare facilities, rehabilitation centres and schools. Almost 3000 jobs were created for the conflict-affected population; 350 small and medium enterprises were supported through grant programmes; 6500 people developed business skills that improved their employability during 2015-2020.
«Becoming a significant contributor to the ICRC since February 2009, Japan’s assistance today helps the ICRC to provide necessary protection and assist people in Ukraine, and in other countries at war. In Ukraine, Japan contributions help the ICRC tend to urgent needs of civilians caught by the conflict on both sides of the line of contact in the east of the country by contributing to restore and maintain their access to services, in particular, water and healthcare, by improving their living conditions, when their housing is damaged by the hostilities, and by protecting their livelihoods. Thanks to the contributions of donors such as Japan, the ICRC can pursue its humanitarian response in a neutral and impartial manner, - noted Ms. Angelique Appeyroux, Head of Operations at ICRC Ukraine».

Title: 1 per cent of humanity displaced: UNHCR Global Trends report
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
18 June 2020
UNHCR’s annual Global Trends report, which comes two days ahead of 20 June World Refugee Day, shows that an unprecedented 79.5 million were displaced as of the end of 2019. UNHCR has not seen a higher total.
The report also notes diminishing prospects for refugees when it comes to hopes of any quick end to their plight. In the 1990s, on average 1.5 million refugees were able to return home each year. Over the past decade that number has fallen to around 385,000, meaning that growth in displacement is today far outstripping solutions.
“We are witnessing a changed reality in that forced displacement nowadays is not only vastly more widespread but is simply no longer a short-term and temporary phenomenon,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.
“People cannot be expected to live in a state of upheaval for years on end, without a chance of going home, nor a hope of building a future where they are. We need a fundamentally new and more accepting attitude towards all who flee, coupled with a much more determined drive to unlock conflicts that go on for years and that are at the root of such immense suffering.”
UNHCR’s Global Trends report shows that of the 79.5 million who were displaced at the end of last year, 45.7 million were people who had fled to other areas of their own countries. The rest were people displaced elsewhere, 4.2 million of them being people awaiting the outcome of asylum requests, while 29.6 million were refugees and others forcibly displaced outside their country.
The annual increase, from a figure of 70.8 million at the end of 2018, is a result of two main factors. First is worrying new displacement in 2019, particularly in Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sahel, Yemen and Syria – the latter now in its tenth year of conflict and accounting on its own for 13.2 million refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people, fully a sixth of the world’s total.
Second is a better presentation of the situation of Venezuelans outside their country, many of whom are not legally registered as refugees or asylum-seekers, but for whom protection-sensitive arrangements are required.
And within all of these numbers is a multitude of individual and very personal crises. As many children (estimated at 30-34 million, tens of thousands of them unaccompanied) are among the displaced than, for example, the entire populations of Australia, Denmark and Mongolia combined. Meanwhile, the proportion of displaced aged 60 and above (4 per cent) is far below that of the world population (12 per cent) – a statistic that speaks to immeasurable heartbreak, desperation, sacrifice and being torn apart from loved ones.
8 things you need to know about forced displacement today
Note:
UNHCR’s Global Trends report is released in parallel with its annual Global Report, which reports on actions UNHCR is taking to address the needs of all who are forced to flee, as well as the world’s known stateless populations.

Title: Collective centres for the older people and people with disabilities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts received personal protective equipment from COVID-19
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
17 June 2020

UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, together with HelpAge International, distributed personal protective equipment and Institutional Hygiene Kits which are specifically adapted to COVID-19 prevention to 10 public collective centres for the older people and people with disabilities. Currently, 761 people are living in these dormitories, who need additional security measures in connection with the pandemic.
In Ukraine, 23% of the population are older people, and 98.45% (69.93% of women) have at least one chronic disease*. At the same time, 81.68% of elderly (including 85.24% of women) need basic hygiene items (89.49%), urological pads (39.35%) and diapers for adults (20.52%)*. And access to such facilities may be hampered because of quarantine and other measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the WHO, people over 60s and those with chronic diseases are at higher risk of more severe consequences from COVID-19. According to statistics, mortality from coronavirus in people 60-69 years is 3.6%, 70-79 years - 8%, and over 80 years - 22%.
This week, collective centres for the older people and people with disabilities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts received humanitarian aid from the international organizations UNFPA Ukraine and HelpAge International, which included: cleaning and washing products (including bleach, washing powder, laundry soap and mops) and mops), hygiene products (soap, toilet paper, washing powder, paper towels, rubber gloves) and disposable medical masks. All these products will be used by staff of centers and people who are living there.
In addition, each package contained tips for the older people developed by HelpAge International on how to protect yourself from COVID-19 and UNFPA Ukraine's Break the Circle campaign materials on domestic violence and available assistance services.

Title: Eastern Ukraine Micro-and Small Businesses Require Support to Recover from COVID-19
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
12 June 2020
“The role of micro- and small businesses in eastern Ukraine, heavily affected by over six years of ongoing hostilities, is hard to overestimate, as they provide much-needed services and create jobs in their communities,” said Anh Nguyen, Chief of Mission at IOM Ukraine. “Because of their pre-existing vulnerabilities, IDPs appear more at risk of being unable to recover from the economic shock of COVID-19 control measures. Female-owned businesses are under greater strain as well,” he added.
Forty-nine per cent (49%) of the firms owned by internally displaced persons (IDPs) had to stop running, IOM survey revealed. Among the companies owned by members of Donetsk and Luhansk regions host communities, this share was lower at 36 per cent.
The average drop in sales during the quarantine was estimated at 25 per cent for the companies with monthly sales ranging from UAH 5,000 to UAH 50,000, and at 44 per cent for the enterprises with monthly sales from UAH 51,000 to UAH 250,000.
Almost one third (29%) of all businesses which had to shut down their operations said they would not be able to reopen without external support after the quarantine restrictions are lifted. Female respondents were less confident in the ability to restart a business without external support compared to the males: 34 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men said they are unable to restart a business without external support.
Over a half of the businesses surveyed by IOM (55%) indicated the need for financial assistance to cover their fixed operation costs, including staff wages; 41 per cent needed equipment to help run businesses online; 37 per cent said they wanted additional tax holidays or tax reduction; 15 per cent stated they required training on online business management.
“IOM calls on international, government and private stakeholders to jointly support the micro- and small businesses in eastern Ukraine,” said Anh Nguyen.
Background:
The International Organization for Migration has been one of the key providers of livelihood support to vulnerable populations in Ukraine. Since 2014, it has provided grants for vocational training, self-employment or micro-business to over 11,000 of conflict-affected people, 61 per cent of them are IDPs and 53 per cent women.
*Four hundred and ninety-one (491) respondents from Donetsk and Luhansk regions, government-controlled area, were interviewed from 11 to 12 May 2020 via phone. One fifth (121) of the respondents were IOM beneficiaries who received in-kind livelihood assistance through IOM projects from 2016 to 2019, and others were entrepreneurs who previously applied for livelihood programmes. Women represented 53 per cent of the surveyed entrepreneurs.

Title: Official UN Ukraine Statement on Ratification of the Istanbul Convention
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
25 May 2020
Gender-based violence against women and girls is not only a violation of human rights; but devastates the lives of women and families across the country. Here in Ukraine, women constitute 86% of the survivors of rape, and 78% of the survivors of domestic violence.
The devastating impact of this violence on women is clear; but what is less-often apparent is the deleterious impact on families, on the community, on the economy – and the country’s development writ-large.
The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the way we live – whilst it is bringing many families closer together, it is driving others further apart. With the compound pressures of increased unemployment and money worries, confinement, and a lack of social interaction, levels of domestic violence are increasing at alarming rates.
Back in 2017, in the concluding observations on the 8th periodic report of Ukraine, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) stressed the crucial role of the legislative power in ensuring the full implementation of the Istanbul Convention.
In 2018, the Government of Ukraine approved the National Action Plan for the implementation of the recommendations made in the Concluding observations of CEDAW. In Recommendation 26, the Government of Ukraine commits to introduce criminal liability for domestic violence and accelerate the ratification of the Istanbul Convention.
The responsibility is assigned to the Ministry of Social Policy and other central executive authorities to bring the normative legal acts of state authorities concerning the combating of all forms of violence against women into accordance with the norms of legislation and exercise public control over the ratification of the Istanbul Convention.
Moreover, the commitment to eliminate gender-based violence is in line with the Government’s commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 5 – namely the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres.
We condemn the recent cases of hate speech and verbal/cyber violence towards women politicians, public officials, human rights and gender equality advocates. Advocating for women’s rights and gender equality should not, under any circumstances, expose human rights defenders to heightened risks of harassment and attacks. Tolerating and excusing such violence perpetuates unequal power relations and gender stereotypes, justifies discrimination against women and girls, and fuels gender-based violence.
The United Nations in Ukraine calls for action by the Parliament of Ukraine to ratify the Istanbul Convention and create the change necessary for a society free from gender-based violence.

Title: Osnat Lubrani on the challenges that may await Ukraine in the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
17 May 2020
She shared this in an interview for the quarantine marathon on Suspilne (at 51:29).


According to the Resident Coordinator, the World Health Organization and the governments of many countries are currently looking for ways to fight coronavirus infection, and are considering lifting the quarantine, but this may take a long time.

In her opinion, quarantine restrictions should be lifted very carefully.
"Ukraine has a lot to learn from how other countries are dealing with this, and the task of the UN here is to facilitate the exchange of this experience so that countries can return to normal life as soon as possible," said Lubrani.

The UN representative stressed that this is not only a health crisis, it is also a very serious socio-economic crisis that will have a lot of impact on millions of people.

"No one will be able to cope with it alone. Countries and the international community must work together with a very strong focus on the most vulnerable groups. Food security is a problem for poor countries, but it also relates to world trade and agriculture," she said.

Lubrani noted that currently there is a question of agricultural workers returning to their work in the fields, however, it is necessary to continue to put safety measures in place, conduct testing, and identify cases.
"I want to emphasize that even when restaurants open and there are more activities that can be done, please protect yourself just as before, keep your distance, do not go to crowded places, and do not leave the house at all without urgent need. There is always the danger, that there will be a rise of infection cases," said Lubrani.

"The second challenge for Ukraine and other countries is to protect people at risk. For example, homes for the elderly and other similar institutions. We need to protect their employees and residents," she added.
She expressed confidence that strict quarantine measures were necessary for Ukraine, and that relaxing them does not mean that the virus has gone away.

"I want to emphasize that even when restaurants open and more activities that can be done, please protect yourself just as before, keep your distance, do not go to crowded places, and do not go outside in general, without urgent need. There is always the danger, that there will be a rise in infections" said Lubrani.

"The second challenge for Ukraine and other countries is to protect the vulnerable. A particular focus is on the homes for the elderly and other similar institutions where the risks are higher. We need to protect their employees and residents," she added.

According to her, there are also concerns about the identification of patients and their isolation, because although the number of tests in Ukraine is increasing, compared to other European countries, it remains low and needs to be increased.

"This pandemic has shown that the world is not prepared enough to deal with a terrible crisis. Among the challenges is climate change, which seems inconspicuous but can have a serious impact on food security," she said.

In particular, there is a risk that there will be more pandemics in the world in the future.
"It is also important for Ukraine. There is a big problem that many people in Ukraine still do not have constant easy access to safe water. For example, Roma community in the west and certain populations in the east do have problems with this," Lubrani said.

She added that the state should have a holistic vision of how agriculture will develop, as well as an understanding of the challenges of water scarcity and other important issues.

What is known

- Earlier, the UN reported that the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a food crisis, resulting in mass starvation.

- Also, according to UN representatives, the pandemic could affect people's mental health.

Title: Today the world marks International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
17 May 2020
For the UN in Ukraine, promoting equality, and combating all forms of discrimination is integral to our efforts to advance this global agenda and we therefore follow closely the situation of the LGBTI community within Ukraine.
We commend the progress achieved in the promotion and protection of human rights of LGBTI people in recent years. It is encouraging to see that equality marches are now better secured by law enforcement compared with previous years. The progressive improvement of response by authorities to discrimination against LGBTI people contributes to this community being able to enjoy the full spectrum of their rights. As we welcome progress, today we encourage the Ukrainian authorities to address areas where further improvement is needed.
Today, in the 21st century, homophobia, transphobia and biphobia still exist, poisoning our societies with intolerance. Hate crimes against LGBTI people are unacceptable. Addressing hate speech is an essential element in prevention of hate-based violence. In this context, the UN globally and in Ukraine have identified countering hate speech as a priority. As the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres recently pointed out, the outbreak of COVID-19 has fueled a wave of hate speech targeting vulnerable communities around the globe. So, it is now, more than ever, that we need to respond.
In Ukraine the UN remains concerned about incidents of violence and hate speech targeting the LGBTI community, attempts by state and local authorities to introduce discriminatory legislation and refusals of law enforcement services to consider hate motives in crimes targeting LGBTI people. State and local officials also have often failed to publicly react to blatant incidents of discrimination and hate crimes.
Authorities must take the lead in condemning violence and discriminatory rhetoric towards the LGBTI community and ensuring effective investigations of hate crimes. Furthermore, in the context of the global pandemic, I echo the call of Víctor Madrigal-Borloz, the Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity – for the authorities to ensure that COVID-19 response measures are inclusive of all people, whatever their sexual orientation or gender identity.
Discrimination and hate speech have no place in a democratic society. Each and everyone of us can stand up against discrimination and intolerant attitudes whenever and wherever they occur. Let us remember that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and while addressing global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic we should ensure to leave no one behind!

Title: The protection of civilians in the conflict zone should be parties’ absolute priority – Matilda Bogner, Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
08 May 2020
“To a greater extent, my appeal is addressed to the command of the Joint Forces Operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, since all new civilian casualties recorded by the Mission in May, occurred in territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’,” stressed Bogner. “In absence of a sustainable ceasefire, it is also essential that parties do not place their military positions, weapons and personnel in residential areas,” she added.
From 1 to 6 May alone, the Mission recorded 11 new civilian casualties (one killed and six injured as a result of shelling and small arms and light weapons fire, one injured in a mine incident, and one killed and two injured as a result of handling of an explosive remnant of war). They include incidents in Zolote (Luhansk region) on 2 May, and in Oleksandrivka (Donetsk region) on 4 May, when four girls (one born in 2010 and three born in 2013) were injured as a result of shelling and light weapons fire.
“On 7 May, we received reports of eight new civilian casualties caused by light weapons fire in Holubivske (Luhansk region) and Sakhanka (Donetsk region), both controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’. Reportedly, a girl and a boy born in 2006 were among the victims. Our Mission is working to corroborate these reports. If they are confirmed, the number of civilian casualties during the first week of May will have reached nineteen. This will be the highest weekly figure of civilian casualties for the last two years,” said Bogner.
If these eight new casualties are confirmed, the total number of civilian casualties this year will have reached 65 (nine killed and 56 injured), which is more than a third higher than the number of civilian casualties during the same period of 2019 (ten killed and 38 injured). “This will be reversing the positive trend we had seen up until now of a reduction in civilian casualties,” Bogner noted.
“I am particularly concerned that there are many children among those injured,” she added.
If two child injuries in Sakhanka are confirmed, that would bring the total number of civilian casualties among children from 1 January to 7 May 2020 to ten (all in territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’): six girls and three boys injured by shelling and light weapons fire, and one boy injured as a result of the handling of an explosive remnant of war.
“It will be important for the next meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group to pay due attention to the current situation,” Bogner noted. “Civilians are not a target, and the responsibility to uphold this principle rests not only with the military, but also with politicians,” she concluded.

Title: Pablo Mateu: Ukrainians in Donbas are entitled to their pensions
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
07 May 2020
The main task of the UN agency, headed by Pablo Mateu in Kyiv, is to help refugees. However, due to the war in Donbas, UNHCR undertook much of the work to help internally displaced persons (IDP) because of the conflict, as well as socially vulnerable people living in the war zone.
Deutsche Welle journalist Eugene Teise spoke with Mr. Pablo Mateu:
DW: Mr. Mateu, how aggravated are the social problems of the population in the conflict zone in Eastern Ukraine in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic?
Pablo Mateu: As a result of the conflict, primarily people of working age and families with children left, many of whom moved to the capital, Dnipro, Odesa and other large cities of the country. The share of elderly people near the contact line in Donbas, usually of 23 %, reaches 41 % since the beginning of the conflict. Older people are most at risk during the Covid-19 pandemic, but at the same time, access to medical services is difficult in the conflict zone as many doctors have left the region.
DW: How exactly can your organisation help?
Pablo Mateu: The annual budget of the UNHCR office in Ukraine is $28 million. We have immediately allocated 10 % of this amount to the activities needed in view of the pandemic. We first started monitoring the situation along the contact line – in 119 settlements of the government-controlled side. This became possible thanks to cooperation with our partner – the non-governmental organisation (NGO) “Proliska”. Before the quarantine, 36 settlements did not have transport connections with the outside world. Now the number is 71. About 50 villages do not have access to primary health care and do not even have grocery stores. When people were told to stay home because of the quarantine, it became a problem to get basic groceries. We have arranged help from other humanitarian organisations, which deliver groceries to these villages now. A number of charities and the International Committee of the Red Cross distribute food kits.
The Social Protection Departments of Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts also receive support so that social workers can visit the homes those who need it. Another big problem is for people to get their pensions. We are negotiating with Oschadbank to deliver pensions to places where there are no ATMs.
Aren’t you afraid that in a crisis caused by a pandemic, the government will not meet the special needs of the people in the conflict zone?
In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, international humanitarian organizations have agreed to allocate an additional $63 million for aid programs, the lion’s share of which will be allocated to the most vulnerable residents of Eastern Ukraine. The government is also increasing its support. Until recently, only the UN and the Red Cross, as well as NGOs, were involved in rebuilding houses destroyed during the fighting. However, since the end of last year, the State Emergency Service and regional administrations have joined this process. This is a very positive trend, which shows the readiness of the Ukrainian government to help citizens affected by the conflict more actively.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has recently called for the opening of the demarcation line in Donbas, which has been closed due to quarantine for several weeks. Why is this so important?
Since the introduction of quarantine, neither the OSCE nor the UN have been able to enter this uncontrolled territory. We also cannot send humanitarian aid, except in the framework of the Covid-19 pandemic. We, along with other international organisations, are currently sending disinfectants and personal protective equipment, and the WHO and the Red Cross provide medical equipments. The second aspect is the need to open the contact line for the civilian population. There are many people “stuck” on the other side: for example, people who went to visit relatives on the eve of the closure of checkpoints and have not been able to return home for more than a month. In addition, many retirees live in non-government controlled areas (NGCA). Before the closure of the contact line, they regularly went to the controlled area to receive their pensions. Now they cannot get it.
All those who come to Ukraine during quarantine are sent to a two-week self-isolation. Will it be necessary to create special entry conditions for those crossing the contact line in Donbas?
At some checkpoints on the contact line, right behind the barrier of border guards there are branches of Oshchadbank, where people can get their pension. For example, there is such a branch in Stanytsia Luhanska. It would be worth opening more of those Oshchadbank mobile branches at other checkpoints so that people can withdraw their pensions and not go to the city for this purpose. If people want to visit relatives in Kyiv or other regions, they obviously have to be subject to the same self-isolation regulations that apply when crossing borders.
However, this will not solve all the problems linked to receiving pensions. After all, people have to regularly certify their actual residence in government-controlled territory. How to solve this problem?
A pension is a human right a person has earned by many years of work. The people did not choose to find themselves in NGCA. We are trying to persuade the Ukrainian government to abandon mandatory registration of IDPs wanting to receive their pension. This only forces people to obtain a fictitious IDP status in order to exercise their right to an earned pension. I hope that the pandemic can force the government to reconsider its approach to the registration of IDPs, as well as help increase the rights of Ukrainian citizens living in NGCA.
According to Ukrainian legislation, the non-government controlled territories of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts are “temporarily occupied” and controlled by “armed formations of the Russian Federation” and “the occupation administration of the Russian Federation”. Doesn’t this fall under the principles of international humanitarian law, which make the occupier responsible for respecting rights of the civilian population?
This territory is a part of Ukraine. The people who live there are Ukrainians. They have not lost their Ukrainian citizenship. When you talk to them, you realize that many of them still feel Ukrainians. Most of them remain in NGCA, not out of ideological conviction – they do not want to join Russia or have any independence – but because they are elders and they simply do not want to go through the challenges faced by displaced persons. The more you cut ties with people living on the other side of the line, the harder it will be to find ways to resolve the conflict peacefully. It is very important to maintain these connections by giving people the opportunity to visit other regions of Ukraine, by giving young people the opportunity to receive an education and by providing access to medical services. It is equally important that people living in the territories often called “occupied” in Ukraine, receive humanitarian aid not from Russia or from the de facto authorities of those territories, but from international organisations and countries that are friends of Ukraine. In addition, the experience of other Russian-related unrecognised territories, such as South Ossetia or Abkhazia, shows that Russian aid is diminishing over time. Finally, I assume that the people living in the non-government controlled territory of Donbas understand the situation will become increasingly difficult.

Title: UNICEF provides UAH 16 million worth of essential supplies in response to COVID-19 in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
06 May 2020
To support the national health care system in response to COVID-19, UNICEF has shipped oxygen concentrators, oximeters and personal protection equipment for medical workers. The batch of the much-needed supplies has been delivered to the regions this week.
“UNICEF is standing ready to support health care institutions with critical supplies in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. This assistance will help patients with severe respiratory disorders, and doctors, tirelessly performing their jobs in hazardous environments,” said Ms. Lotta Sylwander, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine. “We also appreciate all the contributions from our private sector partners that made this help possible.”
Nineteen health care facilities in conflict-affected eastern Ukraine will benefit from oxygen concentrators. UNICEF is also procuring personal protective equipment and sanitizers to the laboratory that provides the entire Donetsk region with coronavirus PCR testing.
An adequate water and hygiene supply remains essential, especially in areas with frequent water supply cuts. Together with private sector partners, UNICEF is delivering over 200 tons of drinking water, creating a reliable stock in health care facilities in the east. Around 10,000 medical staff and patients will receive sanitary kits, as a part of the COVID-19 response. Water and hygiene supplies worth nearly UAH 6 million.
UNICEF is continuing to work with local markets and companies in response to COVID-19 pandemic.
UNICEF is calling for support from international communities and local businesses to fund its US$29.9 million COVID-19 appeal – including US$ 8.5 million for humanitarian response – to help reach and protect the most vulnerable children and women in Ukraine.

Title: The rights and health of refugees, migrants and stateless must be protected in COVID-19 response. Joint press release from OHCHR, IOM, UNHCR and WHO
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
31 March 2020
Three-quarters of the world’s refugees and many migrants are hosted in developing regions where health systems are already overwhelmed and under-capacitated. Many live in overcrowded camps, settlements, makeshift shelters or reception centres, where they lack adequate access to health services, clean water and sanitation.
The situation for refugees and migrants held in formal and informal places of detention, in cramped and unsanitary conditions, is particularly worrying. Considering the lethal consequences a COVID-19 outbreak would have, they should be released without delay. Migrant children and their families and those detained without a sufficient legal basis should be immediately released.
This disease can be controlled only if there is an inclusive approach which protects every individual’s rights to life and health. Migrants and refugees are disproportionately vulnerable to exclusion, stigma and discrimination, particularly when undocumented. To avert a catastrophe, governments must do all they can to protect the rights and the health of everyone. Protecting the rights and the health of all people will in fact help control the spread of the virus.
It is vital that everyone, including all migrants and refugees, are ensured equal access to health services and are effectively included in national responses to COVID-19, including prevention, testing and treatment. Inclusion will help not only to protect the rights of refugees and migrants, but will also serve to protect public health and stem the global spread of COVID-19. While many nations protect and host refugee and migrant populations, they are often not equipped to respond to crises such as COVID-19. To ensure refugees and migrants have adequate access to national health services, States may need additional financial support. This is where the world’s financial institutions can play a leading role in making funds available.
While countries are closing their borders and limiting cross-border movements, there are ways to manage border restrictions in a manner which respects international human rights and refugee protection standards, including the principle of non-refoulement, through quarantine and health checks.
More than ever, as COVID-19 poses a global threat to our collective humanity, our primary focus should be on the preservation of life, regardless of status. This crisis demands a coherent, effective international approach that leaves no-one behind. At this crucial moment we all need to rally around a common objective, fighting this deadly virus. Many refugees, displaced, stateless people and migrants have skills and resources that can also be part of the solution.
We cannot allow fear or intolerance to undermine rights or compromise the effectiveness of responses to the global pandemic. We are all in this together. We can only defeat this virus when each and every one of us is protected.

Title: UN and Humanitarian Actors Call for US$165 Million to Respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ukraine
Content: Donate to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund
26 March 2020
The plan defines the response efforts being undertaken by the UN, front line humanitarian actors and public health and health service providers to mitigate the humanitarian consequences of the virus transmission, which is estimated to impact up to 21 million people living in Ukraine.
Since the detection of the first COVID-19 case in Ukraine on 3 March, the number of cases continues to rise daily. Given the speed of transmission of COVID-19, there is a concern in the ability of the health system to cope with this unprecedented pressure. “While the exact prevalence of COVID-19 in the coming months is difficult to estimate at this stage, we know that a significant number of people could be infected. Out of this, at least every fifth needs medical attention. The physical distancing measures can slow down the virus to win time, however, they will not stop this pandemic. Our task, with partners, is to strengthen targeting tactics such as testing every suspected case, isolating and providing care across the country.” noted the World Health Organization Representative in Ukraine Dr. Jarno Habicht.
While the Government of Ukraine is making its own resources available to the response, the 2020 Ukraine Humanitarian Response Plan to COVID-19 launched today represents an appeal of US$165 million to support this response over the next nine months. The Plan considers the public health impact of the epidemic – as well as far-reaching consequences on the well-being of people and communities, which will go beyond the spread of disease, and span across many aspects of life from education, livelihoods, psychological well-being, and the ability to access basic human rights.
“We are keeping our finger on the pulse, carefully monitoring the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and stand ready to support the Government of Ukraine in responding to the fast-evolving situation. Our top priority now is to act fast to deliver assistance to those who need it most, while taking precautions to ensure the safety of staff and the people we serve,” Ms. Lubrani remarked. “The stakes are too high, and time is of the essence. We call on Governments and all stakeholders to facilitate humanitarian action so that we can provide life-saving humanitarian assistance, which we will do with full respect of public health considerations,” Ms. Lubrani urged.
“We are deeply worried about the next phases of the crisis and the risk of it hitting some of the most vulnerable children and families in Ukraine – including those who have been displaced, those who face poverty, and those who live in areas with limited access to healthcare and social services,” said UNICEF Representative in Ukraine, Ms. Lotta Sylwander. “We will not be safe until the hardest to reach are safe too.”
While the Government of Ukraine swiftly introduced several decisive measures to contain the spread of the virus, there is a growing concern that eastern Ukraine – ravaged by six years of armed conflict, with weakened health systems and an aging population – may face particular challenges in handling a COVID-19 outbreak.
“A large proportion of the population in the conflict-affected area is elderly – some 36 per cent – rendering it even more vulnerable to COVID-19,” added Ms. Alice Armanni Sequi, Head of the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Ukraine.
“We are particularly concerned for the elderly living in isolated settlements close to the “contact line” who are cut off from healthcare services due to insecurity, landmine contamination and poor road conditions,” Ms. Alice Armanni Sequi noted.
The humanitarian ask for Ukraine is an integral part of the “COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan” that was issued yesterday in Geneva and New York by the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. “In the words of the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock, “We must come together to fight this virus, and as we do so, ensure that lifesaving relief operations around the world continue. It’s a moment for solidarity and global action.”
