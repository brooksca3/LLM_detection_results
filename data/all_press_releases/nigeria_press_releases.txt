Title: We will stand behind you - UN assures, as States Action Plans for Durable Solutions in Northeast are launched.
Content: 28 May 2024
The plans recognise that displaced people can choose between going back home, properly integrating where they are right now or relocating elsewhere in the country.”
Abuja, 28 May 2024. In furtherance of their commitment to ending internal displacement in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States, the Government of Nigeria and the United Nations have launched the States Action Plans on Durable Solutions to Internal Displacement in Nigeria.
“We will stand behind you. Let me reiterate our commitment on behalf of the United Nations: We will keep supporting on the ground; We will help rally donors; We will chase missing partners; We will celebrate your successes,” said Robert Piper, United Nations Assistant Secretary General, and Special Adviser on Solutions to Internal Displacement, at the launch held at the Presidential Villa Abuja, Nigeria.
The Action Plans, according to him, are anchored in international standards and the Kampala Convention; driven by real political leadership; and are geared to mobilize development investments.
“The plans you launch today provide a model of how governments can take responsibility for ending displacement. The plans recognise that displaced people can choose between going back home, properly integrating where they are right now or relocating elsewhere in the country.” Piper explained.
The Vice President of Nigeria, His Excellency Senator Kashim Shettima, emphasised that “We must invest in sustainable development, education, and economic opportunities to build resilient communities. By doing so, we not only address the immediate needs of the displaced but also create a foundation for a more stable and prosperous future.”
He noted that the launch of the state Action Plans was meant to craft solutions that would outlive the present generation,  and offer future generations a place of hope, a home for all, and a land of opportunity where dreams could be pursued without worry.
Shettima noted, “As we launch these State Action Plans, let us commit to collaborative efforts that transcend borders and political divides. Let us harness the strength of our partnerships, both local and international, to bring about lasting change. The task ahead is immense, but with determination, unity, and a clear vision, we can make a profound difference.”

Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed commended the governments of Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe for their actions to scale up solution pathways in their state action plans, noting that achieving durable solutions is a priority for both Nigeria and for the United Nations secretary general.
“Finding durable solutions to internal displacement is central to achieving the sustainable development goals in Nigeria and beyond, and they must become an integral part of development plans in areas affected by forced displacement.” Said the Deputy Secretary-General.
She emphasized that durable solutions required long term investments in infrastructure, education, health care, as well as in security and the enablers social contract with the people.
Mohammed added that “Our joint efforts must offer the promise of inclusive governance, human dignity, and a world where we leave no one behind.”
The British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Ambassador Richard Montgomery, who spoke on behalf of the informal North-East Ambassador Group, emphasised that the group shared a collective interest in government’s efforts to bring peace to the North-East.
“We stand in support of the Renewed Hope Agenda of the current administration. As regards the durable solutions to internal displacement in the North-east, Montgomery noted, “No one country has the answer. We must join hands to ensure sustainable solutions to internally displaced persons (IDPs) issues in Nigeria.”
At the launch were the Governor of Borno State, H.E. Prof Babagana Zulum; Governor of Yobe State, H.E. Mai Mala Buni; Governor of Benue State, H.E. Rev. Fr. Hyacinth Alia; and Hon. Commissioner for Reconstruction Rehabilitation Reintegration & Human Service, Bello Hamman Diram, representing Adamawa State Governor, H.E. Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri.

Note to Editors
The publication of the United Nations Secretary General High Level Panel’s Report on Internal Displacement, and the accompanying Action Agenda on Internal Displacement created a pivotal moment in how durable solutions in situations of internal displacement are approached. Building on the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the renewed attention to durable solutions puts a significant emphasis towards government-led and -owned processes.
In line with this recommendation, and following the visit of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to Borno in May 2022, the authorities in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe initiated a process to develop their own action plans to address internal displacement as part of overall and long term development of their state.
Progress towards durable solutions requires an approach that steps away from a needs-based way of working towards an area-based approach. The activities, processes and budget elaborated on in the State Action Plans, ensure that attention is given to all communities affected by displacement – including internally displaced persons, returnees as well as members of the host communities. Addressing forced displacement in this way bears the promise for the State Action Plans to contribute to the overall development of the state and to leave no one behind.
Through their State Action Plans, the authorities acknowledge the need to ensure that methodologies, processes, and activities which form part of the vision to achieve durable solutions need to be evaluated in a timely manner with an aim to amend and strengthen their approach to achieving solutions. As an integral part of the overall governance system
for durable solutions, the people-centered approach described in the monitoring and
evaluation chapters will significantly contribute to ensure displacement affected communities participate in the overall development of the state.
All plans recognize the need to maintain humanitarian assistance where needed, work around preventing future displacement and progressing solutions where possible. Driving these plans forward and recognizing the longer-term systematic sustainability that is needed, ambitious budgets have been developed. While a significant amount of these budgets is reserved for access to housing –including elements related to secure tenure –they cater to a wider set of interventions such as economic development and access to services.

Title: UN condemns killing of children and women in Zangon Kataf, Kaduna State
Content: 19 March 2023
“We call on all parties to work towards a peaceful resolution to this violence and to respect the sanctity of human life."

Abuja, 18 March 2023 - The United Nations is deeply disturbed by the recent spate of violence in some parts of the country. Earlier this week, several innocent women and children were killed in Zangon Kataf, Local Government Area of Kaduna State. What is alarming is the barbaric and senseless killings of young children including a young boy who was abducted and murdered in the most brutal manner in the LGA.  This spate of violence comes soon after another series of violent incidents where numerous of people including children were killed in Kwande Local Government Area of Benue state.
The UN strongly condemns these attacks, which have resulted in the deaths of dozens of people, including children, some of whom were toddlers, women, and men. We are also deeply concerned that people continued to be killed and injured in subsequent attacks.
We urge groups involved in the conflict to immediately cease hostilities and refrain from attacking innocent civilians, especially women and children who have nothing to do with the conflict. We also call for a lasting solution to be found that will provide a sustainable and peaceful resolution to the conflict.
The UN Resident Coordinator for Nigeria, Matthias Schmale, said, "these atrocities must not continue unchecked. The UN stands with the government and people of Nigeria in their efforts to bring an end to this senseless violence, bring to justice perpetrators and ensure that all citizens are protected and able to live in peace and security."
“We call on all parties to work towards a peaceful resolution to this violence and to respect the sanctity of human life. The UN remains committed to supporting the government and people of Nigeria in their quest for a peaceful and prosperous nation”, he added.

Title: Applications open next week for the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme, the graduate employment initiative by the Federal Government and UNDP
Content: 01 September 2021
The programme will place 20,000 young Nigerians annually in private and public sector organisations across the country.
Applications will open September 6th for the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP), H.E, President Muhammadu Buhari announced today at the Aso Rock Villa. The NJFP is an initiative led by the Federal Government of Nigeria, with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union (EU), to match 20,000 highly skilled graduates annually with yearlong job placements in public and private sectors across multiple industries. The programme is open to graduates and organisations that fit the requirements found here.
In attendance at the official launch was the Vice President of Nigeria, His Excellency, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, and the Honourable Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, His Excellency, Mr. Otunba Richard Adeniyi Adebayo CON.
Other development partners who attended the event included the Chargé d'Affaires a.i Delegation of the European Union to Nigeria and ECOWAS, His Excellency, Alexandre Borges Gomes, United Nations Resident Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr. Edward Kallon and the UNDP Resident Representative, Mr. Mohamad Yahya.
According to one 2019 estimate, about 25 million graduates remain unemployed across the country. The NJFP aims to create a channel between graduates and industry, to help address this employment gap by identifying the emerging skills that companies need most, while guiding graduates to be more prepared for a constantly evolving work environment.
In his remarks, H.E President Muhammadu Buhari said, “An important part of our policies and strategies is to focus on employment and creating opportunities for young Nigerians. The Jubilee Fellows Programme will create new opportunities for 20,000 recent graduates annually and I encourage all eligible Nigerians to apply. I also urge private and public sector organizations across the country to join us by providing work placement opportunities, mentors, and funding to support the program. I thank the United Nations Development Programme and the European Union for their support on this vital initiative”.
The NJFP will champion homegrown Nigerian talent and opportunities by connecting organizations directly to graduates. The pandemic has changed our lives in many ways and made it even more difficult for young graduates entering the job market as well as for organizations looking for new talent. Through the NJFP, both graduates and organizations will get a boost in a changing post-COVID job landscape.
In his remarks, the Chargé d'Affaires a.i at the Delegation of the European Union to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Alexandre Borges Gomes said: “The EU sees itself as being at the forefront of promoting youth focused, and youth led, development. We see the young as change-makers, essential to the implementation of the Development Agenda and stand ready to assist Nigeria in keeping the young as an asset. This is why we are committing to support the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme.”
This fellowship is designed to help fresh NYSC graduates with zero work experience, who often find it challenging to break into the professional world. The long-term goal would be for the Fellows to feel that they are playing a meaningful part in growing the private and public sector landscape, helping to shape the future of Nigeria.
“Through the Jubilee Fellows Programme, young Nigerians will access skills that will help them to navigate in an evolving job market. By creating a channel between graduates and companies, the programme will help identify the emerging skills that companies need most, while guiding graduates to be more prepared to make impact, influence decisions and re-imagine future-proof skills”  said UNDP Resident Representative Mohamed Yahya. “We look forward to seeing the inspiring young talent of this country leverage this programme to continue to make positive change and impact in their communities”.
Applications for the Nigeria Jubilee Fellowship Programme will open on the NJFP website on September 6, 2021. For more information on NJFP, visit the website here. You can also watch the recording of the launch event on the Aso Rock Youtube page.

Title: North-East Nigeria: US$1 billion needed to address the humanitarian needs of 6.4 million people in 2021
Content: 16 March 2021
"A combination of escalating conflict, displacement, and disruption to and loss of livelihoods due to COVID19 restrictions, could lead to hunger for millions of Nigerians living in the north-east."
Abuja, 16 March 2021- Ongoing conflict continues to be the main driver of humanitarian needs in northeast Nigeria, where millions of people have been displaced. Longstanding insecurity and violence, compounded by climate change, and the impact of Covid-19 are increasing the vulnerability of close to nine million people. Close to two million people are internally displaced, while millions of people depend on humanitarian partners for basic services, and up to 5.1 million people are facing hunger in the lean season – the worst outlook in four years. The humanitarian community and the Government of Nigeria officially launched the north-east Nigeria Humanitarian Response Plan for 2021 earlier today. The plan requests US$1 billion to enable partners to provide critical services to the 6.4 million most vulnerable people - amongst a total of 8.7 million people in need of some form of humanitarian assistance in 2021.
“The humanitarian crisis in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe states, unfortunately, remains one of the largest in the world and continues to have a profound impact on Nigeria and its people, causing untold suffering and deprivation for millions of vulnerable women, men and children. The year 2021 marks the twelfth year of the conflict and the sixth year of the international community working together with the Government of Nigeria to provide humanitarian support,” said the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon. “Last year was a challenging year for vulnerable people in north-east Nigeria.
It was a year marked by a new reality, the COVID-19 pandemic. The socio-economic impact of the pandemic has already diminished the resilience of millions of people, increasing the fragility of those who were already extremely vulnerable,” he added.
“The requirements for this 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan reflect a growing need, while we know that the available resources will very likely not be commensurate with those needs”, said the Honourable Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq. “We are facing additional challenges in terms of security and access for humanitarian partners, which is why we have developed the National Humanitarian Development Peace Framework”, she added.
A combination of escalating conflict, displacement, and disruption to and loss of livelihoods due to COVID19 restrictions, could lead to hunger for millions of Nigerians living in the north-east. As many as 5.1 million people are threatened by acute hunger during the upcoming lean season – the worst outlook in four years.
The humanitarian community remains committed to working closely with the Government of Nigeria and local communities to reduce protection risks, provide basic services, including shelter, health, water and sanitation, education, as well as food and nutrition and, moreover, livelihood opportunities. The operation will increasingly seek to identify longer-term or durable solutions for those displaced, restoring dignity, self-reliance and hope for a better future, where possible.
“The main thrust of the operation in 2021 will continue to be providing lifesaving and life-sustaining support to people who are displaced, host communities, and others that are affected by the humanitarian crisis”, said Mr. Kallon. “This includes improving the living conditions in camps through decongestion and enhancing the quality of services. We will continue to prioritize prevention, development where feasible and humanitarian assistance where needed. A durable framework to find solution to the crisis in north east Nigeria must promote and implement the humanitarian, development and peace nexus,” he added.
“In 2020 the Government took major steps to strengthen its coordination and leadership role and structures at federal and state levels to bring better coherence to addressing humanitarian needs, while laying the foundation for stabilization and development of conflict-affected states,” said the Honourable Minister. “One of these steps includes the inauguration of the National Humanitarian Coordination Committee, which is the highest national advisory body to guide humanitarian activities in the country,” she added.
In 2020, only 55 per cent of the required funding for the Humanitarian Response Plan was secured notwithstanding the additional needs created by the COVID-19 pandemic, recording the lowest funding level since the beginning of the joint response. Nevertheless, humanitarian partners reached over five million people with potentially lifesaving services despite funding shortfalls, security challenges and movement restrictions caused by the ongoing violence and the COVID-19 pandemic. Malnutrition was averted for over two million children through their provision with fortified nutritious foods to address or prevent malnutrition, and two million people were reached with protection services, including sexual and gender-based violence prevention and response, enhanced mine awareness, and support in addressing housing land and property concerns.

Title: UN Strategizes to ensure African countries respond and recover better from the COVID-19 pandemic
Content: 03 March 2021
"Today marks the start of the next-generation collaboration approach for the regional UN entities to support African countries to respond and recover better from the COVID-19 pandemic."
3 March 2021
BRAZZAVILLE – Africa’s regional know-how, assets and policy expertise will be more systematically channeled to the Resident Coordinators and United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) across the continent as they help countries ensure an inclusive and sustainable transition out of the COVID-19 crisis, UN Deputy Secretary-General and Chair of the UN Sustainable Development Group Amina J. Mohammed stressed as she joined the first annual meeting of the new Regional Collaborative Platform on 2 March 2021.
“Today marks the start of the next-generation collaboration approach for the regional UN entities to support African countries to respond and recover better from the COVID-19 pandemic and reignite the Decade of Action for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is aligned with the Africa Union Agenda 2063,” Ms. Mohammed said.
The United Nations has been making progress on its sweeping reforms to strengthen its support to countries, leveraging its capacities at all levels. The new Regional Collaborative Platform has responded to the growing need for enhanced UN coordination and regional collaboration in the face of the pandemic and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. It brings together UN regional expertise, capacity and data to provide analytical, policy and operational support to countries.
Yesterday’s discussion, attended by regional representatives from the Africa UN development system, focused on high-priority issues for the African continent to recover better from the pandemic and move toward the Sustainable Development Goals. These included accelerating the implementation of the continental free trade agreement; investing in youth and women’s empowerment to help countries reap the benefit of their demographic dividends; advancing home-grown sustainable and scalable technologies and digital solutions; building climate and disaster resilience; and continuing to support the African Union’s “Silencing the Guns” initiative.
Across the continent, Resident Coordinators and UNCTs are supporting countries in their access to COVAX vaccines and their socioeconomic response plans. In addition to the pandemic recovery, UN entities will work together to support sustainable development efforts in the Sahel, the Lake Chad Basin and the Horn of Africa, and address the resurgence of Ebola, and climate crises with severe damage caused by deadly droughts, cyclones and locust outbreaks.
“We are still in a recovery phase for the continent. We need additional resources. Our low- and middle-income countries, as well as small island states, have lost a lot of their resources. They need more fiscal space. They need more revenues. They need additional liquidity to ensure we build forward better,” said Under-Secretary-General Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).
Although it was a transitional year, the regional UN entities demonstrated evidence of enhanced system-wide collaboration at the regional level. For example, last year, all of them joined forces to launch the Knowledge Management Hub on COVID-19 and shared a business continuity plan with governments to support their e-governance, e-justice and e-commerce for livelihoods, while the Africa e-education strategy was introduced to Resident Coordinators to provide emergency education to more than 100 million African children out of school.
“The African region is at a strategic juncture with COVID-19 recovery programmes and investments that we are making to enhance trade. All our efforts will yield desired results only if Africa’s people – our most important resource – feel productive, if they feel valued, if they feel safe, and if they feel secure,” said Assistant Secretary-General Ahunna Eziakonwa, Director of the Regional Bureau for Africa at the UN Development Programme (UNDP).
The new platform will engage with the African Union in April and accelerate its effort to deliver on its promise with an impact-oriented focus on implementations.
The Regional Collaborative Platform is chaired by the UN Deputy Secretary-General with two Vice-Chairs: Ms. Songwe and Ms. Eziakonwa. Its joint secretariat is comprised of UNECA, UNDP and the UN Development Coordination Office (DCO).

Title: COVID-19 vaccines shipped by COVAX arrive in Nigeria
Content: 02 March 2021
"COVAX shipped 3.94 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), from Mumbai to Abuja."
Press statement
COVID-19 vaccines shipped by COVAX arrive in Nigeria
Abuja, 2 March 2021 - Today, Nigeria received nearly 4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, shipped via the COVAX Facility, a partnership between CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO.
The arrival marked a historic step towards the goal to ensure equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally, in what will be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history. The delivery is part of a first wave of arrivals in Nigeria that will continue in the coming days and weeks.
COVAX shipped 3.94 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), from Mumbai to Abuja.
“The UN Country Team in Nigeria reiterates its commitment to support the vaccination campaign in Nigeria and help contain the spread of the virus,” said Edward Kallon, UN Resident Coordinator in Nigeria. “The arrival of these vaccines in Abuja today marks a milestone for the COVAX Facility in its unprecedented effort to deliver at least 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines globally by the end of 2021.”
The arrival of the CIVID-19 vaccine will enable the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) to commence the vaccination of Nigerians in priority groups, starting with frontline healthcare workers.
“This is a landmark moment for the country and the COVAX Facility’s mission to help end the acute phase of the pandemic by enabling equitable access to these vaccines across the world. We are glad to see Nigeria is amongst the first receiving the doses from COVAX, thanks to the excellent level of preparedness put in place by the Government of Nigeria,” said Thabani Maphosa, Managing Director for Country Programmes at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “Gavi looks forward to these vaccines being made available to the people most at risk, as soon as possible, and to ensuring that routine immunization services for other life-threatening infections are also delivered to avoid other disease outbreaks.”
Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, WHO Representative in Nigeria, said: “It is heart-warming to witness this epoch-making event and WHO wishes to congratulate the government of Nigeria for its participation in the global vaccine collaboration (COVAX) efforts and its commitment to protecting Nigerians against this pandemic. Vaccines are a critical new tool in the battle against COVID-19; therefore, this is a step in the right direction. These vaccines have undergone rigorous regulatory processes at global and country level and have been deemed safe and effective.”
The COVAX Facility is expected to deliver around 90 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the African Region in the first quarter of 2021 and has committed to providing up to 600 million doses to the region by end-2021 to cover 20 per cent of the population.
“After a year of disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, today we celebrate the efforts being made in getting the vaccine to Nigeria. With more than 150,000 Nigerians infected with the virus and over 1,800 lives lost, the path to recovery for the people of Nigeria can finally begin,” said Peter Hawkins, UNICEF Nigeria Country Representative.
“This is a very significant occasion - the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccines into Nigeria is critical in curbing the pandemic. The only way out of this crisis is to ensure that vaccinations are available to all.”
The COVAX Facility thanks the governments, foundation and other donors who contributed to making this milestone happen – including the generous support of the European Commission, countries of the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. For a full list of donors, please see here.
For several months, COVAX partners have been supporting governments and partners in readiness efforts, in preparation for this moment. They have been especially active in working with some of the world’s poorest countries: those that will benefit from the Advance Market Commitment (AMC), an innovative financial mechanism to help secure global and equitable access for COVID-19 vaccines. This includes assisting with the development of national vaccination plans, support for cold chain infrastructure, as well as stockpiling of half a billion syringes and safety boxes for their disposal, masks, gloves and other equipment to ensure that there is enough equipment for health workers to start vaccinating priority groups as soon as possible.
In order for doses to be delivered to COVAX Facility participants via this first allocation round, several critical pieces must be in place, including confirmation of national regulatory authorisation criteria related to the vaccines delivered, indemnification agreements, national vaccination plans from AMC participants, as well as other logistical factors such as export and import licenses.
As participants fulfil the above criteria and finalise readiness preparations, COVAX issues purchase orders to the manufacturer and ships and delivers doses via an iterative process. This means deliveries for the first round of allocation are taking place on a rolling basis and in tranches.
COVAX is co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), working in partnership with UNICEF, the World Bank, civil society organisations, manufacturers, and others. COVAX is part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
COVAX has built a diverse portfolio of vaccines suitable for a range of settings and populations, and is on track to meet its goal of delivering at least 2 billion doses of vaccine to participating countries around the globe in 2021, including at least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses to the 92 lower-income COVAX Facility participants supported by the Gavi COVAX AMC.

About COVAX
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, and others. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.
CEPI is focused on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio: investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.
Gavi is focused on procurement and delivery for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. The COVAX Facility is the global pooled procurement mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines through which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all 190 participating economies, using an allocation framework formulated by WHO. The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies and providing volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates. The Gavi COVAX AMC is the financing mechanism that will support the participation of 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Facility, enabling access to donor-funded doses of safe and effective vaccines. Gavi is fundraising for the COVAX AMC, and funding UNICEF procurement of vaccines as well as partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery, including support cold chain equipment, technical assistance, syringes, vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery. UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) will be acting as procurement coordinators for the COVAX Facility, helping deliver vaccines to COVAX AMC participants and others.
WHO has multiple roles within COVAX: It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL)/prequalification programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states. It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination.  WHO leads, along with UNICEF, the support to countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines. The Country Readiness and Delivery (CRD) workstream includes Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional, and country-level to provide tools, guidance, monitoring, and on the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines.  Along with COVAX partners, WHO is also developing a no-fault compensation scheme as part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments.
UNICEF is leveraging its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world and working with manufacturers and partners on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as freight, logistics and storage. UNICEF already procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunization and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund, UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19 vaccines for COVAX. In addition, UNICEF, Gavi and WHO are working with governments around the clock to ensure that countries are ready to receive the vaccines, with appropriate cold chain equipment in place and health workers trained to dispense them. UNICEF is also playing a lead role in efforts to foster trust in vaccines, delivering vaccine confidence communications and tracking and addressing misinformation around the world.
About CEPI
CEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017, to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI has moved with great urgency and in coordination with WHO in response to the emergence of COVID-19. CEPI has initiated 11 partnerships to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus. The programmes are leveraging rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI as well as new partnerships.
Before the emergence of COVID-19, CEPI’s priority diseases included Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya virus. CEPI also invested in platform technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (Disease X).

Title: Federal Government, UN Convene National Dialogues on Food Systems
Content: 02 March 2021
“We must mobilise human and material resources across the country, and come together to dialogue on how to build back better, the ailing food systems.”
Abuja, 02 February 2021. The Federal Government of Nigeria in collaboration with the United Nations system in Nigeria, has announced plans to organize series of dialogues across the country towards ensuring resilient, inclusive and sustainable food systems in Nigeria by 2030. This was preparatory to the September 2021 UN Food Systems Summit (FSS) convened by the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
The National Convenor of Nigeria Food Systems Summit Dialogue (FSSD), and Permanent Secretary, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Olusola Idowu, disclosed this in Abuja on Monday 1 February 2021, during a multi-sectoral, inter-Agency planning meeting for the dialogue.
According to her, the food systems dialogues, the first of which holds on 23 February, are based on five action tracks which align with the current developmental priorities of Nigeria, and therefore, immensely contributory to an improved food systems in the country.
“The five action tracks”, Mrs. Idowu explained, “include to ensure access to safe and nutritious food for all; Shift to sustainable Consumption Pattern; Boost nature-positive production; Advance equitable livelihood; and build resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks and stress.”
The National Convenor emphasized that the Nigeria FSSD would be organized at three levels: The Inception National Dialogue, aimed at identifying food systems challenges from multiple perspectives; the Exploratory Dialogues, planned to hold in the six geo-political zones and major cities in Nigeria to harness promising approaches from diverse stakeholders that contribute to food systems in the country; and the Consolidatory Dialogues, aimed to exchange views on the pathway towards sustainable national food system, identify intentions and commitments of different food system actors.
Providing some insights, Mrs. Idowu explained that in Nigeria, the Food Systems Dialogue would create more inclusive, healthier food systems, and encourage a collaborative approach towards building a sustainable food systems and enhance the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs).
The UN Resident Coordinator, Mr. Edward Kallon, observed that the COVID-19 pandemic had worsened the Nigeria food systems and the food systems dialogues would provide a critical opportunity to tackle the weaknesses that were exposed by the crisis.
“We must mobilise human and material resources across the country, and come together to dialogue on how to build back better, the ailing food systems.” He emphasized, “We are all members of the global food system, and we all have a responsibility to act.”
Mr Kallon informed that the UN Secretary-General’s Food Systems Summit was designed to galvanise new actions to deliver progress on all 17 SDGs, each of which relies to some degree on healthier, more sustainable and equitable food systems. “It will also enhance food security and sustainability of eco-based Agriculture and food systems around the world.” He added.
In November 2020, the Deputy Secretary-General and Chair of the Advisory Committee of the Food Systems Summit, Amina J. Mohammed, had invited all Member States to engage in the preparation of the Summit through encouraging action-oriented Dialogues, discussing ways to achieve sustainable food systems by 2030.

Title: FG, UN To Ensure Substantial And Positive Changes In Nigeria’s Food Systems
Content: 11 February 2021
“Nigeria is working with the UN and other stakeholders to ensure that the nation’s food systems are more sustainable, inclusive and resilient.”
Abuja, 11 February 2021. The Government of Nigeria and the United Nations system have reiterated their commitment to ensuring substantial and positive changes in Nigeria’s food systems.
“Nigeria is working with the UN and other stakeholders to ensure that the nation’s food systems are more sustainable, inclusive and resilient,” said the National Convenor of Nigeria Food Systems Summit Dialogues, and Permanent Secretary, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Olusola Idowu, at a webinar for journalists, held on Monday, 9 February 2021.
To achieve this, Mrs. Idowu explained, National Food Summit Dialogues would be organized across Nigeria and there would be a harvest of contributions towards shaping the pathways that will lead to collective determination of sustainable food systems and how they will contribute to achieving food security in Nigeria.
She further noted that the dialogues would consider how it would be possible to assess progress towards improved food systems as well as determine who needed to be involved in achieving the overarching objective of building effective food systems in Nigeria.
The National Convenor added that Food systems touched every aspect of human existence. ”In Nigeria and elsewhere in the world, the management of food systems profoundly affects the health of the people, as well as the health of the environment, economies and cultures.”
The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Edward Kallon, emphasized the importance of sustainability of the food system. “We need to put in place systems to ensure that we produce enough food for the current generation, without compromising the ability of future generations to have access to adequate food and proper nutrition.” He said, “As the population continues to grow, and with the many players in the food industry, there is greater need for all of us to understand how we will ensure availability of quality food in quantities that will cater for the needs of all people in a sustainable way.”
Mr. Kallon underscored the importance of the media in ensuring sustainable food systems. “Without the media, all dialogues would be likened to ‘winking in the dark’, no one sees what you are doing. Nigeria is blessed with a vibrant press in a pluralistic media ecosystem and populated by professionals who constitute one of the world’s best.” He explained and urged media partners to get in the flow of the UN Food Systems Summit, and to support “our efforts by encouraging debate and discussion among the population on issues of sustainable food systems for the country.
On COVID-19 and the food systems, the Resident Coordinator noted that coronavirus pandemic has brought to the fore the connection between food, health and quality of life, and also how many of our food systems are failing us, especially where inequality is most prevalent. “The pandemic has powered an unprecedented global appetite for change that must be channeled into transforming food systems to be more inclusive, more equitable and more sustainable. We must come together as stakeholders to build back better.” He said.
“While we must understand the purpose of current food systems, their functions and our own vision in the next decade. We need to also know the changes that need to be made for food systems to meet the SDGs expectations by 2030 and how stakeholders need to effectively work together or differently for collective action,” said the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) Country Representative, Mr Fred Kafeero.
He explained that Government, Food producers and processors, traders, donors and all partners needed to evaluate the current realities, to know what is currently working or not and the lessons  learned from what is not working, make recommendations for improvement and take action towards achieving sustainable food systems for Nigeria by 2030.
Speaking on the UN Food Systems Dialogue and ensuring access to safe and nutritious food for all, Peter Hawkins, UNICEF Representative in Nigeria, underscoring the importance of safe and nutritious food, said: “ One out of every 3 children in Nigeria is stunted; 1 in 10 children is wasted. This is not only a personal tragedy for families but also has a direct impact on human resources. Unfortunately, Nigeria’s food system has failed children, young people and adults in delivering safe, nutritious food.’’
“The UN is looking at a fundamental shift from feeding people, particularly children, to nourishing them. This would require transforming food systems and moving away from food production as a goal to looking at production as a tool to ensure nutrition security. UN is committed to working with the government, communities, traditional institutions, private sector and civil society, to achieve this.” He added
WHO Representative, Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo noted, “Nigeria already has a good number of policies and regulations, but what we need now is implementation.  There is a need to generate game changing solutions that can catalyze shift in consumption through changes in food policy, food environments, private sector and offering and consumers behavior.”
Highlighting that Non-Communicable Diseases are the most common causes of death and disability worldwide, Dr Mulombo who was represented by Dr Kelias Phiri Msyamboza, called for a transition towards diets which are healthier and more sustainable, economically equitable and socially just, taking into account the local context and cultural identity.
"Around the world, more than enough food is produced to feed the global population—but over 690 million people still remain hungry" said, Mr. Mohamed Yahya UNDP Resident Representative for Nigeria. He observed that successfully tackling these challenges required a major shift from our current consumption patterns to sustainable nature-positive production at scale. “This has become a necessity, as our food system is currently limiting our ability to achieve the SDGs". He added.
The Representative of IFAD in Nigeria, Ms Nadine Gbosa, called for inclusion of pro-poor nature-based solutions and climate change and environment policies to improve the capacity of the poor to manage risks. “Effort must be focused on making value chains inclusive through the generation of decent employment and improving resilience through social protection; while food systems transformation should be anchored in small- and medium-scale production, family farmers, women and workers in food value chains” Ms Nadine who was represented by Ms Florence Iseko, said and highlighted the need to address specific barriers to inclusive, equitable livelihood development; as well as the legal, institutional and market constraints to the realization of equity within food systems.
Speaking on “Building Resilience to Vulnerabilities, Shocks and Stresses”, Representative and Country Director, WFP Nigeria, Dr. Paul Howe, noted that “We need to explore solutions to ensure that if there’s a shock, vulnerability or stresses, food systems maintain their functionality and keep going. Or, if there’s a disruption, it’s able to recover quickly.”
He informed that the UN would work with stakeholders from across society to build food systems that withstand future shocks and stresses; as well as food systems that are truly resilient and will be strong taking us into 2030 to help us achieve Zero Hunger.
In September 2021, UN Secretary-General António Guterres will convene a Food Systems Summit as part of the Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Ahead of the summit, UN Member States have been asked to convene national dialogues. Nigeria’s inception dialogue on the UN Food Systems Summit, therefore, holds on 23 February 2021.

Title: On the first International Day to Protect Education from Attack, UN urges Nigeria to prioritise school safety, learners’ protection
Content: 09 September 2020
While the world marks the first-ever International Day to Protect Education from Attack under the theme “Protect Education, Save a Generation” more than three million children in the conflict-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe in north-east Nigeria are in need of education-in-emergency support.
ABUJA, 9 September 2020 – The United Nations in Nigeria today said safeguarding education from attack is urgently needed to restore confidence in schools as places of protection for children and teachers. This is particularly pressing in light of COVID-19, which affected 46 million primary and secondary learners across Nigeria due to pandemic-related school closures.
“As State Governments plan to reopen schools after prolonged closures, building a resilient education system to withstand future shocks should be included in pandemic response plans,” said the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr Edward Kallon.
He noted that prioritising safety in schools for educators and learners is an indication of the Government’s commitment to protecting investments in the education sector and a validation of Nigeria’s endorsement of the Safe Schools Declaration.
While the world marks the first-ever International Day to Protect Education from Attack under the theme “Protect Education, Save a Generation” more than three million children in the conflict-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe in north-east Nigeria are in need of education-in-emergency support.
“Education is essential to helping crisis-affected communities in the north-east rebuild and recover. Attacks on schools are a direct attack on future generations. I call on all parties to the conflict to take all necessary measures to protect education and give learners a chance to build a brighter future,” Mr Kallon said.
The protracted conflict in the north-east has had devastating impacts on education. From 2009 until December 2018, 611 teachers were killed and 910 schools damaged or destroyed. More than 1,500 schools were forced to close and some 4.2 million children in the north-east are at risk of missing out on an education. Hundreds of girls have been abducted, some even from their own schools, which are meant to be safe zones. The attacks on schools, communities and education itself are tragic consequences of a protracted conflict that has left a generation of children traumatized.
“As the world fights to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, children and youth in conflict zones remain among the most vulnerable to its devastating impact. We must ensure our children have a safe and secure environment in which to learn the knowledge and skills they need for the future,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres.
The UN vehemently condemned any and all attacks on education including abductions of school children, school-related gender-based violence, herders-farmers clashes, and repurposing of schools for use as isolation centres, IDP camps, markets or for military purposes.
“Schools must remain safe places, free of conflict and violence,” said Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General. “Our collective future as well as the achievements of all development goals depend on it. Safeguarding the right to education for all contributes to the achievement of sustainable development and nurtures the international community’s decades-long gains towards peace, economic prosperity, and social inclusion worldwide.’’
Left unchecked, the UN said incessant attacks on schools and learners could reverse the gains on education investments made by government of Nigeria, the UN and other multilateral, bilateral, and private sector partners over years.
Attacks on schools are a violation of humanity and basic decency. We must not allow these senseless attacks to destroy the hopes and dreams of a generation of children. We must do all in our power to ensure that schools and the children and teachers within them are protected,’’ said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “As the world begins planning to re-open schools once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we must ensure that schools remain safe places of learning, even in countries in conflict.”
With school reopening plans underway in many states, the UN called for increased funding, noting that it would go a long way in mitigating the effects of prolonged school closures on learners, especially vulnerable children, including girls and others living with disabilities. In north-east Nigeria, education in emergency partners are appealing for $55 million USD to provide emergency education to 3.1 conflict-affected children this year. So far this year, only $3.3 million USD, a mere 6 per cent of the total needed, has been received so far.
The Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to build a resilient education system, invest in human capital and strengthen communities who act as first responders in the event of attacks on schools.
To deliver for children in Nigeria, education must remain on top of the public agenda while Government should boost efforts to translate its vision for education into real change for children, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged learners.

Title: Nigeria: Humanitarian Needs Hit Record High, UN Calls For Urgent Support
Content: 14 August 2020
“The number of people needing humanitarian assistance is the highest ever recorded in five years of a joint humanitarian response,” stressed Mr Kallon.
ABUJA/ MAIDUGURI, 14 August – The humanitarian community in Nigeria called for urgent support for vulnerable people in the north-eastern part of the country, as the number of people in need of lifesaving aid has risen steeply. At the same time people’s living conditions and the security situation have significantly deteriorated since the beginning of the year.
Speaking at an online High-Level Briefing on 13 August, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr Edward Kallon, joined by the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq and Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, as well as other UN and NGO representatives, stressed that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the dire humanitarian situation in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, and risks wreaking havoc on the most vulnerable population.
“The number of people needing humanitarian assistance is the highest ever recorded in five years of a joint humanitarian response,” stressed Mr Kallon. “The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting us all. Its’ devastating effects will distress Nigeria’s most fragile region. Unless we take immediate action, we should prepare for a spike in conflict, hunger and destitution in north-east Nigeria.”
The ongoing conflict in north-east Nigeria - now in its eleventh year - and the upsurge in violence witnessed over the past year in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, have deepened humanitarian needs. Over 10.6 million people - out of a total of 13 million, or four in five people – will need some form of humanitarian assistance in 2020. This is close to a 50 per cent increase in people in need since last year, mainly from increasing violence and insecurity further compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We are concerned about conflict-affected communities who already face severe hunger and are vulnerable to the socio-economic fallout from the pandemic,” added Paul Howe, Representative and Country Director of the World Food Programme. “They are on life support and need assistance to survive.”
Though humanitarian organisations are providing food assistance to over 2.5 million people, the food security situation has gradually worsened over the past three years. In an area where famine was averted only a few years ago and where millions are still struggling day by day to find their next meal, the steep rise in prices and movement restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic are an insufferable shock. Up to 4.3 million people could now be facing hunger.
“Accessing the most vulnerable communities has become more challenging even for us as national organisations,” explained Ambassador Ahmed Shehu, Chairman of the North-East Civil Society Forum. “Many of our colleagues have lost their lives in the service to humanity. We are urging the international community to support the north-east. It is important we all come together to provide assistance to people in need and work even closer together, especially with local actors.”
“Needs are increasing and our work has become ever more challenging,” added Charles Usie, Country Director of Christian Aid, representing the international NGOs. “Since late 2019, there are almost no roads in Borno and Yobe states that humanitarians can travel on. With the upsurge in violent attacks by non-state armed groups, humanitarian workers and the aid they deliver are increasingly at risk.”
Over the past year, 15 aid workers were killed in wanton violence by non-state armed groups, greatly affecting the ability for international and Nigerian organisations and the Government to provide lifesaving assistance. Despite challenges, the humanitarian community remains committed to support the people of Nigeria who are desperately in need of assistance. UN and NGO partners have already provided assistance to over 2.6 million people since the beginning of this year.
As needs are increasing, UN and partner NGOs have reviewed their collective appeal and the budget required to provide urgent aid to 7.8 million people who are amongst the most vulnerable. The requirement now stands at US$1.08 billion. Whilst needs are rapidly increasing, funding is however at a historic low. With only five months left until the end of the year, aid organisations have received less than a third of the required amount, amounting to less than 30 cents for each person in need for the whole year.
“We know that many of our donors are facing extraordinary economic and social challenges at home as a result of the pandemic, that will require vast resources,” explained the Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr Kallon. “Now is the time for all of us to step up for the most vulnerable and demonstrate our solidarity amid the greatest global challenge of our times. Together we have already changed the course of history in north-east Nigeria for the better and we can do so once again.”
Since 2015, UN agencies and international NGOs have been working in north-east Nigeria in coordination with the Government, to provide life-saving assistance to those affected by the crisis that has ravaged entire communities in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. In 2019, humanitarian organisations provided support to more than 5.2 million people. Over 4 million of them received emergency health treatment or support, 2.4 million benefitted from food assistance; and, each day, aid workers saved the lives of over 650 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

Title: UN Resident Coordinator Edward Kallon calls for citizen-centered approach in the fight against corruption
Content: 14 July 2020
“Going forward, I would like to propose to you today an adjustment to our approach. It is our belief that we need an approach that puts citizens at the center of the fight against corruption."
The United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr. Edward Kallon, has called for a people-centred approach in the fight against corruption in Nigeria such that the lives of citizens will be positively impacted. He made the call today as he joined top ranking officials of the African Union and African Governments to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission at a Regional Webinar on Combating Corruption and Illicit Financial Flows.
Mr. Kallon, who acknowledged efforts of Nigeria in corrupt related convictions, especially in 2019 and repatriation of stolen funds from few jurisdictions, expressed belief that citizens should be put at the centre of the fight against corruption to make the efforts more impactful.
“Going forward, I would like to propose to you today an adjustment to our approach. It is our belief that we need an approach that puts citizens at the center of the fight against corruption.
It is only when citizens see tangible progress directly impacting their lives positively, that we can expect them to support the fight, to refuse to take part in corrupt practices and to report corruption incidents whenever they become aware of them. In short, we need to do better in demonstrating the actual benefits of the fight against corruption.”
Against the background of the upcoming first United Nations Special Session against Corruption comes up in early 2021, Mr. Kallon stressed the timeliness of the event for the African Anti-Corruption community to come together to jointly determine Africa’s anti-corruption agenda at the global stage.
Drawing from the experience in Nigeria, the UN Resident Coordinator proposed four specific actions to tackle widespread small-scale bribery, enhancing the development impact of asset recovery, create effective and responsive public complaints systems and improve transparency and communications in the fight against corruption.
In his goodwill message, the Deputy Chairperson African Union Commission, Thomas Kwesi-Qartey acknowledged the leading role of Nigeria in the fight against corruption, especially illegal financial flow noted that the Common African Position in Asset Recovery commonly known as CAPAR, which the Nigerian government was instrumental to its adoption during the 33rd Ordinary Session of Assembly of Heads of States and Governments of African Union held in February 2020 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, will be crucial in stemming illegal financial flow from Africa. According to him “the CAPAR will be extremely useful in helping African countries to identify, to repatriate, and to effectively manage the illicitly acquired assets in a manner that respects our sovereignty.”
The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, in his message likened the fight against corruption to that of COVID-19 charged individuals to take personal responsibility. According to him, “We all need to take responsibility for the fight against Corruption as we take responsibility against infection of COVID-19. COVID-19 kills, but Corruption kills even more. ICPC alone cannot fight Corruption. We all must be involved. Failure to take responsibility is dangerous to self and the society.”

Title: Nigeria Police, UNODC, EU to Safeguard Frontline Officers against COVID-19 Pandemic
Content: 10 May 2020
Police officers in Nigeria are serving on the frontline in the fight against this virus and are often the first representatives of the state that the sick can turn to for help.
On Friday 8th May, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes, the Nigeria Police Force, and the European Union, launched new Guidelines for Policing During the COVID-19 Emergency, tailored specifically for the Nigerian context.
Based on guidance provided by the World Health Organization, INTERPOL, and other leading international experts, these Guidelines set out practical steps that officers can take to reduce their risk of infection while working to prevent the spread of this disease and to protect the public from criminal activity. 10,000 copies of the new Guidelines, printed in booklet form, are being distributed to frontline officers.
Around the world, Police officers, whose duties bring them in close and frequent contact with members of the public, have suffered disproportionately from the COVID-19 virus. Sadly, in Nigeria the virus has already claimed the life of Deputy Commissioner of Police Francis Bissong, Head of the Zonal Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (CIID) in Benin.
By following the practical advice contained in these Guidelines, especially simple steps like wearing personal protective equipment, maintaining social distancing, and frequently washing hands, it is hoped that officers will be able undertake their duties in greater confidence and safety.
Launching the Guidelines UNODC Country Representative Oliver Stolpe said: “We often ask our police officers to take tremendous risks on our behalf, and the COVID-19 crisis is no exception. Police officers in Nigeria are serving on the frontline in the fight against this virus and are often the first representatives of the state that the sick can turn to for help. We owe it to them to do everything in our power to enable them to go about their duties in as safe a manner as possible in such troubled times. We trust that these Guidelines will be a significant step towards achieving this goal.”
EU Ambassador Ketil Karlsen also welcomed the initiative: “Raising awareness to limit the spread of the disease is of paramount importance. Along with health professionals, Nigerian law enforcement organizations are at the forefront of the COVID-19 response. By supporting the publication and distribution of these new Guidelines, the EU would like to contribute to safer working conditions for Nigerian police officers.”
Finally, the Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu extended his personal thanks and gratitude to UNODC and the European Union for their assistance:  “I would like to thank our international partners for working with us to prepare these Guidelines, my officers are doing a top notch job during this crisis and anything that helps them to stay safe while serving the public makes a tremendous contribution to the national effort to eradicate COVID-19.”

Title: Nigerian Correctional Service partners with UNODC, UNAIDS and EU to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 in Custodial Centres
Content: 07 May 2020
Since the lock down, UNODC has therefore partnered with the National Correctional Service first supporting efforts to inform inmates and staff on how to stay safe.
While there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 in the 244 custodial centres in Nigeria, reports from across the globe show that once the virus has gained access to prisons it is extremely hard to control its further spread. Prison overcrowding and the poorer health profile of inmates make people livening in prisons significantly more susceptible to contract the virus and to suffer severe symptoms if infected. Stringent preventative action is thus critical. Since the lockdown, UNODC has therefore partnered with the National Correctional Service first supporting efforts to inform inmates and staff on how to stay safe and subsequently through the provision of basic protective and preventive equipment and supplies, including gloves, face masks, sanitizer, dispensers as well as infrared thermometers.
The items were procured with the support of the European Union through the (‘Response to drugs and related organized crime in Nigeria’ Project and in collaboration with other UN agencies, including UNICEF and UNAIDS.
Receiving the equipment on behalf of the Nigerian Correctional Service, the Comptroller General, Ja’afaru Ahmed, expressed “appreciation to the UNODC and the EU for the assistance they have been rendering to the Service”, pledging that the “items would be judicially used.”
As the pandemic evolves, UNODC and the leadership of the Nigerian Correctional Service will continue to spare no effort to safeguard the health of the people living and working in custodial centres and other detention settings in Nigeria.

Title: More hands on-deck: Aliko Dangote Foundation contributes N1.5 Billion (USD 3.8 million) to Nigeria/UN COVID-19 Basket Fund
Content: 06 May 2020
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Nigeria is enormous and affects us all, and no institution can battle it alone." - Aliko Dangote
The Aliko Dangote Foundation (ADF) has joined hands with the United Nations in Nigeria. with a total sum of N1.5 Billion (equivalent to USD $3.8 million) contribution to the Nigeria UN COVID-19 Basket Fund.
ADF collaboration with the UN will bolster the Nigerian Government's efforts of strengthening the functional capacity of the healthcare systems and support to those affected by the coronavirus. The contribution from ADF, will go towards the procurement of the much-needed testing and medical supplies and equipment, to aid the healthcare response towards the COVID19 pandemic.
“The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Nigeria is enormous and affects us all, and no institution can battle it alone. It is therefore critical that we act in solidarity as a private sector actor and as a foundation, to beat this common enemy. Our goal is to contribute to the Government’s ongoing efforts of tackling the spread of the coronavirus and the arising challenges.” said, Aliko Dangote, President and Chief Executive of Dangote group and Chairman of the Aliko Dangote Foundation.
The UN in Nigeria is working closely with the Government to accelerate response to the pandemic; tackle the spread of the virus and ensure optimum care for those affected. The Nigeria UN COVID-19 Basket fund is designed to serve within the One COVID-19 Financing and Investment Platform through which stakeholders, including the private sector, can channel their financial assistance to the multi-sectoral efforts of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19.
The UN Strategy uses the Basket Fund (pooled fund) arrangement to support the rapid implementation of Nigeria’s National COVID-19 Multi-sectoral Pandemic Response Plan in the ten functional areas, through a bi-lateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) or Contribution Agreement between individual donors with the Basket Fund. A dedicated Fund and Project Management structure for the Nigeria UN COVID-19 Basket Fund managed by UNDP acts as the Secretariat to the Project Board and oversees disbursement of funds, procurement of services and goods and accountability.
Receiving the contribution on behalf of the UN in Nigeria, Mr. Edward Kallon, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria noted that, Nigeria’s win against the coronavirus requires a whole-of-society approach that brings all stakeholders on board to support the national response. He further commended the Nigerian private sector for its active role in supporting the Government, to mobilise the critical resources to tackle COVID-19. "We need all hands on-deck to help the Government to keep the healthcare systems working and be able to address the development challenges exacerbated by the pandemic." He said.
Besides partnering with the UN in Nigeria in support of the Government’s COVID-19 response, ADF is also a founding member of CACOVID, the Nigerian Private Sector Coalition against COVID19.

Title: UN Women Supports Ministry of Women Affairs with N38 million for COVID-19 Palliatives targeted to Vulnerable Women
Content: 06 May 2020
“Women in Nigeria make up 47.8 % of sole owners of micro-enterprises and 22 % of SMEs, with a high concentration in specific economic sectors, such as wholesale, manufacturing, accommodation, food services and agriculture.
As part of ongoing efforts to provide support to the Government of Nigeria on the COVID-19 response, UN Women is contributing N38 million to the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs towards palliatives for vulnerable Nigerian women. The donation was officially presented today in Abuja, to the Honourable Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen, by the UN Women Representative to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ms. Comfort Lamptey.
The funds will be channeled towards the procurement and distribution of relief and hygiene supplies including food items, soap, masks and sanitizers, which will be procured from women-owned businesses. These palliative measures are targeted at reaching 12,600 vulnerable women and girls who have been worst hit by the effects of the crisis, in 14 states across the six geo-political zones in Nigeria.
Through the oversight and supervision of the Ministry of Women Affairs, in collaboration with women’s organizations and networks in the targeted states, including the Nigeria chapter of the Africa Women Leaders Network (AWLN), the leadership role of women will be underlined throughout this pilot partnership effort: from the process of procurement of the palliatives from women-owned businesses, the identification of vulnerable households in the states in collaboration with women’s organizations, to the monitoring of the distribution of the palliative materials for vulnerable women.
“Women in Nigeria make up 47.8 % of sole owners of microenterprises and 22 % of SMEs, with a high concentration in specific economic sectors, such as wholesale, manufacturing, accommodation, food services and agriculture. These women-led enterprises will be heavily impacted by disruptions in supply chains and closure of markets; impacting on their ability to feed their families and be independent,” said Ms. Lamptey.
“Whilst the pandemic is one that affects all spheres of society, women and girls are being more adversely affected by violence, food insecurity and loss of income. Additionally, women and girls are the bearers of an unfair burden of care. During this time, they are most likely to be responsible for caring and providing for households including sick relatives,” she further stated.
UN Women through its support to the Ministry of Women Affairs will continue to contribute to strengthening the resilience and coping capacities of some of the most affected households, including vulnerable female-headed households, poor women with disabilities, and those affected by conflict in the country. The targeted support is also geared at improving the awareness and adoption of hygiene practices as measures to prevent the target beneficiaries and their communities from contracting the COVID-19 disease.
The Minister of Women Affairs thanked UN Women for the gracious donation and show of support. She highlighted the efforts and resilience of Nigerian women during this challenging time and commended the efforts of frontline workers and journalists for their selfless service. “Support will be prioritized for the most vulnerable women and those women who earn a daily income.” She also thanked the UN family in Nigeria, under the leadership of the Resident Coordinator, Mr. Edward Kallon, for highlighting the need to prioritize women’s empowerment through the UN-managed Basket Fund to guide the COVID-19 response in Nigeria.
The Executive Director of UN Women, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka has made the call to governments and stakeholders worldwide to integrate protection policies for women in their COVID response plans: “Where governments or businesses put income protection in place, this can ease these dilemmas, sustain incomes and avoid driving households into poverty. This response must also include those in the informal economy, where most women who work outside home make their livelihood. Such social protection is best directed specifically to women.”

Title: Secretary-General Press Remarks on COVID-19 Crisis
Content: 21 March 2020
We are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the United Nations — one that is spreading human suffering, infecting the global economy and upending people’s lives.
A global recession – perhaps of record dimensions – is a near certainty.
The International Labour Organization has just reported that workers around the world could lose as much as 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars in income by the end of this year.
This is, above all, a human crisis that calls for solidarity.
Our human family is stressed and the social fabric is being torn.  People are suffering, sick and scared.
Current responses at the country level will not address the global scale and complexity of the crisis.
This is a moment that demands coordinated, decisive, and innovative policy action from the world’s leading economies.   We must recognize that the poorest countries and most vulnerable — especially women — will be the hardest hit.
I welcome the decision by G20 leaders to convene an emergency summit next week to respond to the epic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic – and I look forward to taking part.
My central message is clear:  We are in an unprecedented situation and the normal rules no longer apply.  We cannot resort to the usual tools in such unusual times.
The creativity of the response must match the unique nature of the crisis – and the magnitude of the response must match its scale.
Our world faces a common enemy.  We are at war with a virus.
COVID-19 is killing people, as well as attacking the real economy at its core – trade, supply chains, businesses, jobs.  Entire countries and cities are in lockdown.  Borders are closing.  Companies are struggling to stay in business and families are simply struggling to stay afloat.
But in managing this crisis, we also have a unique opportunity.
Done right, we can steer the recovery towards a more sustainable and inclusive path.  But poorly coordinated policies risk locking in -- or even worsening -- already unsustainable inequalities, reversing hard-won development gains and poverty reduction.
I call on world leaders to come together and offer an urgent and coordinated response to this global crisis.
I see three critical areas for action:
FIRST, TACKLING THE HEALTH EMERGENCY.
Many countries have exceeded the capacity to care for even mild cases in dedicated health facilities, with many unable to respond to the enormous needs of the elderly.
Even in the wealthiest countries, we see health systems buckling under pressure.
Health spending must be scaled up right away to meet urgent needs and the surge in demand – expanding testing, bolstering facilities, supporting health care workers, and ensuring adequate supplies – with full respect for human rights and without stigma.
It has been proven that the virus can be contained.  It must be contained.
If we let the virus spread like wildfire – especially in the most vulnerable regions of the world – it would kill millions of people.
And we need to immediately move away from a situation where each country is undertaking its own health strategies to one that ensures, in full transparency, a coordinated global response, including helping countries that are less prepared to tackle the crisis.
Governments must give the strongest support to the multilateral effort to fight the virus, led by the World Health Organization, whose appeals must be fully met.
The health catastrophe makes clear that we are only as strong as the weakest health system.
Global solidarity is not only a moral imperative, it is in everyone’s interests.
SECOND, WE MUST FOCUS ON THE SOCIAL IMPACT AND THE ECONOMIC RESPONSE AND RECOVERY.
Unlike the 2008 financial crisis, injecting capital in the financial sector alone is not the answer.  This is not a banking crisis – and indeed banks must be part of the solution.
And it is not an ordinary shock in supply and demand; it is a shock to society as a whole.
The liquidity of the financial system must be guaranteed, and banks must use their resilience to support their customers.
But let’s not forget this is essentially a human crisis.
Most fundamentally, we need to focus on people –low-wage workers, small and medium enterprises, the most vulnerable.
That means wage support, insurance, social protection, preventing bankruptcies and job loss.
That also means designing fiscal and monetary responses to ensure that the burden does not fall on those who can least afford it.
The recovery must not come on the backs of the poorest – and we cannot create a legion of new poor.
We need to get resources directly in the hands of people.  A number of countries are taking up social protection initiatives such as cash transfers and universal income.
We need to take it to the next level to ensure support reaches those entirely dependent on the informal economy and countries less able to respond.
Remittances are a lifeline in the developing world – especially now.  Countries have already committed to reduce remittance fees to 3 percent, much below the current average levels.  The crisis requires us to go further, getting as close to zero as possible.
In addition, G20 leaders have taken steps to protect their own citizens and economies by waiving interest payments.  We must apply that same logic to the most vulnerable countries in our global village and alleviate their debt burden.
Across the board, we need a commitment to ensure adequate financial facilities to support countries in difficulties.  The IMF, the World Bank and other International Financial Institutions play a key role.  The private sector is essential in seeking, creative investment opportunities and protecting jobs.
And we must refrain from the temptation of resorting to protectionism.  This is the time to dismantle trade barriers and re-establish supply chains.
Looking at the broader picture, disruptions to society are having a profound impact.
We must address the effects of this crisis on women.  The world’s women are disproportionally carrying the burden at home and in the wider economy.
Children are also paying a heavy price.  More than 800 million children are out of school right now — many of whom rely on school to provide their only meal.  We must ensure that all children have access to food and equal access to learning – bridging the digital divide and reducing the costs of connectivity.
As people’s lives are disrupted, isolated and upturned, we must prevent this pandemic from turning into a crisis of mental health.  And young people will be most at risk.
The world needs to keep going with core support to programs for the most vulnerable, including through UN-coordinated humanitarian and refugee response plans.  Humanitarian needs must not be sacrificed.
THIRD, AND FINALLY, WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO “RECOVER BETTER”.
The 2008 financial crisis demonstrated clearly that countries with robust social protection systems suffered the least and recovered most quickly from its impact.
We must ensure that lessons are learned and that this crisis provides a watershed moment for health emergency preparedness and for investment in critical 21st century public services and the effective delivery of global public goods.
We have a framework for action – the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.  We must keep our promises for people and planet.
The United Nations – and our global network of country offices – will support all governments to ensure that the global economy and the people we serve emerge stronger from this crisis.
That is the logic of the Decade of Action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals.
More than ever before, we need solidarity, hope and the political will to see this crisis through together.
Thank you.

Title: Nigeria Hails the Generation Equality Campaign to Kick Off International Women’s Month 2020
Content: 04 March 2020
In March 2020, the Federal Government of Nigeria, the United Nations, partner organisations and civil society are dedicating the entire month of March to commemorate the strength, resilience and achievements of Nigeria women, whilst also highlighting persisting challenges to achieving gender equality, during International Women’s Month. Each year, the 8th of March is celebrated globally as International Women’s Day – a day set aside in recognition of the social, economic, cultural and political achievement of women. This year’s theme is I am Generation Equality: Realising Women’s Rights.
The commemoration of International Women’s Month in Nigeria involves a series of activities and events which began with a press briefing on the 28th of February by the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs, and which will culminate on the 31st of March with the launch of the Generation Equality campaign.
The Generation Equality Campaign is a global campaign spearheaded by UN Women to inspire and bring together the next generations of women’s rights activists with the gender equality advocates and visionaries who were instrumental in creating the Beijing Platform for Action 25 years ago. Executive Director of UN Women, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka notes the impatience of this generation to close the inequality gaps on all fronts, and especially with the unmoving economic inequality. “Women and girls use triple the time and energy of boys and men to look after the household. That costs them equal opportunities in education, in the job market and in earning power. It’s a driver of repeating poverty. Young women raising families are 25 per cent more likely than men to live in extreme poverty, affecting millions of young children, with impacts that last into later life for both mother and child.”
At the press briefing to kick start International Women’s Month  in Nigeria, the Honourable Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen described the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action as a progressive platform for women’s rights. She underscored the commitment of her ministry to driving the agenda for women’s empowerment and gender equality in Nigeria, and called on all stakeholders to work in partnership with the ministry to positively impact the lives of women and girls and to enable them to realize their full potential. Dame Tallen also highlighted the importance of including men and boys as advocates of gender equality.
UN Women Country Representative to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ms. Comfort Lamptey, speaking on behalf of the United Nations at the press briefing, noted that whilst Nigeria had made some progress in advancing women’s rights over the past 25 years, such as in promoting girls education and adopting laws to protect women from violence, persisting gender inequalities  in other areas including the under-representation of women in politics and high levels of maternal mortality constitute setbacks to realizing the national development vision of the country. She called on all Nigerians to recognize that now is the time to take bold, concrete steps in ensuring that we make significant progress towards achieving gender equality by the year 2030.

Title: Government of Japan Donates USD 474,272 in support of the Internally Displaced Persons in Nigeria
Content: 02 March 2020
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency in Nigeria welcomes a generous contribution of US$ 474,272 from the People of Japan for much-needed assistance to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in North-East Nigeria.
Abuja, Nigeria: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency in Nigeria welcomes a generous contribution of US$ 474,272 from the People of Japan to support UNHCR operation in providing protection and much-needed assistance to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in North-East Nigeria.
‘Sincere thanks to the Government and the People of Japan for this contribution. By providing this fund, you have asserted, yet again, our responsibility to deliver on UNHCR's mandate for the People of Concern in Nigeria. We commit ourselves to ensuring that this generous funding will be used to provide life-saving support to IDPs in North-East Nigeria.’ Said Alexander Kishara, UNHCR Head of Sub Office Maiduguri.
'Many of these displaced people do not have anywhere to sleep, no access to water, and their access to health and education services is very limited. With the help of well-designed livelihoods programmes, they can be gradually empowered to support themselves and their families'.
The project “Protection and Assistance to IDPs in Nigeria” will be implemented to touch approximately 30,921 people in Bama LGA, to increase the protection of affected populations, and restore human dignity, through monitoring of the protection situation, prevention and response to the plight of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, and provision of assistance through shelter and protection safety nets/livelihood support.
There are currently over 1.8 million IDPs in North-East Nigeria. The crisis, now in its 10th year, has displaced people several times over. Each displacement negatively impacts the stability of communities, disrupts normal life, and causes untold suffering to innocent populations.  Many IDPs are hosted in camps managed by the government and humanitarian organizations. They require continued support to meet their basic human needs.
UNHCR takes this opportunity to appreciate the long-standing collaboration with the Government of Japan and the Japanese people.  “The main objective now is to start implementing this project and continue to collaborate and work closely with the Japanese government to achieve what we have signed for and fulfil UNHCR protection and solutions mandate.” Said Roger Hollo, UNHCR Representative a.i.  “And we will continue to mobilize for more support for Nigeria,” he added.

Title: UN Humanitarian Coordinator Outraged At Attack Against Major Humanitarian Facility
Content: 15 February 2020
The UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr Edward Kallon, strongly condemns the attack by non-state armed groups against the main humanitarian accommodation in Ngala, in the north-eastern State of Borno. “I am outraged by the extremely violent attack on this key humanitarian facility where five United Nations staff were staying at the time of the incident,” stated the UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr Edward Kallon.
On the evening of Saturday 18 January, the humanitarian hub in Ngala was the direct target of a complex assault by heavily armed non-state armed groups operatives. An entire section of the facility was burned down as well as one of the few vehicles UN agencies rely on for movement and aid delivery. Protective security measures deployed at the humanitarian hub prevented any harm to the staff who was in the facility.
“I am shocked by the violence and intensity of this attack, which is the latest of too many incidents directly targeting humanitarian actors and the assistance we provide,” stressed the Humanitarian Coordinator. “I am relieved all staff is now safe and secure. Aid workers, humanitarian facilities and assets cannot be a target and must be protected and respected at all times.”
Aid workers are providing assistance to more than 55,000 people in the town of Ngala, near the border with Cameroon. In 2019, over 10,000 people arrived in Ngala, searching for security and basic services. Humanitarian hubs in Borno State are critical to the humanitarian response. They provide operating environments for aid workers in remote locations where some of the most vulnerable people live or have sought refuge.
“Such incidents have a disastrous effect on the lives of the most vulnerable people who depend on our assistance to survive. Many of them had already fled violence in their area of origin and were hoping to find safety and assistance in Ngala. This also jeopardizes the ability for aid workers to stay and deliver assistance to the people most in need in remote areas in Borno State.”
“I call on all parties to the conflict to respect the principles of humanity, neutrality, independence and impartiality which guide the assistance the humanitarian community delivers in the states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe.”
The United Nations and NGO partners in Nigeria are working to bring vital assistance to over seven million people in the crisis-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. They are increasingly the target of attacks. Twelve aid workers lost their lives in 2019, which is twice the number in the previous year. Two aid workers remain in the captivity of non-state armed groups
– ACF staff member Grace Taku abducted near Damasak in July 2019, and Alice Loksha, a nurse and a mother, kidnapped during an attack in Rann in March 2018. The United Nations and its humanitarian partners call for their immediate and safe release.

Title: International Women’s Month 2020: March Women’s Shadowing Scheme - Call for Applications
Content: 14 February 2020
Overview
To commemorate International Women’s Month in March 2020 and the global #GenerationEquality campaign, the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs, supported by UN Women, has launched the March Women’s Shadowing Scheme for young Nigerian aspiring women leaders. This experience-learning and networking initiative connects aspiring female leaders with trailblazing female professionals from across the world of diplomacy, development and the private sector. Convinced of the power of experience-sharing to propel professional and personal development, the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs is seeking out young female aspiring leaders with an aptitude for learning and a passion for advancing women and girls’ rights in Nigeria. Participants will benefit from a one-week shadowing experience with a designated host during the month of March 2020; gaining insight into the day-to-day responsibilities of a high-level professional. The shadowing experience will culminate in a celebratory gala event for both hosts and participants. In addition, participants will have the opportunity to share experiences and learn from each other as part of the shadowing scheme network, with the likelihood of forging lifelong connections.
The Federal Ministry of Women Affairs is committed to ensuring equal access to rights and opportunities of women and girls in Nigeria. The 2020 cohort of the March Women’s Shadowing Scheme is part of a series of inter-generational dialogue and exchanges being rolled-out in the context of the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action under the global #Generation Equality Campaign being spearheaded by UN Women.
