Title: Liberia joins global community to commemorate the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)
Content: 02 February 2024
Monrovia, February 1, 2024


On 06 February 2024, Liberia will join the global community to observe the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), under the theme: ‘Her voice. Her future. Investing in Survivor-Led Movements to End Female Genital Mutilation.’ The theme calls for increasing survivors’ space for voicing out against the practice to protect girls at risk of being subjected to FGM.

Globally, more than 200 million girls and women have undergone FGM, a practice that involves the removal or injury of external female genital organs for non-medical reasons.  It is a violation of human rights, causing irreversible physical and psychological harm to millions of girls and women across various communities.

Important progress has been made in eliminating FGM globally and in Liberia. Exactly, a year ago, on 6 February 2023, the National Council of Chiefs and Elders of Liberia (NACCEL), made a historic proclamation to ban the practice of FGM in Liberia. Since then, traditional ceremonies to effectively enforce the ban on FGM have been conducted in four out of 11 FGM practicing counties in Liberia, namely Montserrado, Grand Cape Mount, Nimba and Bong counties.

Liberia also signalled its commitment to ending FGM during the global convening of world leaders and women’s rights activists at the Generation Equality Forum in Paris in 2021, where Liberia pledged to pursue efforts to end Gender Based Violence and became a signatory to the collective commitment on eradicating harmful practices, including FGM.

This year’s commemoration of the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM will be held at the Vezela Vocational and Heritage Centre in Lofa County. Several activities are lined up to mark the anti-FGM Day including, traditional ceremonies to close bush schools and enforce the ban on FGM by NACCEL with technical support from the Liberia Crusaders For Peace and the official handover of the Vezela Heritage Centre to the Government of Liberia. Lofa is set to be the fifth county to conduct traditional ceremonies to ban FGM and close bush schools in the country.

The Vezela centre is one of the four vocational and heritage centres established by UN Women with funding from the European Union and the United Nations through the Spotlight Initiative to eliminate violence against women, harmful practices and promote sexual and reproductive health and rights. Vocational and heritage centers provide dedicated learning space to teach former FGM traditional practitioners new skills to enable them to pursue alternative sources of income to replace FGM. Other heritage centres are located in Grand Cape Mount, Montserrado and Nimba counties.
To date, over 800 former traditional practitioners of FGM are benefitting from alternative economic livelihood programs such as climate smart agriculture, business and vocational skills training with support from the European Union, United Nations and Government of Liberia Spotlight Initiative.

As we observe the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM, UN Women commends the traditional leaders and communities for their unwavering commitment to ending FGM in Liberia and embracing the concept of ‘initiation without mutilation’ which upholds positive cultural practices as part of the rites of passage of young girls, whilst eliminating FGM.

“Although progress has been made in eliminating FGM, Liberia is one of only three counties in the region yet to outlaw FGM,” says Comfort Lamptey, UN Women Liberia Country Representative.
“We call on all stakeholders to continue ensuring collective commitment to ending this harmful practice and ensuring the fundamental rights and dignity of women and girls are realised. We call on lawmakers to ensure that the FGM Bill that is currently before the legislature is passed into law.”

UN Women is supporting the Government of Liberia and NACCEL to commemorate FGM Day and to conduct bush school closure events with funding from the Government of Sweden.

Title: Joint Statement by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations (UN) on the post-electoral phase in Liberia
Content: 14 October 2023
October 14, 2023

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations (UN) in Liberia welcome the gradual announcement of polling results from the National Elections Commission (NEC) and largely positive preliminary reports from observers on the conduct of the elections.
ECOWAS and the UN note with grave concern the heightened tensions following a largely peaceful voting process. The dissemination of misinformation and dis-information, allegations and counter allegations, including actions that, if not contained, could undermine the integrity of the electoral process, have largely contributed to this tension.
The consolidation of Liberia’s peace is a collective responsibility of Liberians at home and abroad and, ECOWAS and the UN, therefore, call on all Liberians to desist from acts that threaten Liberia’s peace. In this regard, we urge Liberians to take a firm stand against violence and refrain from spreading unfounded information that may incite violence.
ECOWAS and the UN call especially on the leaders of political parties to demonstrate, in word and deed, their commitment to peace and the revised Farmington River Declaration. We remind all parties that the joint security is the only lawfully mandated security force to provide security to national installations including the tally centres across the country. Therefore, political parties are urged to desist from assuming the roles of security or law enforcement agencies.
ECOWAS and the UN urge all political parties to exercise calm and restraint as the tallying of votes by the NEC progresses and is concluded.
We underscore the importance of NEC and the security agencies to professionally discharge their duties with utmost respect for the rule of law.
ECOWAS and the UN urge all parties to resolve any grievances peacefully through the appropriate legal means in accordance with national laws.
Finally, ECOWAS and the UN remind all political leaders of their responsibility to safeguard Liberia’s hard-won peace which is vital for the country’s stability and democratic consolidation.

Title: Joint Statement by International Partners on the Electoral Process in Liberia
Content: 31 August 2023
Press Release





The International Community in Liberia commends the Liberian-led and Liberian-owned electoral process. We are mindful that the presidential and legislative elections will be the first to be primarily organised and administered by Liberia, since the drawdown of the United Nations Mission in Liberia in 2018. It is therefore a pivotal moment for Liberia to safeguard its peace and democracy and serve as an inspiration for Africa and the rest of the world.

The International Community in Liberia further commends the National Elections Commission for the conduct of a generally well-administered and transparent biometric voter registration and candidate nomination process and for its continuing efforts to demonstrate its independence and impartiality, which is crucial for public confidence in the institution and the electoral process.

As Liberia commemorates 20 years of unbroken peace, the International Community in Liberia calls on the signatories of the Farmington River Declaration 2023 to abide by their commitment and promote the conditions for peaceful, transparent, and credible elections, prior, during and after elections.

The International Community in Liberia is concerned by the recent reports of election violence, urges the authorities to investigate and hold those responsible to account, and appeals to all Liberians to safeguard the hard-won peace gains. We bring attention to inflammatory rhetoric which has the potential to instigate violence. We therefore urge political leaders to be active peace messengers and promote issue-based campaigns and refrain from incitement of followers toward violent action, especially violence against women in elections and politics and, to resolve any grievance through established legal mechanisms. We further caution against the instrumentalization of the youth.

The International Community in Liberia reaffirms its unwavering support to the Government and people of Liberia in their efforts to consolidate peace and inclusive democracy.

Title: Human Rights 75: Women and Girl's Right to Participate in Public and Political Life
Content: 04 July 2023
Press Release



Monrovia, Liberia – July 03, 2023 - This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the 30th anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. On April 24, 2023, the UN in Liberia officially launched the Human Rights 75 campaign (HR75) with the national authorities, CSOs and all stakeholders. Since the launch, a series of activities and awareness raising on the campaign has been ongoing during a series of activities in the country and through ECOWAS, including a radio talk show.

For each month in 2023, OHCHR, globally, shines a spotlight on one critical theme spanning a range of economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights – highlighting different aspects of the Universal Declaration and calling for concrete action by States and others. This month's spotlight is on Women's political participation, focusing on women and girls with disabilities. OHCHR will collaborate with the National Commission on Disability and the National Union of Organisations on the Disabled to host a dialogue with women and girls with disabilities on July 04 2023.

"While women's political participation rates are low overall, women with disabilities are even more underrepresented due to discriminatory norms and attitudes based on gender and disability. This makes people consider them incapable of voting or holding office due to stereotypical characteristics ascribed to women and physical or intellectual disabilities. This contributes to a lack of access to polling stations, inaccessible voting material, and few women political candidates with disabilities. Electoral processes should be inclusive and participatory, and any action to improve women's participation in political and public life must include women and girls with disabilities", said UN Resident Coordinator Christine Umutoni.

In his speech at the launch of the HR75, Honourable Frank Musah Dean Jr, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Republic of Liberia and HR75 Champion for Liberia, mentioned that the increased budget allocated to the National Commission on Disabilities in 2023 indicates the government's political will to ensure the inclusion of persons with disabilities at the level of policies and programs.


"To encourage women and girls participation in the body politic of Liberia, it should firstly begin with political parties themselves taking action against stereotyping and stigmatising them", said Rev. Fallah S. Boima, vice chairperson of the National Commission of Disabilities, speaking during the HR75 Live Talkshow hosted on ECOWAS Radio.

"The human rights framework recommends strengthening the national legal framework to ensure gender equality in the public and the private spheres and protect women from violence on and offline, and mostly supporting women and girls with disabilities", said OHCHR Country Representative Christian Mukosa.

Joint press release


4 April 2023

MARGIBI, Liberia – As Liberia prepares for its presidential and legislative elections in October 2023, the nation's political parties have united to pledge their commitment to peaceful, transparent, and credible elections. They have agreed to resolve any disputes through legal means.

On 4 April, at the Farmington Hotel in Margibi, Liberia, leaders from 27 of 31 political parties signed the Farmington River Declaration 2023, an enhanced and comprehensive declaration designed to ensure a nonviolent electoral process. This builds on the foundation of the initial pledge signed in 2017.

Today’s signing ceremony was organized under the auspices of Liberia's National Elections Commission (NEC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the United Nations (UN).  President George Weah attended and signed as a political leader and standard-bearer. Representatives from the government, civil society groups, the diplomatic community and international organizations were also present at the high-level event.

The UN and ECOWAS signed the agreement as witnesses. On behalf of the United Nations, Ms. Giovanie Biha, Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Acting Head of the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), signed the agreement. Dr. Omar Alieu Touray, President of the ECOWAS Commission, signed on behalf of ECOWAS.

The Farmington Peace Pledge obliges signatories and their supporters to uphold the principles of peaceful elections and respect the rule of law. The UN, ECOWAS, and international partners continue to reiterate the importance and centrality of peaceful elections to Liberia's stability and prosperity.

The upcoming elections in October, the fourth in the country since 2003, coincide with Liberia commemorating 20 years of peace. This pivotal moment serves to reinforce progress towards sustainable peace and democracy. The Farmington River Declaration 2023 is a strong commitment to prevent potential instances of violence, including violence against women, during the electoral process.

By signing this Declaration, the nation's political parties have displayed their resolve to ensure peaceful elections in 2023, with the international community fully committed to supporting their efforts.

Title: Joint Statement of support by the International Community on the Ban on Female Genital  Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) in Liberia by the National Council of Chiefs and Elders of Liberia  (NACCEL)
Content: 20 February 2023


Monrovia, 20 February 2023
The international community in Liberia welcomes the ban of the practice of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) in Liberia, as declared by the Chairperson of the National Council of Chiefs and Elders of Liberia (NACCEL), Chief Zanzan Karwor, during the commemoration of the International Day of Zero Tolerance on FGM held in Sonkay Town, Montserrado County on Monday, February 6, 2023.
Chief Zanzan Karwor declared: “By the power vested in me, as Chairman of all the traditional chiefs in 15 Counties, FGM is banned in this country” and he called on chiefs and elders to share the message around the country.
International partners also commend the efforts of the Government and people of Liberia, under the leadership of His Excellency President George Manneh Weah, with the invaluable support of the Vice President, Chief Dr. Jewel Howard Taylor, the mobilization and advocacy of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as well as women’s and children’s rights organizations and networks and other human rights defenders who have been campaigning over many years to eliminate FGM and gender-based violence in Liberia.
We recall earlier pronouncements by NACCEL and the Liberian Government, including the Ganta Declaration to suspend FGM/C for one year in 2019 and a further three-year suspension from 2022 to 2025. We welcome this latest call by Chief Zanzan Karwor and NACCEL for a permanent ban of FGM/C.
The international community commends this declaration to ban FGM/C in Liberia as an important step in a journey towards the abolition of FGM/C and other harmful cultural beliefs and practices. As international partners, we will continue to mobilize support for all initiatives taken by the three branches of Liberia’s government, NACCEL and other actors to abolish FGM/C.
We commend the latest holistic and respectful approach that includes continuous engagement with chiefs, zoes, elders, human rights defenders; provision of alternative livelihood opportunities for zoes; and maintaining traditional rites of passage for girls whilst doing no harm, through an approach that underlines ‘initiation without mutilation/cutting.’
We encourage wider collaborations with men and boys, adolescent girls, and other community and national stakeholders, including those in health, education, and other relevant sectors for a multi-level and system-wide approach.
We commend the fact that there are existing laws on which the Government of Liberia can build, including the Children’s Law (2011), the Domestic Violence Law (2019), and Chapter 14 of the Penal Code to protect security of the person, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Liberian Constitution. As international partners, we will continue to support ongoing national efforts to pass a law prohibiting FGM/C as part of our support to the Government of Liberia to domesticate the international legal instruments that it has ratified. These include the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and its Optional Protocol; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol) which requires States to implement legislation against FGM/C, as well as to take other measures such as public education, awareness campaigns, and protection and provision of necessary health services and psychosocial support to survivors.
The United Nations, international partners, and ECOWAS have been supporting the Spotlight Initiative and other programs aimed at eliminating all forms of gender-based violence including harmful practices such as FGM/C.

Title: NACCEL initiates move to stop the practice of FGM in Montserrado County
Content: 01 December 2022
Monrovia, 30 November 2022
The National Council of Chiefs and Elders of Liberia (NACCEL) has committed to close all bush schools and stop the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) in Montserrado County in January 2023.

The Chairperson of NACCEL, Chief Zanzan Karwor made the commitment during the launch of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence in Sonkay Town, Montserrado County on 25 November, 2022.

Following the pronouncement, Chief Zanzan Karwor called on the Chief Zoe (traditional practitioner) Massa Kandakai and the Paramount Chief, Stephen Goba to ensure that all Zoes within the Montserrado County surrender all documents and practicing implements in preparation for the official traditional ceremony to abolish the practice of FGM in early January, 2023.

Once the order is given in January next year, anyone challenging his authority will face disciplinary action from the NACCEL.
The Chief reiterated  NACCEL’s commitment to ending FGM as evidenced by pronouncements of the three-year ban on FGM in the country. He also emphasized the importance of providing alternative economic livelihood programs for traditional practitioners in the 11 FGM practicing counties.

During her keynote address, the Vice President of Liberia, Chief Dr. Jewel Howard Taylor called on NACCEL’s Chief Zanzan Karwor to engage the legislature and the international community to ensure the speedy passage of the FGM bill into law. Liberia is one of only three countries in West Africa that has yet to outlaw the practice of FGM.

The Vice President also presented a token to Chief Zanzan Karwor and requested him to visit all the Counties where FGM is still being practiced and ask traditional practitioners to stop the practice.
This year’s 16 days campaign is being held under the global theme - “UNITE! Activism to End Violence Against Women and Girls” and the national theme “With One Voice, Let's End Violence Against Women, Girls and Children." The campaign runs from 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, till December 10, Human Rights Day.
The  campaign launch event was attended by several dignitaries including, special  guest, Jaha Dukureh, UN Women Goodwill Ambassador for Africa on ending FGM and child marriage who served as key launcher of 16 days campaign; Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, Honourable Williametta E. Saydee-Tarr who welcomed guests, members of the Diplomatic Corp, Government officials, civil society and traditional leaders from various counties; and Ms. Comfort Lamptey, UN Women Representative and Acting UN Resident Coordinator who delivered a special message from UN Secretary General.
The UN is supporting efforts of the Government of Liberia to eliminate gender-based violence through the Spotlight Initiative, a global programme that aims to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls including harmful practices such as FGM.

Title: UN Women Goodwill Ambassador for Africa intensifies efforts to eliminate FGM in Liberia
Content: 15 November 2022
Press Release


Monrovia, 15 November 2022 - UN Women Goodwill Ambassador for Africa on female genital mutilation (FGM) and child marriage, Jaha Dukureh, will visit Liberia from 19 to 27 November 2022 to add support to the country’s efforts to eliminate FGM, a harmful practice against women and girls.
Ms. Dukureh hails from the Gambia and is herself a survivor of both FGM and child marriage. In February 2018, she was appointed UN Women Goodwill Ambassador for Africa to support regional and global advocacy efforts to end FGM and child marriage. Alongside women’s organizations and civil society, she contributed to the Gambian Government’s ban on FGM in 2015 after youth mobilization and campaigning in the country. She also contributed to an investigation on FGM in the USA by former President Obama’s administration, and the subsequent Summit to End FGM at the United States Institute of Peace.
Ms. Dukureh’s visit will coincide with the start of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence campaign which will be observed from 25 November to 10 December under the global theme, ‘Unite, Activism to end violence against women and girls” and national theme, ‘With one voice, let us unite to end violence against women, girls and children.’
“The visit follows Liberia’s sign up to the Generation Equality Action Coalition on Gender Based Violence in 2021 and is intended to support Liberia’s efforts towards the eradication of FGM through multi-stakeholder engagements and high-level advocacy and social mobilization,” says Comfort Lamptey, UN Women Liberia Country Representative.
Major highlights of Ms. Dukureh’s visit include; a public screening of ‘Jaha’s Promise’, a documentary film about the life and advocacy efforts of Jaha Dukureh; engagements with various stakeholders including traditional and religious leaders; a solidarity walk to end gender based violence in Liberia; the launch of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based violence as well as the launch of a Vocational and Heritage centre in Sonkay Town, Liberia.

The Sonkay Town Heritage centre is one of four vocational and heritage centres established by UN Women under the framework of the European Union and United Nations Spotlight Initiative. The four centers are expected to provide alternative economic livelihood programs to former traditional practitioners of FGM in Liberia.

Ms. Dukureh is expected to engage with various change makers including government officials, diplomatic community, traditional leaders, civil society, women’s organisations and the media. She will also reinforce public knowledge and increase education on the depth, scale and devastating consequences of FGM.

In February 2022, the National Council of Chiefs and Elders of Liberia in collaboration with the Government of Liberia proclaimed a three-year ban on the practice of FGM from 2022 to 2025. Nonetheless, Liberia remains one of the three West African countries that do not have a law criminalizing FGM despite having signed and ratified regional and international human rights instruments condemning the practice as a human rights violation, including the Maputo Protocol that seeks to outlaw FGM.

UN Women is supporting efforts of the Government of Liberia to eliminate gender-based violence through the Spotlight Initiative, a global programme that aims to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls including harmful practices such as FGM.

Title: Liberia: Put people before profit and ensure responsible business environment, UN experts urge
Content: 14 November 2022
Press Release
MONROVIA/GENEVA (11 November 2022) – The Government of Liberia and businesses operating in the country must urgently implement measures to ensure the quest for economic development does not continue to undermine human rights, says a group of UN experts.
“The present climate of irresponsible business practices provides profit for companies but does little for people. A sustainable and stable peace calls for accountability, transparency, equality, social cohesion, the rule of law, and respect of human rights for all,” said the experts from the Working Group on human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises.
The experts welcomed the Government’s commitment to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), and praised the development of a national action plan on business and human rights. However, they were alarmed at the absence of State oversight in various parts of the country.
“Facilitating foreign investment has superseded the implementation of responsible business practices,” said Working Group Chair Fernanda Hopenhaym, presenting a statement at the end of a 10-day visit. Basic infrastructure and services were lacking, especially outside Monrovia. “The general neglect of local communities in development planning is unacceptable,” she said.
The Government needs to ensure domestic and foreign business enterprises demonstrate much greater respect for human rights, Hopenhaym said. “A critical element is transparency and meaningful participation of affected communities in decisions regarding business activity,” she said.
The experts met representatives of Government, businesses, workers unions, civil society organisations and local communities to discuss the opportunities and challenges faced in implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Legal reforms, such as the Land Rights Act of 2018 and the Decent Work Act of 2015, were welcomed but implementation was weak. “The experience of Liberia shows the urgent need for a smart mix of policies, incentives and regulations to implement laws and promote a business culture that respects human rights,” said Damilola Olawuyi, the other member of the Working Group on the visit.
Human rights defenders, trade union members and community members were vulnerable to attacks and intimidation for speaking out against business-related human rights abuses and the Government needed to act. “People who are seeking to hold businesses accountable need to be respected, taken seriously, and offered effective grievance mechanisms to have their cases heard and remediated,” Hopenhaym said.
Among their initial findings, the experts reflected on the very limited employment opportunities, the significant hold that a small number of large multinational corporations have on the economy, the poor labour conditions across different sectors and concessions, and the multiple forms of systematic harassment, abuse and violence that they heard are faced by women and girls.
“Liberia should ensure that all government institutions dealing with business, and the Judiciary, together with the Independent National Commission on Human Rights have the necessary resources and training to provide effective oversight of corporate behaviour, and corporate accountability,” said the experts.
During their visit, the Working Group experts had meetings in Monrovia, and in Nimba County, Bong County and Bomi County. The experts’ final report, including its findings and key recommendations, will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in June 2023.
ENDS
The Working Group on human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises was established by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011. Its current members are: Ms. Fernanda Hopenhaym (Chairperson), Ms. Pichamon Yeophantong (Vice-Chairperson), Mr. Damilola Olawuyi, Mr. Robert McCorquodale, and Ms. Elżbieta Karska.
The Working Group is part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent human rights monitoring mechanisms. The Working Group reports to the Human Rights Council and to the UN General Assembly. Special Procedures mandate-holders are independent human rights experts appointed by the Human Rights Council to address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. The experts are not UN staff and are independent from any government or organization. They serve in their individual capacity and do not receive a salary for their work.
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, unanimously endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011 (resolution 17/4), provide the authoritative global standard for action to safeguard human rights in a business context, clarifying what is expected by governments and companies to prevent and address impacts on human rights arising from business activity.

UN Resident Coordinator in Liberia, Mr. Niels Scott



Monrovia, August 22, 2022 - The United Nations in Liberia is hosting a One-day Roundtable Dialogue with The Private Sector on Tuesday, 23 August 2022, at the Monrovia City Hall to discuss and identify opportunities for mutual collaboration and partnership. The Dialogue, to be led by the UN Resident Coordinator, will include the participation of the Liberia Chamber of Commerce. Liberia Bankers Association, Liberia Business Association, Chief Executive Officers of MTN, ArcelorMittal, Golden Veloreum, Mano Manufacturing, Bollore Logistics, Orange Foundation, and the United Nations Heads of Agencies and others.
The UN Vision 2030 is “To support Liberia to become a reconciled, transformed, and prosperous nation anchored on accountable institutions and equitable, inclusive, and sustainable development.”
The UN recognizes the critical role of the Private Sector in supporting the Government of Liberia’s Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD) aspirations and contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The partnership between the United Nations and the Private Sector in Liberia has been minimal over the years. This dialogue presents the opportunity for the Private Sector and the United Nations to have a mutual understanding of their contributions to the socio-economic development of Liberia and identify strong collaboration and partnership areas.
“The UN System in Liberia is committed towards a mutually stronger partnership with the private sector to support Liberia’s socio-economic development,” says UN Resident Coordinator in Liberia, Mr. Niels Scott.
During the dialogue, the Private Sector will highlight their work, and the UN Agencies will do the same.
Notes to the Editor
The UN's global development agenda, the SDGs, are unprecedently ambitious and requires the mobilization of all, including governments, businesses, donors, and civil society, as never before for its implementation. The UN in Liberia developed and signed the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework with the Government of Liberia in 2019. The implementation of this Framework runs from 2020 to 2024.

Title: Joint Statement by the International Community on Political Violence
Content: 02 August 2022
The International Community in Liberia, having learnt with concern of the serious violence committed in Monrovia on 26 July, condemns without reservation, such acts which occurred on the 175th anniversary of Independence.
We urge a prompt and thorough investigation by the police, that will bring to justice the instigators and perpetrators of these acts of violence.
We welcome the swift condemnation by political, governmental, and civil society actors of the violent acts which occurred, and we encourage all political leaders to act firmly in preventing and eliminating political intolerance and violence.
Liberia has a record of free, fair, and transparent elections over the last two decades, making this country an example of stability and democracy in the region.
Violence is not the right way to resolve disputes. Political differences should be resolved by dialogue.
We therefore encourage all actors to act responsibly and embrace the principles of tolerance, democracy, and constitutionalism for an inclusive, transparent, and peaceful election process in Liberia 2022-2023.

Title: Assistant Secretary General and UN Women Deputy Executive Director reiterates UN Women Commitment to Promote Gender Equality and Women Empowerment in Liberia
Content: 30 June 2022
Monrovia, 28 June 2022 - Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and UN Women Deputy Executive Director, Asa Regner, has concluded her first official mission to Liberia.
While in the country,  she held several strategic meetings with high-level government officials and women leaders. She also interacted with women who are beneficiaries of UN Women interventions in Liberia.
Ms. Regner was accompanied by UN Women Regional Director for West and Central Africa, Ms. Oulimata Sarr.
Some of the high-level officials that Ms. Regner met include, Vice President of Liberia, Chief Dr. Jewel Howard Taylor; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hon. Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah; Acting Minister of Justice, Hon. Nyanti Tuan, Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, Hon. Williametta Saydee Tarr; and Minister of Internal Affairs, Hon. Varney Sirleaf. Ms. Regner also had a chance to meet the UN Country Team and members of the diplomatic community and development partners.
During her engagements, Ms. Regner emphasized UN Women’s commitment to support the Government and people of Liberia to promote gender equality and women empowerment in the country.
She noted that Liberia has made important strides to advance the rights of women and girls over the past two decades through legislative reforms and targeted programmes to eradicate discriminatory barriers and harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, despite challenges.
Ms. Regner had an opportunity to visit the vocational and heritage centre in Todee in Montserrado County constructed by UN Women under the European Union, and UN Spotlight Initiative. UN Women is establishing four vocational and heritage centres in four Counties to provide alternative economic livelihood programs to traditional practitioners as part of interventions to eliminate FGM in Liberia. The centres will serve as dedicated learning centres for traditional practitioners and young women and girls to acquire new livelihood skills.
Ms. Regner also interacted with former traditional practitioners of female genital mutilation. At least 300 traditional practitioners have benefitted from the alternative economic livelihood programme, which was launched in December 2019 under the Spotlight Initiative.
Although milestones have been achieved, there has been little progress in women’s political participation, leadership, and representation in national and local governance. The percentage of women in the legislature has fallen from over 16 percent in 2006 to less than 11 percent currently.
Ms. Regner called upon the country leadership to foster a common agenda to promote women political participation and take advantage of the 30 percent gender quota for political party candidates, as Liberia is preparing for the 2023 elections.
The UN Women Deputy Executive Director was also delighted to meet various women’s groups and young women leaders to discuss opportunities for enhancing women’s participation in politics and leadership. Ms. Regner also applauded the contributions made to peace building, justice, and conflict resolution by members of the Fish Market Women’s Peace Hut, who shared their experience of how they are contributing.to strengthening social cohesion and supporting women's access to justice.

UN Women is the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. A global champion for women and girls, UN Women was established to accelerate progress on meeting their needs worldwide.

Title: Assistant Secretary General and UN Women Deputy Executive Director to visit Liberia
Content: 23 June 2022
Monrovia, 22 June 2022 - The Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations and Deputy Executive Director of UN Women, Asa Regner, is set to visit Liberia on her first official visit to the country from 26 to 29 June 2022.
The visit is aimed at strengthening and re-affirming UN Women’s support to the advancement of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls in Liberia. Ms. Regner will be accompanied by the UN Women Regional Director for West and Central Africa, Ms. Oulimata Sarr.
During her visit, Ms. Regner is expected to meet various stakeholders including the President of the Republic of Liberia, Dr. George Manneh Weah; Vice President, Chief Dr. Jewel Howard Taylor; several Government Ministers, development partners and the UN Country Team in Liberia.
The Deputy Executive Director will also meet various women’s groups and young women leaders, among others to discuss opportunities for enhancing women’s participation in politics and leadership positions. Ms. Regner’s visit comes at a time when the country is preparing for the 2023 elections and women are grossly underrepresented in politics and decision-making positions.
Another highlight of the mission is the visit to the vocational and heritage centre in Todee, Montserrado County that was constructed by UN Women under the European Union, United Nations and Government of Liberia Spotlight Initiative.  The centre will serve as a dedicated learning centre for traditional practitioners and young women and girls to learn new skills to enable them to get an alternative source of income to replace female genital mutilation (FGM).
Ms. Regner will get the opportunity to meet and interact with traditional practitioners who formerly practiced FGM but are now beneficiaries of the alternative economic livelihood program, and see first-hand integrated approaches being used to prevent violence against women and girls and the women’s economic empowerment initiatives being implemented.
She will also visit the Fish market women’s Peace Hut, a centre for conflict prevention, resolution and peace building.
At the end of the visit, Ms. Regner will hold a press briefing with media practitioners in Liberia.
UN Women is the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. A global champion for women and girls, UN Women was established to accelerate progress on meeting their needs worldwide. The entity works to position gender equality as fundamental to the Sustainable Development Goals, and a more inclusive world.

Title: Joint Statement by International Partners on the Electoral Process in Liberia
Content: 14 June 2022
The International Community in Liberia commends the people and Government of Liberia for the orderly and mainly peaceful manner in which the country has conducted recent elections, a concrete manifestation of its commitment to democracy, peace and stability. We further wish to commend the professional way the process was managed by the National Elections Commission.
The International Community in Liberia commends political parties, their supporters and other stakeholders for exercising patience and remaining calm as they awaited judicial review of the Lofa situation. We encourage outstanding grievances to be similarly addressed through established legal frameworks in a peaceful and transparent manner.
Liberia has a positive track record of mainly peaceful elections. We therefore urge all parties to reject the use of violence and avoid making statements that could further increase tensions in the upcoming Lofa County senatorial by-election. We underscore the need to ensure accountability for any violations that may occur during the electoral period.
The International Community in Liberia voices grave concern about worrying possible misuse of youth for partisan politics. This has the potential to escalate into violence. It is imperative therefore that the youth play a peaceful and constructive role in the electoral process and not feed a climate of fear.
The International Community in Liberia reaffirms the importance of women’s participation in elections, where there is a proud tradition in Liberia. We take note of the Liberian Government’s Page 2 of 2 2 stated commitment to increase women’s political participation through an enforceable 30 percent gender quota and call on the Government and all political parties to make good on this commitment.
In this regard, we stress the need for timely passage of the amended New Elections Law (1986) to ensure near equal representation of men and women in the legislature. We are encouraged by the positive steps undertaken by the Liberty Party, the Alternative National Congress, and most recently, the Congress for Democratic Change, to instigate electoral gender quotas and we would keenly urge others to also enforce the implementation of quotas.
The International Community in Liberia reaffirms its support to the people and Government of Liberia in their endeavours for a peaceful and prosperous country.

Title: UN Women Partners with LBS to Conduct Community Dialogues on Women’s Land Rights and Gender Roles
Content: 24 September 2021
Monrovia – 23 September, 2021 - UN Women is partnering with the Liberia Broadcasting System to conduct community dialogues on; the rights of women to land and, gender roles and masculinities in eight Counties in Liberia namely, Grand Cape Mount, Sinoe, Maryland, Nimba, Margibi, Grand Bassa, Bong, and Lofa.
The first community dialogue will be held in Grand Cape Mount on Saturday, 25 September 2021. Representatives of women’s groups, women peace huts, multi-stakeholder platforms, youth groups, and land committees are expected to participate in the community dialogue which will also be aired on community radio stations.
“The community dialogues are aimed at raising awareness on women’s land rights and influencing change in the dominant traditional cultural perceptions and the narrative that land-related matters and peacebuilding are a masculine domain,” says Jennifer Mbithi, UN Women Gender and Land Management Specialist. “The community dialogues are also aimed at correcting misconceptions and stereotypes on gender roles and encourage women’s active participation in decision-making processes,” she says.
The Land Rights Act which ascended into law on September 19, 2018, states that every Liberian citizen including men, women, and youth, has the right to own land regardless of identity, custom, ethnicity, tribe, language, gender or otherwise.
Women’s land rights are human rights, and therefore must be protected and respected. The Land Rights Act provides for equal rights specifically for women to access, use and own land and that land governance is inclusive and supports women’s leadership and participation in decision-making processes on land matters.
Women rights to land have been violated in the past through denial or simple marginalization. Predominantly, the Liberian Land tenure system is strongly rooted in traditional and cultural practices and customs that exclude women and marginalized groups from land ownership and constrain their participation in decision-making forums at community, local and national levels. The community dialogues are therefore meant to remedy this by helping women understand their rights to land and subsequently ensuring that they exercise these rights, explains Ms. Mbithi.
A perceptions study conducted by UN Women Liberia in 43 communities in Grand Cape Mount, Sinoe, Maryland, and Nimba counties, to assess the understanding of communities and individuals on gender, human rights and land rights issues, revealed deep-seated gender inequalities on roles as well as access to and control over resources and decision making, at the household and community levels. The study was conducted under the Peace Building Funded project ‘Sustaining Peace and Reconciliation through Strengthening Land Governance and Dispute Resolution Mechanisms, includes a Perceptions survey and, a Gender and Power Analysis and reveals the persistence of traditionally held cultural norms around the role of men and women in Liberian society as well as their rights.
At the household level, women’s roles are largely relegated to that of a homemaker, and they are subservient to male heads of households as related to decision making. On land matters, the study revealed that Liberia has made significant strides in terms of its legal and policy framework towards ensuring gender equality and the protection of women rights including around land matters. Liberia’s Land Rights Framework is found to be gender-responsive, however, on the ground, more work needs to be done on education and implementation of existing laws. Specific recommendations were also made for continuous long-term grass-roots awareness-raising activities around land rights and gender equality. The community dialogues are therefore intended to address this.
UN Women is the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. UN Women is supporting the Liberia Broadcasting system to conduct community dialogues with funding support from the Norwegian and Swedish Embassies as well as the Peacebuilding Fund and Multi-Partner Trust Fund.

Title: UN Women Supports MGCSP to Host Mock Parliament Sessions in Five Counties in Liberia
Content: 11 August 2021
Monrovia, 11 August 2021 - Stakeholders drawn from 15 Counties in Liberia are expected to take part in mock Parliament sessions to be held throughout the month of August starting from Thursday, 12 August and ending on 27 August 2021.
The Mock Parliament sessions will be held in Grand Bassa (12 and 13 August 2021), Grand Gedeh (16 and 17 August), Nimba (18 and 19 August), Margibi (20 and 21 August) and Bomi (26 and 27 August) respectively. Participants will comprise of County leaders, academics, Parliamentarians, political party leaders, representatives of Civil Society Organisations and members of the judiciary, among others.
The mock Parliament sessions are aimed at promoting and strengthening collaboration mechanisms and advocating for an increase in women’s political participation through inclusion of the enforceable 30 percent gender quota provision in the Liberia election law. The provision will make it mandatory for political parties to adhere to the 30 percent quota for women.
In addition, the mock sessions provide an opportunity for people at the grassroots level including, women and youths as well as community leaders to have insights on the need and benefits of having more women in decision making positions and on how bills are debated in Parliament.
“We hope that, by bringing the parliament to the people, communities are provided with a platform to understand how their recommendations for legal reforms are translated into law by their representatives,” says Marie Goreth Nizigama, UN Women Liberia, Country Representative.
“It also gives them a chance to understand how the law makers prioritise and present their need for a critical mass of women in politics and advocate for inclusion of the enforceable 30 percent gender quota in the elections law,” says Ms. Nizigama.
In Liberia, women make up half the population, but they are grossly underrepresented in politics as evidenced by the number of seats that they occupy in the legislature. There are currently eight women in the House of Representatives out of 73 and there are two women in the Senate out of 30.
However, in an effort to increase the number of women in politics and decision making positions, Liberia has committed to take action to increase women’s political participation and representation by signing and ratifying a number of international and regional human rights instruments including the UN Convention on the Elimination of All forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW), the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights (ACHPR), the protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights of women in Africa (ACHPR-PW), the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG), the ECOWAS protocol on democracy and good governance (PDGG), among other protocols.
Despite the commitments made, some gaps still exist- UN Women is supporting the government of Liberia to bridge these gap.
“As the Ministry responsible for the empowerment of women, we are delighted to partner with the Women’s Legislative Caucus of Liberia, WONGOSOL, National Elections Commission and women at the grassroots level to bring a spotlight on the importance of empowering women to participate in politics and leadership positions,” Gender, Children and Social Protection Minister, Honourbale Williametta Saydee-Tarr expressed.
Considering this, UN Women is providing technical and financial support to the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection and other partners, to host mock Parliament sessions that will comprise of an opening session and the Mock Parliament sessions.

Title: COVID-19 Vaccines Shipped by COVAX Arrives in Liberia
Content: 06 March 2021
Margibi, Liberia, 05 March 2021 - Liberia received 96,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses shipped via the COVAX initiative, a partnership between CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO. The arrival of the vaccines in Liberia is part of the historic step towards achieving the goal of equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally, in what will be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history. This delivery is part of a first wave of shipments that will continue to different countries in the coming days and weeks.
The arrival of the 96,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), marks the first batch of vaccine shipped to Liberia by the COVAX initiative as part of its unprecedented efforts to deliver at least 2 billion doses of the vaccine globally by the end of 2021.
Ahead of the arrival of the vaccines, Liberia received 97,000 syringes and 600 safety boxes that will be used for the administration and disposal of immunization waste. The syringes are vital as the vaccine itself and it is critical to have adequate supply of syringes in Liberia ahead of the arrival of the vaccine.
"Today we are making history in Liberia with the arrival of the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine into the country. We are proud to be part of COVAX global cooperation which demonstrates the best of humanity. Vaccines save lives and we are all confident that this important milestone will allow Liberia to get back to business and continue our efforts to build back the economy of Liberia,” Honorable Dr. Wilhelmina Jallah, Health Minister of the Republic of Liberia
“The arrival of the first vaccines represents an important moment for Liberia as it gives the people a tool to halt a global disease that has already impacted the lives and livelihoods of so many. I’m very proud of Liberia team who made this important step a reality, “Jonna Jeurlink, Senior Country Manager at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
Niels Scott, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Liberia said, “the United Nations is proud to support the Government in saving lives and ensuring an equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX, the largest and most varied portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines globally.”
Dr. Peter Clement, WHO Representative in Liberia said “the delivery of vaccines to Liberia today is a historic moment and reaffirms WHO’s commitment to ensure access to life saving vaccines for eligible people in Liberia. It also signifies the strong partnership and collaboration to control COVID-19 in Liberia and globally. Let us continue with the COVID-19 preventive measures because these vaccines will not be used for mass vaccination but selected category of people.”
"We are very proud to support the Government of Liberia in the fight against COVID-19. The arrival of vaccines in the country is an essential milestone for strengthening and protecting health workers and staff working on the pandemic's frontline. We will continue to play our role as a key delivery partner and provide the technical support to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are safely delivered for the launch of the immunization campaign,” said Laila O. Gad, UNICEF Representative in Liberia.
COVAX is co-led by GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), working in partnership with UNICEF as well as the World Bank, civil society organizations, manufacturers, and others.
The United States, Team Europe (the European Union and the European Union Member States), the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada are among the main donors to the COVAX Facility.
For several months, COVAX partners have been supporting governments and partners in readiness efforts, in preparation for this moment. This includes assisting with the development of national vaccination plans, support for cold chain infrastructure, as well as stockpiling of syringes and safety boxes for their disposal, masks, gloves and other equipment to ensure that there is enough equipment for health workers to start vaccinating priority groups as soon as possible.
In order to foster the early introduction of COVID-19 vaccine in Liberia, the country has identified its 20% priority population or target group in accordance with the guidance. The priority group includes health care workers, elderly people (60+), people with co-morbidities, refugees and other essential workers who cannot social distance due to the work they performed.

Title: Joint Statement on Election Violence in Liberia by the United Nations in Liberia, ECOWAS, the EU Delegation and the Embassies of the EU Member States (France, Germany, Ireland, and Sweden), the Embassy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern I
Content: 07 December 2020
MONROVIA (December 6, 2020) – The United Nations in Liberia, ECOWAS, the EU Delegation and the Embassies of the EU Member States (France, Germany, Ireland, and Sweden), the Embassy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the Embassy of the United States of America appreciate and share the profound values Liberians hold for peaceful and democratic processes and protection of human rights.
We have invested heavily and worked strenuously alongside Liberians from all political parties and all walks of life to promote peace, security, and democratic institutions in this country. We deplore the incidence of violence in Grand Cape Mount yesterday, including the burning of cars and looting and burning of a house, and are certain that the vast majority of Liberians would wish to disassociate themselves from such acts. In this regard, we fully support the statement this morning by President George Manneh Weah condemning the violence and calling for political partisans and their leaders to conduct themselves peacefully.
There must be a full investigation of incidences of violence, including yesterday’s, and all those found responsible must be held accountable. Law enforcement agencies must be granted sufficient resources to carry out their work, including the provision of security to political candidates and polling sites. We recall commitments stakeholders made in the Code of Conduct to ensure a peaceful and transparent electoral process. We call on all parties to renounce the use
of provocative language and dissemination of misinformation and falsehoods that only promote political tensions, divisiveness, and violence and risk the progress Liberia has continuously demonstrated since 2005. We further call on political leaders and electoral candidates to pursue any disputes through peaceful means and dialogue, in accordance with the law.
International partners are following closely Liberia’s adherence to the rule of law and its advancement of peace and democracy. We look forward to witnessing the voting process on December 8, and support Liberian civil society observation and monitoring initiatives as well. We remain confident in the strong commitment of the Liberian people to peace, stability, and development and continue dedicating our support to advance these essential goals.

Title: Government of Liberia and the Spotlight Initiative launch community engagement campaign to prevent violence against women and girls
Content: 15 May 2020
As part of its continuous efforts to eliminate violence against women and girls in Liberia, the Spotlight Initiative is supporting the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National  Council of Chiefs and Elders to launch a campaign for monitoring the implementation of the Ganta Declaration which calls for a one-year suspension of all Sande society activities; and to raise awareness among communities on measures to prevent the spread of corona virus and respond to sexual and gender based violence.
The Ganta Declaration signed on 25 June 2019 calls for a one-year suspension of Sande society and bush school activities, where young women and girls are initiated into adulthood through a series of activities including Female Genital Mutilation.
“We hope the closure of the bush schools will pave the way for the elimination of all harmful practices against women and girls in Liberia,” says Marie Goreth Nizigama, UN Women Country Representative for Liberia.
“As the custodians of culture and traditional practices, traditional leaders play an important role in ending all forms of violence against women and girls. We commend the European Union and the Government of Liberia for providing the platform to eliminate harmful practices.”
To enable traditional leaders to reach the grassroot communities, UN Women within the framework of the Spotlight Initiative is donating ten motorbikes to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National  Council of Chiefs and Elders to facilitate the monitoring of the closure of the bush schools and alternative livelihood support.
“We commend the Spotlight Initiative for the provision of motorbikes to enable the Ministry to enforce its mandate to close bush schools and to help eliminate violence against women and girls in the communities,” says Honourable Varney Sirleaf, Minister of Internal Affairs.
Additionally, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic affecting Liberia, the traditional leaders will raise awareness on the virus and its implications on sexual and gender-based violence in eight counties, including Grand Gedeh, Nimba, Lofa, Montserrado, Grand Cape Mount, Bomi, Bong and Margibi Counties.
COVID-19 conditions are putting a lot of people under strain and increasing the risk of violence against women and girls.  The Spotlight Initiative urges the Government of Liberia and civil society actors to provide a comprehensive response with interventions to prevent violence against women and girls, says Theodorus Kaspers, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation in Liberia.
The Spotlight Initiative is a global, multi-year partnership between the European Union and the United Nations. In Liberia, the Initiative seeks to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls including Female Genital Mutilation.

Notes to the Editor
Female Genital Mutilation is practiced in 11 of Liberia’s 15 counties.  Following the Ganta declaration, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National Council of Chiefs and Elders ordered the immediate closure of all bush schools.
The European Union and United Nations Spotlight Initiative, launched the ‘Alternative Economic Livelihood’ activities and the ground breaking ceremony for the construction of the vocational and heritage centre in December 2019 for traditional practitioners who operate bush schools in order to provide alternative sources of income replacing female genital mutilation.
The launch of the vocational and heritage centres present many opportunities for self-empowerment of traditional practitioners in Liberia as they are set to benefit from climate smart agriculture, business development, literacy, catering, soap making and tailoring skills among others.
Four vocational and heritage centres are set to be constructed in Nimba, Lofa, Grand Cape Mount and Montserrado counties in Liberia under the European Union and United Nations Spotlight Initiative.

Title: Inter-Religious Council of Liberia and UNICEF partner to support 600,000 people against COVID-19
Content: 13 May 2020
The Inter-Religious Council of Liberia and UNICEF rollout their plans to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Liberia throughout an awareness campaign and provision of hygiene items in eight counties, Montserrado, Margibi, Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Bomi, Grand Bassa, Nimba and Bong.


Over nine month and through utilizing well trained and equipped 510 community mobilizers and youth, the campaign will reach out to 600,000 people in the eight counties with messaging on prevention of the virus and access to basic services including education. Additionally, 12,500 people and children will be provided with hygiene kits.
“This is a worthwhile initiative, a viable partnership. Together we can spread the message against COVID-19 and limit its spread, “said Bishop Kortu K. Brown, President of the Inter-Religious Council of Liberia.
The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global challenge, affecting communities in every nation in the world including Liberia. UNICEF and partners are aware of the increased vulnerability of children, families and in particular women and girls.
“There is a need to act together to protect our children and communities from the virus. The religious community has the greatest propensity to play a pivotal role in communicating mitigating actions that will stop the spread of the virus,” said Laila O. Gad, UNICEF Representative in Liberia. “This partnership with IRCL is in line with UNICEF’s global Multi-Religious Faith-in-Action Covid-19 Initiative to raise awareness of the impacts of this pandemic on the world’s youngest citizens.”
The pandemic is a health crisis that is becoming a child rights crisis. Children are severely affected and facing a number of challenges in terms of health, education and their well-being. School closures alone constitute high levels of emotional distress and expose children to higher risks of violence and food insecurity.
Together with our partners and donors we stand united against this global challenge to promote wider community engagement including youth, to inform local responses as well as countering all forms of stigma and discrimination associated with the transmission of the disease.

Title: WFP Liberia Announces Arrival of 16 Brand New 4x4 Vehicles for its Liberia Country Operations
Content: 11 May 2020
Monrovia – The World Food Programme in Liberia has announced the arrival of a fleet of sixteen (16) brand new 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser vehicles from the WFP Fleet Center in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. The Toyota vehicles - including 7 Hard Tops, 4 Double Cabin Pickups, 2 Single Cabin Pickups, 1 Land Cruiser L200, and 2 Land Cruiser Prados - were leased in January 2020 under WFP’s Global Vehicle Leasing Programme (GVLP).
The vehicles will replace the WFP aged fleet of Toyota Land Cruisers that the Organization started disposing of in October 2018 and February 2020 in line with its assets management policy that requires the replacement of all vehicles that have reached the terminal mileage. According to the Head of WFP’s Support Services Unit, Aaron Sleh, the new vehicles will be used in various components of WFP’s operations in Liberia including the ongoing fight against COVID-19 as well as WFP’s social safety net programmes, WFP’s food assistance for assets creation, and other resilience building activities around Liberia.

Title: Futures of 370 million children in jeopardy as school closures deprive them of school meals – UNICEF and WFP
Content: 29 April 2020
As the COVID-19 crisis pushes up levels of hunger among the global poor, the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF are urging national governments to prevent devastating nutrition and health consequences for the 370 million children missing out on school meals amid school closures.
“In Liberia, as part of its COVID-19 emergency response programme, WFP in collaboration with the Ministry of Education is providing take-home dry rations to all the nearly 100,000 girls and boys for use by their entire households as a way of averting child hunger and encouraging the children to continue studying their lessons at home,” said Karla Hershey, World Food Programme Representative and Country Director in Liberia.
School meals in Liberia are especially critical for girls as a conduit for increased retention and learning, paving a pathway for alleviating poverty and reaching Zero Hunger. WFP has therefore prioritized the provision of school meals through an inclusive approach involving the Government of Liberia and key stakeholders. WFP’s school meals programme is one of the largest social safety net programmes in Liberia reaching almost 100,000 boys and girls.
“A school in Liberia is much more than a place for learning. For many children it is a safe environment where children thrive, play and enjoy a healthy growth with their peers. Now is the time to act, lifesaving services must be provided for the most vulnerable children to avoid a devastating fallout caused by COVID-19 that could affect generations,” said Laila O. Gad, UNICEF Representative in Liberia.
Alongside school meal programmes, children often benefit from health services - such as vaccinations - delivered through their schools. In Liberia, 1.5 million children are currently out of school as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, out of which a total of 270,000 school children were provided with school feeding in 12 counties through different programmes.
In response to a recent report from the United Nations Secretary-General, which highlighted the number of children missing out on school meals, WFP and UNICEF are working with governments to support children who are out of school during the crisis. In 68 countries, governments and WFP are providing children with take-home rations, vouchers or cash transfers as an alternative to school meals.
Under the partnership, WFP and UNICEF will assist governments in the coming months to ensure that when schools reopen returning children benefit from school meals and health programmes. This will also provide an incentive for parents to send their children back to school. The agencies are also working together to track children in need of school meals through an online School Meals map.
To support this work – which will initially focus on 30 low-income or fragile countries to support 10 million children – UNICEF and WFP are appealing for US$ 600 million. Their work will be closely aligned with the UNESCO-led Global Education Coalition, a global push to ensure children keep learning despite the disruptions caused by COVID-19.

Title: WFP Liberia Completes Installation of Video Conferencing System at NPHIL to Reduce Crowded Meetings
Content: 25 March 2020
WFP Representative and Country Director, Ms. Karla Hershey, said the World Food Programme is in full readiness to assist the government and people of Liberia to roll back the coronavirus attack.
Monrovia – As part of efforts to support the Government of Liberia to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Food Programme (WFP) in Liberia has completed the installation of a video conferencing system at the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL). NPHIL is the central coordination point of the Incident Management System (IMS) that is leading the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The facility will limit the number of people present in the hall for meetings, in compliance with enhancing the social distancing requirements by the government.
WFP Representative and Country Director, Ms. Karla Hershey, said the World Food Programme is in full readiness to assist the government and people of Liberia to roll back the coronavirus attack. “The World Food Programme stands by the people of Liberia and their government during this emergency. Emergency telecommunications (ETC) is instrumental in allowing for a consistent and reliable flow of information among partners to respond flexibly and concertedly to leave no one behind. This is even more critical in the context of COVID-19, where ETC contributes to complying with social distancing measures and ensuring the safety of all stakeholders involved in the response. In addition to the video conferencing system, WFP is providing quality internet services at the Liberia Institute of Biomedical Research (LIBR) in Marshall, Margibi County where COVD-19 Page 2 of 2 tests are taking place and nearing the completion of the construction of a mobile storage unit at LIBR.”
Since the outbreak of coronavirus in Liberia last week, WFP has been at the forefront of providing essential logistics, emergency telecommunications, and warehousing support to the governmentled response. In a related development, WFP is currently prepositioning over 1,700 metric tons of assorted food items in Nimba and Maryland Counties for distribution to students as take-home rations as part of the national home-grown school feeding programme should the closure of schools last longer than expected.

Title: World Bank Group Announces Up to $12 Billion Immediate Support  for COVID-19 Country Response
Content: 04 March 2020
Fast Track Financing for Developing Countries
WASHINGTON, March 3, 2020 — As COVID-19 reaches more than 60 countries, the World Bank Group is making available an initial package of up to $12 billion in immediate support to assist countries coping with the health and economic impacts of the global outbreak. This financing is designed to help member countries take effective action to respond to and, where possible, lessen the tragic impacts posed by the COVID-19 (coronavirus).
Through this new fast track package, the World Bank Group will help developing countries strengthen health systems, including better access to health services to safeguard people from the epidemic, strengthen disease surveillance, bolster public health interventions, and work with the private sector to reduce the impact on economies. The financial package, with financing drawn from across IDA, IBRD and IFC, will be globally coordinated to support country-based responses.
The COVID-19 support package will make available initial crisis resources of up to $12 billion in financing — $8 billion of which is new — on a fast track basis. This comprises up to $2.7 billion new financing from IBRD; $1.3 billion from IDA, complemented by reprioritization of $2 billion of the Bank’s existing portfolio; and $6 billion from IFC, including $2 billion from existing trade facilities. It will also include policy advice and technical assistance drawing on global expertise and country-level knowledge.
“We are working to provide a fast, flexible response based on developing country needs in dealing with the spread of COVID-19,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass. “This includes emergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance, building on the World Bank Group's existing instruments and expertise to help countries respond to the crisis."
The financial package will provide grants and low-interest loans from IDA for low income countries and loans from IBRD for middle income countries, using all of the Bank’s operational instruments with processing accelerated on a fast track basis.  International Finance Corporation, the World Bank Group’s private sector arm, will provide its clients with the necessary support to continue operating and to sustain jobs.
The World Bank support will cover a range of interventions to strengthen health services and primary health care, bolster disease monitoring and reporting, train front line health workers, encourage community engagement to maintain public trust, and improve access to treatment for the poorest patients. The Bank will also provide policy and technical advice to ensure countries can access global expertise.
IFC will work with commercial bank clients to expand trade finance and working capital lines.  IFC will also directly support its corporate clients — with a focus on strategic sectors including medical equipment and pharmaceuticals — to sustain supply chains and limit downside risks. These solutions will leverage the lessons learned from similar events in the past with a goal to minimize the negative economic and social impacts of COVID-19 globally.
Countries face different levels of risk and vulnerability to COVID-19, and will require different levels of support. The Bank Group support will prioritize the poorest countries and those at high risk with low capacity. As the spread of COVID-19 and its impact continues to evolve, the World Bank Group will adapt its approach and resources as needed.
The World Bank Group is actively engaged with international institutions and country authorities to help coordinate the global response.

Title: New Year’s Babies: Over 559 children will be born in Liberia on New Year’s Day - UNICEF
Content: 03 January 2020
In 2020, UNICEF is calling for world leaders and nations to invest in health workers with the know-how and equipment to save every newborn
MONROVIA, 1 January 2020 – An estimated 559 babies will be born in Liberia on New Year’s Day, UNICEF said today. Liberian babies will account for 0.14 per cent of the estimated 392,078 babies to be born on New Year’s Day.
“The beginning of a new year and a new decade is an opportunity to reflect on our hopes and aspirations not only for our future, but the future of those who will come after us,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “As the calendar flips each January, we are reminded of all the possibility and potential of each child embarking on her or his life’s journey—if they are just given that chance.”
Fiji in the Pacific will most likely deliver 2020’s first baby. The United States, its last. Globally, over half of these births are estimated to take place in eight countries:
Each January, UNICEF celebrates babies born on New Year’s Day, an auspicious day for childbirth around the world.
However, for millions of newborns around the world, the day of their birth is far less auspicious.
In 2018, 2.5 million newborns died in just their first month of life; about a third of them on the first day of life. Among those children, most died from preventable causes such as premature birth, complications during delivery, and infections like sepsis. In addition, more than 2.5 million babies are born dead each year.
Over the past three decades, the world has seen remarkable progress in child survival, cutting the number of children worldwide who die before their fifth birthday by more than half. But there has been slower progress for newborns. Babies dying in the first month accounted for 47 per cent of all deaths among children under five in 2018, up from 40 per cent in 1990.
UNICEF’s Every Child Alive campaign calls for immediate investment in health workers with the right training, who are equipped with the right medicines to ensure every mother and newborn is cared for by a safe pair of hands to prevent and treat complications during pregnancy, delivery and birth.
“Too many mothers and newborns are not being cared for by a trained and equipped midwife or nurse, and the results are devastating,” added Fore. “We can ensure that millions of babies survive their first day and live into this decade and beyond if every one of them is born into a safe pair of hands.”

Title: Despite significant increase in birth registration, a quarter of the world’s children remain ‘invisible’ – UNICEF
Content: 11 December 2019
Proportion of registered births increased almost 20 per cent over past decade, yet 166 million children under-five have never been officially recorded
Monrovia, 11 December 2019 – The number of children whose births are officially registered has increased significantly worldwide, yet 166 million children under-five, or 1 in 4, remain unregistered, according to a new report released by UNICEF today on its own 73rd birthday.
Birth Registration for Every Child by 2030: Are we on track? – which analyses data from 174 countries – shows that the proportion of children under-five registered globally is up around 20 per cent from 10 years ago – increasing from 63 per cent to 75 per cent.
“We have come a long way but too many children are still slipping through the cracks, uncounted and unaccounted for,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “A child not registered at birth is invisible – nonexistent in the eyes of the government or the law. Without proof of identity, children are often excluded from accessing education, health care and other vital services, vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.”
Global progress is driven largely by great strides in South Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, but recent years have seen advances in birth registration in West and Central Africa as well. Liberia, for example, increased the level of birth certification from 4 per cent to 25 per cent between 2007 and 2013.
To improve accessibility in Liberia, UNICEF supported integrated service delivery models of birth registration within health facilities and at county level through one-stop centers. As of October 2019, over 112,000 children between the ages of 0-12 have been registered all over the country, including over 32,000 children below the age of 12 month. The highest number of registrations since 2016.
“Birth registration in West and Central Africa remained stagnant for a long time, leaving millions of children without their basic right to legal identity. This situation has now changed and millions more children are registered at birth”, said Marie-Pierre Poirier, UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa. “With UNICEF’s support and under the leadership of the African Union and of national governments, countries have invested in integrating birth registration in health and immunization platforms to extend the coverage and accessibility of services and reach even the most vulnerable populations. This simple shift in service delivery is not only low cost but effective in increasing national registration rates, contributing to progress in the region as a whole.”
Despite progress, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa are lagging behind the rest of the world and some of the lowest levels of registration are found in Chad (12 per cent) or Guinea-Bissau (24 per cent).
“Governments must scale up proven solutions to improve birth registration, if they are to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target on making every child count”, stressed Marie-Pierre Poirier.
In Liberia, the birth registration is under the mandate of the Ministry of Health. “Together with UNICEF we work closely on creating an enabling environment to expand the provision of services to 26 new birth registration centers located in public and private hospitals”, said Chea Sanford Wesseh, Assistant Minister of Vital and Health Statistics in Liberia.” Meanwhile, we are revising the Public Health Law of 1976 to extend the time frame for current birth registration from 14 days to 30 days”. In 2019, Liberia reach more children than any other year in her history and has registered the highest proportion of newborns and under-five.
Barriers to registration globally include lack of knowledge on how to register a child’s birth, unaffordable fees for registering a birth or obtaining a birth certificate, and distance to the nearest registration facility. Traditional customs and practices in some communities – such as new mothers staying indoors or single mothers’ inability to register their children – may also deter or prevent formal birth registration in the permitted timeframe.
Even when children’s births are registered, possession of a birth certificate is less common, with 237 million children under-five globally – or slightly more than 1 in 3 – lacking this official proof of registration.
In Birth Registration for Every Child by 2030, UNICEF calls for five actions to protect all children:
“Every child has a right to a name, a nationality and a legal identity, so any improvement in increased registration levels is welcome news,” said Fore. “But as we have just marked the 30th anniversary of these rights – as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child – we must not stop until every child is counted.”

Title: FAO under a joint peacebuilding project with UNDP and the Government of Liberia, empowers farmers to increase agriculture production using the Village Savings and Loans scheme
Content: 09 December 2019
Increasing farmers access to credit and income generating capacity
- The United Nations Peacebuilding project, jointly implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) focusing on components within their mandate and comparative advantage, continues to reach out to the most vulnerable rural populations especially young women by providing the needed alternative livelihood opportunities.
The Multi-Partnership Trust Fund Project titled: “Strengthening Conflict Prevention through the Establishment of Multi-stakeholders Platforms and Improved Alternative Livelihoods” led by FAO, is providing increased support to nine (9) concession affected communities in Bomi (Gbar-Jakeh, Beh-sao and Moore Town) and Nimba (Sippi Town, Zolowee, Minkinto and Sayeaga).
The two agencies are jointly coordinating their efforts alongside the Government of Liberia to reach out to over 1500 direct beneficiaries in Bomi and Nimba Counties.
UNDP coordinates the aspects on establishing and capacitating multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) that incorporate opinion leaders including civil society representatives and local leaders (town chiefs, commissioners, women and youth) and (MSP) is strategically positioned between the government, concessionaires, and these communities. The MSP is “an innovative approach for peacebuilding and social cohesion. It works to ensure effective prevention and resolution of concessions land-related conflicts. These platforms have helped resolve differences amicably, preserving agreements between all parties through MoUs and consensus”.
FAO leads the component that helps provide sustainable alternative livelihood to affected communities. Through a local Implementing Partner “Universal Empowerment Mission”, FAO rolled out an intensive two-week capacity development exercise for targeted beneficiaries simultaneously in the seven (7) project communities in the two counties. The exercise aimed to equip the beneficiaries with skills and knowledge in Business Management and Marketing, and Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) for sustainable access to credit, agriculture-based income generating activities and social cohesion in group spirit. The training targeted seven (7) VSLA groups comprising 240 young women (cassava, poultry and vegetables producers) across the two project counties.
FAO provided agriculture inputs and postharvest facilities
In addition to the VSLA and Business Management and Marketing capacity enhancement support, FAO is providing support to the farming communities consisting of women farmers who make up majority of Liberia’s smallholder producers and agricultural labour force with improved rice seeds, cassava cuttings and hand tools, backed by extension services to enhance production and productivity.
Two postharvest facilities have been constructed and equipped with agro processors in the counties to enable farmers minimize postharvest losses.
Farmers embraced the ideas of FAO and government of Liberia
Emmanuel N. Zangbory, Secretary of the SLAC Farmers’ Cooperative in Nimba County, which hosts four communities, described the training as “rewarding” adding, “This is the first time for such a training to be introduced to our farmers. This is helpful, it will encourage the women to get involved in agriculture.”
He noted that since the introduction of the project in the four communities, farmers have been actively, working in groups, and agricultural activities are moving well among them. “The women here only depend on farming, this will be a great help for them,” he added.
Rev George Dale, Programme Officer, Universal Empowerment Mission, added that from the training, the women have established by-laws and constitutions that will ensure effective regulation and management of the groups activities and engender them sustainably. “We introduced to them group election, meeting procedures, business management and social fund policies and practices as well as constitutional development,” he noted. Further, he mentioned that the training also provided the opportunity for the groups to have a broader knowledge on loan disbursement and repayment to enable them to identify their income at the end of the cycle. He added that the project is a unifier as women are brought together and united under a common purpose, expressed enthusiasm in acquiring the knowledge to enhance their agriculture activities.
A clearly ecstatic Bendu Scott, Chairlady, “Think for tomorrow” VSLA group in Beh-sao, Bomi County, took the podium, and speaking on behalf of her group, requested FAO for additional support to consider expanding the training to reach out to other women.
The chairlady of the thirty (30) women’s group underscored the importance of the training, “We are so happy for your support. We appeal to FAO to provide similar support to other women who are not part of this training. This is an opportunity that is provided to help us increase our production.” She added that women from the three communities (Gbar-Jakeh, Beh-sao and Moore Town), in Bomi benefited from the training.
She noted that the VSLA introduced by FAO will improve their agriculture production, empower them economically and improve their self-reliance (dependence on their husbands).
Next Steps
Working through the Government of Liberia, FAO Liberia, UNDP, and its partners, will ensure that gains made are sustained. To this end, some capacity support has been provided to the GoL to undertake monitoring and follow-up actions through the decentralized structures of the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Bureau of Concessions.

The United Nations System in Liberia held the UN Liberia Vision 2030 retreat from the 31stOctober to 2ndNovember 2018, to develop the UN 2030 vision which will shape the next United Nations Sustainable Development Assistance Framework (UNSDAF) in Liberia, and will ensure that it “fits for purposewhile fitting in the priorities of all key stakeholders including the Government of Liberia”. The retreat was facilitated by the UNSDG-WCA.
The current United Nations Sustainable Development Assistance Framework in Liberia ends in December 2019 after two extensions to ensure alignment with the Pro- Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development. The UN has completed its end of Programme Evaluation and the Common Country Assessment. The Pro- Poor Agenda will guide the strategic areas of support for the United Nations System and Development Partners in Liberia.
The Government of Liberia, through recent years took steps that were to lead to a national context that will boost the country’s development  while speeding SDGs implementation at the same time.  The current national prevailing view is that the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, had borne considerable fruits that include establishing institutions and processes that are contributing to the consolidation of peace and security, the revitalization of the economy, the entrenchment of institutions of good governance and the rule of law, and the reconstruction of the nation’s social and physical infrastructure for the delivery of basic public goods and services. However, there is still a pressing need to integrate development policies in holistic development frameworks that include UNSDAFs, inscribed in a long-term perspective in which reconciliation and development, peace and democracy would be strengthened and mutually reinforced.
The adoption of Pro Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development by the Government of Liberia is to make this happen through a national consensus building process that will ensure successful implementation of agendas 2030 and 2063. The consensus would be encapsulated in a national vision statement designed to provide a long-term framework for decision-makers, leaders at all levels of society and development practitioners in the public, private and civil society organization sectors.
During the retreat, the UNCT understood the current national context and recognized the needs to identify the portion of the national vision that is compatible with the UN comparative advantages and translate it into a workable vision that will guide the UN support during the 5 years to come in Liberia.
A series of sessions were run to guide the UN team’s reflections and analysis to identify the anchorage points of the UN vision with the Liberia national vision. There was first a consensus about the concept of a vision defined during the retreat as an expression of the aspirations of a people or a group of persons, providing a sense of common identity, purpose, and ideals.
At the end of the retreat, the further steps of UNDAF roadmap was presented and there was a common agreement that the UN vision articulates how the results of UNSDAF are intended to contribute to the broader 15 years span of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, and the ways it is anticipated that successive UNDAF results build upon each other.

Title: Joint Statement by the United Nations and the Office of the Special Representative of the ECOWAS Commission in Liberia, on recent electoral violence in Montserrado County
Content: 19 August 2019
The United Nations (UN) and the Office of the Special Representative of the ECOWAS Commission in Liberia (ECOWAS) have observed with concern the increasing violence acts arising from the recent by-elections in Montserrado County. We deplore the violent attacks that have taken place during the Senatorial and Representative by-elections and reiterate that electoral violence in all its forms and manifestations is criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, and constitutes one of the most serious threats to peace and security of Liberia.
We condemn the violence that occurred on Saturday, 17 August in District #15, Montserrado County, between supporters of the Coalition for Democratic Change and supporters of the Opposition Collaborating Political Parties.
We commend the Government of Liberia’s swift move to defusetensions and foster dialogue between antagonists. We, therefore, urge the Ministry of Justice and the Liberia National Police to carry out a prompt and impartial investigation into the unfortunate incident so that those responsible are held accountable, regardless of their political affiliations.
We urge all Liberians in general and political parties in particular to reject violence and avoid using inflammatory language or hate speech that could further increase tensions. We appeal to Liberians to safeguard the hard-won gains made in consolidating peace and democracy and urge them to address electoral complaints in a peaceful manner and through legal means.
The United Nations (UN) and the Office of the Special Representative of the ECOWAS Commission in Liberia (ECOWAS) wish to renew our continued support to peaceful, credible and inclusive elections.

Title: Joint Statement by the UN, African Union, and the ECOWAS Commission in Liberia on the promotion of continued dialogue amongst all stakeholders for sustenance of peace and stability in Liberia
Content: 15 May 2019
The United Nations (UN), the African Union Liaison Office in Liberia (AU) and the Office of the Special Representative of the ECOWAS Commission in Liberia (ECOWAS), wish to commend the Government and people of Liberia, “the Council of Patriots”, and other Stakeholders for the inclusive dialogue held on 14 May, which coincided with ‘Unification Day’. We welcome the dialogue as an indication of the willingness of all Parties to continue to work to reach amicable and encompassing political agreements.
We wish to emphasize that any prolonged political disagreement in Liberia will undermine peace, as well as worsen the prospects for improved socio-economic development. We therefore reiterate the need for inclusive, transparent and continued dialogue on the planned 7 June protest, without denying Article 17 of the Liberian Constitution, which guarantees the right of all Liberians to lawful, peaceful and orderly assembly and association.
The United Nations (UN), the African Union Liaison Office in Liberia (AU) and the Office of the Special Representative of the ECOWAS Commission in Liberia (ECOWAS) wish to renew our continued support to this process and our firm commitment to supporting the people and Government of Liberia in all their endeavours for a peaceful, stable and prosperous country.

Title: 34th High-Level Meeting of Heads of UN Peace Mission in West Africa
Content: 10 May 2019
Bissau - At the invitation of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), Mohamed Ibn Chambas, the Heads of the United Nations Missions in West Africa held their 34th High-level Meeting on 10 May 2019 in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau.
The objective was to strengthen coordination in order to enhance synergies to address common challenges facing the West African and Sahel regions.
In attendance were the Special Representatives of the UN Secretary-General in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS), José Viegas Filho and for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), Mohamed Ibn Chambas; the United Nations Resident Coordinators for Côte d’Ivoire, Babacar Cissé, and Liberia, Yacoub El Hillo. The Director of Political Affairs for the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) Bruno Mpondo-Epo also attended.
Discussions focused on recent security incidents in the region. They expressed their condolences to the families of victims, both civilian and military, including in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, as well as in the Lake Chad Basin while strongly condemning attacks against civilians and peacekeepers. They underlined the need for a multidimensional and regional approach to address the root causes of insecurity and called for enhanced cooperation amongst all relevant actors and concerned governments.
1. The Heads and other representatives of Missions commended efforts to sustain peacebuilding gains in Côte d’Ivoire and welcomed discussions on the reform of the Independent Electoral Commission, ahead of the 2020 presidential elections. They noted the ongoing re-composition of the political class and encouraged all parties to ensure that democratic expression takes place in a healthy political atmosphere. In that regard, they welcomed national and regional initiatives to help de-escalate tensions and urged all political actors to promote peace and stability in order to achieve the aspirations of the Ivorian people. They also stressed on the need for an early engagement of the UN in supporting the Ivorian people in the upcoming presidential elections.
2. The Heads of Missions expressed concerns at the ongoing political tensions and violence in Guinea and called on all actors to exercise restraint and engage in constructive dialogue to resolve their differences ahead of upcoming legislative and presidential elections with utmost respect for democratic principles and the rule of law.
3. The Heads of Missions welcomed the outcome of peaceful, credible and transparent parliamentary elections in Guinea-Bissau on 10 March; and commended national stakeholders and the international partners for the support and collaboration provided. However, they expressed concern that post-electoral stabilization efforts are facing serious challenges owing to the re-emergence of partisan divisions surrounding the elections of the members of the Bureau of the People’s National Assembly (ANP). The Heads of Missions urged all political parties represented in the ANP to work together in a constructive manner to enable the legislative body to focus on the major post-electoral priorities. Moreover, they noted that the timely appointment of a new Prime Minister by the President of the Republic was crucial. They also urged national authorities and the National Electoral Commission (CNE) to complete the electoral cycle by organizing the presidential elections before the end of 2019, in compliance with the Constitution and the Electoral Law. The Heads of Missions encouraged partners, particularly the Group of Five (AU, CPLP, ECOWAS, EU and UN) to continue to coordinate their activities and to support and engage the Bissau-Guinean political actors in order to foster genuine dialogue, peace and development in the country.
4. The Heads of Missions took note of the briefing on the current situation in Liberia, particularly plans to protest on 7 June and the ongoing dialogue by the government, pressure groups and opposition political parties to ensure that the protests are peaceful. The meeting enjoined the people and government of
Liberia to sustain efforts to address various political, economic and governance challenges facing Liberia and reiterated the importance of the maintenance of peace and security. They commended the UN Country Team’s coordinated support to Liberia as well as the strong partnership between the UN, the AU and ECOWAS, particularly on conflict prevention and good offices. The Heads of Missions called on the international community to continue its support to Liberia to further enhance peace consolidation and sustainable development.
5. The Heads of Missions took note of the recent change of Prime minister and formation of a new Malian government. They took note of the signing of a political agreement between the Prime Minister and political parties and stressed the importance of accelerating the implementation of the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement to firmly anchor Mali on the path of stability and lasting peace. They also called on political parties and civil society organizations to continue playing a key role in the implementation of institutional reforms that are at the core of the agreement.
6. On Nigeria, the Heads of Mission welcomed the holding of generally peaceful presidential and federal legislative elections on 23 February as well as governorship and state assembly elections on 9 March. They congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari, winner of the presidential election and encouraged Nigerians to continue working towards national cohesion and unity and the consolidation of democracy in the country as well as the region. They commended UNOWAS for its good offices and support to Nigeria during the elections. The Heads of Mission deplored the attacks and the current rise in the violent activities of the Boko Haram insurgency, intercommunity violence as well as the killings in the Middle Belt and the North West. They urged the authorities to hold perpetrators of these crimes accountable.
7. The Heads of Mission congratulated the President of Senegal on his re-election, commended the Senegalese people for keeping the long tradition of peaceful elections, and called for building of broader national political consensus to consolidate Senegal’s role as one of the beacons for democracy in the region.
8. The Heads of Missions also expressed concerns at the large number of unresolved petitions filed in court by Sierra Leonean parliamentarians on constitutional and electoral matters, highlighting the volatility of the political environment and threatening national cohesion. They called on political parties to refrain from using violent and hateful speeches and to promote dialogue to resolve political differences and strengthen national cohesion.
9. The Heads of Missions commended the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for its efforts to promote peace and stability in the region, particularly in addressing the situations in Togo and Benin. They appealed to Togolese stakeholders to put the interest of their nation above all sectional and partisan interests, to exercise restraint and seek peaceful means to address grievances. While noting that local elections have been slated for 30 June 2019, the Heads of Missions underscored the need for inclusivity and transparency during this process as well as during presidential elections planned for next year.
10. Participants commended the steady progress registered in the UN transition processes in Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia, while calling for a continued focus on remaining challenges, further reinforcement of UN Country Teams and greater international support towards addressing remaining gaps, including cross-border security issues.
11. The Heads of Missions also agreed that UNOWAS should convene a meeting of Resident Coordinators in the Mano River Union countries and the Mano River Union Secretariat with a view to developing programmes to mitigate the various challenges in the Mano River Union area.
12. The Heads of Missions indicated that, although the conduct of elections in the region continues to improve, pre and post electoral periods continue to be characterized by tensions. In this regard, they called on authorities and national stakeholders to work together to ensure a level playing field and help create an environment that is conducive to the holding of peaceful, inclusive and credible elections in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Mauritania in 2019.
13. The Heads of Missions noted with concern the violence witnessed on election day in north and central Benin as well as in the post-electoral period. They called on the Beninese stakeholders to exercise restraint and encourage a consensual and peaceful solution in order to preserve peace and stability in the country.
14. The Heads of Missions welcomed the resumption of the operations of the G5 Sahel Joint Force, as recently welcomed by the Ministerial meeting on the Force held in New York on 28 March. They emphasized that a multidimensional approach, notably through the establishment of its police component, and respect for human rights are essential to the success of the Joint Force.
15. The Heads of Missions remain deeply concerned about the situation in the centre of Mali. In this regard, they advocate for a better alignment with the Sahel Support Plan which is aimed at promoting coherence, synergies and coordination in the context of the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel. This collaborative approach would increase multiplier effects to strengthening, inter alia, governance, resilience and security. They further noted the importance of ensuring that populations and communities are at the center of the efforts of Governments as well as regional and international partners. The Heads of Missions stressed the importance of a continuous resource mobilization for both security operations as well as development and humanitarian programmes in the framework of the UN Support Plan for the Sahel.
16. The Heads of Missions expressed deep concerns over the violence that has skyrocketed in the Sahel region between November 2018 and March 2019, with reports of a 31 per cent increase in incidents relative to the same period the previous year. They deplored that, in Burkina Faso alone, the United Nations registered 153 incidents in the first three months of 2019 as part of a trend of increasing violence in the northern and eastern parts of the country due to a convergence of factors, including the inadequate capacity of the defence and security forces to operate effectively throughout the country, the growing mistrust of the local population towards defence and security forces, and the porosity of the borders
17. While commending the Multinational Joint Task Force, the G5 Sahel Force and Security and Defence Forces of conflict-affected countries, the Heads of Missions expressed grave concerns over a cycle of ethnic violence and revenge targeting of civilians by both state and non-state actors in Burkina Faso and Mali; the continuing deterioration in the security situation in the Lake Chad Basin countries; bandit and militia attacks and herder-farmer clashes across Nigeria; and the corresponding challenging humanitarian situation across the region. The Heads of Missions stressed the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges posed by terrorist organizations other violent non-state actors by focusing on security, respect for human rights and the rule of law, governance and development, while encouraging authorities to continue to domesticate the Regional Strategy for the Stabilization, Recovery and resilience of Boko Haram-affected areas of the lake Chad Basin.
18. The Heads of Missions recognized efforts by national, regional and international partners in the fight against transnational organized crime and trafficking in the region, acknowledging that the scourge of these practices continues to aggravate insecurity and threaten the stability of the region through funding of terrorist organizations and other violent groups. The Heads of Missions reiterated the threats posed by the continued presence of perpetrators of transnational organized crime, drug traffickers, terrorist organizations and other violent groups in the region and the urgency of the efforts by the United Nations and other international partners in support of national authorities.
19. The meeting welcomed regional initiatives aimed at addressing persistent challenges to governance, security, humanitarian needs, and human rights, including sexual and gender-based violence, in West Africa and the Sahel. Heads of Missions urge governments and relevant stakeholders to continue improving the legislative and institutional framework for the respect of fundamental human rights which are key to democratic consolidation. The meeting also recognized efforts to promote gender equality in the region but called for significant progress especially, with regards to women’s participation in political and peacebuilding processes at all levels.
20. The Heads of Missions exchanged on best practices and lessons learnt on transitions.
21. The Heads of Missions agreed to continue to cooperate and to strengthen information-sharing between their missions on key issues affecting the region.
22. Participants expressed their gratitude to SRSG Jose Viegas Filho for hosting the meeting and agreed that the venue of the next meeting will be announced following consultations.

Title: Legislature Engagement for Scaling Up Nutrition
Content: 02 May 2019
Monrovia – The Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement in Liberia and the United Nations Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger and Under-nutrition (or UN REACH) will tomorrow, Friday, hold a one-day nutrition awareness meeting with members of the House of Representatives of the 54th National Legislature. The gathering will be held under the theme “Legislature Engagement for Scaling Up Nutrition“.
The SUN Movement in Liberia and UN REACH continue to engage nutrition stakeholders from various sectors of society including government line ministries, civil society organizations, donors, INGOs and parliamentarians. The SUN Movement and REACH first parliamentarian meeting was held with House Speaker Hon. Dr. Bonfal Chambers on 16 April 2019 in Monrovia. During the meeting, Speaker Chambers was briefed about the numerous challenges malnutrition poses as well as some constraints being encountered by the nutrition actors in tackling the issues. For example, the Liberia 2018 Comprehensive Food Security and Nutrition Survey (CFSNS) indicated that “Malnutrition in children less than 5 years of age remains a concern with 35.5% stunted (short for age), 15% underweight (thin for age) and 3.7% overweight (above weight considered normal)“.
In response, Speaker Chambers expressed gratitude to the SUN and REACH team - as well as UN agencies working for nutrition including the the World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF, WHO, and FAO among others - for the discussion and pledged the willing of the House of Representatives to collaborate with all stakeholders on nutrition-related concerns.
The meeting then agreed on the holding of a one-day engagement and awareness-raising session with members of the House of Representatives to place them in a better position to make informed decisions that can help promote SUN and REACH activities, end malnutrition, and eradicate stunting, leading to a healthier and happier population positively contributing to Liberia’s development agenda. Page 2 of 2
The one-day legislative engagement will primarily focus on creating awareness on nutrition, presenting and discussing the nutrition-enabling environment, and identifying Nutrition Champion to support Scaling Up Nutrition activities.
Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) is a multi-stakeholder movement to reduce hunger and under-nutrition and contribute to the realization of all the SDGs. As a SUN member country, Liberia is committed to reducing malnutrition through multi-sectoral strategies that address the immediate and underlying causes of malnutrition.
REACH bring together WFP, FAO, WHO, UNICEF, and IFAD and Resident Coordinator Office, aiming to improving multi-sectoral nutrition governance. Funded by Irish Aid, REACH is a country-led approach, addressing child undernutrition through the partnership and coordinated actions of UN agencies, civil society, donors, and the private sector, under the leadership of national governments.

Title: Germany contributes over 500,000 euros towards the UN Liberia’s work in peace and development
Content: 29 April 2019
Monrovia, Liberia - The Federal Foreign Office of the Federal Republic of Germany has signed a new agreement to support the Strengthened United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator’s Office (RCO) in Liberia.
The new agreement comes with a contribution of over 500,000 euros which will support the RCO’s work towards sustaining peace gains in Liberia.
The agreement was signed by Mr. Günter Plambeck, the Chargé d’Affaires, Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Liberia and Mr. Pa Lamin Beyai, the UN Resident Coordinator a.i at the One UN House located in the capital, Monrovia.
Speaking after the signing, Mr. Plambeck said that the support to strengthen the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office was part of the Government of Germany’s efforts to maintain peace in the world as a member of the UN Security Council.
“As a current member of the UN Security Council, we are interested in maintaining peace between countries and within countries. In Liberia, we have a case of maintaining peace within the country after many years of civil strife. It is still a fragile country and bolstering the peace process must continue for some years to come,” he said.
The contribution for the Federal Republic of Germany will enable the UN RCO to continue its work in supporting Liberia’s efforts to consolidate its peace gains through preventative interventions, provide political support in sustaining peace and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) among others.
“We thank the Government of Germany for its generous support to strengthen the UN particularly the Resident Coordinator’s Office in Liberia. We believe that these funds will support the continuation of our work in bolstering peace in the country,” Mr. Beyai said.
In addition, the funds will be key for ensuring that the Political, Peace and Development Unit functions of the RCO can continue their work in providing political analysis, supporting dialogue and using the RCO’s good offices to sustain peace by addressing emerging challenges.

Title: Joint Statement by the UN, African Union, and the ECOWAS Commission in Liberia on recent inciteful messages in the media
Content: 21 February 2019
The United Nations (UN), the African Union Liaison Office in Liberia (AU) and the Office of the Special Representative of the ECOWAS Commission in Liberia (ECOWAS) note with grave concern the use of inciteful messages in the media, particularly in the social media, which has become intensified in recent weeks and days.
Liberia has taken great strides in building peace and stability. It is encouraging that the Kamara Abdullah Kamara Act of Press Freedom was recently passed by the Legislature, ensuring that all Liberians are entitled to all the protection that this new law extends. It is important that all Liberians respect all the laws and exercise their rights freely, but always in a manner that carries responsibility towards other people and towards the nation. The United Nations (UN), the African Union Liaison Office in Liberia (AU) and the Office of the Special Representative of the ECOWAS Commission in Liberia (ECOWAS), believe that this is a time that all Liberians need to come together to ensure that the hard won peace is sustained and a greater focus on the development of Liberia should be paramount, rather than media messages that distract and promote violence.
The United Nations (UN), the African Union Liaison Office in Liberia (AU) and the Office of the Special Representative of the ECOWAS Commission in Liberia (ECOWAS) condemn all such media messages that threaten peace and stability of Liberia and call on all to take immediate steps to refrain from acts and utterances that are inimical to peace and stability in Liberia. We shall continue to closely follow the media as well as the political climate, and remain committed to supporting the people and government of Liberia in all their endeavours for a peaceful country.

Title: Liberia: New Country Partnership Framework to Boost Sustainable Economic Growth and Development
Content: 27 November 2018
The World Bank Group (WBG) Board of Executive Directors on Wednesday, November 27, approved a six-year Country Partnership Framework (CPF) to support Liberia’s effort to achieve sustainable, resilient pro-poor economic growth and development. The CPF responds to the country’s strategic priorities in its Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development strategy and incorporates views from a wide range of stakeholders following consultations held across the country.
Liberia has made significant achievements after the restoration of peace and stability 15 years ago. The medium-term growth prospects remain positive, although substantial downside risks remain. GDP growth is projected to recover at an annual average rate of 3.8% over the period 2018-2020. The recovery is expected to be largely driven by agriculture, manufacturing and services sectors, as the economy begins to reap the benefits of improved access to roads and cheaper sources of electricity. Inflation is projected to decline from 11.5% in 2018 to 9.5% by 2020. Additionally, in line with projected improvements in the economy, poverty is expected to fall from 50.5% in 2018 to 48.6% in 2020.
The CPF focuses on human development and intangible capital, while keeping the balance with investments in infrastructure to consolidate successes of the previous Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and reinforce the impact of the WBG program aimed at building human capital and boosting private sector development. Specifically, the CPF will place emphasis on strengthening institutions and creating the enabling environment for inclusive and sustainable growth through transparency and accountability in the public sector, support for commercial agriculture, and the development of micro, small and medium enterprises. The CPF will support infrastructure investments to foster more equitable nationwide development to improve access to basic services.
“This CPF is designed to have a balanced approach to support the country to build human capital, to strengthen public institutions and governance, and to consolidate progress in filling the significant infrastructure gaps. We are encouraged to see a strong commitment of the government to the Human Capital agenda and advancements towards a digital economy in Liberia,” said Henry Kerali, World Bank Country Director for Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
In building human capital to seize new economic opportunities, the CPF will improve access to quality education, create income opportunities for youth and women, and improve maternal and child health.
“The CPF aims to support the most vulnerable in the society. We will invest, more and better, in health and education to give young Liberians and women a better chance to shape their own future,” said Larisa Leshchenko, World Bank Country Manager for Liberia.
The role of the private sector in financing development is critical. The CPF will therefore seek close collaboration between the International Development Association (IDA), International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and harness the role of the private sector in financing development in Liberia.
“The private sector is critical in accelerating economic growth and development. The IFC will work along with the Liberian Government to develop good policies and vibrant institutions to attract investments for the resuscitation of the economy,” said Adamou Labara, IFC Country Manager for Liberia.
The CPF emphasizes the importance of shifting the focus of the WBG program from being infrastructure intensive towards a more balanced approach with greater attention on education, agriculture, economic empowerment of women and youth, and maternal and child health.
The CPF builds on the lessons from the CPS for FY13-FY17, although well designed and relevant, its implementation was disrupted by the Ebola crisis, thereby adversely affecting both the delivery of the lending program and portfolio performance. Despite the changes made to the WBG program to respond to the Ebola epidemic, most of the original outcome targeted by the CPS were achieved.

Title: Africa Can Tackle Its “Severe Learning Crisis,” Needs to Focus on Access and Quality, Says World Bank
Content: 05 March 2018
Africa faces a “severe learning crisis” that undermines economic growth and the well-being of its citizens, according to a new World Bank study. The region has made considerable progress in boosting primary and lower secondary school enrollment, but some 50 million children remain out of school, and most of those who attend school are not acquiring the basic skills necessary for success later in life.
Facing Forward: Schooling for Learning in Africa argues that learning levels across the region are alarmingly low. Among second grade students assessed on numeracy tests in several Sub-Saharan African countries, three-quarters could not count beyond 80 and 40 percent could not do a one-digit addition problem. In reading, between 50 and 80 percent of children in second grade could not answer a single question based on a short passage they had read, and a large proportion could not read even a single word.
Progress in the region has been mixed and some countries, including South Africa and Zimbabwe, have universalized access to basic education (primary and lower secondary). Other countries, including Central African Republic, Liberia and Chad, which have been affected by conflict and political turmoil, are lagging behind even in primary school access. In most countries, however, despite rapid advances, richer children, urban children and boys have the highest access to lower secondary education.
“Providing a high-quality basic education for children across the region is an economic necessity, as well as a moral imperative,” said Jaime Saavedra, the World Bank’s Senior Director for Education. “This report provides a sobering look at Africa’s learning crisis and the region’s potential to solve it. Young Africans can transform the region and create lasting economic change, but they need to be equipped with the skills and human capital to do so.”
The study lays out concrete steps in four priority areas: providing universal basic education with a focus on equitable access, quality and retention; ensuring effective management and support of teachers; increasing financing for quality education; and boosting institutional capacity.
Specifically, the report urges countries to focus on student progression and the “traffic jam” in early grades, where children are stuck for many years with little learning, and are often taught in a language they don’t fully understand. Ensuring regular student attendance, reducing repetition and class size, and implementing a language of instruction policy are factors critical to ensuring foundational learning. The study also calls for the elimination of the high-stakes examinations between primary and lower secondary school to ensure student progression.
The study highlights the need for better teacher support, particularly around issues of recruitment, preparation, deployment, supervision, and support at the school level. Policies need to address high rates of absenteeism and lack of teacher knowledge and skill, with a focus on better and more effective teacher preparation programs, on-the-job support, and incentives.
According to the study, in 2014, African governments spent an estimated US$204 per student for primary education—less than half of the amount spent in South Asia, the region with the next lowest level of spending. But the authors caution that more spending needs to be complemented by smarter and more strategic spending on learning materials, infrastructure, and teacher training.
“Countries in Africa can address this learning crisis while also improving access and completion,” said Sajitha Bashir, World Bank Education Manager and co-author of the report along with Marlaine Lockheed, Elizabeth Ninan, and Jee-Peng Tan. “Our research draws on lessons from the region and for the region about what works. Countries need to design policies that fit their local context and educational needs, while building their capacity to implement dynamic programs that are open to improvement and feedback.”
The study complements the World Bank’s recent World Development Report 2018: Learning to Realize Education’s Promise, which was released in September 2017 and argued that without learning, education will fail to deliver on its promise to eliminate extreme poverty and create shared opportunity and prosperity for all.
