Title: PRINCIPALITY OF MONACO HELPS WFP PROVIDE HOME GROWN SCHOOL FEEDING IN LESOTHO
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
28 February 2024
MASERU – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has welcomed a €600,000 contribution from the Principality of Monaco for the period of 2023-2026, to help provide meals to school children and training for smallholder farmers as part of the national home-grown school feeding activities in the Kingdom of Lesotho.
Monaco’s contribution will help strengthen food and nutrition support to some 10,000 school children in 80 schools and provide agricultural and financial literacy training for 300 smallholder farmers in Quthing and Mohale’s hoek districts.
Under the national home-grown school feeding programme, WFP sources local produce from smallholder farmers to provide children nutritious mid-day meals on every school day. The programme links local farmers to the education sector by facilitating their access to the school feeding market. “We are grateful to the Principality of Monaco for this timely support at a critical time in the country,” says Aurore Rusiga, WFP’s Country Director in Lesotho.
“The school feeding programme is a game changer. Its benefits are evident and manifold in the communities we work. The schools provide local farmers with a predictable outlet for their products, leading to a stable income, more investments and higher production. The children enjoy nutritious, diversified food, making it more likely that they will stay in school, be healthier, perform better thus improve their future prospects.”
Through this initiative which is implemented in partnership with both the Ministry of Education and Training and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition, school children will have the opportunity to enhance their nutrition through provision of beans, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. “The Government of the Principality of Monaco is deeply convinced that school feeding programs, one of the Monegasque Cooperation’s flagship programmes, have direct and multiple benefits to the child – in terms of health, nutrition, access to education and learning”, says Bénédicte SCHUTZ, Special Representative for International Cooperation. “We are very pleased to work alongside WFP through this new partnership in Lesotho, with a mutual vision to help the most vulnerable in the fight against hunger and accessing their right to food.”
WFP’s School Feeding programme supports the Ministry of Education’s development plan, which aims to educate all children, especially those from vulnerable families. Over the past decade, school feeding has helped ensure access to quality education by reduce the rate of dropping out as well as improve child nutrition and increase child enrolment in schools. In 2023, WFP and its partners provided nutritious meals to over 50,000 pre-school learners between the ages of 2 and 5 in 2,500 schools while more than 100 farmers sold their produce to schools.

Title: Human Rights Day Statement by the UN Resident Coordinator
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
10 December 2022
The 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence is an annual international campaign that kicks off on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and runs until 10 December, Human Rights Day.
The end of the 16 days of activism against gender based violence is a hard phenomenon to celebrate or commemorate. This is because of the need to advocate for an end to gender based violence is work we should do all year. This time coincides always with an important time when the world celebrates and commemorates Human Rights Day.
This year’s Human Rights Day theme is celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) under the slogan “Dignity, Freedom and Justice for All”. In his message, Volker Türk the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has this year underlined that “On this Human Rights Day, we reiterate the need and relevance of human rights now as they were seventy-six years ago. Our hope is to increase knowledge of the UDHR as a foundational blueprint for taking concrete actions to stand up for human rights and tackle pressing global issues today”.
To ensure that the ideals enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights become reality for Basotho, there is a role for everyone to play in ensuring respect, promotion and protection of human rights for all. The passing of The Persons with Disability Equity Act by the government of Lesotho has signified the commitment to ensure and safeguard the rights of people with disability in Lesotho. This Act now needs to be fully implemented to truly ensure that all Basotho with disabilities enjoy the full protection of and provision of their rights. Human rights start at the family level permeating to communities, schools, the workplace and to parliament. Indeed, as one of the lead drafters of the Universal Declaration Eleanor Roosevelt said in 1958:
“Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home—so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he/she lives in; the school or college he/she attends; the factory, farm, or office where he/she works. Such are the places where every man, woman, and child seek equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere.”
The UN commits to continue working with the Government of Lesotho towards strengthening a national human rights legislative, policy and institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights. One of the institutions that will strengthen the national protection framework for human rights is the Human Rights Commission whose establishment is still awaited.
This year’s activities on the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence across the country have indicated a need for more engagement, more platforms and more importantly a need for a better coordinated and systematic approach to ending gender based violence in Lesotho. Throughout the several activities in commemoration of 16 Days of Activism, numerous stories were told of women and girls that have survived gender based violence and remembered with sadness those that have died and whose stories we can only tell. We heard from a sixteen-year-old girl who as a result of being raped by her father is now a young mother to her own sister. Of the many dreams she has, she shared how she would like to go back to school and be able to raise her child.
Gender based violence does not only affect individuals through the violence in their bodies, but it also affects children born of such incidences, children that live through these circumstances, affects productivity and production thus the economy. It has a bearing on our health systems, affects development and truly impacts all aspects of our lives. The UN joins the people of Lesotho to advocate against gender based violence for 365 days.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is as relevant today as it was when it was adopted 75 years ago. It has withstood the tests of the passing years, and the advent of dramatic new technologies and social, political and economic developments that its drafters could not have foreseen. For instance, its provisions are so fundamental that they can be applied to every new dilemma including new phenomena like artificial intelligence, the digital world and countering the effects of climate change on people.
Everyone is entitled to all the freedoms listed in the Universal Declaration "without distinction of any kind such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."
Gender is a concept that is addressed in almost every clause of the Declaration. For its time, the document was remarkably lacking in sexist language. The document refers to "everyone," "all" or "no one" throughout its 30 Articles. Indeed, for the first time in the history of international law-making, women played a prominent role in drafting the Universal Declaration.
But, 75 years after its adoption, the work the Universal Declaration lays down for us to do is far from over, and it never will be. It is the duty of everyone to ensure that the provisions of the Universal Declaration and all the international and regional treaties to which Lesotho is party are turned into a reality for the people of Lesotho especially the most marginalised.

Title: Lesotho: European Union continues to support those facing food insecurity through the World Food Programme
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
29 November 2021
MASERU – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has welcomed the European Union (EU) contribution of € 1 million (equivalent to LSL 17 million) that will help meet the needs of 14,760 people through cash transfers for a period of six months. This follows a contribution of € 2.8 million in 2020.
The funding, provided by the EU’s Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) will be used to reach families worst affected by the impacts of rising climate shocks, food prices and the prolonged effects of COVID-19 in the capital Maseru and Qacha’s Nek districts; including families badly affected by recent windstorms in Sehlaba-Thebe, Qacha`s Nek. Each household will receive the equivalent of € 54 in cash, per month, allowing them to buy food items from local markets.
“The EU continues to support partners such as WFP in order to provide life-saving food assistance to the most vulnerable people suffering the effects of climate shocks and the COVID-19 pandemic” said Ms. Paola Amadei, EU Ambassador to Lesotho. “We are aware that people in urban and peri-urban areas who lost their jobs or businesses have been hit hard by climate shocks, and we want to contribute to alleviating their suffering as a consequence of the pandemic."
The support from the EU comes at a crucial time, when hunger is peaking with over 470,000 of the population experiencing acute levels of food insecurity through March 2022. Food prices have increased, and households are still feeling the long-term impacts of COVID-19 control measures on their livelihoods such as loss of jobs and severe reduction in remittances, with many migrant workers returning to Lesotho after losing their jobs.
“We thank the European Union for continuing their support, allowing WFP and the government to provide much-needed assistance to vulnerable people affected by COVID-19 and climate shocks”, said Ms. Aurore Rusiga, WFP Country Director and Representative in Lesotho. “This timely contribution will help WFP save lives by supporting those who are most at risk and change lives by improving the food security and nutrition of targeted people.”
WFP will undertake Social Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) initiatives during cash distributions to provide information on basic hygiene for the prevention of COVID-19, as well as information on nutritional practices to enhance purchasing choices for households to meet their nutritional needs.
The European Union is one of WFP’s main donors in Lesotho. The latest contribution brings the total contributions to € 7 million in the last five years.

Title: Germany provides support to vulnerable people in Lesotho
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
04 November 2021
Maseru – The Government of Germany, through the German Federal Foreign Office, has contributed EUR 1.5 million for the years 2021-2023 to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Lesotho to support highly vulnerable people struggling to meet their basic food needs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This is part of a EUR 18 million contribution by Germany to Southern Africa for 2021-2023.
This contribution will improve access to food and ensure that vulnerable people, including women, have access to an adequate and nutritious diet in times of need, particularly during the lean season, more commonly referred to as the period between planting and harvesting. The assistance to the identified people will be through monthly cash transfers via mobile money and commodity voucher assistance.
“Germany hopes that this funding will contribute to mitigating the suffering of vulnerable people at a time when more of them are in need of humanitarian assistance,” said Andreas Pesche, German Ambassador to South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini, based in Pretoria. “We commend WFP for its continuous efforts to improve the lives of vulnerable people in the southern Africa region.”
According to the 2021 Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, about 312,000 people of the total rural population in Lesotho are food insecure and the Lesotho vulnerability Assessment report estimated that a total of 158,000 urban population in Lesotho is food insecure. In total, about 470,00 people are food insecure and require humanitarian assistance to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition.
“WFP welcomes this timely and generous contribution from the people of Germany to enable us to respond to the most urgent humanitarian needs across the country, especially during the difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted already vulnerable groups in Lesotho, driving them into increased food insecurity,” said Lesotho WFP Country Director and Representative, Aurora Rusiga. “This contribution from Germany will go a long way in assisting vulnerable people who are finding it increasingly difficult to put food on the table and in dire need of support.”
WFP aims to assist 122,000 food insecure people through emergency response assistance until the end of the lean season in March 2022 with monthly cash transfers via mobile money and commodity vouchers. Beneficiaries receive USD 47 per month to help meet their basic food needs. Presently, the available funding will allow WFP to assist a total of 44,000 food insecure people.

Title: “Reimagine, Rebalance, Restart: Recovering together”, celebrating the UN’s 76th Anniversary in Lesotho
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
22 October 2021
Maseru, 22 October 2021. The COVID19 pandemic as a shared global crisis, has affected economies, health systems, education and so much more of life as we knew it. Since the record of the first case in Lesotho in May 2020, the UN stayed and delivered through various COVID19 response and recovery interventions in support of the Government of Lesotho.
The UN supported the capacity building of health personnel on COVID-19 prevention and care in health facilities across the country, more recently, with all the 206 health facility staff being capacitated on COVID19 vaccine administration. The UN further supported government in the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility, with the country having now administered at least 383 341 doses (about 11% of the population), exceeding the target set by WHO that by the end of September 2021, every country and territory should have vaccinated 10% of its population.
Women were also supported with maternal health services, an effort for the continuity of health essential health services. Over 800 000 people and 500 000 school learners benefited from improved access to water and sanitation, which is key in the protection against COVID19 through the provision of handwashing facilities throughout the country.
The UN day was commemorated through a UN Fair under the theme: “Recovering together” an opportune moment for the UN, on its 76th Anniversary, to reflect and celebrate joint achievements and impact of the various COVID19 response programmes across all the UN agencies in Lesotho.
“I have come here today to salute the United Nations and the people of Lesotho for the progress in transforming this great Kingdom into a prosperous, peaceful and stable nation. We are all aware that we still have a long way to the optimum ‘Lesotho We want’,” remarked the UN Resident Coordinator a.i, Betty Wabunoha at the opening ceremony.
She highlighted the importance of working together in finding ways to collectively find solutions to complex challenges that face the country including COVID19.
Further, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hon Matshepo Ramakoae, reiterated the importance of  “building back better” from the pandemic which has affected millions of people, however, commending the UN in continuing to work with the government in the fight against it, and in its effort in assisting the country to accelerate the implementation of Agenda 2030, or the Sustainable Development Goals.
Beyond the COVID19 response, the UN continues to support the government in the promotion of good governance, rule of law and human rights, gender responsive social protection systems, sustainable economic growth, food security and decent jobs, and sustainable natural resource use.

Title: Lesotho Convenes UNCTAD15 Side Panel Event On Bridging The Divide Between Formal & Informal Cross-Border Traders
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
07 October 2021
7 October Maseru, Lesotho- The 15th session of the UNCTAD quadrennial ministerial conference (UNCTAD15) has been held virtually between Barbados and Geneva from 3 to 7 October 2021.
The UNCTAD 15 conference will establish the organisation’s work priorities for the next four years and formulate global policy recommendations. It presents an opportunity for developed and developing countries to jointly take bold actions to reduce inequality and vulnerability and offer hope and direction to a world struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
UNCTAD15 will be held under the theme “From inequality and vulnerability to prosperity for all”, offering the nations of the world a platform to devise new ways to use trade as an enabler of sustainable development.
With economies all over the world ravaged by COVID-19, countries will explore how to build back better and strengthen their resilience. They will discuss the strategies and policies needed to resist shocks and quickly recover from crises – economic, financial, climate and social.
To supplement the global conference, the UN in Lesotho today hosted host a side panel event specific to Lesotho under the theme “Bridging the divide between formal and informal cross-border traders”.
The UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Representative, Betty Wahunoha remarked at the opening session “HOLD FOR QUOTE”
Lesotho depends heavily on trade with South Africa, which was intermittently disrupted due to border closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst both formal and informal traders have been affected, formal, mainly medium-sized, traders have generally been able to navigate border closures and to maintain their trade routes and supply chains. However, informal, and small-sized formal, traders have experienced much greater disruption.
Those that have been able to maintain some trade have had to navigate more restrictive informal border crossings, which offer less protection, and thus frequently increase their exposure to vulnerability, particularly in the case of female traders. As Lesotho recovers from COVID-19 and seeks to stabilize trade, there must be consideration as to how to recognize informal cross-border traders, to protect their safety and livelihoods, support their formalization and to ensure that nobody is left behind. This will further strengthen the national efforts towards accession to the African Continental Free Trade Agreement.
HOLD FOR QUOTE, Eriko Nihushumura, IOM head of Office
The panel discussion will focused on the biggest challenges facing informal cross-border traders, how to ensure their safety, increase their contribution to trade and economic development, the challenges and opportunities in their formalization and potential.

Title: Japan renews commitment to food and nutrition assistance in Lesotho
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 September 2021
MASERU- The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) today welcomed a JPY 200 million (US$ 1.8 Million) contribution by the Government of Japan to strengthen food assistance support to 50,000 pre-primary school children through the Government of Lesotho’s national school feeding programme.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity in the country as sources of livelihoods (casual labour, remittances, crop sales, petty trade, livestock sales or sale of livestock products) remain slightly lower than normal. It is estimated that some 312,000 Basotho will face acute food insecurity and require urgent humanitarian assistance, between October 2020 and March 2021. “The support from Japan has come at a critical time when WFP is appealing for more resources to respond to increasing humanitarian needs,” said Ms. Aurore Rusiga, WFP Lesotho Representative and Country Director. “The timely contribution will reach the most vulnerable Basotho children in the form of a hot and nutritious meal, allowing them to remain in school and as such to reach their full potential.”
Results from the latest Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) Food Insecurity Analysis of August 2021 predict that currently (September 2021) about 179,000 people are facing high acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) and require humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihood and prevent acute malnutrition. Japan has been one of the most consistent donors to WFP Lesotho having donated over JPY 1 billion (US$10 million) since 2014. The online ceremony was attended virtually by the Ambassador of the Embassy of Japan in Pretoria, His Excellency Mr. Norio Maruyama and WFP southern Africa Regional Director, Mr. Menghestab Haile.
“The donation will help meet the heightened need for food assistance during this unprecedented time. Together we can work towards reducing the country’s development challenges, and strengthening our bilateral relations through humanitarian assistance,” said His Excellency Ambassador Norio Maruyama “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Government of Japan for this direct investment in the future of our country through the national school feeding programme,” said Mamookho Phiri, Honourable Minister of Education and Training. “This invaluable donation will complement the maize meal and highly fortified nutritious porridge that the children are currently enjoying and make a tangible difference to the lives of Basotho children across the nation.”
The contribution supports the National School Feeding Programme, which aims to ensure that vulnerable pre-primary school children in Lesotho have access to adequate, safe and nutritious food all year round.
The Government of Japan has been contributing towards humanitarian food assistance in developing countries since 1968 and is a long-standing partner of WFP in Lesotho.

Title: United States Government donates 302 400 doses of COVID-19 Vaccine to Lesotho
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
23 July 2021
Statement by UNICEF Lesotho and the US Embassy in Maseru on the arrival of Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
Today, Lesotho receives 302 400 doses of Johnson&Johnson COVID19 vaccines donated by the United States Government. The donation comes following close collaboration between the COVAX facility, the African Union (AU)/ African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT), and the United States Government. "Over the last year, the United States has continued its global leadership in public health and the international COVID-19 response. We have moved swiftly to help the Kingdom of Lesotho control the spread of COVID-19, and we will continue to support the vaccine rollout with trusted implementing partners and the Ministry of Health," said Ambassador Gonzales of the US Embassy in Lesotho.
"We are pleased to see partners, such as the US Government, working together to ensure the equitable access and timely delivery of vaccines in Africa”. said Kimanzi Muthingi, Deputy Representative UNICEF Lesotho. “Every vaccines arrival to Lesotho is a significant moment. UNICEF remains committed to partner with the Government of Lesotho so that all who are eligible have access to COVID-19 vaccines as they become available." This is the third delivery of many that will be allocated to Lesotho in the coming months.
The COVAX Facility is working to accelerate the development of and access to COVID-19 vaccines. Today’s delivery of vaccines contributes to the AVAT goal of achieving 60% coverage across the African continent by 2022 As the vaccine is rolled out, all Basotho are encouraged to continue wearing a mask, washing their hands regularly, avoiding crowded places, and practicing social distancing.
What is COVAX?
COVAX is co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), working in partnership with UNICEF and the World Bank, civil society organizations, manufacturers, and others. In addition, COVAX is part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
COVAX has built a diverse portfolio of vaccines suitable for a range of settings and populations and is on track to meet its goal of delivering at least 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to participating countries around the globe by the end of 2021. This includes at least $ 1.3 billion in donor-funded doses to the 92 lower-income COVAX Facility participants supported by the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). For several months, COVAX partners have been supporting governments and partners to prepare for this moment.
They have been especially active in working with some of the world's poorest countries: those that will benefit from the AMC, an innovative financial mechanism to help secure global and equitable access for COVID-19 vaccines. This entails assisting with the development of national vaccination plans, support for cold chain infrastructure, as well as stockpiling of half a billion syringes and safety boxes for their disposal, masks, gloves, and other equipment to ensure that there is enough equipment for health workers to start vaccinating priority groups as soon as possible.

Title: Starting their New Life - 60 vulnerable returnees and youth graduate from St. Mary Mazzarello
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 May 2021
IOM has been implementing regional projects funded by the UK-Aid titled ‘’Humanitarian response to vulnerable and stranded migrants in Southern Africa region’’ as part of the COVID-19 response. The countries which are implementing are South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi and Lesotho. IOM Lesotho has been working closely with Ministry of Social Development (MoSD), DISCOSEC (District COVID-19 Secretariat) and the District Disaster Management Team (DDMT) to identify vulnerable returnees and their family members, as well as other extremely vulnerable youth in Mohales Hoek, Quthing and Qacha’s Nek districts and provide skills training to restore their livelihoods.

Among the 180 beneficiaries who received skills training through the project, 60 of them have already graduated from the College of Cooperative Entrepreneurship and Business Studies (CCBES) in February and March 2021 and started their own business in their respective districts. On 1 May 2021, another 60 beneficiaries graduated from St. Mary Mazzarello Vocational Training Centre (VTC). 17 beneficiaries learned catering and decoration, 13 beneficiaries learned computer, 13 learned sewing/fashion design, and 17 learned hairdressing. The Graduates are from Qacha’s Nek (17 persons), Quthing (18 person), Mohales Hoek (21 persons) and Mafeteng (4 persons) districts.
In her remarks, The Principal of the St. Mary Mazzarello, Sister Cecillia Motanya stated, ‘’St. Mary Mazzarello VTC was established in early 1990’s when women had no access to secondary education and women’s rights were not recognized in the society. Our objective is to empower women through skills training and transform them to be women of honor, women who can stand for their rights and bring positive changes to their community.’’ She further stated; ‘’We are happy for our partnership with IOM in this project as the empowerment of young women and men is what we believe is our mission’’.
In her remarks, Head of Office IOM Lesotho, Ms. Eriko Nishimura acknowledged the students’ commitment and tireless efforts to gain new skills at St. Mary Mazzarello VTC and congratulated on their successful completion of their skills training. She remarked, ‘’Money can be consumed even today and it will be gone. Skills you have gained will not disappear and it will remain with you forever. Skills training have transformed you completely. When you came here, you were vulnerable youth, but now, you are a confident and empowered youth who can bring positive changes to your community where you are coming from’’.
Speaking on behalf of the Ministry of Education, TVET, Mr. Thabang Mokotjo said; ‘’Leadership is influence. When you go back to your community, you are young community leaders as you now have a skill. So you can influence your community and market your products’’. He also said; ‘’Hairdressing and manicure is one of the skills in demand. I am happy that St. Mazarello VTC is among the first VTCs to offer this training’’. Lastly, he commented that the Ministry of Education is always ready to support the growth of VTCs, reduce the skills mismatch between the VTC and industrial needs, and once again congratulated students and St. Mary Mazarello VTC on the successful completion of the skills training.
Speaking on behalf of the entire beneficiaries, Ms. Mammopa Masiloane, Student representative, thanked UK Aid and the Government of Japan for availing the skills training opportunity. She stated; “What we have learned here in the past three months will not go to waste. We have become leaders in our own right and we shall demonstrate this in our communities to empower other young people. Our dreams have become a reality because of this opportunity and we are forever indebted to UK Aid and the Government of Japan for their support.’’
The skills training was funded by a generous support from UK Aid and the Government of Japan.

Title: Lesotho receives its first shipment of the COVID-19 Vaccine
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 March 2021
After a year of disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 10,000 Basotho infected with the virus, almost 300 lives lost, and hundreds of thousands of Basotho families affected in countless ways, the path to recovery for Lesotho can now begin with the arrival of a vaccine for COVID-19.
The deliveries mark the beginning of what will be the largest, most complex global roll-out of vaccines in history. The COVAX Facility plans to deliver at least 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of this year. This is an unprecedented global effort to make sure all citizens have access to vaccines.
“This is a momentous occasion,” said Dr. Richard Banda, WHO Representative for Lesotho. “COVID-19 has taken a toll on countries around the world and Lesotho is no exception. We know this is the first step and we congratulate the Government of Lesotho, especially the Ministry of Health for its tireless efforts to protect Basotho and contain the spread of the virus.
Lesotho will today receive 36, 000 vaccines as part of an initial tranche of deliveries of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine licensed to the Serum Institute of India, which represents part of the first wave of COVID-19 vaccines headed to several low and middle-income countries.
“We know the only way out of this crisis is to ensure that vaccinations are available for all,” Anurita Bains, UNICEF Representative for Lesotho and acting UN Resident Coordinator. “It’s a historic day for the country and as the UN we stand ready to support the successful roll-out of the vaccine programme.”
The shipment today is the first tranche of many that will be allocated to Lesotho in the coming months and year through the COVAX Facility, which is working to accelerate the development of and access to COVID-19 vaccines. The facility is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) working in partnership with UNICEF as well as the World Bank, manufacturers, civil society organizations, and others.
We also acknowledge the immense contributions to the COVAX Facility from key partners who are also supporting the Kingdom of Lesotho, including:
The US Government recently contributed $2 billion to the COVAX facility. As the largest donor to COVAX, the US government is committed to supporting the international COVID-19 response, which is critical to ending this pandemic. “Over the last year, the United States government has moved swiftly to support the local response to control the spread of COVID-19,” said US Ambassador Rebecca Gonzales. “We will continue to support the vaccine rollout with trusted implementing partners and the Ministry of Health.”
The European Union has made €1 billion contribution to the COVAX Facility. The EU and its Member States have been one of the lead contributors to COVAX with over €2.2 billion. Through these contributions, the European Union and its partners have secured purchase options for COVID-19 vaccines for all the participants in the COVAX Facility. “The EU is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it,” said EU Ambassador to Lesotho Christian Manahl. “Because we will only be safe if the whole world is safe. We are in a race against the virus and COVAX is our best hope that all our partners, in Africa and elsewhere, have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.”
The UK Government is proud to be one of the biggest donors to COVAX, helping to secure over one billion doses for vulnerable populations around the world. The UK has contributed £548 million (or over $765-million) to the COVAX facility. “The UK is delighted to see vaccines arriving “on the ground” in Lesotho, said British High Commissioner to Lesotho, Anne Macro. “This is a testament to the hard work of the Lesotho Government, Ministry of Health, and its partners in the UN and NGO sector in undertaking all the necessary advance preparation.”
What is COVAX?
COVAX is co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), working in partnership with UNICEF as well as the World Bank, civil society organizations, manufacturers, and others. COVAX is part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
COVAX has built a diverse portfolio of vaccines suitable for a range of settings and populations, and is on track to meet its goal of delivering at least 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to participating countries around the globe by the end of 2021, including at least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses to the 92 lower-income COVAX Facility participants supported by the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).
For several months, COVAX partners have been supporting governments and partners in readiness efforts, in preparation for this moment. They have been especially active in working with some of the world’s poorest countries: those that will benefit from the Advance Market Commitment (AMC), an innovative financial mechanism to help secure global and equitable access for COVID-19 vaccines. This includes assisting with the development of national vaccination plans, support for cold chain infrastructure, as well as stockpiling of half a billion syringes and safety boxes for their disposal, masks, gloves and other equipment to ensure that there is enough equipment for health workers to start vaccinating priority groups as soon as possible.

Title: Transforming Lives: 15 returnees and vulnerable youth start a new life chapter
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
22 February 2021
IOM has been implementing a Regional Projects funded by UK-Aid titled ‘’Humanitarian response to vulnerable and stranded migrants in Southern Africa region’’ as part of the COVID-19 response. The countries which are implementing are South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi and Lesotho. IOM Lesotho has been working closely with the of Ministry of Social Development (MoSD), DISCOSEC (District COVID-19 Secretariat) and District Disaster Management Team (DDMT) to identify vulnerable returnees and their family members, as well as other vulnerable youth in Mohales Hoek, Quthing and Qacha’s Nek districts to provide skills training in an effort to restore their livelihoods.

On February 22 2021, 15 youth from Qacha’s Nek District have graduated from the skills training at College Cooperative formulation and Entrepreneurship Business Services (CCEBS) in Mafeteng district. They have acquired skills to manufacture hand sanitizers, body lotion, petroleum jelly, dried soup, beverage, dish washer and other items. The product is organic and made of the locally available materials such as rose hip and aloe vera.
In his remarks, Director of CCEBS, Mr. Ramoorosi, explained about the importance of becoming ‘’producer and become entrepreneurs (create job themselves)’’ rather than “waiting for somebody to employ them.’’ The Director encouraged the students to be creative and bold as they became entrepreneurs.
Head of Office IOM Lesotho, Ms Eriko Nishimura stated that one of IOM's key mandates is to ensure vulnerable migrants could be exposed to life changing opportunities and expressed her sincere appreciation to the UK Aid as donor and CCEBS as a committed partner.
On Behalf of the United Kingdom High Commission in Lesotho, Ms. Lineo Tsikoane thanked IOM for the efforts to improve the lives of Basotho. When talking to the students, she said; “we hope you will be exemplary and that this training has truly improved your lives” she quoted a famous proverb which says “give a man fish, you will feed him for a day, teach a man how to fish and you will feed him for a lifetime.”
A student representative thanked IOM for the support which she said has truly impacted on their lives. She said that they considered this training to be an honor and a great privilege. She reflected on how some of them had previously crossed the border to South Africa often through unofficial channels in search of work. She said that this effort had brought them together and that because their group is from Qachas Nek, they were intent on forming a society that would help them market and sell their products.

Title: Japan provides support on Reintegration of Returnees and other vulnerable members in migration affected areas in Lesotho
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 February 2021

MASERU - IOM has been advocating for the adoption of sustainability-oriented reintegration policies that respond to the economic, social and psychosocial needs of returning migrants while also benefiting communities of origin and addressing structural challenges to reintegration.
With the aim to support sustainable reintegration of returnees who continue to come back to Lesotho affected by COVID-19, as well as host communities in migration affected areas, the Government of Japan will provide support to the project called ‘’Socio-Economic Reintegration of Returnees and other vulnerable members in migration affected areas severely impacted by COVID-19 pandemic.’’ The project will be implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), UN Migration Agency, for 12 months from March 2021.
In this project, IOM intends to apply part of the reintegration assistance modality which proved to be effective and productive based on the global IOM Reintegration project which will be modified and tailored to the Lesotho context and the urgent needs of returnees pressured by continuous challenges of COVID-19. The project has three outcomes.
Outcome 1: GoL has improved its ability to successfully implement reintegration programmes;
Outcome 2: Vulnerable Basotho returnees impacted by COVID-19 have enhanced their livelihoods through restoring their dignity, income generating opportunities and enhanced their living conditions in the district of origin; and
Outcome 3: GoL (Local Government) has improved its ability to enhance social unity / cohesion through community development initiative.
These activities are designed to improve beneficiaries’ livelihoods through maximizing income-generating opportunities and enhancing their living conditions while addressing the returnees’ immediate needs to restore their livelihoods and ensure their safety from being infected/affected by COVID-19. This project will be implemented in close collaboration with the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG), Ministry of Social Development (MoSD), Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE), Disaster Management Authority (DMA), among others.
“IOM is committed to bring changes to the lives of people in Lesotho – in particularly returnees and other vulnerable people affected by COVID-19. We also implement community development activities in migration affected area which can economically support returnees and host communities while facilitate social cohesion.’’ said Ms. Eriko Nishimura, Head of Office of IOM Lesotho.

Title: The Government of Lesotho joins forces with the United Nations to address    Malnutrition
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 November 2020
The Government of Lesotho and the UN in Lesotho officially launched a Maximum Intervention Programme (MIP), supported by the global Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger (REACH) initiative. This Programme is aimed at enhancing food and nutrition security in Lesotho especially during this COVID-19 pandemic that has negatively affected food and nutrition security.
In the wake of the prevailing COVID-19 global pandemic,  the Food and Nutrition Coordinating Office (FNCO) in collaboration with development partners and guided by the National Food and Nutrition Strategy and Costed Action Plan initiated the food and nutrition Maximum Intervention Programme(MIP) through the Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger (REACH).  REACH is an inter-agency partnership of FAO, WHO, UNICEF, WFP and IFAD under the UN Network for Nutrition that promotes country-owned and country-led, multi-sectoral approach to addressing malnutrition.
The Maximum Intervention Programme was officially launched in Quthing, Qomo-qomong and Ha Ramosoeu villages where targeted people were reached with educational materials on vegetable production, promotion of dietary diversity and child feeding. This support has also mainstreamed COVID19 awareness on hygiene and other preventive measures.
The nutrition situation in Lesotho remains of a great concern. Studies show that stunting rates remain high at 33.2% among children under 5 years of age, micronutrient deficiencies are rife among children aged 6 to 59 months, particularly iron deficiency or anaemia and over 27% of girls and women and 14 % of boys and men in the 15-49 age range are also anaemic. Lesotho is striving to harness the potential of all key players in food and nutrition to synergize efforts that address all forms of malnutrition for all people by 2030. The programme will be implemented in the four districts of Mokhotlong, Botha-Bothe, Thaba-Tseka and Quthing which have high rates of stunting. The programme is aimed at diversifying diets in hard-to-reach areas and among the most vulnerable populations by introducing community-based promotion on productivity of nutritious foods.
United Nations (UN) recognizes that nutrition is central to the sustainable development agenda and that there is need for both horizontal and vertical coherence in implementation of the programmes.
Speaking at the launch ceremony on behalf of UN agencies, the UN Resident Coordinator, Mr. Salvator Niyonzima, highlighted that: “Malnutrition is crippling the health of our children in Lesotho, often times even leading to death, and this needs to come to an end. It is still a problem which can be solved and a preventable one if we continue to combine efforts together in order to achieve a sustainable reduction of malnutrition in Lesotho.”
Notable initiatives have been undertaken by the leadership of Lesotho to raise the profile of nutrition and the national policy on food and nutrition was endorsed by the Government in 2016. Furthermore, Lesotho is fully supported by the Royal Family with His Majesty as the African Union Champion on Nutrition and globally, as the Food and Agricultural Organisation’s Special Ambassador on Nutrition and the World Bank’s Human Capital Ambassador.

Title: WFP and China support government efforts in strengthening food security in Lesotho
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
13 November 2020
Maseru – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomed a contribution from the People’s Republic of China that has helped WFP reach 36,000 vulnerable people with food and nutrition assistance.
“Through our partnership with WFP, China supports efforts by the Government of Lesotho to provide adequate food and nutrition to vulnerable Basotho across the country, ensuring they remain healthy and meet their basic food needs” said the Economic and Commercial Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy, Ma Guoliang.
With Chinese support, WFP has already procured and delivered highly nutritious food to some 18,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women in the districts of Mafeteng, Mohale’s Hoek, Quthing and Qacha’s Nek, improving the nutritional health of mothers and children.
Additionally, 366 MT of food has been procured for 18,000 children attending pre-primary schools in the districts of Maseru, Mohale’s Hoek, Mokhotlong, Qacha’s Nek and Quthing.
In Lesotho, four in 10 people across the country are experiencing acute food insecurity. Food production has continued to decline for the third consecutive year, whilst food prices have increased due to COVID-19 lockdown measures.
“The support from China is an invaluable investment in the next generation and the country’s overall development,” said Aurore Rusiga, WFP Country Director and Representative in Lesotho. “The contribution came at a critical time when WFP was scaling up to respond to increasing needs in the country.”
China has provided continual and concrete support to WFP’s humanitarian operations in various countries and regions in recent years, contributing significantly to WFP’s mission of saving and changing lives.
The United Nations World Food Programme is the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate.  We are the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

Title: European Union supports WFP’s cash assistance to people affected by drought and COVID-19 in Lesotho
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
19 October 2020
MASERU – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomes the European Union’s (EU) contribution of €2.8 million (M55.5 million) to provide much needed relief assistance to the most vulnerable people in Lesotho affected by three consecutive years of drought and the socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The contribution is part of a larger EU grant of €4.4 million (M87.3 million) to support joint emergency response interventions led by WFP in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the International Organisation of Migration (IOM). WFP will assist 34,000 severely food insecure people living in urban areas of the five worst affected districts by expanding the government’s Public Assistance Programme. Each household will receive €47 (M831) per month via MPESA, a mobile money platform. This cash assistance will give them a choice to purchase what they need most at local markets.
“We thank the EU for their continuous support to the emergency response operations WFP is rolling out across the country to complement the government’s COVID-19 Food Security Response Plan,” said Aurore Rusiga, WFP’s Country Director in Lesotho. “WFP’s operations in Lesotho are only 23 percent funded and require an additional €18.5 million to assist communities affected by emergency levels of food insecurity and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The EU’s funding comes at a crucial time when over 40 percent of the population across the country is experiencing acute food insecurity. Food production has continued to decline for the third consecutive year whilst food prices have increased due to COVID-19 lockdown measures.
Border closures have severely reduced remittances and many migrant workers are returning to Lesotho after losing their jobs. Moreover, the Government of Lesotho’s COVID-19 Food Security Response Plan has estimated a resource gap of €32.7 million (M643 million) that hinders an adequate response to the emergency faced by the country.
“We decided with our partners from the Lesotho Government and UN agencies that we should focus on alleviating the socio-economic hardships experienced by Basotho citizens due to the pandemic as well as the necessary lockdown” said Christian Manahl, EU Ambassador to Lesotho. “We are aware that people in urban and peri-urban areas who lost their jobs or businesses have been particularly hard hit, and we want to contribute to mitigating their suffering as a consequence of the pandemic."
The impact of COVID-19 on livelihoods and access to food has required WFP to expand into urban areas of Lesotho, which were historically more food secure. Thanks to donors like the EU, WFP is able, for the first time, to support vulnerable communities in these areas.
WFP will continue to assist nearly 80,000 people across the country with monthly cash and food assistance to ensure they have access to nutritious and healthy food.

Title: Japan to provide food assistance to 154,000 school children in Lesotho
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 September 2020
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomes the Japanese Government contribution of JPY 250 Million (equivalent to about US$ 2.3 Million) that will enable WFP to strengthen food assistance to some 94,000 primary school and 60,000 pre-primary school learners, through the Government of Lesotho’s national school feeding programme.
An online ceremony was held today at the United Nations House to mark the contribution which will be used to buy canned fish, maize meal and highly fortified foods to further diversify nutritious meals offered in primary schools and Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) centres across the country. The ceremony was officiated by the Lesotho Minister of Education and Training, Honourable Ntlhoi Motsamai.
Lesotho is in the third consecutive year of poor crop production due to drought. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity in the country as restriction on movement has affected informal traders and smallholder farmers access to markets. It is estimated that some 582,000 Basotho will face acute food insecurity and require urgent humanitarian assistance, between October 2020 and March 2021.
“This support came at a critical time when WFP is appealing for more resources to respond to increasing needs. It will help the most vulnerable, Basotho children, some of whom, the only nutritious meals they receive are provided through the national school feeding programme,” said WFP Lesotho Acting Country Representative, Hsunhee Marian Yun.
Japan has been one of the most consistent donors to WFP Lesotho having donated over JPY 1 billion (some USD $10 million) since 2014. The online ceremony was attended virtually by the Ambassador of the Embassy of Japan in Pretoria, His Excellency Mr. Norio Maruyama and WFP Southern Africa Regional Director, Ms. Lola Castro.
“We hope this donation will contribute to the reduction of food insecurity in Lesotho countries. Together we can work towards reducing the Lesotho’s development challenges, and strengthening our bilateral relations through humanitarian assistance ” said His Excellency Ambassador Norio Maruyama.

Title: UN and the World Bank present essential personal protective equipment to the Lesotho Government in support of the fight against COVID-19
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 August 2020
The United Nations (UN) in Lesotho today handed over a shipment of personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 diagnostics and patient management equipment to the Government of Lesotho through the Minister of Health, Honorable Motlatsi Maqelepo and the National COVID-19 Secretariat CEO, Mr. Thabo Khasipe, at the Ministry of health headquarters in Maseru.
The consignment includes the following:
Despite the impact of COVID-19 on global supply chains, the UN, with logistical support from World Food Programme, through humanitarian flights, has been able to procure and deliver these essential commodities to support the Government response to COVID-19. The supplies will be critical for healthcare workers on the frontlines supporting Basotho who need critical care.
Upon handing over the equipment, the UN Resident Coordinator in Lesotho, Mr. Salvator Niyonzima, expressed solidarity and support on behalf of the UN family and said, “no one ministry or agency or donor can fight COVID-19 alone. These essential items will help equip healthcare workers and communities to protect themselves while caring for those affected by COVID-19...The UN stands ready to support the Government in its efforts to defeat the epidemic, including supporting additional procurement through the Global COVID-19 Supply Portal allowing the country to continue to procure essential supplies”.
The World Bank Country Representative, Mr. Yoichiro Ishihara highlighted that the World Bank has joined hands with other development partners to assist Lesotho to respond effectively to COVID-19 to save the lives of the Basotho people.  “In addition to financing the procurement of PPE, the World Bank has been implementing US$7.5 million Lesotho COVID-19 Emergency Preparedness and Response Project to prevent, detect and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19 and strengthen national systems for public health preparedness. We remain committed to helping the Government of Lesotho in its efforts to curbing the damage that can be caused by the spread of COVID-19. We appeal to all the people of Lesotho to heed guidance provided by the Government to keep safe from this pandemic”.
The Minister of Health, Hon. Motlatsi Maqelepo, thanked the UN and the World Bank for their ongoing support and noted that the cooperation between the Government and development partners in procuring the equipment has been exemplary. “On behalf of the Government of Lesotho and the Ministry of Health, and the Government of Lesotho, I would like to thank all partners involved in getting this essential equipment here today. COVID-19 requires all actors to work together in order to tackle all the challenges this pandemic presents. Today’s ceremony is a demonstration of that much needed cooperation, which I hope will continue into the future. Our biggest challenge is in building a resilient health system that is able to withstand shocks such as COVID-19. I call on all partners to work with the Government and my Ministry in building such a system”, he said.
Further, National COVID-19 Secretariat CEO, Mr. Thabo Khasipe, explained that this equipment comes at a crucial time when the country is faced with a shortage of PPE, increasing the number of Basotho testing positive for COVID-19, and a rising the death rate.
Since Lesotho recorded its COVID-19 first case in May 2020, the country has, to date, registered 1,015 cases with 472 recoveries and 30 deaths. “This donation will go a long way in ensuring that our front-line workers, whom we all depend, work under the safe conditions, as they continue to step directly into COVID-19’s path to support the afflicted and help curb the spread of the virus.”.
To avoid the risk of transmission, the WHO recommends that people should wash their hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub, cover their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.
People are also encouraged to wear masks and  maintain a one meter distance between themselves and others, avoid crowded places, stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until recovered, avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or a cough, seek medical attention if one has a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources such as WHO and national health authorities.

Title: European Union boosts assistance to drought-affected people in Lesotho
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
19 February 2020
MASERU – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomes the European Union (EU) contribution of €1.5 million (equivalent to about M24 million) in humanitarian support, enabling WFP to expand ongoing emergency drought assistance to an additional 22,100 people on top of the 77,880 people that are already receiving assistance.
“The situation in Lesotho is very worrying. Climate change has been the driving force behind recurrent droughts that have pushed more than half a million people into a major food security crisis,” said UN Resident Coordinator Salvator Niyonzima. “It is imperative that comprehensive action is taken now to address the negative effects of climate change and ensure that the most vulnerable people are not left behind,” he noted. 
The EU’s funding comes at a time when over 30 percent of the population across the country is experiencing crisis levels of food insecurity during the ongoing lean season as a result of drought. The production of maize, the staple food, declined by a whopping 78 percent in 2019 compared to the previous year. Rural communities have been worst affected, with the vast majority of the country’s more than 500,000 food insecure people living in rural areas.
“We are happy to assist the government and UN agencies in addressing the immediate emergency, but we also contribute to overcoming recurrent food insecurity through long-term resilience building", said Christian Manahl, the European Union Ambassador to Lesotho. 
Last year, a national drought emergency was declared, and a flash appeal was made to support of the Government-led Drought Response and Resilience Plan. The flash appeal requires € 74 million (M 1.2 billion) to target 261,000 people in 10 districts between November 2019 and April 2020.
Thanks to donors like the EU, WFP is reaching 100,000 people every month with a combination cash and food assistance. This assistance ensures that people have access to nutritious, healthy food, while also giving them the choice to buy what they need most at local markets. 
“We urge the international community to respond to the government’s appeal for humanitarian assistance to ensure that the most vulnerable people in the country receive life-saving assistance,” said Mary Njoroge, WFP’s Country Director in Lesotho. “We are only 33 percent funded and urgently require an additional € 10 million to assist communities affected by emergency levels of food insecurity,” she added.
The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies, building prosperity and supporting a sustainable future for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

Based on the two previous projects funded by Government of Japan, namely, ‘’Building Sustainable Peace and Promoting Human Security of Cross-border Communities and Mobile Populations through Integrated Border Security and Management and Community-based Counter Trafficking Initiative (2018)’’ and ’’Counter Trafficking and Addressing Irregular Migration through Strengthening Border and Migration and Border Management, Sensitization on TIP and Building Capacity of Law enforcement and Border Officials in Lesotho (2019),’’ the Government of Japan has become a leading donor in Lesotho to support the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho (GoL) in strengthening border and migration management and counter trafficking / smuggling. Despite the tangible results achieved through these two projects, Lesotho continues to face diverse and complex challenges in the protection of Victims of Trafficking (VoT) as well as in tackling the issues of trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants.
The new project aims to achieve three results, namely, to rehabilitate the new Crisis Shelter for female Victims of Trafficking (VoT). In addition, IOM will also purchase a mobile house with several rooms which will be used as rooms for psychosocial counselling, skills training for the beneficiaries and administrative office for Beautiful Dream Society (BDS) which operates the crisis shelter for female VoTs under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA); to enhance the capacity of identification and investigation of the trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants, through the establishment of an immigration inspection unit and strengthened immigration intelligence. This will be made possible through developing risk analysis / profiles, undertake threat analysis, conducting study tour to IOM’s African Capacity Building Centre (ACBC) in Moshi, Tanzania, as well as intensive training to the immigration official towards establishing immigration inspection unit led by immigration intelligence and its effective operations; and to improve the livelihoods of vulnerable returnees and VoTs, through restoring their self-esteem, income generating opportunities and enhance their living conditions in the district of origin. Through study tour to IOM mission with Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) programme in South Africa, and conduct national level workshop to discuss the coordination, process of screening, registration and provide humanitarian support to vulnerable returnees, the project intends to start the national level discussions on how best Lesotho can support vulnerable returnees known as ‘’deportees’'.
‘’Based on the partnership built through the two previous projects, IOM will implement the project with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) as a key counterpart, but also cooperate with other relevant Ministries and institutes, Cross Border Crime Prevention Forum between South Africa and Lesotho, Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) active in counter trafficking activities, District Authorities as well as Basotho diaspora members, church leaders and village leaders. In order to fight against human trafficking, we need to collaborate with everybody who shares with us the common goal. Our shared goal is to realize Lesotho free from this inhuman crime – human trafficking’’ said Ms. Eriko Nishimura, Head of Office of IOM Lesotho.

13 November 2019
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) held a handover ceremony at Moshoeshoe I International Airport that marked some of the key milestones of the project related to border management and counter trafficking / smuggling.
IOM handed over various items – (a) document examination equipment; (b) boom gate (Maputsoe, Caledon Spoots); (c) CCTV (Moshoeshoe I International Airport); and (d) two vehicles for immigration department.
These items are expected to contribute to increasing the capacity of Immigration department of Ministry of Home Affairs to deliver immigration services and fulfil its mandates, to strengthen border security and to address human trafficking / migrant smuggling at the key Ports of Entry. The handover of these items from IOM to MoHA was witnessed by the donor of this project, the Government of Japan, represented by the representatives from Embassy of Japan to the Kingdom of Lesotho.
In his remarks the Minister of Home Affairs, Hon. Mokhele Moletsane (MP) reminded participants of the 2010 UN General Assembly Global Plan of Action to combat Trafficking in Persons and further said that there was “a need to be better coordinated and consistent in fighting Trafficking in Persons. We need to integrate the fight against Trafficking in broader programs to boost development and to strengthen security.”
On behalf of the Embassy of Japan, Mr. Shuichiro Kawaguchi, Minister Counsellor, said that ‘’proper border management and enhancement of border security are critically important for Lesotho for further development, as building a safe and stable nation will attract more foreign investments’’.
On the installation of CCTV to enhance border security, Mrs. Mapeete Jonathan,  Immigration Manager at Moshoeshoe One Airport said that “The CCTV camera would prove to be highly useful to prevent criminal activity that happens at the airport and this equipment will help us learn more about things that happen at the airport that we do not always see’’.
In addition to the enhancement of border security and migration management, the project also contributes to the protection and rehabilitation of the vulnerable female Victims of Trafficking in persons (VoT). The check of 168,000 Maloti was handed over from IOM to the Ministry of Home Affairs in order to support the Crisis Shelter for the Victims of Trafficking run by a NGO called Beautiful Dream Society (BDS) Lesotho. In addition, a short video of human trafficking produced by Skillshare Lesotho which is used for sensitizing youth was displayed at this occasion.
Beautiful Dream Society, an NGO that is working with the Ministry of Home Affairs on providing shelter to Victioms of Trafficking thanked the government of Japan for “This noble gesture to partner with us in the war against Human Trafficking, in 2019 so far we have served 14 clients of which 11 of them have been reintegrated with the community and we still assist them through our non-residential program.” Mr. Molikoe Lali, President of BDS.
One of the participants attending the handover ceremony who also watched the Video Documentary, Ms. Palesa Masite, said that “We are deeply encouraged to see that Government is doing something on trafficking in persons. We are losing our brothers and sisters to this scourge. I still think that the Ministry of Home Affairs and its partners including IOM, sensitize communities all over the country. I believe some people do not know about this problem.”
In her remarks, IOM Head of Office, Ms. Eriko Nishimura, thanked the Ministry of Home Affairs for the good collaboration on this Project and indicated that while strides have been made, “There are still a lot to do in order to bring border and migration management up to international standards, and fight against human trafficking in the Kingdom of Lesotho. I would like to assure you that IOM is firmly committed to working with the Government of Lesotho and in supporting strengthening migration governance in Lesotho. If we manage migration well, we can gain developmental impact from migration’’.

Press Release: UN, Government join forces to boost Lesotho's drought response
7th May 2019 - Maseru. According to the findings of the June 2018 Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis (VAA) and Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) conducted by the Lesotho Vulnerability Assessment Committee (LVAC) in June 2018, the number of people in need of assistance slightly increased compared to 2017 and it was projected to be 308,966 during the lean season (October 2018-February 2019) and respectively 18% of the rural population (257,283 people) and 9.2% of the urban population (51,683 people). Moreover, in the projected period September 2018-February 2019, Mohale’s Hoek, Qacha’s Nek and Quthing districts were classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or higher while the other districts were projected in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed).

Due to the reportedly deteriorating humanitarian situation, the Disaster Management Authority (DMA), LVAC and partners launched a countrywide rapid assessment on 1 March 2019, to better evaluate the current humanitarian needs in different key sectors, including Agriculture and Food Security, Health and Nutrition, WASH, Protection (including GBV, Migration and Child Protection), HIV/AIDS, etc.
Based on the Rapid Assessment results presented on 1st April 2019 - 407 191(28%) rural population in need of Humanitarian assistance.  An increase from 273 635 (19%) from IPC update results (Nov 2018) and 257 283 (18%) from May 2018 VAA results. 80 666 (15%) urban population in need of Humanitarian Assistance.

Food security is anticipated to deteriorate further for the next consumption beyond June 2019 (July 2019 to June 2020) and food insecure populations to increase.
The findings of the Rapid Assessment have revealed that current food insecurity situation is deteriorating compared to VAA results (May 2018) marked by: • Increasing number of food insecure population for the period March to May 2019. • Compromised food consumption reflected through high proportion of households with poor food consumption scores, low dietary diversity, households experiencing moderate to severe hunger, adopting stress, crisis and emergency coping strategies with the aim to fill existing food gaps • The above Indicative of the negative impact of drought experienced since the start of the current agricultural season. • The results further indicate that water situation is currently not normal as indicated by increasing number of households getting drinking water from unprotected sources. • Migration rate to RSA increasing with those who migrated reported that they were responding to existing lack of food and water.  • Some household reported child marriage, Child labour, sexual offence and GBV as result of drought impact in the affected households.

Title: World Contraception Day will be marked globally today
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
26 September 2018
World Contraception Day centers around a vision where every pregnancy is wanted and the aim is to help each new generation of adults make informed decisions until every pregnancy in the world is a planned one.
The day, which was launched in 2007, and has been marked globally every year on 26th September, is meant to improve awareness of contraception and to enable young people to make informed choices on their sexual and reproductive health.
It centers around a vision where every pregnancy is wanted and the aim is to help each new generation of adults make informed decisions until every pregnancy in the world is a planned one.
This resonates well with UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund’s vision of delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.
This is also more relevant to Lesotho as the country is currently faced with a challenge of high cases of unsafe abortion as witnessed by high patient load at the referral hospital - Queen ‘Mamohato Memorial Hospital (QMMH) of complications of abortion.
The country is also in the process of producing maternal death report which shows that some causes of maternal deaths are due to complications of unsafe abortion.
It is of paramount importance that every woman must be free to decide when to start child bearing and when to stop.  It is the right of every woman to have a choice on the number and spacing of their children.
In Lesotho, UNFPA supports procurement of family planning commodities for and on behalf of the Government of Lesotho in an effort to ensure commodity security.  UNFPA also supports the Ministry of Health in the policy direction and creating enabling environment to increase access and uptake of family planning.

Title: Lesotho launches HIV and Health Situation Room to Fast-Track Progress towards ending AIDS and TB through the power of data
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
08 May 2018
Lesotho HIV and Health Situation Room centralizes health data for HIV, TB, and Maternal and Child Health and ensure more effective and precise programming and reach more people with services.
Maseru, 8 May 2018 - The Right Honourable Prime Minister of Lesotho Dr Thomas Thabane, in partnership with UNAIDS, represented by Mr Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS Executive Director and Under-Secretary General of the United Nations, has launched an innovative new tool to track progress and identify gaps in HIV, TB, and Maternal Health programming in Lesotho.
The HIV and Health Situation Room shows in real-time the service delivery data, producing a comprehensive picture and understanding of Lesotho’s epidemic. The Lesotho HIV and Health Situation Room enables quick feedback on results at the county and community levels and identifies any bottlenecks and access issues. It aims to speed up and streamline communications between policy-makers and implementers, to help Lesotho stay on track to reach its national health targets and to improve the lives of people across the country.
Latest data from the Lesotho HIV and Health Situation Room Situation Room shows that Lesotho is close to having 200,000 people on treatment. New HIV infections have fallen by 45% between 2000 and 2017. This has been possible due to Lesotho’s adoption of a peoplecentred approach in its response to ensure that no one is left behind, thus accelerating progress towards ending its AIDS epidemic.
Deaths of people living with HIV were reduced by 66% since the mid-2000s as access to antiretroviral treatment was scaled up. By end 2017, approximately 62% of adults living with HIV in Lesotho had access to lifesaving medicine and >70% of pregnant women living with HIV had access to medicine to prevent transmission of the virus to their child. This resulted in 60% decline in new HIV infections among children since 2000. The scale-up of antiretroviral treatment also reduced incidence of tuberculosis. At present about 72% of people living with HIV also suffer from tuberculosis.
The Lesotho Situation Room will enable programme staff to localize where efforts need to be intensified. This more accurate programming will help to ensure that adults and children living with HIV have regular access to care and treatment and that antiretroviral medicines are replenished quickly should stock-outs occur. 
The Government of Lesotho and UNAIDS have worked together to bring two different data sets into one tool: data from the District Health Information System (DHIS2) and Lesotho’s HIV Estimates.
The Lesotho HIV and Health Situation Room, developed by the Ministry of Health Lesotho in collaboration with UNAIDS, is supported by the Government of Sweden, which contributed resources as part of its continued support to improving monitoring and evaluation of the global AIDS epidemic.
